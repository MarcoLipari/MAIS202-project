I will give you a couple of tips, however. One common trick of cruiser players is to slow down and turn in (towards you) when you shoot them. To pre-empt this move, aim lower and lead less, so that they end up turning under your shells. For ships in full speed turns, hold more to the outside of the turn that you think you might need to.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; There's a great write-up over on /r/askphilosophy that goes over the problems of reddit's favourite agnostic/gnostic atheist construction, that people really ought to read.

That's a good read. I have eaten a few downvotes for resisting, if not outright rejecting, the notion that *atheism* is 'merely the lack of belief in any gods.' My position is that insofar as a person could in principle hold the view described by that [stipulative] definition, this is only possible in the special case that the person in question has not been exposed to the concept of deity.

That is, once exposed to a concept, we form a place-holder belief capturing our subjective credence, plausibility, etc., and that in the case of deity, this means we implicitly accept *theist* or *atheist* roughly according to the Dawkins scale referenced in the linked discussion. To wit, a person who had never been exposed to the concept of deity could not self-identify as a theist or an atheist, but once exposed, they *would* select one (perhaps on some scale).

To the extent that this pertains to OP's 'argument,' however, is a bit of an open question, methinks. Clearly, OP is trying to argue that all parties make 'positive' claims, and that therefore all parties are somehow on equal footing with respect to the burden of proof, but jist as clearly OP is flat out wrong.

We could dive into the rabbit hole of non-black non-ravens if we like, but the simple fact is that an existence claim (i.e. 'X exists') is a positive claim which bears the birden of proof, and a non-existence claim (i.e. 'X does not exist') transfers the burden of proof to those who oppose that claim. I can appropriately insist that my opponents provide a single counterexample to a universal claim, but I cannot refuse to provide an example of a particular claim.

Effectively, OP has simply failed to understand and correctly apply syllogistic logic.",1569888000

That's likely part of the problem, and letting them form internet echo chambers is good for neither them nor us.

&gt;these are real humans in pain who want to vent

There's vast gulf of difference between venting and what's going on in communities like this. If your venting is not socially tolerable, it's not venting.

&gt;or even some of the really awful sites that I won't even mention here

What makes you think they weren't already there?

&gt;What I do think might help the incel situation is more normie empathy

Everyone has plenty of empathy for people who are down on their luck romantically. Incels are *not* those people. Stating that we should empathize with the *violence* these people espouse is a dangerous proposition.

&gt;I also think more empathy and outreach to communities that face the same issues as the incelosphere, like ForeverAlone, would be helpful

Have you ever tried? I have. Got nothing but scorn and hatred in return. They don't want help, because that would be admitting that their issues originate from themselves rather than the world around them. 

&gt;Also jokes about male virgins, short men, jokes about man-children, basically all emasculating jokes that take jabs at men for their sexual status, income, or physical characteristics, should stop

Preaching to the choir.

&gt;Men already have it so tough

[Everyone's got it tough in one way or another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLGP0ftWQjU). Men are the least sympathetic in this regard. If you've got problems, talk to the people who care about them, but problems related to a man's gender are not likely to be well received by women and minorities.

&gt;They go into these communities because they don't feel understood

They'd be perfectly well understood if they could process and relay their grievances in a way that is rational and digestible to the rest of the world. Advocating rape, pedophilia, and misogyny will *never* qualify for that.

&gt;I'm not sure if this ban will inevitably be a good thing or a bad thing.

It will always be a good thing. The harder we make it for them to form these echo chambers, the more likely it is they'll have to reach out to the real world to get real, truly helpful feedback on their lives. The people in these echo chambers don't get that and further isolate themselves from it by validating each others' bullshit",1569888001

Tell me about Usertesting. I've never heard of it. If you're accepted to work on there, do they offer a lot of jobs? It says they pay $10 for a 20 minute video. Do you have to do video? I would never, ever do that. I don't even take pictures of myself. Talking I'll do.

Some snakes have scales more strongly keeled on their backs than on their sides, so location and extent of keeling of scales can also be diagnostic.

"YAwriters","t5_2vtil","For your comps, I would say specifically what elements - ""similar elements"" seem pretty vague. Also two of your comps are quite old (The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Miseducation of Cameron Post) so maybe pick something more recent? 

""Cameron Persaud is supposed to finish her last year of high school strong, with the 3 of her best friends since middle school, film major girlfriend‚Äôs Tamera and Lily, and Cameron‚Äôs longtime crush, theater major Elle, as they plan on leaving dry and boring Florida and heading to New York for the college of their dreams. ""

This is quite the sentence. I would maybe change it to something like: Cameron Persaud is supposed to finish her last year of high school strong, and she and her friends plan on leaving Florida behind and heading to New York for the college of their dreams.""

I think this could be reworked and it's a bit too vague: Her struggle eventually leads to her going down a self-destructive path with the school‚Äôs stoner that‚Äôs got a good heart, Elliot Lifton.   What does self-destructive path mean? Also can you maybe add more about why this school is Cameron's dream school? We know her friends majors, but we don't know her major and we should focus more on her. Is film or theatre her dream? Is that still her dream after she doesn't get in and meets Elliot?

I'd also maybe try to raise the stakes a little bit - something more than ""parties and romantic mischief"" because that doesn't seem like enough. Maybe Elliot introduces her to a different (better) path than she originally thought she wanted?

I think I would also suggest putting all your housekeeping business (comps, genre, word count) together either at the beginning or end.

"valve","t5_2qzqs","&gt; When we get full brain interfacing VR things will change, but current VR just isn't what most people want right now.

Yes, I know you've said this before. There isn't any real justification behind it though. It doesn't need to get to that point because people already really enjoy themselves today with VR but are often put off buying and constantly using a setup due to the inconveniences of it being 1st gen tech. The market is small and niche, because it's still in it's 1st generation so it's in a perfectly normal spot.

What it needs is to get to something as depicted in Ready Player One to be at that mainstream level, as it would then be very convenient and without almost all of it's current issues. That doesn't require a brain interface at all.

&gt;  I still prefer games to be in my screen. I don't care about interacting with them physically.

That's fine, except if you haven't experienced VR then you need to actually try it first, or if you have experienced VR you need to make sure you've actually tried the really, really good stuff like Astro Bot, Lone Echo / Echo VR, Beat Saber.

You should also be aware that VR has always been and always will be a mix of both physically active and relaxing seated games. Therefore you can still enjoy VR while relaxed by playing seated gamepad games, or even Boneworks, [which is built to allow for relaxed play](https://twitter.com/brandonjla/status/1154580767537655809?lang=en).",1569888004

I wrote that in 2nd person bc that's the kinda debate this seemed like.

There's a thing called flow. You prolly wont need that, but just write notes of what you and the opponent said so you can call them out on stufff they didn't adress and the impact.

Also wtf do you mean decided in real life. Slavery happened too and that doesn't mean it's right. Deciding whether something is right or wrong since it happened is bs.

It also makes more sense in Spanish because adjectives are marked for gender and number so you should probably establish the noun before describing it. 

As for advice, I had to binge a lot of Spanish before things felt natural and ""made sense"" to me. Books and movies are good if you don't have access to native speakers. Pick content you enjoy and search for Spanish versions/translations of it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hi, I used to work for about 4 years at a Cheesecake factory as a server, bartender, would help out in the kitchen when needed. a few things on the menu:

1: Everything is made in house from scratch, everything down to the buffalo sauce on the wings. My roommate was a prep cook and line cook and we would help each other from time to time. The kitchen had, at least at our restaurant (slowest in the nation), had 6 different walk in coolers. One just for prep items such as sauces, occasionally I would help with some of the sauces and other things.

2: The kitchen line has 8 different chef stations: Pasta, Saute, Fry, Flattop, Broil/grill / Pizza/Sandwich, and Salad. Each with a minimum of 6 pull out cooler drawers and 15-25 third pans on the top. For our restaurant there was a minimum of 7 people on staff for a week day and about 14 on a busy weekend night. I did some time at a busier restaurant and they could flex up to 25 people on the line at once, plus 4 dishwashers and 4 people in prep at all times.

3: Granted, yes a huge menu such as that is hard to execute, but just like MickeyDs, everything is closely monitored and each cook has to follow, and pass a test on any recipes that they cook, plus the new 7-10 new recipes bi-annually. (Cheesecake rotates out under performing dishes for newer ones twice a year).

4: After about a year there everything started to taste the same, like butter and lemon sauce; the base of 1/4th of the food at the place haha.

Think about it this way, you want to make a burger, pasta, steak, a salad, and chicken picatta for a single table. Well if you want return customers you better do them at least better than okay.

EDIT: Thank you kind strangers for the Gold and Silver, I will spend them on Serotonin and Dopamine ;)",1569888007

As an upgrade to that basic concept, I think I might get a pair of [ratcheting straps](https://smile.amazon.com/AUGO-Ratchet-Tie-Down-Straps/dp/B07GG6715T?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1) and run them beneath the mattress and out either side (one for wrists, and one for ankles). They'll come out between the bed slats, which should keep them in place to prevent me from wiggling the straps over the bed corners. There's just something very appealing about the idea of being ratcheted down, and I also enjoy the sensation of having a tug from one limb pull another limb. Should still be pretty easy to tuck out of sight when not in use, too.

And considering these kinds of straps are meant to secure things like ATVs and other super heavy items for transportation, there's no way in hell the buckles will bust. If only I'd thought of this in the first place!

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","&gt; Surviving abuse is never an excuse for being a shitty person

Except for the part where your whole comment was about how it is incredibly difficult to break that cycle. Why is there such a big divide in your mind between the parents and the brother? The parents were never violent (and until after becoming legally an adult, OP said they were good parents), yet the brother can be shitty and it is smoothed over. What if the parents both grew up in truly abusive households? Would it then be understandable them being as shitty as they are?",1569888008

A little background first 

So last night a mutual friend (I say friend but he is more of an acquaintance) of ours was snapchatting my fianc√©e. He had shown up to her work before (she works at a restaurant) and has always been nice with her. They messaged a few times before and never was it flirtatious or anything. So they were snapchatting last night but it wasn‚Äôt through the messaging function but actual pictures of him, and the people he was with, along with the messages. 

At first they were talking about how we were going to see a concert in a different state when he became very flirtatious. She had asked him to stop immediately and showed me what he was saying. (Ex: his ex has the same name as my fianc√©e and said ‚ÄòI wish I could have traded my Alex for you‚Äô or ‚ÄòI‚Äôll take you up there to see the concert, you would have the best time‚Äô) She immediately told him that she was engaged to me and that we were a package deal. After he wouldn‚Äôt stop his attempts she just blocked him. 

I was pretty upset at this moment because this isn‚Äôt the first time a guy has disrespected our relationship. I find in my life multiple people who have total disregard for our engagement and sexuality. I had had enough at that point so [I messaged him over facebook.](https://imgur.com/a/H0xCPBS) I went to sleep after and woke up the next morning to see he had completely ignored the message. This upset me even more and had commented on his page ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt try to hit on a girl who is engaged and a lesbian‚Äô. This finally got his attention and he messaged me back telling me to stop and calling me a dipshit. 



Well that just pissed me off even more so I screenshot the messages and posted [this fine gem.](https://imgur.com/a/m8BdK4a) Which comes to the conclusion: AITA for posting that on Facebook? 

**I also want to point out he also knew me as I have seen him in my fianc√©es restaurant before and was introduced to him. It is without a doubt that he knew we were engaged and he absolutely knew she was a lesbian.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","This is purely anecdotal, and I am sure there are kids with actual diagnosable conditions, but as a parent of two non-violent kids who have a few violent friends and cousins, I have noticed a difference in child-rearing. 

Firstly, my husband and I have never raised a hand to our children. There is no ear pinching. Because, secondly, we treat physical violence as completely shocking and unacceptable behavior. When my oldest was 2.5, she threw a ball that hit her cousin. I would like to think it was an accident but can't be sure. We gasped, asked her what she was doing and why, made her apologize and immediately left for home. There is no ""retaliation"" to my kids acting inappropriately because there is no ""getting even"" - only consequences: we leave, we turn off the tv, we go home, we don't get ice cream. We are very disappointed.

With my kids' more violent little friends, I have noticed the parents tend to be extremely strict or extremely lax. Like your friend, who would just ignore getting cursed at or assaulted. Or a parent who would flip out because his kid took a goldfish cracker offer to all kids without asking him for permission.

That being said, we might also just have kids who don't really fight or scream. We might just be lucky and it has nothing to do with our parenting style.",1569888010

Literally crimes white people commit too. A lot of things can give white people a bad image, doesn't make it right though.

&gt;How many orders of magnitude more likely to commit violent crimes does someone have to be for you not to relax when you see a large group of that specific group approaching you?

If around 5/10 people actually fall victim to a violent crime by the blacks they're around, but in reality, it's not even 0.5/1000, nobody would be friends with blacks if that were true. But I guess that's something only people who are actually at least acquainted with a black person would know. Fear through lies isn't healthy.

That's put a few planning elements slightly on pause (e.g. it doesn't make sense to start booking a local premarital counselor until we know where we'll be living) but I'm still feeling well on top of things.

I'm curious when everyone else is sending out their invitations? I'd been planning on 12/1 so there wouldn't be a huge gap before a 3/1 RSVP deadline (venue needs to know 3/14) but it's a (domestic) destination wedding for all guests and people have started talking about booking flights and hotels, so maybe we should get them out earlier...

What's up next:

* Deciding on invitation design &amp; wording - samples arrive this Friday! This also means we have to finalize the schedule and brings me to the next bullet:
* Finalizing plans for the other weekend events like welcome drinks and farewell brunch
* Finalize plans for bachelor/bachelorette parties
* Ask my brother to be the officiant - I keep waiting for the right moment when he's not too busy or traveling but I just need to do it!
* FH to start figuring out suit color/style; figure out if we want to ask our siblings to coordinate (since we're not really doing a bridal party and they're going to stand up with us)
* (Possibly) start ordering our various decor extras like favors and card box... we may wait another few weeks on this, especially if we end up moving!",1569888012

"Whatcouldgowrong","t5_2x2oy","This is some of the worst Gish-galloping I've seen. Let's take your last two comments point-by-point. That will show how wide of the point you've gone.

&gt;Except outlets like NYT push obvious bullshit on a daily basis and then bury their reprint. That way they can push political narratives they like and still say ‚Äúwe reprinted the article after the facts changed‚Äù. 

First, this isn't a rebuttal, it's an opinion, so you don't need the ""except."" Second, new outlets retract stories when new information arises. What would you prefer? No retraction? I don't think you'll hold to that opinion.

&gt;It‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs intentional. And half the time they don‚Äôt even bother to reprint. They just tweet some dumb shit about how they retracted he article. But they keep the original out there for liberal shills to pull from when arguing bullshit like all this racist shit. 

This is just ad-hom rambling, but it seems like you're saying that outlets don't retract their stories. That directly contradicts the image we're commenting on. 

&gt; It‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs intentional. And half the time they don‚Äôt even bother to reprint. They just tweet some dumb shit about how they retracted he article. But they keep the original out there for liberal shills to pull from when arguing bullshit like all this racist shit. 

I'd like a source on this one. Make sure your source includes the ""by liberals"" information. You wouldn't want to be accused of perpetuating ""fake news"" when you couldn't back up a claim, now would you?

&gt;Don‚Äôt you find it odd that these leftists want a narrative to exist so bad they‚Äôre literally making it up?

This is question-begging. I don't agree with your premise, ad-hom attacks, or intentional vagueness. Who are ""these leftists""?  The girl? The NYT? Why is the NYT ""leftist"" for reporting the story and then retracting it when the truth came out? Leftists are better at follow-up?

&gt;The problem is reporting the fucking story to begin with and not bothering to even talk to the fuckin kid. 

...which kid? The girl with dreadlocks? How would they have written the article without talking to her? 

&gt;A person with their iq level above room temperature would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna see if I can talk to this girl, her parents, her school, the children she‚Äôs accusing..‚Äù literally anyone. But they don‚Äôt, they just repeat whatever dumb shit was said and send it out for the world to read. 

Reporters do exactly that. Then they update their reporting. Again, literally Journalism 101. That's why we have a retraction. So are you angry that they did follow-up and a retraction, or are you saying there shouldn't have been a retraction? You're awfully vague on that point.

&gt;Then it gets repeated by outlet after outlet after outlet. While the original outlet ‚Äúretracted‚Äù the article, even though they leave the original up, everybody else keeps pushing it until it‚Äôs well known to be false. Then it gets swept under the rug and they move back to other political propaganda. 

Oh this one's easy. There was a retraction. You keep glossing over that. If another outlet picks up the story, they're still reporting the truth: ""The NYT reports..."" Which is true. That's what the NYT reported. That's why reputable outlets will maintain that magic word: ""allegedly.""

... and then there's the part where you repeat my insult. It'd be kind of recursive to quote that again.",1569888013

"ballpython","t5_2srho","Here‚Äôs my bp feeding copypasta

It‚Äôs common for ball pythons to go off food, especially in the colder months. If they miss a feeding, wait at least a couple days before offering again. Offering food too often can stress them out. 

Here‚Äôs a few techniques that might be worth trying:

Hamster bedding: I imagine you could go to any pet store and get a little cup of used hamster bedding. I‚Äôve heard of people using this to ‚Äúscent‚Äù the mouse/rat to entice the snake to eat.

Hair dryer: thaw a mouse with whatever method you choose. Just before you feed it to the snake, use a hair dryer to heat the head to around 115F, confirm with a temp gun. This gives the snake a more clear heat target when they strike. 

Braining: you can cut open the head of the mouse/rat a little bit so the smell of blood and brains can attract your snake. 

Plate: some ball pythons don‚Äôt like eating off of tongs and prefer to have it left in their enclosure. If you do this it‚Äôs important to check back within 15-20 minutes to see if the prey is eaten. If not, remove from the enclosure and discard. Dead prey sitting around will quickly grow bacteria. In the case of a refusal, discard the rodent and don‚Äôt re-freeze.

Tub feeding: this one is a bit controversial, and most say this method shouldn‚Äôt be used. But you put the snake in a separate tub, feed them, then put them back. The downside is this can cause a lot of stress on the snake and possibly cause them to regurgitate. It also goes off of outdated ideas about ‚Äúcage aggression‚Äù. I‚Äôve heard of some people finding success with this method. As long as the snake is okay I don‚Äôt really see a problem with it. But I think it should be kept as a last resort. 

Wet or Dry: I‚Äôve seen some snakes be picky about this. My baby ball python doesn‚Äôt seem to care one way or the other. My older snake is a bit picky and won‚Äôt touch it at all if it‚Äôs wet. This can be solved with the hair dryer method from above.",1569888013

Their chairs are fucking incredible though, hella comfortable, high quality (no shitty plastic base, stuff like that) and they look great (which is subjective really but whatever). Biggest problem is the price, but If you can justify spending like 400 bucks on a chair I‚Äôd say fucking full send. For what I‚Äôd consider a premium product, in a market that is flooded with those cheap 20 dollar amazon gaming chairs, I think they stand out as top of the line chairs. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs THE best as I haven‚Äôt tried every chair in existence but it‚Äôs definitely a glorious chair that I‚Äôd deem worthy of all the praise it gets. 

Ok rant over. Btw I‚Äôm not a shill, I just really love my chair lol.

I also have health issues, I also struggle to get my husband to help (along with various other asshole traits that are slowly killing me), however my husband flat out refuses marriage counseling- the only way he says he‚Äôll agree to go is during a select few months of the year {can‚Äôt be during football season or the hunting seasons he participates in} and I would have to pay for it entirely {but only after paying off my share of our debt} which would be almost impossible as I work part time {I‚Äôm a stylist who just took a job 2 cities away from where I was working- for better opportunity and pay however it‚Äôll take months if not a year or more for that to pay off but it WILL be well worth it} with other financial obligations. 
My husbands family has stepped on my toes on multiple occasions. We‚Äôve talked (and argued) over this many many times- he cannot see the issue (yet everyone I‚Äôve talked to about these situations is shocked at their audacity). 

Having said all that, when it comes down to it- would I leave because he‚Äôs hurting my health? I can‚Äôt see it happening. I love him, I took vows for better or worse. No one is perfect but I see how he tries. I see the improvements he‚Äôs made since we first got together. I don‚Äôt want to break my family up, they‚Äôre my world. Frankly, without my family, I don‚Äôt know how important my health would be to me. It‚Äôs only been something I‚Äôve truly been concerned with since becoming a wife and mother. 
I‚Äôm not advising anyone to do as I do, I‚Äôm simply stating that it is not just black and white. Walking out is a different beast when you‚Äôre financially reliant on your husband, you have children (especially if you‚Äôre children have special needs), etc.. 
I also just can‚Äôt see leaving someone I love so much because of their ignorance. He‚Äôs not TRYING to neglect his wife. He just can‚Äôt see the situation for what it really is.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically a few nights ago I went out for a few drinks with some mates and somehow ended up at one of my mates' flat. He's a big steroid user. The conversation somehow steered towards steroid use and me complaining about not being able to put on muscle. Dumbf\*ck that I am I asked him about using steroids and he was open to letting me try and said he can sort me out. He injected me with 500mg testosterone enanthate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up the next morning with some minor pain where I got injected but mostly regret. I don't judge people for taking steroids but I really don't want to be on them. Will this one injection make my testicles atrophy? Is there anything I can take to prevent that? I'm in a bit of a panic and I can't sleep. I know that the testosterone will stay in my system for 2 weeks so is that 2 weeks without my balls producing testosterone?",1569888015

"gnome","t5_2qjhn","I work in HPC, and people use GPGPUs for accellerated computing. The *major* bottleneck i transferring data to and from the GPU. So much so, in fact, that surprisingly often it can be overall faster to just do the calculation on the CPU even though the GPU can do the operation much faster. And this is on HPC systems with far faster GPUs and higher bandwidth between CPU and GPU. I'm not sceptical at all.

It's probably not to the sole source of the delay, though. Another common bottleneck for graphics processing is that you need to massage your data into a form that the GPU code can easily use. That happens on the CPU and can easily take more time than you spend on the GPU afterwards. My bet it is a combination of both these things.",1569888017

Tencent has the ability, since it has 2 board members, to cast a vote on matters that are brought to the board. They can influence that ultimate decision based on which way they vote. They do not, however, control what the company does.

Say for example the board comes together to decide where they're going to invest their money. New IPs or existing. Tencent's members of the board could vote for Epic to branch out and invest in new IPs. However, if the board votes in favour of existing IPs, then that's the direction that Epic will go, and because Tim Sweeney owns the majority stake of the company shares, even if Tencent's board members throw a tantrum and demand that the board vote the other way, Tim has the power, as the individual with controlling interest, to tell Tencent to fuck off.",1569888018

I really like how 5e manages the three main choices where the racial ASIs are often insignificant enough to make any race/class combo viable and that background choice is almost entirely a collection of ribbon features that seek to make a character rather than a statblock.

As for changing level-up options, that's a hard no from me. The overburdening feat/proficiency may work well for Pathfinder and earlier editions of D&amp;D, but there's no way I can see it being preferable to 5e's more streamlined approach.

All in all, it just sounds like you want to play Pathfinder as I'm sure that's just what you'll end up with if you introduce all these changes to 5e.",1569888019

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because you did not include a minimum of one required tag in the title.

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive &amp; spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct &amp; incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets &amp; capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

If I think to myself a negative thought regarding my body what I would do is tell myself that everyone else who even so much as looked my direction was also noticing and judging me on whatever it was I was hung up about. In reality, for the most part, everyone is so worried about themselves and their own insecurities that they rarely notice or give a second glance at everyone else‚Äôs flaws. Just try and remind yourself that every time you think someone is judging you and it stops you from doing something you were planning on doing. Anyways, my first steps were cleaning up my diet, I started counting macros and that‚Äôs something that I could do in full on private that no one else had to see.",1569888019
"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit isn't discussed much in the Bible past the fact that it exists. I can't say that this is the word of God and I am certain, but this is my opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up solving this, to the best of my ability, with formal logic. Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is a sin Jesus doesn't forgive. The Bible states Jesus forgives anyone who repents. Therefore, I conclude that blaspheming against the Holy Spirit means to die without repenting. This would be a blasphemy against the spirit because the Bible states many times that all creation testifies to God and that the Holy Spirit calls everyone to repentance. To die without repentance is to ignore all this testimony and call it false. People who die without repenting die refusing this call of the Holy Spirit to repent. They are calling the Holy Spirit's testimony false, and to call the Holy Spirit a false witness is to call the Holy Spirit a liar, which is blasphemy. 

This is the only sin that Jesus doesn't forgive, because by definition, it is unrepented. It's not unforgivable because it's so bad, since James states that all sins are equal in God's eyes. It's unforgivable because Jesus forgives sins that are repented, and will not forgive a sin that cannot be repented because repentance comes before death. If you want to repent because you're afraid you've committed the unpardonable sin, that is proof you didn't commit it, because anything you want to repent, Jesus will forgive.

If you're alive, you don't have to worry that you have blasphemed the Holy Spirit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second Question: How do you know you're saved?

I used to really struggle with this too. I worried that I only THOUGHT I believed and was missing some tiny loophole and was headed straight for Hell. But rest assured to know that returning to sin does not make you unsaved, or literally no one in history ever would have been saved. Everyone returns to sin.

&amp;#x200B;

Romans 7:15-20:  I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.¬†And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.¬†As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.¬†For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do‚Äîthis I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. - If your pastor is right that relapsing means you're not saved, Paul isn't saved.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, David and Solomon were both CRAAAAAZY sinful and relapsed like every day. If Solomon ""700 wives after God told him specifically not to do that"" and David ""Counted his soldiers TWICE after God told him not to and literally his son died because of that"" can be saved, relapsing into sin is no indication of salvation

&amp;#x200B;

So how do you know you're saved?

&amp;#x200B;

I rest on one verse. A verse from the mouth of God. The word of God, spoken to you:

Romans 10:9 That if you **confess with your mouth**, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in **your** heart that God raised him from **the** dead, you will be saved. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. That's literally it. You confess Jesus is Lord? You believe God raised him from the dead? You're golden. Cut and dried, absolutely, simple as that. Anything else is just complicating things. This is the word of God, directly answering your exact question.",1569888019

The key items of trade being access to undrafted players and the compensation picks clubs received for losing free agents (both clubs traded stuff to get some of those future year compo picks off the recipient clubs)

In year 2 they each had their natural pick from ladder position, and also what they subsequently traded in. What the OP has documented is the different trading behaviour of the two clubs.

The only material difference in what the two clubs started with was the four minidraft picks GWS got to trade, a couple of which resulted in Gold Coast swapping National Draft picks for basically equivalent minidraft access to Martin and O'Meara. That's where Gold Coast's 2012 pick 4 for finishing 17th went, for instance - Jaeger O'Meara (GWS drafted Hoskin-Elliot there).

The minidraft was an extra thing which was *supposed* to make up for the percieved inferior quality of zone access for GWS and the assumed greater difficulty they'd have getting uncontracted players due to going second after other clubs locked many players up. As it turns out, that didn't matter much to GWS, the GC zone access guys still mostly left and GC's free agents were more of a short term sugar hit than Davis and Ward would end up being.",1569888021

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","That was a struggle for us in the beginning before we got more or less working products.  We started with a hands-off approach where we just gave everyone their own distinct subtree (since all of our ICs are themselves developers) and turned them loose.  I did my own subtree push and pull to decide what I liked and what I didn't of features (with the help of a handful of other reviewers), but it got to be really painful to sanitize their often proprietary commit messages from generic features we wanted to capture... So we switched to submodules.  That approach has its own demons for sure, but it prevents cross-commits that are particularly sensitive considering all of our projects are integrated at the folder level.  

With that preamble, what we do now is a constantly rolling set of tests.  We specified that if you want to have unbroken code, your runners will be in a folder called ""runners"" and they will have a method called ""test"", and we will run all of those before we merge into your branch.  Anyone who doesn't want merges can opt out, since we're in academia most projects have like a 1 year shelf life or so.  Generally we do an on-demand system where about once a month I roll up an enterprise commit of all the ""noteworthy"" changes and distribute them to any group that wants.

To decide what is ""noteworthy"", I look for the last time I did a merge to their project (everyone still gets their own perpetual remote on the master subtree repository), and I squash and re-tool all their commits into one.  Then I do a diff and pick and choose what I want.  That enterprise commit then gets merged into their branch and I make a patch to roll out to the master line.  I put those all together on one integration branch, then roll them to everyone simultaneously (about once every 3 weeks) and do it as one highly annotated commit.  If they don't like it, it's easy to revert because we do a heavy focus on rebasing so there are never tree conflicts.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt;  **Article:**

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine‚Äôs president, a senior State Department official said Monday, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.

Mr. Pompeo‚Äôs participation on the call, which hadn‚Äôt been previously reported, was one of several developments related to the controversy that centers on Mr. Trump‚Äôs repeated urging that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump‚Äôs personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr, on investigations into Mr. Trump‚Äôs political opponents, including Democratic rival Joe Biden.

Also Monday, House committees subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani to turn over documents related to his communications with Trump administration officials about his efforts in Ukraine, as well as any other documents related to that effort, by Oct. 15. They said the subpoena was formally part of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani said on Twitter that the subpoena ‚Äúwill be given appropriate consideration,‚Äù noting that the subpoena was ‚Äúsigned only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case.‚Äù

The impeachment inquiry is focused on Mr. Trump‚Äôs dealings with Ukraine. Lawmakers are focusing on a whistleblower complaint by a person identified as an officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and a record of the call between the two presidents that was released by the administration. If the Democrats approve articles of impeachment, the matter would move to trial in the Senate, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed Monday he would hold.

‚ÄúI would have no choice but to take it up,‚Äù the Kentucky Republican said on CNBC. He added: ‚ÄúHow long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.‚Äù

The scrutiny of the call with Ukraine‚Äîwhich came at a time when Mr. Trump had ordered U.S. aid to Ukraine put on hold‚Äîhas prompted a wider examination of efforts by the Trump administration to engage foreign leaders in assisting with issues important to the president.

Mr. Barr has asked Mr. Trump to make introductions to a number of foreign officials he believes may have information relevant to the Justice Department‚Äôs review of the origins of the Russia investigation and has held overseas meetings with some of them, a Justice Department official said Monday. Mr. Trump recently called Australia‚Äôs prime minister at Mr. Barr‚Äôs request, two government officials said, to ask him to help with the inquiry.

Mr. Barr in May tapped John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, to lead the review. It focuses on the counterintelligence investigation that became special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs probe into Russian election meddling. Since then, Mr. Durham has been exploring what role if any various countries including Ukraine played in the counterintelligence probe. The Justice Department has revealed that ‚Äúcertain Ukrainians who are not members of the government‚Äù had volunteered information to Mr. Durham.

The department official wouldn‚Äôt say from which other countries Mr. Barr is seeking information. The attorney general was in Italy last week speaking to government officials in connection with Mr. Durham‚Äôs review.

The official described Mr. Barr‚Äôs request that Mr. Trump speak to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as standard, saying ‚ÄúIt is typical protocol for one leader to contact another leader‚Äù for such a request.

‚ÄúThe Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,‚Äù according to a statement from the Australian government. ‚ÄúThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president.‚Äù

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Monday said: ‚ÄúThe DOJ simply requested that the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Mr. Trump and his Republican congressional allies have long alleged that his associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance, and that investigators in the Justice Department and the FBI were politically prejudiced against Mr. Trump in a way that could have affected their work. Mr. Trump has said he believes Mr. Durham‚Äôs review will show crimes were comFmitted by his political opponents.

Mr. Pompeo was scheduled to depart for a European trip later Monday. He said last week that he hadn‚Äôt yet read the whistleblower‚Äôs complaint in its entirety, but said that to his knowledge, actions by State Department officials had been ‚Äúentirely appropriate and consistent‚Äù with administration efforts to improve relations with Ukraine.

In those comments, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, he didn‚Äôt mention his own participation in the call, but said the complaint was filed by ‚Äúsomeone who had secondhand knowledge.‚Äù

Several days earlier, Mr. Pompeo said that he opposed releasing the record of the Trump-Zelensky call. He told ‚ÄúFox News Sunday‚Äù in a Sept. 22 interview that he would defer to the White House on whether to do so.

‚ÄúThose are private conversations between world leaders, and it‚Äôs not often that those are released,‚Äù he said in the interview. And when they‚Äôre [released], it‚Äôs done when the White House deems it appropriate.‚Äù Mr. Pompeo dismissed a question about details of the call, saying, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot going on in the world.‚Äù

Three House committees‚ÄîForeign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight ‚Äî on Friday subpoenaed Mr. Pompeo for documents related to the inquiry; he has until Oct. 4 to produce them.

The committees plan to depose former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch ; U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker ; Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent; counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl ; and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.

Mr. Volker resigned his post last week. Mr. Sondland said he planned to attend the deposition. The State Department did not respond to questions about plans by other officials who were asked to appear.

In Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky said Monday that his administration wouldn‚Äôt release a transcript of the July phone call with Mr. Trump, while also saying he is open to investigating any alleged violation of Ukrainian law.

At the White House on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump told reporters: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to find out about a whistleblower.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt expand on that, and the White House didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a question about the comment.

Mr. Trump has said he deserved to confront the whistleblower and anyone who provided him information and has suggested they are spies who committed treasonous acts. House Democrats are eager to hear testimony from the whistleblower‚Äîthough in a way that will protect his identity.

Shortly after Mr. Trump‚Äôs comment, Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer who represents the whistleblower wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúThe Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.‚Äù

The Republican-led Senate is considered unlikely to convict Mr. Trump in any impeachment trial. Removing the president requires approval by two-thirds of the 100-member Senate.

Some Senate Republicans have voiced concern over the allegations outlined in a whistleblower complaint made public last week, but none has voiced support for impeachment.",1569888023

He also has a bad self image hence him over compensating with the sports car and god-awful clothes. He still seems to be that nerdy kid stuck in the body of a slightly bigger kid.

I‚Äôm a bit confused. You say that you‚Äôre only learning things that you learned last year in Spanish... but apparently only one person in your class has mastered the material.

You also say that the teacher piles on homework and that you‚Äôve had 15 worksheets in two months. But that doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of homework. It seems very manageable. Are you getting incompletes because you‚Äôre not finishing corrections? Are you required to redo them completely every time? Eight out of fifteen seems like a really high percentage.

The teacher preventing you from testing is weird, but is that her rule? Is that a school policy? Are their other Spanish II classes that are allowed to test?",1569888024

Typically rooting interests are based around geography. I'm born and raised in the Los Angeles area and my parents were kids when the Dodgers and Lakers moved to LA and before that the biggest thing in town was USC football. This is something that was passed on to myself and brothers and sisters. Along the way I would end up rooting for the Raiders(still do uggggh) while my brothers went the Rams route(still do screw them). I have a few friends who grew up Clipper fans and Angel fans and UCLA fans. To me it's always been about geography. The lone outlier for me has been my love for the Tottenham Hotspur over the last 5yrs and my love for soccer has led to me rooting for LAFC. Again, geography.

I love that Goku's art and animations, but his functionality, especially once he goes SSJ is astounding.

I'll be going for him with 2 paths open tbh.

Rotation 1: Namek Goku &amp; LR SSJ Gohan

Rotation 2: EZA Goku/Gohan &amp; LR SSJ Gohan.

LR Vegito, LR Gogeta &amp; LR Cell (or STR Cell when his EZA comes) floating

That'll be my dream team I reckon.",1569888026

"Marriage","t5_2reak","This is going to sound disjointed but here are the thoughts running through my head:

Is he depressed?

His responses to the role playing and dirty talking seem like classic humor-avoidance behavior, too. He's got some sexual hang-ups he needs to work through - at least that's what it seems like, especially considering he won't even go down on you?? Really bud, its 20 fucking 19, you get down there and eat that pussy and ass like a starving man. 

He might be feeling a bit ashamed and inadequate as a man/husband, regardless of how you go about it. Is he seeing a therapist/counselor on his own? If not he needs to get on that. Lord knows I'd be feeling like shit letting my wife down in the bedroom.

I know it seems like I'm going to ask you to do even more than what you're already doing, and that isn't really fair at all; but sometimes we suck it up and deal with unfair situations for the sake of the marriage. That said: do you know what kind of porn he's into? Have you tried doing some of that stuff, or maybe watching porn together?

As for not finding a pregnant body attractive...well...I'm not going to hate on that. Everyone is turned on and off different things, and I can see how a partners body changing could affect that.

It seems like you're both trying...though you more than him, honestly. Like someone else mentioned, he sounds quite selfish in the bedroom. And immature. He's uncomfortable with the intimacy required for a loving, sexual marriage. Sometimes I do things for my wife that I'm not necessarily into because she likes it, and vice-versa. 

As I re-read it: it sounds like you two are good friends/roommates. Not lovers or husband/wife.

The sudden change when you two moved in together is an important point, and I think you two need to dig into that more with your therapist(s). Sudden changes in behavior are rarely things that happen on their own.

Last thought, and probably the most unpleasant: is he having an affair, and thus doesn't have enough ""gas in the tank"" for you?

Good luck, I hope things improve.",1569888026

I agree though on the aspect of being successful in the way everyone wants to be, or in the way people expect you to be. Big house, lots of money, nice car, it seems like this is what is considered as success now a days. This is what I could care less for. But when it comes to my geniuene goals and dreams, I will do whatever I can to make those my reality. Sure, I technically don't need them to be happy but it's what I want to experience and it is what fills me with passion.

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","&gt; That's what I mean by the analogy not working.

You keep saying this, but it works just fine.

The supposed ""Crime"" never involved Joe Biden. That is why it is confusing you when you add in Joe Biden. The analogy itself actually works great for a few reasons. It illustrates how abnormal it is for the investigation to advertise, especially without any first hand knowledge or evidence.

It's also Especially Apt in the part where the murdered guy shows up and says ""I'm not murdered"" (""I wasn't pressured to investigate anyone"")

&gt;It's only veering into deep state conspiracy and the idea that everyone is spying on the president that makes me not want to continue.

Well, I think you will have a hard time with the next year of revelations from the right and the Durham and Horowitz reports.

I don't like the term ""Deep state"" either. There are very specific people in the Obama Administration that did this, not countless nameless faceless monsters. Jim Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, Sztork and Page and maybe a few more people. President Obama for sure.

This isn't like Hydra suddenly taking over Shield, to use a Marvel Analogy.

And this topic  is only the beginning of this discussion, as far as the Trump Campaign and most conservatives like me are concerned. I can't wait to see more. Especially when the reports come out.

Ironically Hillary is the only one who didn't abuse her power in 2016. She had none to abuse.

Hjalmarsson is a shutdown, stay-at-home defenseman at heart, and isolated impact metrics prove that, showing Hjalmarsson to be a moderate negative play driver on 5v5 offense but a MASSIVE 5v5 force on defense. His usage confirm's these metrics' suggestions, as Hjalmarsson is regularly tasked with shutting down the opposition's top offensive forwards. While Hjalmarsson won't contribute much on offense, his ability to log huge, tough minutes makes him an incredible #2 defenseman. 

Hickey has cemented himself as a solid, albeit somewhat mediocre top-6 defenseman. He's more of a two-way defenseman, as his play in both ends of the ice are serviceable, but he does not overly impress in either area. He's not one to shy away from a physical encounter, but as a somewhat smaller defenseman, he's too easily knocked off the puck and doesn't have the skating abilities to compensate for that shortcoming. He's not the defenseman a team should trust to be an anchor.

"watamote","t5_2wshs","It's nice to see you back, World Three. Summer break finally has begun, the one what it probably will be the most chaotic and tormentous arc after No-Disneyland, and wait a moment, isn't there any fireworks scene? Well, whatever.

What an interesting parallelism in first page, Futaki and Ucchi, the two emoji girls walking one ahead other in the same panel, whereas one is surrounded by a group of boys, the other is surrounded by a group of girls, though pitifully for the latter, she isn't with the girl with whom she really craves for.

And talking about parallelisms, I'm not sure if NT did it intentionally, but it caught a lot my attention to see Asuka and Mako in the same row, in different panels though. Every one of them has become dangerously controlling onto their respective 'new-highlight-friend', and even with all this disturbance in environment, we don't get any true responses yet.

Surprises have just started, if this were a regular day, Tomoko and Yuri wandered around together in road to their respective homes, but thanks to Nemo factor, things will be different here, by the way, an interesting tidbit to know that Nemo and Akane have hanged out together to have study at beach in their 1st day of summer break since..., since 1st year maybe?

Of course, Nemo won't lose any chance for living her slice of life MC fantasies, even if that implies to force Yuri-chan, and asserting moral superiority won't work this time.

I would have never hated so much to agree with a character, albeit to others seeing Yuri-chan complaining about her current state, I understand her feeling, like someone who has lived diring all his life in a cold city, if I must study, I'd prefer at least to avoid any bit of heat in air, and seriously, to scape of any distracting noise. How much of truth is there in what Nemo told about alpha waves?

Technology is the way with the least resistance, lol. But being serious, I hope that reading Tomoko talking about her agreement of studying at the beach, it isn't the forethought to what Asuka though about how she is a pushover person, Tomoko is just having her 'enjoying of youth' moment.

Oh, Akane, Akane, Akane! Why had you to spill the soup? Myself being a introvert person, I've to heard over and over how extrovert ones remark whenever I'm just showing the littlest gesture of and smile or fast-talking, and at least for me, those remarks are unrequited attention, I really must read back the past chapters of series for realizing myself how conscious Akane is in what regards to reading the mood.

Don't abuse of technology, or it'll eat you alive, lol, and please Akane, stop already with that. Being serious again, for once it's nice to see a interaction between Akane and Tomoko where Forehead/Pineapple girl doesn't end up being traumatized, those two are having a normal conversation (I'd like to know if Akane sees Tomoko as a friend, though), and of a trivial subject like it's to prefer spend summer break rather than school, I'm not surprised Tomoko realized too late that not liking school is a common trope among the average of students, until relatively so short ago, she was a loner.

Damn it, my eyes cheated me and for a while I thought in inadequate things. However, here we get to appreciate the beachy landscape with three girls having fun time in sea (or at least in Nemo's head), and the remaining one watching them from distance, but of course, the picture won't be complete (literally talking) until four of them are touching the water.

As the other introvert one, Tomoko knows very well how to persuade Yuri-chan, and in her very peculiar way, though here is where I wonder Yuri acceded to Tomoko's petition whether because it was her who asked it to her, or because Yuri-chan was able to see through that double-sense comment and she found it fun, which would support hypothesis about Yuri-chan is a closet pervert.

I swear Tomoko was just trying to save Yuri of being drenched by seawater, seriously that was the only thing it happened there, though at least that incident gave us a cute (by its way) moment.

And Nemo is playing out her 'see the glass half full' card, but unironically, this brings along the 'the worst that could happen', pretty curious, it's the second time in this series where the original plans of characters are disrupted by having to go at stadium for so to cheer the baseball team. By the way, how difficult is it to wash the seaweed scent off clothes?

It was a quiet chapter, but not for that it is worth less, by contrary, it's curious how in fighting shonen manga, people complaints constantly when there are chapters where characters are having a good while moment, however, I consider them like a well-deserved moment of resting for them, and how big will be the storm which is coming in life of characters in this 'The Last High School Summer Break Arc', I think it's quite necessary this kind of chapters.

It's going to be a torturing wait until November 7th, honestly, I don't thing is a good marketing strategy that of paywalling beforehand, especially when for this manga, it was necessary to make reprints because volumes have sold out from shelves.",1569888032

\- **Rimworld** (Alun perin mietin **Dwarf Fortress**ia, mutta DF ei taida t√§ytt√§√§ julkaisukriteerej√§ listalle. Asetti t√§ysin uudet standardit omalle emergentille pelikonseptilleen. Emergentit pelimekanismit ja ""jumalan leikkiminen"" eiv√§t olleet pitk√§√§n aikaan cooleja, melkeen joutuu muistelemaan about jotain **Populous, Dungeon Keeper** ja **Black &amp; White** \-aikoja ennen n√§it√§.)

\- **Portal 2** (Hemmetin ovela puzzleri sopivan kevyesti h√∂ystettyn√§, osoitti ett√§ hyv√§ kirjoittaminen ja ""yksinkertainen"" konsepti riitt√§v√§t; j√§lkijunassa seurasi muita eritt√§in mielenkiintoisia pelej√§ kuten mm. **The Talos Principle** ja **The Stanley Parable**. Toki pohjalla oli jo loistava **Portal 1**, mutta silti - loistavasta on eritt√§in vaikea parantaa.)

\- **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** (Loi uutta uskoa ett√§ cyberpunkki voidaan oikeasti saada taas toimimaan - nyt sormet ristiss√§ sen CD Projekt Redin kanssa... sanoisin ett√§ toimii pitk√§lti pohjana koko ensi vuoden odotetuimmalle pelille.)

\- **Rocket League** (Varma go-to peli sillon kun joku kummipojista tulee kyl√§√§n tai kavereiden kanssa haluu oikeesti vaan relata; jos joku esittelis t√§n hassunhauskan pelikonseptin pelk√§ll√§ paperilla, niin useimmat varmaan heittelisiv√§t suoraan √ñ-mappiin. Yksi esimerkki peligenrest√§, miss√§ ihan p√§√§tt√∂m√§lt√§ tuntuva pelikonsepti onkin todella hauska - nyt taitaa olla esim. Untitled Goose Game kovassa nousussa.)

\- **Mass Effect 2** (Kyll√§ tuon koko trilogian pelasi innolla l√§pi, vaikka se loppufiasko oli kielt√§m√§tt√§ v√§h√§n tuhnu; kyynel silm√§kulmassa sanon hiljaa hyv√§stej√§ Bioware-tasoiselle tarinankerronnalle, vaikkakin **Divinity: Original Sin 2**:n kaltaiset iloiset pilkahdukset antavat toivoa ett√§ uusia tekij√∂it√§ nousisi t√§llaisen ""maailmojen luojan"" j√§ttil√§isen tilalle.)

\- **This War of Mine** (Right in mah feelz... osoitti ett√§ indie-deveilt√§kin l√∂ytyy taitoa liikuttaa siihen pisteeseen, ett√§ v√§lill√§ tulee eksytty√§ kattelemaan YouTubeen trailereita ja mietitty√§ ihan aikuisten oikeasti konfliktialueilla el√§vi√§ ihmisi√§.)

\- **Sid Meier's Civilization V** (Taattua ""one more turn""-addiktiota jos erehtyy launchaamaan, just ylt√§en 2010-luvulle; strategiapelien ehdotonta eliitti√§, kest√§nyt helposti koko vuosikymmenen ja on osoittanut ett√§ ""perinteist√§"" vuoropohjaista strategiaa jaksaa edelleenkin hakata.)

\- **Europa Universalis IV** (Eka Paradox-peli, joka koukutti yli kilotunnin verran, vaikka **Stellaris** p√§√§see l√§helle; HoI4 ja CK2 ihan ok mutteivat iskeneet yht√§ kovaa; Paradoxin jatkuva-aikaiset niksunaksut nyt ovat mikromanageroinnin m√§rki√§ unia ja ovat suurin piirtein muodostaneet oman kulttinsa)

\- **Dark Souls** \[1 - 'Prepare to Die' edition\] (Ensimm√§inen askeleeni DS-maailmaan, en pettynyt - trilogia tuli pelattua l√§pi 100% masokistisessa mielihyv√§ss√§; pidin jopa ykk√∂sen ja kakkosen hitaammasta temposta vs. kolmonen, pelasin kronologisessa j√§rjestyksess√§ vasta sitten l√§pi kun koko trilogia oli jo julkaistu... ja juu, kyll√§h√§n se on tuolla topicissakin, ja syyst√§kin. Dark Souls on itsess√§√§n jo k√§site, ja se jo riitt√§nee omaksi maininnakseen.)

\- **Doom** (T√§√§ p√§√§tyy listalle hassusta syyst√§ - en oo pelannut peli√§ lainkaan, mutta vahingossa musaraitaan sekaantuneena j√§in koukkuun ja tutustuin Mick Gordonin muuhunkin tuotantoon; kenties esimerkki pelist√§, jossa musiikki teki merkitt√§v√§n osan pelikokemuksesta? Tulee nyky√§√§n luukutettua t√§m√§n ansiosta jotain Killer Instinct -OST:iakin. Joka tapauksessa toi yhden tietokonepelien pyhimmist√§ klassikoista onnistuneesti modernille vuosikymmenelle.)

\- **DotA 2** (No oli t√§√§ nyt kuitenkin pakko laittaa t√§nne, vaikka MOBA:t olivatkin jo olemassa. Mutta sanoisin ett√§ t√§√§ r√§j√§ytti tuon eSports-pankin, jossa LoL:n, SC:n, CS:n yms palkintorahat kalpenevat. Sill√§ on valtavasti yhteiskunnallistakin vaikutusta. T√§n ansiosta nyky√§√§n vaikkapa Ylelt√§ n√§kyy tietokonepelej√§ ""urheiluna"", ja mik√§s sen enemp√§√§ vanhempaa sukupolvea √§rsytt√§isik√§√§n.)

En nyt erikseen mene hehkuttamaan vaikkapa **Minecraft**ia, kun on jo otsikossakin. Tuli sit√§ omaa serveri√§kin py√∂ritetty√§ useampi vuosi. Sitten on viel√§ libraryssa odottamassa aika takuuvarmoja helmi√§ (**Witcher 3** p√§√§llimm√§isin√§), joihin ei vaan oo viel√§ uskaltanu tarttua ajanpuutteen takia.

Tuli j√§tetty√§ useampi helmi pois listalta, koska en voi rehellisesti sanoa niiden suoranaisesti mullistaneen omia peligenrej√§√§n, vaan tuottaneen l√§hinn√§ henkil√∂kohtaista euforiaa *(Legend of Grimrock 1/2, Stardew Valley, Terraria, TIS-100/SpaceChem/..., To the Moon, Banished, Bioshock Infinite, Amnesia*, ... lista jatkuisi ...).",1569888032

Guns are a no go.

This doesn't involve a gun,

However an off duty policeman (I did not know at the time) had had one too many. 

Shouting across the bar, clicking his fingers, yelling 'OI!' to my fellow colleagues 

At this point cut him off, explaining it is because 

A. He had had enough 

B. He should not be speaking to any of the staff like that 

Finally C. We had other people to serve and he was being a nuisance. 

At this point he starts shouting at me demanding another drink, so I nod one of the other bartenders to grab a doorman. When I still refuse. He did something I NEVER thought i would hear a cop do. 

'I have a badge, do you want me to pull my badge out. You better fucking serve me another or we will have your license. ' as accurate as i can remember 

Just after this the bouncer arrives and kicks the bloke out. As this is happening, so only he can hear. I tell him

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;What is a seed?

&gt;a number 3 seed? a number 2 seed?

A seed is the ""rank"" that a team has qualifed to Worlds as. Seed 1 is the winner of a region, seed 2 is the runner-up, etc. So Team Liquid is the first seed from North America, since they won the LCS, G2 the 1st seed from EU since they won the LEC, etc. Seeds are important for the creation of groups for the Group stage, as your seed determines what pool you're in. Being in a higher pool, which you are if you're the 1st seed, generally rewards you with an easier group in the main event. I suggest watching [the Group Draw Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfM79Gyu-9I) which happened a week ago. Here's a version with all the fluff cut out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLjSDRYkRc

&gt;How many teams from the play in Move forward into the 4 groups?
all 12?

Out of the 12-Play-In teams, 4 teams advance. These 4 teams join the 12 teams in the Group stage for a total of 16 teams, which creates 4 groups of 4 teams for the Group stage. The Group stage is considered the ""real"" beginning of Worlds for most audiences.

&gt;Then what exactly is the point of a play in stage?

As you can see in the video, most of the teams in the Play-In stage are from small regions like Oceania, Japan, Brazil and Turkey (these are called minor regions). The Play-In stage was added in 2017 to include all of the official regions in Worlds, without having a seperate tournament. The 3rd seed team from some of the big regions like Europe, Korea and North American also participate in this round, as you can see in the video.

I suggest reading through the Leaguepedia page for [this year's Worlds](https://lol.gamepedia.com/2019_Season_World_Championship) (Leaguepedia is an amazing site in general to learn about the history and understand competitive League of Legends).

I don't know how much you know about the game, but there's also a guide on their page for [viewing League of Legends](https://lol.gamepedia.com/New_To_League/Welcome) if you're interested.

I don't actually jump between how many nazis the far right has, you just can't seem to understand anything I say so you interpret it that way. The far right has a lot of nazis, and those who aren't nazis aren't much better than nazis. Honestly, I don't even think you're consciously twisting my words. I think you somehow actually manage to interpret my words that way. I haven't actually ever called you a nazi. I've called you an enabler, and a defender of nazis, but I've not actually called you a nazi. Because I don't think you are one. You're a fuckhead sure, but you're no nazi. You're just a dumbass.

And it's so odd that you'd bring up how you copy pasted some of my words as a counter to me saying you twist my words. Even though I wrote a damn paragraph on how those copy pasted words meant literally nothing. How interesting. You've gone and cherry picked again.

And wow, your actual point is actually even fucking dumber than how I interpreted it. You are actually right somewhere. I did misinterpret that point. I was wrong, and I admit it. But the way I interpreted it was a hell of a lot better than what you actually believe. Do you really think that each side is just trying to seem like the lesser evil and fighting the bigger monster while simultaneously defending nazis? Of course each side is trying to seem like the lesser evil. But in this case, one of them *actually is* the lesser evil. Pretty much everything is a lesser evil than nazis. Nazis are literally the biggest evil! It doesn't get worse than that! 

And maybe come up with an insult slightly more interesting than calling me a one word synonym to ""dumb.""

"Accordion","t5_2s4ll","This was so incredibly helpful! Thanks so much!  So when I do adjust and place the chordal material in the right hand, should I change the clef (in the right) to bass to avoid amillion ledger lines? Or would I need to compromise and put everything up an octave so it's more practical in treble? Thanks for a clarification.

I find myself reading about the left hand technique more and more and my brain only goes so far until I need to sit down with the thing and play around, alas - no accordion around here for miles. 

This is the accordionist who put out the Call-for-Scores, if you could educate me further - is this a free-bass one?)

"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","standard order is reverse of position, so 5 then 4 then 3 then 2 than 1 (you're the 1 here). HOWEVER, If you are confident about your ability to win on your hero no matter what they play you can pick it any time you like, giving someone else more options/time to counter the enemy. In this specific example, you are playing a carry who isn't that great right now and is certainly vulnerable to losing the game off of a bad lane, therefore it would probably have been a better decision to wait until late to pick. On the other hand, picking a strong but safe carry like a juggernaut or a wraith king first would probably be a fine decision as it is unlikely their picks can change the effectiveness of your hero in the game. Basically, for morph it was probably a bad move, but don't be afraid to first pick good carries, or heros you are going to play no matter what.",1569888036

It could be based purely on their strength.

Plus Mihawk being a free agent is INCREDIBLY dangerous. Any group he decides to join gets a huge boost to their fighting strength, someone on the level of the Yonko and Admirals.

I personally don't see an issue with his unfrozen bounty being higher than  Teach's - for now. Teach is obviously gonna get a higher bounty than Mihawk the next time he does something big, which is incredibly likely to happen soon.",1569888037

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","Historically this is what people have sought from MMORPGs.  Difficulty comes from building relationships and investing the time and resources into your character.  When you require time and personal investment into something, it gives a very rewarding feeling when you get it.

In Everquest there were mobs that required you to camp them for 8-16 hours.  If you died, you would lose EXP, often enough to constitute several hour worth of grinding.  It was genuinely hard to hit max level in Everquest not because of the mechanical difficulty of walking up to mobs, but because of the dedication and patience it required.

Wow classic is like that, but a little easier and more accessible.  It was the natural evolution and mainstreaming of the MMORPG.

At some point it stopped being an MMORPG and started shifting toward the modern gaming trends of fast, repeatable challenges that are more focused on testing mechanical skill / game knowledge much like a game of dota or counterstrike.  This is great in and of itself and I'm not saying this game cannot exist.  But this is not what people want from the traditional MMORPG experience.",1569888037

Also, Will's comment on Dross being a ""baby presence"" can be read two ways depending on what you assume ""effectively"" is describing.

Either ""Dross is effectively a presence. More specifically he is a baby presence."" or ""Dross is effectively a baby presence."" English is an ambiguous mess.

If it's the latter, there's no particular reason to think he follows the normal rules of the Abidan's presences. I don't really even think this one answer is enough to confidently assume he does regardless of how it was meant.",1569888039

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Book:_Reclaiming_Liberalism

Remember David Owen and a few other of the SDP, who considered themselves European style social democrats, decided not to merge with the Liberals because it was felt the merger was for political expediency but actually liberals and socdem are not that compatible.

A mix of party loyalists and people actually attracted to the LibDems by this sort of LibDem try to keep this out of the discussion, along with the coalition, gay rights, Swinson's history, etc. But the answer to your question in the current party under Swinson is because she is continuing the legacy of orange bookers and the socdems in the party are weak.

It also helps them electorally but I don't think Swinson views it as cynical as much as it's actually compatible with her values and ideology.",1569888039

I remember when my husband and I had to go to this marriage retreat before we could get married in the church...and there was a young couple there.

The 12 step program has no basis in any addiction psychology. For some it might work. For most, it does not. I say it is harmful for two reasons. First, the effectiveness is vastly overstated. Second, it's alienating for people that don't want to admit they're powerless. People that don't think that saying a higher power controlling you is acceptable. For those people programs like this can be detrimental. I'm not saying AA is completely ineffective, research has shown that it can be. But court mandates hundreds of thousands of people into AA.

If a judge forced you into medical care and the doctor said you had to admit that you were powerless and to pray for a cure, you'd seek another opinion. This is no different.

I'm saying that there are alternatives and saying the AA is the best and most effective is inaccurate and harmful.

Those two facts alone are enough to say it **can** be detrimental.",1569888041

"GhostRecon","t5_2s91l","You said it yourself. The game is **designed** to be a grindy mess from Day 1. This is MTX first, everything else second, including making the game. It's the severity of the MTXs that is getting to everyone, then you add in the fact the game still feels like a beta and then you remembered you already paid a lot of money + Year 1 Pass (which is meant to pay for extra content of Year 1) and that explains the rage in this subreddit.

The loot system is there purely for artificial grind, it's nothing but extra integers that they can tweak to gain more cash. Add in the unnecessary always online and we have the ability to tweak stuff without updates, equating to people not noticing as much.

I saw this coming a mile away, but did not see how bad it would be.

Loot levels was the first give away.

[Battle tiers was the next thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/d9nhcr/lets_talk_about_the_battle_tier_system_grind/)

[Ubisoft sending me Ghost Coins to market was the next](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/da12ae/ah_shithere_we_go_again/)

It all was obvious. Only until now can we see how high they are doing it.

They are capable of fixing it easily as they are on an always online (you can patch too anyways)

\- Make any paid cosmetic within Year 1, available for people with Year 1 Pass.

\- Decrease the prices of the MXTs

\- Remove any P2W MXTs

\- Allow non Y1 Pass Owners to earn the stuff.

"godot","t5_2znmk","I recently ran into this problem myself. Admittedly, I don't fully understand why the KinematicBody2D node has this issue. If I recall some brief research I did correctly, I think it has something to do with movement functions setting the scale back to a positive number. When I was playing with the scale of my KinematicBody2D it was flipping all over the place while the node was moving around in game lol. 

However, I did find a solution that works for me. My only dissatisfaction with it, is that, from a coding or organization stand point, it feels like a sloppy hack. Anyway, I basically created a Node2D under my KinematicBody2D and called it ""Flippable"". Any child node on KinematicBody2D I want to flip by setting the scale to -1 (such as Sprites, Area2Ds, CollisionShape2Ds, etc), I put under Flippable. That way in my code, I only have to change the scale of my Flippable node.

I don‚Äôt know what japanese website you will use to buy components, maybe you‚Äôre going to a physical store? Nvm that. I‚Äôm using pcpartpicker from us, so you should look up and adjust to the price in your local store

This build should do 1080p gaming nicely, at medium settings it can reach a nice 100+ fps in esports title and 60+ fps on single player titles

Cpu : ryzen 5 2600, a really nice cpu for the price. It‚Äôs not worth it to get the 2600x considering the price to performance difference. Moreover, you can catchup to 2600x in performance by overclocking the cpu. You should be able to overclock it to 4 Ghz on all core using the stock wraith cooler. But stock speed is fine if you don‚Äôt want to oc.

Motherboard : B450 motherboard that has wifi and bluetooth capabilites, m.2 slot, and 4 ram slots. It‚Äôs also really cheap

Ram : 16gb of fast ram. Will really boost ryzen‚Äôs speed

Storage : 256gb of nvme tlc ssd (a really good one), and 1tb hdd

Gpu : RX 580, a price to performance champion from amd, especially for 1080p gaming

Case : a nice small microatx case from coolermaster. Looks really sleek, which I like

Psu : 550w bronze from corsair, it has 5yr warranty as well

Monitor : msi optix 1080p 144Hz VA panel. It‚Äôs really good, if you don‚Äôt mind the 23.6‚Äù size. I‚Äôm also using a 23‚Äù monitor at home, and I‚Äôm having a good time. Some people don‚Äôt like the smaller screen and would like to play on 27‚Äù, but I think it‚Äôs too big for 1080p (you can see the pixels)",1569888044

"shittyaquariums","t5_3be2l","you're correct, but sometimes certain bettas require tanks between **9.5 liters** and **18.9 liters**, due to spinal issues, sbd, and some other problems that can cause it. this betta doesn't seem to have issues that would cause that, but they should be okay in a 3.5 gallon. i have a blind betta in the same tank, but most of my bettas are pretty small. for giant bettas (probably over **7.6 centimeters**), they need a minimum of **37.9 liters**, for smaller bettas, the absolute bare minimum is **9.5 liters**, i'm not attacking you or anything, this is just what i believe to be true. i prefer for bettas to be in tanks 5+ gallons. i only have a betta in a 3.5 because hes blind, but he's going to upgrade soon still. all my other bettas are in larger tanks tho.

"learn_arabic","t5_2v4vi","ŸáŸà ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© would be ""he/it is the problem,"" and ""he"" is not declineable.


But some other posts made a good point: if you've made a reference to a masculine noun immediately beforehand (say, I dunno, a book:

&gt;ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®...! Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ŸáŸà ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© 

you've identified a specific masculine noun as a referent. 


But ""hungry"" is an adjective, so that can't fill the spot of referent for ""this."" Unless you have identified a specific masculine noun, you're really just pointing at the situation in general and saying ""this [problem] is the problem."" So, in that case, ""this"" is assumed to be referring to the predicate, ""the problem,"" and declined according to it.",1569888045

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

"AncestryDNA","t5_3lh3c","The ethnicity estimates are estimates. They are somewhat accurate, but not anywhere near 100% accurate. Broadly speaking they are more accurate on the continental level (ie Europe, East Asia, Africa, etc.) than on the more local regional level.

Additionally, DNA is not inherited in perfectly proportional quanta. If you have a great-grandmother who is 100% African, for example, you may expect to be 12.5% African. However, in reality you could have inherited more or less DNA from that particular ancestor giving you a large range from perhaps as low as 5% to nearly 20%.

My solution  assumes you're all-in with Apple: iPhone and Mac. If you're on Windows, this probably doesn't apply.

* Apple's cloud keeps photos synced between iOS and MacOS devices, so...
* Forget about syncing from the iPhone. Let it spin its wheels. It's hopeless.
* Be sure that the setting to sync photos from your Mac is turned on. In my **Google Backup and Sync**, the option to sync photos wasn't on. Maybe it was turned off in a previous update. I checkmarked ""Upload newly added photos and video to Google Photos"" under ""Google Photos"" and now my Google Photos library is up to date again.

Good luck!

And yes, I have my photo library in two clouds, Apple and Google. It's important enough to me to keep them both up to date. Previous photo databases from other companies that I  trusted have let me down, by, like, going out of business. So I keep these both as insurance.",1569888045

Is this... an action?  Bonus action?  When and how do I do this?

How long do the conditions last for?  Can the target repeat the save?  Eventually, I'm going to be able to do this quite a bit, is there an upper limit on the number of creatures that I can have, say, feared at the same time?

A nit pick:  ""Fear"" is not the condition.  *Frightened* is the condition.   Don't rely on the reader ""knowing what you mean"" - it's good practice to use the correct terms and mechanics from the start to avoid confusion.

""Sleep"" is not a condition, but unconscious would be too strong.  Sleep is a *spell*, but that's not something you can shortcut like this.

**Infection** The way you have this worded is strange  - it implies that ""infection"" is a separate feature from the rest of the conditions. Which... it really sort of is.  It shouldn't be a part of this feature - since the class so heavily relies on it, it really should be the first thing in the feature block. 

TBH, the entire ""Medicial charges"" feature is really... awkwardly explained.

&gt;Cleanse

I'm not sure how this feature is supposed to work.

What is ""the appropriate plague doctor levels""?  I've already got the slots to cast the first two, and the first level I gain access to 5th level slots is 9th level.  The correct way to do this is to list the level that I gain each spell.

You say ""or"".  Is it that I can use this feature once per long rest, and I can select one spell to cast?  Or that I can cast each spell one time?

So, when I cast cure wounds this way, does it *always* max out the roll?  If so, why are you bothering with Cure Wounds, or listing a d8.  ""Starting at 5th level, you can restore 8+INT mod in HP as an action once per long rest.""  But later on, I'm restoring.... 10-15 d8???  That's a LOT of hit points?

Once I hit 15th level, this feature automatically becomes a 10-minute cast time, no other choice?  Is that supposed to be 10 minute *minus* my INT modifier?  Why?

This is just such a weird feature.

&gt;Creeping shadow

How long would this last if they don't make their save?  There should be a max duration.

&gt;Plague warden

&gt;Greater resilliance

""They gain full immunity by 10th level""

While I appreciate your attempts at making this sound nice, please watch how fluffy you get your descriptions.  ""At 10th level, you become immune to these effects"" is a more correct wording.  Phrasing *is* important.

I'm including it here because this is one of the more... annoying examples, but it's persistent throughout the class.  There *are* standard ways of phrasing mechanics, standard terminology, etc.  Please - apply your creativity to the class, not your descriptions.  

&gt;Infectious casting

How long does this condition last?

*any time* you inflict something with a duration on someone, you need to list that duration.  

&gt;Grave infection


This mechanic - a little stacking pile of bonuses - has been all but removed from 5e and it's not a good idea to bring it back in.  5e is about simplicity and getting rid of ""mathyness"" - this is a step backwards, because now I have some new tiny modifier that I have to track.  

&gt;Carrier

Duration.

""Non-hostile"" - the mechanic is ""willing"", not non-hostile.

Likewise, ""hostile"" is not necessary.  ""If the carrier makes an attack against a creature, or is attacked..."" 

&gt;Scalding abrasion

Again, the Little Stacking Modifier.  

&gt;Cloak of fog

Little Pile of Modifiers problem...

How many times can I do this?  Right now, it's unlimited, meaning it's infinite healing.  

Even if you limit it, I warn you of the Healing Spirit problem.

This feature is a critical example of why phrasing is *so important*.

""If a friendly creature comes in range"" - you have not limited this to how often the effect can trigger.  Theoretically, I could use *my entire movement* to step in and out of your range, healing me for 6d6 HP each time I re-enter the fog.    I am sure that's not what you meant, but because you neglected things like ""For the first time on a turn"", that's how it *works*.

I'm not harping on phrasing because I like to nag.  I'm harping because *bad mechanical phrasing leads to broken mechanics*.

&gt;Blood Cleanser

&gt;Deadly smudging

Does it take an action to bathe my weapon in smoke?  Bonus action?  Is it an effect I do when I hit?  How long does the smudging last?

&gt;Blood Sample

Bounded accuracy?  What bounded accuracy?

It's once per long rest, but *still*.  This is almost a guaranteed hit.

&gt;Abrasive Smoke

So, I can turn my uses of Abrasive Smoke into uses of Deadly Smudging?

&gt;extraction from the trapped

Little Stacking Pile of Bonuses.

&gt;Medicinal Mastery

So, you want to look at the phrasing for ""hold Person"" to see the proper way to do this.

Also, considering how easy it is to infect people, this is kind of nuts.

&gt;Spells

**Miasma** 

For a first level spell, this save should be repeatable.

**Vermintide**

This is an *instant* duration spell with an ongoing effect.  

**Deadly pathogen**

This is an *instant* duration spell with an ongoing effect.  

**Maddening haze**

This is a weird mechanic.  Seriously.  I have to be concentrating on a spell to use a spell.  



Overall:

It's... interesting.  But there's some issues.

You have a problem with missing mechanics, namely durations.  And, overall, your mechanical descriptions are overly fluffy, which as I've pointed out, can lead to some confusing and broken interactions.  Also, the Little Stacking Modifiers really need to go - they're at odds with some of 5e's design philosophies.  Overall - this feels more like a 3rd edition class than a 5th, and I don't think that's a good thing.  It's complicated and mathy and requires a lot of tracking.  

I'm not seeing a huge difference between the subclasses.  Do I want to infect with spells, or do I want to infect with a weapon?  Either way, it's just about infecting as many people as possible.

This guy is a full-caster, but there's very little interaction between his class features and his spells, and because the ""Medicinal charges"" mechanic gets up to *so many* uses, the charges are taking the place of what *should* be spellcasting - like healing.

There's also weird things like Cleanse.  I don't have Cure Wounds on my spell list, but that's fine, because I have a cure-like ability and then I get to cast it once with Cleanse.  Why... not just put it on the spell list, or give me certain spells at certain levels?

It's *different* for no reason than to be *different* and that makes it *complicated*.",1569888047

That same societal expectation that men/women stick to masculinity/femininity can extend to transgender people, especially in the eyes of those that don't accept trans-ness. 

To vastly oversimplify, a 'man in a dress' is a larger taboo than a 'woman in pants', because cis-women can indeed wear pants already as that is barely seen as defying femininity if at all these days.",1569888047

I don‚Äôt want you to think I‚Äôm trying to convince you one way or another or that I‚Äôm talking down to you because I‚Äôm not. This country is both of ours and we are both just trying to do wha we think is best and honestly the most effective way to do that is that we both understand the other‚Äôs view because when these discussions turn into ugly and hateful arguments no one benefits at all so please hear me out and I am willing to hear you out and maybe we ca both learn a little.

My best argument to your point is that Walmart, J.P. Morgan, Home Depot and the others on your list are in fact taxpayers. They pay taxes thus they are taxpayers, they may not be Joe- accountant making $60k/yr or a teacher making $50k/yr but they are taxpayers and in a lot of cases they started in small towns and had only one shop or a couple of burger stands but the fact that they were successful shouldn‚Äôt bring punishment in the form of having to support the misguided youth. We have social issues in this country and if a company would like to stand up and face the issues that they are passionate about they should be applauded but they should not be obligated to do so. A tax is a tax and the government has a right to set tax rates and enforce them but I don‚Äôt believe we should be using that money to forgive personal loans. Why don‚Äôt they increase taxes on large corporations to pay for the Mercedes that I bought that I can‚Äôt afford or the mansion I bought on a minimum wage income? The fact of the matter comes down to the core of why socialism/communism will never work, I did not go to college but I worked very hard to have the things that I have, if the government is going to make everyone an equal than why should I work hard? Socialism/communism always comes to a head when the working class realizes they are working so that the majority of the population can live exactly the same. Why work hard? Why try to start a business? Why invent something? If there is no benefit for being more responsible or more dedicated than the next guy no one will push the envelope and the people who pushed the envelope are the people who now are billionaires employing thousands of other people who can better themselves simply by dedicating themselves to do better because there is the idea that if you are better than the other guy you will make more money and that drives people.

Then add-on the fact that 75% of my patients think its a good idea (despite me telling them otherwise) to store the individual strips outside of the little bottle.

I'm not going to even get into the ""My meter is broken I need a new one and no I'm not going to pay a dime for it"" when the 'low battery' icon is blinking when they put a strip in.",1569888048

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","Hi, HAM radio operator here!

(Long wall of text here, no good way of summarizing it into a TL;DR, so if you can‚Äôt be bothered to read it, don‚Äôt.)
((I‚Äôm just assuming you‚Äôre in the US, though much of this information likely applies to other countries as well.))

I should also clarify a bit of jargon since I‚Äôve found myself using it as I‚Äôve been writing this out. An amateur radio ‚Äústation‚Äù isn‚Äôt a station in the same way as the radio stations you listen to in your car. Those are broadcast stations and are usually transmitting at very, very high powers around the clock or nearly so and are providing some kind of service, usually entertainment or news and funded by advertising or donations. An amateur radio ‚Äústation‚Äù is a single individual and is for personal, non-commercial use to exchange remarks of a personal nature. They are supposed to use as little power as necessary to make their desired ‚Äúcontact‚Äù and I believe the US‚Äôs power limit is 1.5 kilowatts. A ‚Äúcontact‚Äù is an exchange of some level of information, from as basic as callsigns and locations, to as much as a several hour long conversation on whatever (this is known as rag-chewing).

I don‚Äôt suspect it is possible he or his equipment (excluding a serious malfunction) is the cause given that it sounds like the issue is constant, which any conventional Amateur (aka HAM) radio station won‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be operating perfectly continuously. There should be interruptions in the interference when they stop transmitting to hear the other person. The more likely case is your just in a cell phone dead zone. I would also try the WiFi channel thing mentioned in other comments, as that could be a likely cause of issues.

If the issue isn‚Äôt actually constant, then it is more likely to be interference from his station. 

It‚Äôs already been mentioned in other comments, but I‚Äôll repeat it. Go over when it seems the interference is worst and ask him if he‚Äôs currently operating and if so say you have reason to suspect his equipment is causing interference with your stuff. It may also help to prepare a short list of times when it seemed to be the worst. Most hams are happy to help, but they are also required to do so as part of their license, which I should add is a federally issued license. Many hams are generally nice people and will be very willing to help investigate and remedy any interference issues, though there are a few old grumpy coots. 

Stealth edit to add: Most hams want to keep friendly relations with their neighbors and will help until the issues are solved or it is clearly something out of their control and unfixable.

If it *is* continuously transmitting, is not a malfunction, and they aren‚Äôt willing to help reduce interference (or it seems they are making very minimal effort to make you go away), the more likely case is it could be a ‚Äúpirate‚Äù station and should be reported to the FCC (or equivalent government body if outside US) for investigation. There are a few other possibilities, but this is the most likely case if they are not actually a licensed HAM.",1569888049

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","Since you think it‚Äôs *relatively* normal, I‚Äôm sharing my what you think is my *relatively* normal insanity.

Buddha, Socrates &amp; Confucius

Suddenly remembered who they were two millennia ago while watching Greta Thunberg‚Äôs speech at the UN Climate Summit in September.  It had been in the middle of class.  When her speech ended, Socrates started screaming in Ancient Greek though at that time, nobody knew he was screaming in Ancient Greek.

It took half a dozen of his classmates to wrestle-carry him out of the room.  No one noticed the lone student who remained in his seat, staring blankly at nothing until he remembered to breath.  After minutes, SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama lurched up to go after them.  Mind racing over what to do next.  For he knew with utmost certainty that that was Socrates and that there was another one, also from ancient times, whom he ran into on the way to the clinic.

‚ÄúYou are the Buddha?‚Äù  Confucius was skeptical.  Buddha didn‚Äôt mind for his current incarnation was so fat that he did not feel like himself at all.

‚ÄúYes, I am him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the very noisy one is Socrates?‚Äù

He nodded.  Confucius‚Äô frown deepened as they headed to the clinic, whose entrance was crowded with onlookers.  Socrates had stopped screaming in Ancient Greek.

‚ÄúI am fine.  It was just a panic attack because climate change.  You know, climate change.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee, I told you we shouldn‚Äôt be scaring the students about climate change,‚Äù they heard one of their teachers say.  The other rebuked, ‚ÄúIt would be irresponsible of us as teachers to not inform them about climate change.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm letting you handle the next one who freaks out over climate change.‚Äù

Buddha was about to suggest that they return when the crowd was gone, but Socrates spotted them and he loudly told the nurse, ‚ÄúCould you please let my friends Sydd and Qui in and tell the others to leave?‚Äù

Eyes turned to the duo, and the crowd erupted into more chatter, for the top student of their year had clearly lost his mind.  The trio were not friends.  Far from it.  Not only had he bullied the former over his weight but he and Qui did not see eye to eye at all.

Present memories melded with past lives.  Thru his own bewilderment, Buddha could see that Confucius was angry and about to leave.

The nurse intervened.  Shooing the crowd away while telling them and their teacher to stay.  ‚ÄúPlease play along to help keep him keep calm,‚Äù they were whispered to as they were ushered into the clinic.

Socrates beamed at them and loudly thanked the nurse, who patted his brow and took their teacher into her office for a private chat.  All three waited for her door to close.

S:  Would it be too much to ask that you two don‚Äôt blame my past life for my present life‚Äôs past behavior?  Christ, this is confusing.

C:  ‚Ä¶ It would be a trial, but I think I can manage it better than a certain someone who started screaming when he remembered his past life.

S:  To be fair, I had just been executed.

C:  Excuses.

B:  Are you certain you feel better now, Socrates?

S:  Yes!  Ah, of course the Buddha would be the nice one and Kung Fu here would be the mean one.

C:  Sock, I will call you Sock.

S:  I think bantering is generally a good sign in a relationship.

C:  Generally doesn‚Äôt mean always.

S:  Oh, you‚Äôre witty.  I like witty.

Confucius crosses his arms and informs Buddha, ‚ÄúI do not like him.‚Äù

B:  Please be patient.  He had just been executed.

S:  Exactly.  Died by poison, I did.

C: ... Sydd?

B:  It isn‚Äôt really important, Qui.

S:  What isn‚Äôt really important?

Confucious thumb-gestures at Buddha.  ‚ÄúHe also died by poisoning.  Much more slowly and far more painfully, I may add.‚Äù

B:  It isn‚Äôt- (And how did you die?)

While Buddha dwelled on how suffering came in many many forms, the nurse‚Äôs door opened to thankfully interrupt a competition on whose death two millennia ago was more painful.",1569888051

When this shit first happened i saw vape stores sell 60mls for like 50$ but nobody bought them and it quickly changed to DIY stores, they basically sell flavorings, nicotine and PG/VG so you basically mix them up yourself and honestly i miss premade liquid, i cant be asked making it myself.

Also Blackmarket on it is pretty big and people mix the juice themselves and sell on facebook.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I'm seeing this less about the tattoo and more about the gesture. And your words. In the first para you say that she has ""decided that she only goes by female pronouns now"". It's such a small thing but it can be read as very dismissive. You call her daughter but hint at difficulties in the past concerning this. You did say you're learning so that's all good and good but it might be that Athena remembers the difficult stuff and sees the tattoo as an affirmation that you might not accept her as her. Pronouns are extrememly important in the trans community and seeing her deadname in your tattoo might make her feel pretty bad. 

Getting the tattoo changed would be expensive and absolutely a reason to not go forwards with this but this is so much more important to Athena than you might realise. This sounds like a really difficult situation and the most obvious solution is not as doable because of expense but there might be a few good alternatives out there, maybe a few temporary ones to cover while you organise a more permanent one.   


Very very gentle YTA because I do understand that you're learning about all this new stuff and tattoos are expensive but you need to research how offensive deadnaming can be in the trans community. Pronouns and chosen names are *that* important in the trans community.

"WeirdWings","t5_35fvr","It actually wasn't so much Italian production (though that certainly didn't help), the designs were just straight up costly, which was the real reason the G.56 never made production. 

It was actually the Germans who were mainly interested in the G.56. Kurt Tank was a huge admirer of the G.55 and wanted to produce a DB 603 powered version in Germany, where production was more efficient (and of course where Focke Wulf could profit from it), but even in Germany, it was going to take nearly twice the man hours to produce each G.55/56 as it was taking to produce a Bf 109 at that point. 

Instead, it was decided that the Ta 152 ‚Äî which could be produced on the same assembly lines as the Fw 190 with minimal change ‚Äî would make a more economical host for the DB 603. The G.56 had always been a German project, so when their interest in the project died, the project essentially did as well. Not that it made much difference in the end, as production of these engines had barely started by the end of the war. 

Reggiane also produced a prototype DB 603 powered Re.2006 which likely would have been an excellent aircraft, but as the Re.2005 was even more complex to produce (as well as noticeably smaller and therefore harder to fir the huge engine into), there was little German interest in the design, and the single prototype never received an engine.",1569888054

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly there's been so many pieces of the puzzle that I can't convincingly explain to you why I've come to think the way I have. But, the way that I think is that there are positive and negative sensations, or rather pleasure and pain. Pleasure and pain exist to motivate behaviour which has been evolutionarily advantageous. Our goal is to pursue what will bring us the most pleasure --doing otherwise would be to act against our interests--, and we use reason to figure out what path to take. Feelings are what the subconscious seems to think is the best course of action to take, and are effectively a shorthand for reason; rather than having to consciously weigh up all the options all the time, feelings act as a streamlined representation of the logic, if that makes any sense. But feelings aren't necessarily rational. Fearing dogs because you were bitten by one as a child has logical roots, but it's persistence is irrational, and it can be overcome through adopting behaviour seen in CBT. If one isn't aware that one's feelings aren't optimal for their own lifelong pleasure then counselling and directed logical introspection can serve to point out the glaring faults in the logic, and then cbt-like behaviour can be employed to break the feelings down and rebuild more effective ones.

Not everybody risks throwing away their future like I did just for the sake of trying to be completely right about what to do with their life. Wasting precious time analysing what the optimal path to take is, when you might not even be able to pursue that path because of your academic history, isn't a wise thing to do. What people do is make a series of intuitive guesses about what's best, and spend their life working out what actions they can make given their history that will serve to make them happier. They could be right, they could be wrong, but people generally learn and grow happier in the long run nonetheless. 

Psychological issues seem to be perceived by many to be barriers that serve to limit your choices in life, but I don't feel that I've had sufficient reason to believe that in my case, and instead have opted to view them as hurdles for me to overcome on a path to optimal happiness -- likely because these issues were so immensely limiting that trying to live with them taken as unchangeable was too miserable for me to believe.

For people like us I just recommend counselling, introspection, studying psychology and importantly experimentation. Do different things, work out what you feel, work out why you feel it, and if it's not in your interest then disregard them, if they are in your interest then leave them be and let them take root in your brain. I think that pursuing a career which is highly personal and revolves around directly helping others is a huge potential source of happiness; I think that's what motivates many doctors to be as determined as they are, and it's what motivates me to now pursue a career in counselling psychology. Perhaps after realising the value of psychology you'll pursue a similar route, or perhaps there's something else that you think is more meaningful in your life that you're satisfied settling with, like architecture. Regardless, I hope something in this novel was helpful for you and I wish you all the best :)",1569888055

* (**Rule #1**) All posts must be wholesome memes.    
We're not saying this is **un**wholesome! Just that sub's focus is *uplifting*, OR nicing-up existing rude memes. There are already great subs for cute (/r/aww, /r/eyebleach, /r/rarepuppers), things that make us smile (/r/MadeMeSmile, /r/HumansBeingBros, /r/AnimalsBeingBros), or that give us the feels (/r/WholesomeFeels or /r/baww). This might also fit better in another sub in the Wholesome Network (see sidebar).  It's not a ""no"" - it's a ""not the best fit here,"" and another sub will be better.

We appreciate you thinking of us very much! For more on our rules, please check out our [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/about/sidebar).

perhaps love of villains/monstrosity comes from a feeling of being in control?  in real life, we are very rarely in control of 'real' monsters.  or maybe it's identifying with the bad guy?  that happens to me sometimes, when i find sympathy for a monster.",1569888056

But Bungie is ultimately making the right move. With the amount of content they have on offer, Bungie isn‚Äôt selling a game anymore - they are selling a *hobby*. If they cannot hook you into buying more of their stuff, then they are losing money. Giving the base game away for free solves that problem by ensuring them a steady stream of Destiny converts, whom they can then sell cosmetics and DLC to. It‚Äôs very smart.",1569888056

But comments like Allen is at fault for being tackled and forced down head and shoulders first is fault enough to excuse the helmet to helmet contact. The defender has to avoid contact with the helmet.

I mean ""Josh Allen should have gotten the flag""... really now?

You are more likely to lose weight if you get full, feel satisfied, and know that there's some more satisfying food coming along pretty soon. Part of the magic of keto (especially for women) is to learn what hunger feels like, to eat a lot of protein and a lot of fat when you're hungry, and then to experience fullness.

My current boys are not used to running on a wheel, but I was wondering if they might use it if I got a big one and put it in their cage.

Has anyone added a wheel to their rats who were not used to it, and they liked it? Or do they have to learn about wheels as babies to want to use it? 

My only previous experience with wheels was a long time ago one of my female rats ran on a wheel pretty much 24/7, BUT it was definitely too small for her and her tail did curl somewhat (despite folks saying that wheels don't give them wheel-tail!). Then years later I added a 12"" Silent Spinner wheel to my adult male rats' cage, but now I understand that 12"" is still too small for bucks, so that could be why they never used it.

I worked an office job in a township office right after college. My triggers are gum chewing, distant conversations, tapping, clashing noises etc. Our office building had no windows for circulation and everyone listened to their own music at their own desks. The (wonderfully kind and nurturing) woman who sat across from me smacked away at her yoghurt for over an hour and then picked her teeth for a while after. My supervisor always chewed her gum cheerfully. 

It was a nightmare. 

But I needed the job and I genuinely liked the people that worked there. So every time I would hear or see a trigger, and wanted to cry or slam my desk.... I would think about all the good things that human does (whether it‚Äôs true or not). I find that feeling compassion whether warranted or not, helps take violent thoughts and deep rage away.... AND keep breathing. If it gets to a point that you feel crushed by your triggers, I think it‚Äôs totally acceptable to take a step outside. If people can take smoke breaks, we can take ear breaks.

&gt; Do you feel that RMS was wrong to defend Minsky?

I mean, he defended him by (obliquely) implying ""it's not unethical if she presented as willing"". Not ""she presented as willing and he refused"". Which is a pretty vile defense, again, IMHO. 

&gt; What should Minsky have done? Was it clear enough that Giuffre was a sex slave that he should have reported it to the police?

There are other things besides reporting it to the police. I'm not going to go into the full ethical depth of what he should have done (besides turn her down), but it seems like *something* rather than nothing at all. YMMV.",1569888060

This could be your bargaining chip.

Call the pricks tomorrow and tell them you will report them to DVLA if they don't take the car back. 

If they are traders and sell cars to the public then you are entitled to return the car.

Call https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/buying-or-repairing-a-car/buying-a-used-car/

Did he only give you V5C/2 slip? He might have filled the form on your behaf and with your address and posted to DVLA. In which case you will receive the document in your name in 2 weeks.

In the case of Lumen, Dexter is arguing with himself what to do with her. The true Harry would tell him to help the girl, but mental Harry who also has some of Dexter's darker, more defensive traits, thinks he would be better off killing her. This happens a few other times over the course of the series where Dexter has to argue with himself over if killing a person. Sometimes its more convient, but also more dangerous and morally corrupt to do so.

Mental Harry isn't really Harry. At times, he's what Dexter thinks Harry would think. Other times, he's someone to represent Dexter's inner darkness, and in others he's Dexter patting himself on the back.",1569888064

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I understand why both people got really emotional. Greta cares about her future and the future of everyone, including the planet, and she feels like others are ruining it.

Kavanaugh feels like the accusations made against him are false, and are being used to ruin his future (not just a huge promotion, but there is no way he would have been able to keep his job as a judge if he didn't get the SCOTUS position, effectively ruining his life as well as his families), and his ability to serve his country.

Think about it this way. You are up for a huge promotion. But now someone is very publicly trying to metoo you, from actions that happened decades ago. You feel that their recollections are flawed. And they are making a lot of money by doing this (Ford and a few others had some gofundmes going on that raised a handsome amount of money). You feel like they are just trying to be vindictive and are trying to ruin your ability to make money and your future, on what you feel like are false accusation. Are you going to get emotional? It would be very surprising that you would not be.

One case, the system is going to negatively effect everyone, not due to maliciousness, but do to short sideishness and greed, and isn't targeting you in particular. The other case *is* malicious, targeting you in particular, and is the focus, not a side effect.

I understand why both people got emotional. I find it telling that you seem to only give one a pass (unless I am misinterpreting your viewpoint on this)

But I do feel like you are trying to get away from the main point. Emotional outbursts rarely, if ever, work on converting people. I don't see people dismissing what Greta had to say just because she got emotional. I see people dismissing her because they seem to feel like she is being used by people who are passing an agenda they don't agree with (which I don't agree with, mind you). I will say this, I do agree with her point that we need to stop polluting the Earth yesterday. but I was turned off by her purely emotional speech. I like facts, not emotions. Emotion displays are damn near always intentionally used to manipulate people one way, and normally is used when you don't have facts to back you up (key word *NORMALLY*).",1569888065

&gt; potenziamento della capacit√† nucleare globale, agevolando la transizione dal carbone al gas naturale, investendo sull‚Äôidrogeno, catturando la CO2 al momento dell‚Äôemissione o direttamente in atmosfera, riprogettando le reti di trasmissione e distribuzione, aumentando la capacit√† di assorbimento della biosfera, esplorando le opportunit√† che offrono l‚Äôingegneria climatica e la geoingegneria

Queste soluzioni sono in gran parte impraticabili: 

- costose e lente (nucleare)
- producono gas serra (gas naturale)
- immature e costose (idrogeno e carbon capture)
- insufficienti (aumento della capacit√† di bio-assorbimento, che in ogni caso sta declinando)
- pericolose (ingegneria climatica)

Una transizione relativamente indolore sarebbe stata possibile se avessimo iniziato trent'anni fa. Pensare di poter risolvere l'emergenza climatica oggi senza scomodare la classe media √® pateticamente ingenuo.

L'alternativa √® un aumento di temperature globali di 4-6¬∞C per fine secolo, a significare la fine della civilizzazione umana.",1569888068

You have to cross a threshold using the only lever of public accountability that we have at the moment (the very-imperfect state) to cross that line of structural reformation so that artificially imposed oxymoron dissolves. Single-payer healthcare is by definition _less_ bureaucratic and is a pretty clear example of how what you appear to be suggesting is only true within a framework where you try to appease both private and public interest. In other words, half-measures create way more problems than they solve; the ACA is a good example such a half-measure (yay, no more ""pre-existing conditions"" nonsense | boo, mandate that didn't function correctly and made premiums rise).

Remember background checks and mock mentors cost money, so it is not like there is zero cost for an unsuccessful applicant.

Personal referrals are far more likely to be successful and cut out for this job, rather than some random person who happens to click on a Teacher Nancy video.

Leveraging stock for loans only works if you can pay with the loan, which is an in kind sale if exercised.

I don't want billionaires to pay nothing in taxes. I want them to pay taxes on consumption or death.

Why do you want multi millionaires to be incentivised to spend instead of reinvest?  If wealth above a certain limit becomes difficult to make gains on, it becomes rational to blow it wastefully on vanity projects and excess consumption.  It is the excess consumption that is the scourge of the rich.

You point out correctly that wealth taxes in the form of property taxes exist but are not progressive.  I would like to make it so.  Ownership of property is significantly more exclusionary than anything else.  I would tax that before the hypothetical value of a stock.",1569888069

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","If you have the aptitude, you'd probably get the best experience out of being part of a guild. Guilds are diverse groups of badasses, geniuses, bellboys, and more! 

Meet fantastic people from across the world, those who have killed gods, been blessed with incredible strength, exotic species and unique weapon masters. If you're not a fighter or a trainee, you might be introduced to the PR/accounting side of guild management. Perhaps you will make advertisements, keep track of tabs, hell, maybe you'll be lucky enough to be the assistant manager, keeping all the badass fighting men in line. 

It's not exactly a unique concept, however the people you meet will certainly make up for that. Guilds frequently contain fallen gods, demigods, angels, monsters, and more. Many people you wouldnt have met living in your home town. 

You could also get magical training at a guild, which isnt offered in many places. Magic itself is volatile and the ability to weaponize it can be given to others through basically shooting 20ccs of magic black tar heroin into your veins. You might experienced some FUCKED mutations though. Anyways, there's no such thing as spells in this universe, instead there's different levels of magic. 

For example, if you're a pyromancer, there's no different spell for fireball and flamethrower; a fireball is simply a flamethrower that was cut short. Making your fire explode? That's just putting a little more MMPH into it. That being said, magic is such an abstract feeling and concept that its impossible to formally train someone with it. Instead guilds that have talented magicians and magic trainees will just tell them to 'go off I guess', and pray the kid doesnt blow his head off, or worse, blow the magician's head off.",1569888070

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","I think others have pointed out well enough that someone is attacking you personally. Here are a few suggestions I have for you.

1. Create a brand new email address. Set it up with 2-factor authentication, preferably one that doesn't use text messaging. Either a time based phone app or a physical security key. This account is the most important one to keep secure because if someone gets into your email, they can reset almost any password using the ""Forgot my password"" link on most websites.

2. Get a new phone number and SIM card. If they have gotten through your 2FA on your current accounts, they likely have access to your phone's text messages. 

3. Call both the company hosting your email and the phone company and tell them that your identity has been compromised and that they should add extra layers of security to verifying your identity in the future. 

4. Now, set all of your other accounts recovery and 2FA to the new email address and phone number. Avoid using text message 2FA if possible, but if it's the only form of 2FA then use it. Having text message 2FA is better than no 2FA, but its sort of the weakest form of it. 

5. Finally, get a password manager and reset all of your accounts to random passwords that are different from any other website or service. The password manager will make it so you don't have to remember all of these new passwords, and it will prevent one website from compromising another. 

After this is all done, make sure your phone is kept with you, and has a passcode/PIN on it. Don't lend your phone to anyone else, even people you trust, like family. Most identity theft is committed by people close to the victim.",1569888071

Banana milkshakes because me and my bestie used to go for walks to the ice cream shop in the dead of winter and get banana milkshakes together. 

I like the seafood because it's kind of a family thing. We would go fishing and also buy bushels of crabs and cook them in beer and have a feast basically.

And I love souvlaki. a mix if great meat with veggies and awesome seasonings.

and Steaks, well.. I just like them. giggling

You know how people who go to Harvard say they ""go to college in Boston"" because they don't want people to hold them on a pedestal? Well yeah it's kind of the same with me using Arch. Instead of telling people I use Arch I tell them I use Linux (even though I specifically use Arch) and I'll only tell them that I use Arch if they ask.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","This is something I think about a lot and don't really have a good answer.  I don't really think poly is part of the LGBTQ community, but there are definitely people out there who see polyamory as intrinsic to who they are, in the same way someone would speak about their sexuality.  There are also people who see it more as a lifestyle choice or preference.  I think both identities (and everything in between) are great and the older I get the less I think something being ""intrinsic"" should be an argument for why anyone should accept it. Everyone should choose the life they want and the type of love(s) they want, always, as long as that love is consensual and supportive.  And that identity and choice of love should also be allowed to change and shift throughout one's life.

I think discrimination isn't the same as for the LGBTQ community, particularly because many poly couples and singles can easily pass as hetero and mono if they want to, but it does exist to some degree.  Poly people can meet with intense judgement and negative feelings when coming out to family (and many don't for just this reason) and friends to a lesser degree.  Especially in a religious context, and for older generations raised on the ideal of the nuclear family, the idea of more than one love or being married and still seeking new partners just breaks people's brains.  It hurts and it's isolating and I don't think that's just people looking for an excuse to claim they are being marginalized.",1569888074

On the first night, after lights out, the guy is laying in his bed, nervous and wide awake. From the silence, an  unexpected voice rings out down the cell block:

&gt;53!

He hears chuckles from cells around the block. Soon, another voice rings out:

&gt;96!

The laughter, louder this time, comes from every cell.

&gt;101!

This time the prison erupts with guffaws, hoots, and chortles. Guys are gasping for breath everywhere.

The young guy is confused and asks his cell mate to explain what is going on. The guy on the bunk below says ""We've all been in here so long, we've memorized and numbered the jokes. Now we just say the numbers, and everyone laughs.""

The new guy wants to fit in, so he decided to give it a try. After the cell block has quieted down, he shouts out:

&gt;71!

Nothing happens. He tries again:

&gt;19!

Nobody responds. Once more desperate try:

&gt;42!?

Silence. Dead air. Absolutely no laughter. Bewildered, the young guy again asks his cell mate to explain.

"thesims","t5_2rbdu","If you enjoy 3, stay with 3. No one needs to switch if they don't want to. Both games exist and are still supported (in a way haha)

That being said, I love both for the reasons that make them both great. S3 feels full because its a completed game with loads of content. Gameplay-wise there is a lot to do and see, and being an open world game, you feel like the options are limitless in terms of storytelling. However, designing and creating things in terms of CAS and building felt like a drag (at least to me) because of the optimization and how long it would take just to redesign a sim in CAS or add to a build. 

S4 is the opposite - while gameplay might not be the thing it's best at, design-wise its loads better. I know opinions vary on how it look but I personally love the low-poly design of the game. Multitasking also became super important to me (after scoffing at it when S4 was first announced), and while the emotions aren't perfect, I like seeing the cause and effect style they have on my sims

In the end, I still play both games happily. If I wanna create a complex story that involves robots and meteors hitting buildings, I play 3. If I want to recreate myself and build my dream house, living my dream job as a freelance artist that gets paid well, I play 4. Neither games are perfect but I don't understand why they have to be pit against each other all the time. Play whatever makes you happiest! It's your time spent with what you like to do, not anyone else's!

The VAT study I looked at is generous, because it assumes everything is taxed at 5% and then doubled. Yang doesn't want to tax everything at 10%, I haven't seen where he wants to raise the VAT on luxury goods, and as far as I can tell VAT doesn't increase linearly.

Try out international, realize its way harder to communicate important information swiftly with no hesitation in a different language, then give up and say you gave it all you got but the communication was hard not being your native language.


Obviously if all these players spoke English fluently this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, but that‚Äôs not the case (excluding hunter and nexa I assume) which is why it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äújust go international.‚Äù

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","You and the 51 people liking this are almost guaranteed to have never played an 11 a side match in your life, or kicked a ball for that matter. Xhaka was absolutely pathetic today. As usual doing his thing off hiding in random pockets of space not marking anything, not sniffing danger just standing back and ball watching. 

Every counter attack he‚Äôs jogging or walking. Every time, and if a player comes anywhere near him it‚Äôs an immediate foul; just like with Linngard and Mctomany fouls. 

Constantly not running to block shots and standing still with his Hands behind his back like a cunt hoping the ball doesn‚Äôt come near him 

Doesn‚Äôt ever press, continually allows players to turn on the ball. Probably because he‚Äôs incapable. And for a dm that is pretty absurd. 

Does this useless fake marking where he‚Äôs not tight, and he‚Äôs not standing off. He‚Äôs in no mans land and he‚Äôs shit. He does it all game and what it means is whenever the player xhaka is marking receives the ball; he‚Äôs never tight enough to win it nor is he back in the correct position. So they play the simplest of one twos around him. Or just simply turn and run by him. Happens all game every game and it‚Äôs why we face so much pressure 

Vacates position in front of back 4 and makes little or no effort to get back. Again this happens pretty much the entire game. 

Never patrols the edge of our area, always standing in space between centre backs hiding hoping someone else will close and press. This happens all the time from 2nd balls dropping in and around the area. No desire no attempt just hiding in those situations from xhaka 

Fails at set pieces, blasted one out for a goal kick early 

Awful at attacking corners, twice at the near post did nothing 

Lost any headers from goal kicks to mctomany 

Gave away as usual unnecessary fouls in dangerous areas that could have lead to a goal. One where we had Maguire being marked by Guendouzi...great organising captain. 

Misplaced passes as usual 

Didn‚Äôt really stand up for Guendouzi or Saka from the bullying the Utd players were up to 

Ducks his head out the way of an on coming shot that ends up going in 

Oh yeah it‚Äôs a ‚Äòquiet game‚Äô. It‚Äôs either a quiet game as you call it where you completely fail to understand and analyse just how useless xhaka is. Or xhaka has an absolute shitter that you can‚Äôt hide.

Can I ask, when in 3 seasons has Xhaka had a good game? Please enlighten me Xhaka fan boys",1569888081

"HVAC","t5_2s8ms","Let's start with a minimal investment. Make a flat rectangular box out of 5/8 OSB with the rough side in. Make the box wide enough to cover the existing opening and about 2/3 as wide and high enough to be about 1 foot short of the ceiling The filter will fit in the top of the box, so size the box for a filter as wide as the box and somewhat narrower. Make an opening in the back of the box to allow air to come in the top through the filter and then travel down the box and make a turn to enter the blower. Make an OSB bottom for the box. 

Make a gasket out of flimsy open cell foam with a sticky back and install it around the opening on the bottom of the box.

If the noise suppression is not enough, you can line the box with accousti-blok, which is not cheap. You would then line as much of the rectangular opening we see too,

The OSB will accept drywall screws near the edge if they enter at an angle and not straight down into the cut surface.

The box serves to muffle sound and direct whatever sound comes out upward to the ceiling rather than straight out into the room.

You can attach the box to the wall with screws driven in at angle, like toe-nails.

When the project is done please start a new thread and tell the forum about your experience and results.

Here are prior threads that redditors posted about inlet noise silencing.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Depends on what ""easy"" means to you. Forgotten Realms is easy in that you can google anything in the lore and have some basic information pop up, and find materials with more in-depth history, geography, NPCs, etc. But homebrew is easy in the opposite way: you can just make up anything you need (but you HAVE TO make up everything).

Personally, I like having starting material to work from and inspire me. But Faerun is pretty damn crowded and lore-heavy, so if you want somewhere that has a little bit more room to make stuff up, Greyhawk is a bit more ""generic fantasy land"" or Nentil Vale? called something like that from 4e maybe? Before my time. I jumped into Spelljammer instead, which is a crazy setting you can put anything in (but it's not so easy because there are a bunch of extra rules).",1569888084

Say you have two boxes; one box contains the content of the bank (guns, their part and damage info) and in the box right next to it you have all the info for interacting with the bank (add, withdraw, compare)

Now as you add guns to the bank info box, it fills up. A well designed program will know when the box is full and stop you from adding any more.

In our unlimited bank space, we're not checking for that. So we keep piling in guns, eventually they are sticking out of the box, but they're still in there, albeit a bit awkward to get out. As we continue to pile in guns, one slips into the interaction box, maybe it just hits the animation of moving your cursor, no big deal, we can live with out that tiny animation and the bank hums along, maybe with a little hiccup here and there. But as more and more guns slip into that box (note that as far as the computer knows we are still adding it to the bank storage, but the guns are piled so high the only free space is the box next to it) more and more functions of the bank become buried under the guns you put in there. Eventually the whole bank is broken, and thousands of guns you have in there are now completely inaccessible.",1569888086

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I posted this on another thread and it still sends chills up my spine: 

 I was a junior in high school at around 11 or so at night with my best friend, R, after work. We were both morbidly interested in things rather macabre and had walked around this cemetery before, but never at night. We had planned this for a long time. I don't drive, so she was driving down a really long local dirt road to the cemetery. As soon as we got near the 'gates' she said that she was scared but I laughed at her, being the 'tougher' one of the two and said it was fine. I still remember how green the leaves on the tree infront of us were.

No more than 6 entire seconds after I laughed at her for being scared, I looked down at the base of the tree, and I saw this.... smallish creature kind of hiding itself. I cannot offer an explanation as to what it was, and I acknowledge in writing that this is nowhere near as scary as it was in real life. This thing I saw was bright orange. It was round and stood vertically, very compact and short, and had these HUGE saucer like eyes that seemed to take up its whole face. It seemed to shyly stare at the car for an absolute eternity before I said, ""R, GO!"" in a voice i hardly recognized as my own, and she immediately put the car in reverse without so much as a question.

We drove in silent reverse down the road seeing the cemetery become smaller in view before she stopped at the train tracks and said, ""What happened?!"" When I told her what i saw and she said she never saw anything but felt something rather. It was a somber and shaking ride back. Her ex boyfriend always claimed it was a fox or a cat when she brought it up, but i know what both look like and that was NOTHING i have ever seen before. It was no kind of animal. The freakiest and saddest part of this story is that within that same week, a classmate committed suicide in that cemetery. Girl that lived within walking distance of the cemetery that night said she thought she heard fireworks. R and I never ever went back because of both of those things but mostly because of the classmate's suicide, and we often wondered if he was alone when he left this world. I don't want to know.",1569888087

Like I cannot really admit it... I don't think I could admit this to anyone irl,, because admitting it puts so much burden on myself.

People will feel sorry for me, people will see me as broken, or they see me as a liar or a slut or a prude. Unless I have unrefutable evidence then it couldn't have ever happened and how dare I make an attempt to RUIN a man's life.

Every time I hear someone say 'she shouldn't have bad choices' or 'it's her fault' or 'she should've been more careful'

All I hear is 'and its your fucking fault too'

I hate admitting I was raped... Not even because I was fucking raped. Not because I was assaulted in an intimate moment with people who supposedly cared deeply for

But because I feel like I should be so fucking ashamed of myself to have been raped.

I agree, cops shouldn‚Äôt get away with misconduct, this is why I support forcing cops to wear body cams, as cops aren‚Äôt a private force, and are one of the government. Most cop settlements are out of court, and there are loopholes, like the one used in the case of Philando Castile.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Wow, I feel like this question was written specifically for me.

My dad is probably one of the most well liked guys whenever I hear about him from other people. My dad is a graphic artist and pre-recession he was very well paid. He graduated from an excellent art school, got a job working for a fortune 100 company in the marketing department (I remember going there when I was little and getting all sorts of cool free merch).

However he is quiet and a giant pushover. My mother is incredibly controlling, she verbally and physically abused me and my siblings, but not by beating us, she came up with more... creative punishments (just a note, spanking is not physical abuse in my book, beating is). I remember one time (I was about 7 or 8 at the time, as my siblings had not been born yet)I did not clean my room, now grounding, taking away toys, something like that is entirely reasonable, but that isn‚Äôt what she did. My mom knew that she was making one of my favorite meals (probably mac n cheese or something) but instead of grounding me, she stuffed me in a closet that had view of the dining room and it was one of those closets with little horizontal slits that you could juuuust see out of. I stayed in that closet watching her and my father eat. He said nothing, as I would later find out, if he objected, she would scream and carry on. 

I could spend a lot more time talking about the ‚Äúcreative‚Äù punishments my mother came up with, like dumping out a laundry basket of clothes that were not folded correctly, flipping it over and shoving me underneath it and sitting on it until I ‚Äúlearned my lesson‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have that much time.

When my dad lost his job in 2008, things got harder, a lot harder. I had just started high school. We lost our house, we ended up renting a tiny three bedroom house for the five of us, and my dad was ‚Äújob hunting.‚Äù

Hindsight is 20/20 but at the time I was fourteen and more worried about going to a new school.

The gist of what happened is this. I was prompted by my parents to get a job as that‚Äôs what ‚Äúhard working Americans do‚Äù I had just turned fifteen and got my work permit. I worked the maximum allotment of hours per week which I believe was 18 at the time. My dad started asking me for money, as he said ‚Äúthings are hard and I‚Äôm looking for a job but just can‚Äôt find one‚Äù I had heard about other friends whose parents were out of a job as well. My dad regularly took money out of my paycheck as I was too young to have my own account and he could just move money out of mine and into his. The gist was simple, if they didn‚Äôt have money for rent, we wouldn‚Äôt have anywhere to live.

During all of this it was pretty standard to have my mom scream at my Dad, and me. See my grades suffered; I was in band, I worked, and I wanted to have friends. So when it came down to those things or homework, well, band was my creative outlet, it was obvious that I would be kicked out (as I had been ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù many times by that point) if I didn‚Äôt help with rent, and I wanted to have friends.

I consider myself to be relatively intelligent. I graduated university in the top 98th percentile. That was a crutch for me, as I just didn‚Äôt do my homework, but it wasn‚Äôt because I was sitting around doing nothing, I was absolutely exhausted. I couldn‚Äôt focus in class because I was tired, I couldn‚Äôt focus on homework because I tired (band was a requirement for not getting kicked out, as an extracurricular would help me get into college, and I was a better than average musician) so I just did homework on the bus in the morning and during lunch because it was the only time I had.

During high school I had very few friends, many of my classmates were pretty mean to me, starting rumors that I‚Äôm gay (I‚Äôm not, but I‚Äôm a big ally) or just straight bullying me. I couldn‚Äôt figure out if I was depressed or tired, probably because I was both.

I worked my ass off, I got out of the house, my dad got a job... my sophomore year of college. And I found out that my dad hadn‚Äôt gotten a job not because he couldn‚Äôt find one, but because he couldn‚Äôt find one as a graphic artist.

He spent five years basically just doing freelance work, and letting my mom work and be the breadwinner, because he was too good for it.

Here‚Äôs how all of that shaped me. I‚Äôm a spiteful person. I hate to admit it, but I‚Äôm in my late twenties now. I started my own company while I was in college and it became relatively successful. Successful enough that I ended up quitting my job at a Fortune 50 company with a fast track to mid level management to pursue it. I am in the process of starting my second company, we‚Äôll be launching our product by the end of the year. I bought my house at 23, I signed my apartment in a big city about two hours away when I was 25. I had five cars, but I gave one to my best friend as a wedding present as we had restored it together.

My parents live in an apartment smaller than our shitty house in 08. My dad still steals money from my siblings. My sister lives in my apartment, I gave her my bedroom and I sleep on the couch when I‚Äôm there (I go into that area for work for about 5 days a month, I figured renting is cheaper than paying for a hotel). 

I‚Äôm successful by every measure, except for one, my love life.

I can‚Äôt hold down a girlfriend, I‚Äôm emotionally detached, my therapist is helping me through this as I haven‚Äôt had a relationship pass the year mark. All I can do is work. When I‚Äôm bored, I work, either on projects around the house, or revenue generating activities. I choose work over friends, I choose work over girlfriends, I choose work over family. I cannot stop. But, I‚Äôm not unhappy, I‚Äôm pretty happy except in my love life, I feel productive, but the way my parents treated me absolutely made me this way.

If I ever end up having kids, I will do everything I can to make sure they live a good life. Not necessarily by my being wealthy (though it wouldn‚Äôt hurt) but my learning from my parents mistakes, showing them the love that they need. That family is the most important thing.

TLDR; my Dad is a giant pushover and wouldn‚Äôt stop my mom from doing shitty things to me. He refused to get a job and made me pay our rent in high school. As a result of those things I‚Äôm an emotionally detached workaholic.",1569888090

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; Why do people keep showing me this index as if it means anything?

It's a source of data. It's how rational people like classical liberals interpret the world, not through prophecy and myth like the socialist.

&gt;but it doesn't tell me the living standards of unemployed people or those that make considerably less

That information is available, o incurious one. This is the internet.

&gt;or anything else that would actually indicate how prosperous the society is

It is not a prosperity index. It could be easily confused for a prosperity index because economic freedom and prosperity are so correlative. That is my point.

&gt;It doesn't matter how allegedly easy it is to start a business in Hon Kong if there are people who work paycheck to paycheck and can never afford to start a business.

It does matter because easy entrance into business creates opportunities for our fellow humans. Making it difficult to start a business is a violation of property rights, usually at the expense of the scrappy little guy.

&gt;&gt;Anything that requires another person's property or service is not a right.

&gt;You can literally use this argument word for word to defend slavery,

You literally can't, because 'another person' includes all persons. Self-ownership is another property right--you've taken away nothing.

&gt;&gt;Slaveowners don't have a right to own people.

&gt;They did

It was legal, but they didn't have the right. When you need another human to involve themselves in fulfilling your ""'right'"" then it's not a '""right.'"" That's not what the word means in English.

&gt;&gt;Workers don't have a right to control a businessowners' property, the payer and earner have made a wage agreement.

&gt;""The state does't have the right to control a slaveowner's property.""

&gt;When your logic can be used to defend slavery this easily, something's very wrong with your argument.

Something's wrong with your cranial cavity if you think replacing phrases is an argument. Slave ownership is a violation of property rights. Forcing businesses and workers into a democratic relationship is a violation of property rights. Businesses with democratic worker relationships are legal now, and hip. Co-op or worker owned or union businesses advertise the fact on 100% of marketing material. Yet not all businesses choose to operate that way because it's inefficient--constant meetings, involvement takes time. Your system is far more authoritarian than you realize, powerful elites must actively inveigle into commerce to prevent businesses from making the efficient choice, which they will always want to do.

&gt;the workplace to be an autocratic dictatorship of the capitalist

Dictatorship is a strong word for voluntary wagepay.

&gt;And before you say ""well if you don't like your job just leave and find a different one."" Firstly the logic of that argument is non-existent.

I've actually performed this impossible act six or seven times.

&gt;Are you going to say to a someone living under and criticizing a dictatorship that ""if you don't like your government just leave the nation"" as if it's that easy, as if the dictatorship stops mattering once they're no longer under its thumb?

Worst day of your worst job ever, Stasi did not cover your head with a canvas bag and sap you. Dictatorships are much worse than voluntary jobs, and I'm not the only one with that opinion.

&gt;&gt;Socialists don't have a right to prevent people from making private agreements.

&gt;Capitalism prevents people from making private agreements. That's what Intellectual Property, Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights exist to do, prevent people from making and selling products and providing services whose patent/copyright/other form of IP is owned by someone else.

Capitalism only prevents people from making private agreements that violate property rights. The P in IP stands for property. Capitalism does not get involved in other private agreements, but socialism's apparatus has to be plugged up the bunghole at all workplaces.

&gt;There is no distributed property power in capitalism. Everything is owned by the individual capitalist

According to data from the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, there were 5.6 million employer firms in the United States in 2016. That's distributed.

&gt;who can employ up to thousands of people and their lives are in the capitalist's hands, the capitalist's decisions impact their lives and the workers have no say in any of them.

My boss bought a bunch of expensive snowmoving equipment last year and if winter had been less severe, he'd have gone bankrupt. I want no say in that guy's risky plays. I should be able to opt out, rationally gauge my skills on the job market, but in socialism, one does not opt.

&gt;&gt;Self-defense of our rights ‚â† force.

&gt;Also well done redefining ""force"" in such a historically revisionist way. What, did you think that the liberal revolutions that created the capitalist world order were non-violent?

Action in the service of self-defense does not qualify as being violent. 1776 was justified because of rights not in spite of them.

&gt;insisting that when liberals overthrew monarchism, that was okay because it was about defending individual rights but when socialists want to just take liberalism's logic to it's logical conclusion of workplace democracy as well as societal democracy, suddenly it's not about workers trying to defend their rights, it's about employers losing their rights.

Workplace democracy is not a right, because it requires effort and property from others, possibly involuntarily. Rights violations can't be rights.

&gt;What police state would be required to ensure that workers have the right to democratically manage their workplaces

Workers have the right to democratically manage a workplace if they own it or the owner is fine with that. So you wouldn't be giving out new rights, you'd just be removing the property rights for owners.

IF you had a disk version of D2 like me, you need to delete Destiny from your PS4 and if you bought Forsaken digitally, you just need to:  


1. Go to your PS4 Library
2. Go into your purchases
3. Download Forsaken

What's your understanding of veganism anyway? Literally all of you already eat what vegan people eat, and more. It's not some fucking foreign diet?? It's your own food? I'm not even vegan but I get it?? 

The man's not even making them be vegan, if any of you could fucking read they're perfectly free to eat whatever they want outside his house. Mixed religion/dietary habit households work with this rule all the time, it's perfectly doable. 

That 'kid' is 17. That's almost an adult, plus at that age you are self aware and should have a working understanding of what respect is.

"preppers","t5_2riow","Before I even checked, I knew there would be at least 1 person recommending Glock.  Searched the page, ""Glock"" appeared 13 times.

I am hesitant to recommend Glock.  Don't get me wrong, they have a well deserved reputation for being reliable AF, but they're not for everybody.  Here are a few reasons why:

1. Out of the box, they have (relatively) crappy triggers.
2. They use polygonal ""rifling"" in their barrels, which limits your ammo choices (have to use jacketed bullets, pure lead bullets are a no-no).
3. I'm not a fan of the goalpost sights that they come with from the factory.  FWIW, the Ruger Security-9 sitting next to me has the same type of rear sight. It's OK, I just don't like it as much as I like 3-dot sights).
4. The ergonomics of their grip aren't for everybody.
   1. The grip angle is too steep.  This is most noticeable on the double-stack guns
   2. The finger grooves (on the 3rd and 4th gen guns) are in the wrong spot for a lot of people.
   3. The grip is somewhat bigger than it really needs to be, even for double stack mags. This is because the polymer mags they use are thicker than a metal mag of the same capacity would be, so the grip is slightly wider and longer to accommodate that.

You can get used to #1, or you can buy one of the eleventy billion aftermarket trigger kits.

\#2 is probably not actually that big of an issue.  The vast majority of factory 9mm ammo out there is jacketed, so if you only shoot factory ammo, it'll never be a problem.  If you handload, you will just have to suck it up and buy jacketed bullets, because as tempting as those cheap lead bullets are, they cause problems in polygonal barrels.

\#3 is a personal preference issue, and just like #1, there are aftermarket solutions if you just can't get used to the goalpost sights.

\#4 is actually the biggest problem.  If you have particularly small hands, Glocks can be tough to get a proper grip on.  Even if your hands are easily big enough to grip a Glock, the angle of the grip makes Glocks not point naturally for *most* people.  The more you're willing to train, the less of an issue this is, because you can train into the Glock's grip angle, but *most* people *will* have to train into the Glock's grip angle.  That same grip angle is, however, also an advantage.  It somewhat forces you to lock your wrists into position, which is an important factor in recoil control.

With all of that said, I'm not saying ""Don't get a Glock.""  What I **am** saying is, ""Don't get a Glock just because everyone says they're good.""

I will also say that I ***really*** like the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P.",1569888095

Original Post: 

&gt; I am a rewards member of a company that sells a product. I've discovered that if you use there app/equipment in the prescribed manner but use a specific sequence not typically used, it doubles the discount.
&gt; 
&gt; I did not hack the app/equipment or use it in any way that violates my terms of use.
&gt; 
&gt; It's value to me in savings, a single customer, is about $600 a year. 
&gt;

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","In group bias and prejudice aren't the same thing, and you've completely misinterpreted the fuck out of that data. Or intentionally nitpicked it to swing in your favor. 

In group bias: ""I am a woman and I want to help women before I help men.""
How this translates to real life: A female manager may hire a woman instead of a man, because she has a bias towards women, even if she doesn't hate men. 

Prejudice: ""I am a man and I want to hurt women.""
How this translates to real life: A male manager may hire a man instead of a woman, because he hates women, even if he doesn't have a bias towards men.

You can find evidence of in-group bias among women, but you can also find just as strong of evidence of prejudice in men.

There's also power structures that are measurable and objectively exist in which men hold more control of society than women. As I tried pointing out to you with a remark about men controlling politics and lawmaking. You can try and use a bunch of arguments that aren't even logically sound to try and dodge this, but the evidence is there...

It's called a ""patriarchy"" and as much as a lot of the internet like to hate on the word it quite literally just means ""when men are in power"" and is fairly easily identified based on who the head of household is, who runs the politics, who owns the land, who runs the businesses. Men are obviously the head of household in a majority of families and are usually the owner of the house, and men still run a vast majority of the politics and businesses.

Matriarchies have also existed in some ancient societies, where women were the leaders of politics and heads of household. But we're not at all close to that point in western society.

When women ""join team women"" and display bias for each other, it's just them building power back through mutualism. Very much like a worker's union. You have the managers in power (men) and the workers subordinate to them (women). One worker can't make the bosses give out raises if they're dissatisfied, but all the workers saying it suddenly levels the playing field and gives them leverage. A worker is obviously going to have bias towards other workers in these scenarios. But they're still going to be friends with some of the managers when the strikes over and don't necessarily hate very many of them as people.

Now, imagine if all the CEOs in the country came together to unionize against the workers..... That would be pretty ridiculous wouldn't it? What goal would they even have? What's their incentive, what more do they have to gain? That's Mens' Rights Activism.

None of this excuses misandry, but misandry is pretty frowned upon outside of echo chambers. Yes, a lot of millennial women throw around an ""I hate men"" every now and then and it's kind of a trendy phrase. But what you need to realize is a vast majority of the time it's as genuine as ""I hate the sun"". The sun kind of sucks on a hot day, but who the fuck actually wants to go extinguish the sun or genuinely despised sunlight? A few outrageously detached and frenzied outliers, maybe. And they probably don't even care it's hot outside. They just want something to be angry about.

I mean, back to the union example, how often do you say ""I hate my boss""? Sometimes you really do hate your boss because he's a slime bag. But most of the time you'd still grab a beer together after work and it's just a jest at him because he's the one in power and you feel like punching up at him to relieve a little frustration with how he and the other managers' actions dictate your life sometimes. 

Trust me, when the average feminist watches a girl go from ""Haha I hate men haha"" to actually /hating/ men it's pretty quickly pushed out of the group and the tone is changed rapidly. Men are EQUALLY victims of toxic masculinity and women are generally sympathetic to that (at least in modern feminist movements, I'd agree early feminism ignored this a lot even if I don't agree it was intentional, rather just lacked consideration.)

You acknowledge the same thing a lot of feminists acknowledge, but just aren't making the rest of the connection in my opinion; Men lose custody battles, because the male judges refuse to believe another man could be nurturing. Nurturing behavior isn't masculine and men are masculine. Men lose court cases against their abusers, because the male judges refuse to believe a man could be ""submissive"" to a woman. In their eyes, men are stronger, men are smarter, how could they possibly submit to a woman so easily?

Feminists aren't happy about that shit. They want the expectation of feminity removed from womanhood, and now they also want the expectation of masculinity removed from manhood to maintain balance. That's it - free choice of expression, and to destroy gender standards set by prejudice and power structures and the status quo. If they were fighting fire with fire and just throwing more and more gendered standards into the world, we all would lose.

"buffy","t5_2sd68","Personally, I've always seen it as the other way around.  


The whole ""One moment of happiness"" thing seems to be a dumb thing to put in a curse for reasons that lots of other people have gone into which makes me think it is merely a limitation of the spell rather than something they added to the spell.  


This is backed up as when Willow re-souls Angel the same rules apply which would suggest that if it was an addition to the curse she could have just left it out.  


This makes me think that Angel's soul is more of a *for lack of a better word* artificial soul. Like a soul-substitute that isn't as good as the real thing and therefore can't take the strain of something like true happiness or else it'll break.  


This makes sense as while the Gypsys are practised in magic they are still human so aren't going to understand how the universe works like a more supernatural being.  


---------------------------------  


Spike, however, goes to a demon who presumably should understand much better than the gipsies hence it's a lot more likely he has a real soul, hence why he doesn't seem to have the same limitations as Angel.  


I'd even go further and say that it is Williams soul that Spike has. While a lot of it was influenced by The First, it seems that Spike when getting the soul needs to deal with Williams psychological problems a lot more than Angel ever had to deal with Liam's.  


To an extent, this is just due to there nature. Liam, Angelus, and Angel very much seem to be three separate people whereas William appears just to be Spike when he wasn't a Vampire.  


So it may be just the way Spike sees himself as in ""Fool for Love"" he still seems to be hung up over issues he had when he was human, and this was before he had a soul.",1569888097

She didn't notice until she accidentally read it aloud whilst giving the presentation, and apparently the whole room burst into laughter, but luckily the teachers found it hilarious too so neither of us got in trouble.

I ordered him something fun, cleaned up the mess as best I could, and left a really big tip for my trouble as it was a bit of a mess despite my best effort. 

Common sense, I would think? But hey, maybe that's from when I served and one of my worst incidents was the entitled parents who wanted to sit together, I couldn't seat them together without a 45 minute wait, they agreed to be seated separately, let their two kids run amuck between the tables, and caused hell for all of us. Later they complained, lied l, and said I seated the two parents away from the two children and it was me who let them run around the restaurant unsupervised, as if it was specifically my job to watch them. One of my awful managers knew it was bullshit, but was looking for ways to get rid of me. So after that, they chewed me out, refused to listen to me or the people who saw what happened, cut my hours to nothing. I went hungry for two weeks bc of those people.",1569888098

And it leaves me feeling pretty hopeless about the future of the world.

Relatedly, something that I think has a lot to do with it is many people's insistence that ""both sides are wrong."" That attitude is pretty pervasive within my Midwestern but liberal-leaning circle. It's damaging to insist that both sides are equally at fault for the state of our country, because they absolutely aren't. Not saying that Democrats are perfect, or even close to it, but it's just false to say they're as bad as the GOP, and so many people saying it over and over muddies the waters of sensible discussion.

I‚Äôm just trying not to be one of the bad guys in his head ( I guess somehow I am now :( )

He‚Äôs become more closed-up as time went on and I wonder if it was ever my fault for being too chatty or too emotional at times.

He hasn‚Äôt been very emotionally-sensitive to me (sorry if i worded that wrong, english is not my first language) and I‚Äôve had to tell him a few times when ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need advice‚Äù where he asks me why and lets me talk. He just listens, and offers solutions and is very ‚Äòpractical‚Äô about it. I think it is just his way or he doesn‚Äôt very well know how to comfort people.

I love loving, and I‚Äôm very secure and sure of myself, I‚Äôm not sure how to go about what‚Äôs going on right now. Should I just wait and see what he will do about it? Where do I draw the line? I‚Äôm not very good at thinking about what I need :(",1569888100

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","I answered this question a while back on the Yang sub:  
 

As a former Trump supporter myself, I'll try to answer this as best as I can. There's a lot of things that make Yang the best candidate, but for me it comes down to his attitude. Yang is one of the only candidates who doesn't play identity politics, doesn't blame everything on Trump, and is willing to sit down with Conservatives and have a discussion. Take his [interview with Ben Shapiro](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw) for example. He didn't blame Trump for everyone's problems, and he didn't act hostile. They managed to have a really good discussion even though they disagreed on quite a few things. Harris will never get this kind of support (just look at her opening statement from the last debate), and neither will Warren after the whole Pocahontas debacle. Another thing that really impressed me, just like you, is the sheer number and detail of his policy proposals. When I first read through his site it was so refreshing. Other candidates have pages and pages of nothing, but Yang manages to present his policies with data, logic, and compromise, and it gives me hope for the future of politics. Those are the things that made me support Yang, but I think the reason for a lot of more mainstream Republicans is that he is promising a change in the system just like Trump did (drain the swamp), but he actually has policies and data to back him up. I know a lot of Dems think having Conservative support is a bad thing, which is incredibly saddening to me, but if you truly look at the logic behind why people voted for Trump I think it makes complete sense why Yang does have so much.",1569888103

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","From what I can see from your op.gg these are probably likely reasons why your performance on riven is so poor.

1. You're not building her correctly, her core currently is caufields into cleaver, prioritizing the cdr over phage then building into deaths dance for pretty much like 90% of games, and you should never be building cdr boots especially as a new riven player.


2. You probably have a poor understanding of how to trade on riven, and on how trading works in general from what you said about the sion lane.


3. You probably have a lack of understanding of how wave control works and how you should apply it in game according to the matchup/gamestate.


4. Your gold generation is unusually low, you should be hitting at least 6.5cspm on riven, ideally around 7.5 but even on games that you arent dying that much you dont hit 6. This is especially important as riven is a high econ champ  (item/gold/level dependent )


Like other people have said, the mechanical skill floor on riven to be effective is actually suprisingly low. But she can singlehandedly 1v9 games in the right hands with the right items/gold and the champ is very versatile.

How to get better at her? 

Id suggest watching adrian riven/high elo riven vods and seeing how they use the champion, how they trade where they position the wave, the way they approach the matchup. Watch even montages too to see how they use their abilities in high risk situations and to see the champions limits. 

Adrian has some old matchup vods that are 3 seasons old but are still a good insight on how the champion works and if you can understand the thought process on those old matchups, even though the game has changed youll still be able to understand riven more.",1569888105

"ECEProfessionals","t5_2t05v","Unfortunately, the answer is probably yes. Each state is different in Vermont, the minimum wage is $10.78.  I know many teachers who are assistants, they have no degree they have only taken the 36-hour mandatory training class and make $10 an hour.  Teacher's with 5+ years and more education classes and maybe an associates degree make between $12-16 an hour.

Last year I was making $17 an hour with a BS and a teacher's license and 15 years experience.  That was the most I had ever made!  I am currently making $19.20 an hour, I asked for a higher wage and had a bit of leverage because if my qualifications.  They can't 'afford' to lose me and I had been looking for a new job.

In Vermont, if you work for Head Start with a BS you can expect between $19-$25.  Most ECE center's you can expect between $10-$17 maybe $18.

Up until 3 months ago when I got the raise I did struggle to support myself.  I needed a roommate, I counted every penny and lived paycheck to paycheck.  I don't get benefits so I use the state health care program which is expensive.  It's hard and there have been several times I have thought that I needed to switch careers.  I have been trying to get into a school district or head start program.  If I didn't get the raise I would still be trying.",1569888105

The best way to be employable, though, is to look for jobs in your area and learn those frameworks. See a lot of C#? Learn ASP.net. See a lot of Ruby? Learn Ruby on Rails. See a lot of Django or data science? Learn Python. You need to cater your education to your needs.",1569888106

The article starts with the fact that, despite the fact that Bitmex is not a legit exchange, in this market, there is not a whole lot more that can be said about it.



If anything, the article mentions that Bitmex has a reputation (or reputation) value.



The article doesn't mention that Bitmex was once a legitimate exchange, or that is still a recognized exchange, or mention that Bitmex is a ""scamcoin"", or mention that Bitmex has ""gone under"", or mention anything about Bitcoin (BTC)?



The article doesn't mention that Bittrex has a reputation value of $2.7 billion, or mentions that Bitmex has a reputation value of $2 million USD. Or even mentions that Bitmex was a Ponzi scheme?



If a coin has a reputation value, and Bitcoin is viewed as a Ponzi scheme, Bitcoin has a marketable value of USD and thus a marketable price.



This is why the article makes a point of mentioning ""in-depth research"" to confirm Bitmex or Bitcointalk. What kind of research do you ask for?",1569888109

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","So many ways you could skin this cat. What‚Äôs the car worth if you sold it private sale (might be less considering the accident)?

1) You could sell it, pay any negative equity and just buy a decent reliable car for a few grand, with cash, and let this be a lesson about buying too much car for your income.

2) You could pay the car completely off but would be left with 3k in savings/checking but be debt free. And 3k is a decent emergency fund to start with. You‚Äôd have to build that back up a little more. This might not be your best bet as the car is a depreciating asset and that‚Äôs a lot to just dump into it from your accounts.

3) You could keep the car and keep making the payments and just drive the thing until the wheels fall off. But most people just go from car loan to car loan when they get bored of their current car or when that new car smell wears off.

With my view points on debt and how I feel about what I drive, I would go with option 1 or 2.  I don‚Äôt care what I drive. I‚Äôm not impressing anyone. I‚Äôd sell it, eat the negative equity if it wasn‚Äôt too much, and buy a nice reliable car for a few grand with cash and avoid the debt.

If you really love the car, keep it until the wheels fall off. I think a lot of your feelings are because you already had an accident with it. Or you‚Äôre becoming more aware of your finances and don‚Äôt like the car payments.",1569888110

Darwin was developed alongside FreeBSD and has FreeBSD Patches merged in. Sorry if a Wikipedia article misled you. It's based on BSD, not the FreeBSD Project specifically.

You can have a gun in both hands, or you can reach behind your shoulder to grab a shield. Different waves of aliens keep coming out and shooting at you, it's very much an arcade game style, where you're going for a high score, or trying to make it further each time. Like Galaga, but it's you standing there with a gun in each hand, and the aliens keep coming up from below a platform in front of you for each wave. You can switch guns, there's powerups. You can transform the shield to an energy whip/lightsaber thing and grab the aliens to pull them towards you then slice them in half. It's really well done. Really sharp graphics.  But it's just an arcade type of experience, no story, like PacMan or Tempest or anything like that. Great for when friends come over because it's so intuitive.

Trask came in against Kentucky and completely swayed the momentum in that game. UK didn't have a chance once our offense actually started executing.

In both cases, we were the more talented team, and that was the difference in the end. Yes, our O-line is forcing our offense to be one-dimensional, and that will probably end up being our downfall down the stretch, but that's not why we've had a couple of close games so far this season. It's because we've struggled to get out of our own way.

No hitting or yelling or being overly aggressive obviously. So she's in the wrong there. But you need to accpet her son no matter how he acts hes a teenager. Maybe keep trying and he will open up. He may feel like you don't care as a step child myself its hard to feel like a step parent cares unless they go that extra mile. But being passive aggressive is just going to ruin your relationship. Also not seeing the kid will ruin it too. If you guys plan to move in together before he's moved away and out of college then you have to accept him as that's part of the deal of being with someone with kids. I'm divorced after 8 years and my children step dad goes above and beyond to keep a bond with our sons
 I'm currently pregnant and he will make sure they all get treated fairly becuase he too had step parents and remebers the favortism b.s.. You dont have that to deal with but it takes time to build a bond eapecually with a teenager. Giving up so easily will make him feel like you dont think he's worth it. If You love her you will start being a good step dad. Or you need to step away so one day another can take on that roll properly for thr both of them. Don't waste someone time and life especially a child's if can't plan to be a good parent/spouse as well as accept him always and not do petty crap like this. A



Also its only been a year. It took 3 years for my kids to realize (even though I had not dated any others) hey he's staying and he's a really good guy for then to truly accept him. A year in a kid that olds life just is not enough. He's still not used to you guys and your relationship is still new. Also my current spouse didnt displine at all untill aftrr a year. Then he wss very gentle with them about punishment fotna while after till they got used to another adult being in charge of them. You can not just jump in and expect him to be ok with it. It will upset any teenager and they will rebel. One of my kids has ODD too so who knows if your kid does. Having a child who cant help but automatically be defiant takes a different paretning approach. Any authoritative figure and he just rebels not even meaning too. He just wants to be in control of himself. Giving him options instead of saying hey dont do that has helped a ton. It makes him feel like hes in control. So a hey man do you want to go hang out with friends, have computer time or go to your room untill you calm downm if you can't calm down ill pick for you. But every kid is different which is why parenting classes are so Damn important for all parents.. You should take some parenting classes. I do once a month becuase kids are always changing and so are ideas on how to raise them. Also I reccomend a book called my defiant child if defiance really seems to be an issue. I wish you luck parenting is not easy especially being a step parent. But if you do truly care for her and love her as well as her son then I hope you can step up to thr plate and take some classes and work on becoming a better step dad. I really hope you care enough to do so man. Again good luck",1569888111

Being ""back"" is not the same as winning a Natty. Osborne coached dominant teams for 20 years before he won a championship, but that doesn't mean that they weren't competing. You said:

&gt;If you‚Äôre 50 something, you‚Äôll probably be retired when we‚Äôre competing for championships again. 

To me, that implies it will be 10 years before Nebraska is in the playoff conversation, not 10 years until they win it all.

If you think ""We'll be lucky to go 7-5"" is optimistic, I'd hate to see what you think pessimism is. I guess you are optimistic for Frost's career, but not exactly for this season. You are writing off Northwestern, Minnesota, and Iowa as losses. Next week we are favored over Northwestern by 8 points. Just FYI, Northwestern is 1-3 and lost by 3 TD's to Michigan State. You really don't think that's a winnable game? Minnesota beat SD State, Fresno State, GA Southern, and Purdue by a grand total of 20 points. That's a team we can't beat?",1569888113

Same kind of plastic you would find on the handle of a chef knife in a restaurant. Obviously had been through a grinder/grater because it‚Äôs all cut up.

Anyway, Lucia‚Äôs QA department response was that they‚Äôd never seen anything like that and that they have no idea where it came from. They wanted me to send in the piece of plastic so they could check it with vendors and suppliers. They apologized and asked for me to send them my address and they will send a coupon for a free replacement pizza (not interested).

I do a combo of wet and dry food. Many cats don't drink a lot of water so it's good to give them some wet (I still make it gooshy by adding some extra water and mine love it (they're 3 now).  It also helps to have them used to some wet in case you need to sneak meds into food. 

Good quality food will help to keep them healthy, there are lots of brand options. look for something age-appropriate kittens need more calories than older cats because they grow so much in a short period of time. 

Slow introductions are best, if you can set up a safe room to start with and keep the kittens' territory small. Here's a good resource for introductions.  [http://www.tinykittens.com/introductions](http://www.tinykittens.com/introductions)

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","I'm willing to bet the last Road Poneglyph is in God Valley. This would explain why the WG made the island disappear, as well as why Rocks wanted to gather a powerful crew and go there in his quest to become Pirate King.

Remember that we only know the locations of 3 of the Road Poneglyphs so far. We know the Minks are protecting one on Zou, Kaido has one, and Big Mom has one. The location of the fourth is a mystery, just like God Valley.

I also think God Valley has some significance to the Celestial Dragons (they refer to themselves as gods), and Garp was at God Valley to protect them, implying that at least some of them were there.

The final Road Poneglyph being there would also explain why Roger was there. He could have found it during his time at the island.

Doflamingo claimed that the reason he could convince the WG to help him with things is because he knows a secret of theirs, one that they don't want getting out such as the location of the last Road Poneglyph and God Valley. Going along with my theory, since Doflamingo was a Celestial Dragon, he would likely know the location of an island like God Valley that is important to his people.

Blackbeard has made his base at the beehive, where he (presumably) knows that the Rocks Pirates were based. He is probably there to learn the location of the last Road Poneglyph as well, since he would know that he needs it to become Pirate King, his stated goal.

Finally, after the Whole Cake arc, the Straw Hats have two of the Road Poneglyphs. Since they are now working on defeating Kaido and Big Mom, and in the process would get Kaido's Road Poneglyph as well, it seems like the perfect time for Oda to slyly introduce the location of the next objective after Wano, which would probably be either the last Road Poneglyph or the next step to getting to it.",1569888119

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","If you're independent use the direct vassals map filter to see who has what. Otherwise it's a pain in the ass if you're a large vassal kingdom. You usually end up clicking on your vassal tab and sorting them by rank or clicking their title icons to see what lands they have and those that are de jure and slowly sorting it out. I suppose using the transfer vassalage character interaction might give some insight. De jure vassals are usually at the top and there's a malus in their opinion for not controlling said vassal.

It's kind of pointless to create/usurp a kingdom title unless you're an emperor or the de jure is about to shift all kingdoms into one and your terrified of a GHW/Jihad/Crusade, Turkumancheng nomad superblob or Mongol Horde one-shotting your ass. Not sure if your demesne or vassal limit increase from a second title either. Think it goes without saying but if you're tribal or have gavelkind there's no way in hell you should do this unless you enjoy fracturing your realm and pointless dynastic wars (specific situations like creating a custom empire exempt).

All of the above doesn't apply to nomads tho. Throw down for that prestige and if you handled your clans right there should be very few desired title debuffs and F\*\*\* ton of clan sentiment if you're swimming in prestige, and you should be. Their whole goal is to kill, loot and bring the world to its knees (unless you ~~find~~ conquer somewhere pretty to settle down).

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Great post. This is something I've thought about a lot, as probably the only greater conduit for my obsessiveness than Dr Who is Leftist politics.

There are very many parallels between real world issues and in universe problems in Doctor Who, and the program ignores them just as much as the real world does.

The Doctor is essentially a wealthy liberal, constantly moralising to others about their choices, their actions, their policies (use of violence) while never acknowledging the violence that their own comfort is necessarily predicated on. This reminds me of basically every Milquetoast liberal who supports cops, but has a hissy fit whenever a protester might engage in similar violence to challenge hegemonic power.

This is why Danny Pink is really compelling to me; Despite wilfully being a violent tool of an unjustified authority, Danny acknowledges the existing necessity of violent struggle, be it abstract or concrete, for the maintenance of any political order, and so knows that behind the Doctor's carefully crafted aesthetic is the exact same use of violence and embrace of the will to power as The Doctor purports to be against.

He challenges the Doctor for this core contradiction that lies within their character and every action they take. This is something the Doctor sometimes quite obviously struggles to cope with - *Am I a good man?*

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not a chef, but ex bar manager/shift supervisor here.

Part of my closing checks was to check every single tub of prepped food/ingredient. If the tub had sizable remnants of a day dot, it gets thrown as I didnt trust the head chef at the time to properly day dot. If beef was discolour, it goes (not ""usual"" discolouration, I mean full blown silvery green/brown, the kind you get on raw bacon after a while).

Anyways, best indicator to me, is if the manager is switched on and alert when you spot them. If I dont feel the manager(s) on shift are switched on during service, how can i expect them to be switched on when doing close down checks? 

Sadly, *some* chefs cut corners, not a majority and not always the head chef like I experienced, but some will cut corners that are a risk to guests. It's down to the closing manager (typically on shift from 3pm if they're lucky to start late and then their accompanying shift sup will be on around 6 onwards) to do the closing checks and double down on cleanliness where its lacking. If those late managers can't hold a spring in their step and an enthusiastic smile when new guests enter, trust me, they're not going to give a shit about a tub of food that's just gone out of date. 

They wont care about a chefs section not being pristine, that small splash of sauce in a microwave, the dirty seals on the fridges or the floor not being swept underneath all appliances or the one mouldy fruit or vegetable in the walk-ins. 

That right there, is what far too many restaurants lack - a manager with enthusiasm and a backbone to question chefs. They're not scary, they just have a shitty attitude from working a really tough job, but that gives them no excuse for a terrible kitchen at the end of a busy saturday night shift.",1569888120

If you scan your brain-activity with perfect detail, when you make your first decision (introspectral magnitude zero, or spectre zero for short), then you can make a new decision with the data from the last decision, and make spectre level one decision. This decision is of far greater quality than the first one. In spectre zero you didn't even have direct data on how your own brain worked (if it was even well fed and rested at the time). And if you keep going up and up in levels you improve the energy behind your decision, even if you decide to change your mind after sticking with one decision for 999 levels. The more levels you go through the better your decision. If you could go for an infinite amount you'd get the maximum quality decision possible, one that is chosen from all possible options and this decision will have infinite energy (justification) behind it.

IF you had a disk version of D2 like me, you need to delete Destiny from your PS4 and if you bought Forsaken digitally, you just need to:  


1. Go to your PS4 Library
2. Go into your purchases
3. Download Forsaken

Long-distance shots literally gave you points per meter/foot originally. If you snagged a 1000m headshot, you'd get 1000+ points. It was great fun, and I racked up many a 1st place medal by just farming ranged snipers on the periphery of the map. But, yes, you're not really contributing a lot to your team and the juicy points attracted a disproportionate number of players to the relatively niche act of extreme long distance sniping.

After a while, DICE nerfed it so long-distance just gave you the distance, but not the points. Which is fine.

People will do what they want irrespective of whether it's possible to get in-game distance readouts. These statistics are likely to be tracked in Barracks regardless, so I could take it or leave it.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I read your example in the link of ‚Äúhere‚Äôs another‚Äù, and the article is great. It‚Äôs a great idea. No argument there. But I don‚Äôt see an idea of how to actually push mankind in that direction. The world would be better if it was progress driven instead of profit driven, but the problem is still that everyone wants profits. And the powerful people who run things have money because they are profit driven, and so it‚Äôs very difficult to convince any of them to be less profit driven because that is what they already are. 

On the javul initiatives wiki page here are some thoughts:

- For a ‚Äúvoting app‚Äù the problem becomes identity verification. You have to make sure that the people voting are who they say they are and that robots can‚Äôt begin casting thousands of votes. Voting in person is the historically strong way of verifying identity. However, progress has been made in technology with cell phone verification (although companies can have thousands of phone numbers), identity verification through questions (ie: what road did you live on, etc). Substantial progress has to made in verification to have any digital voting system become useful.

- For creating businesses owned by employees and customers, it requires that an algorithm with clear rules and guidelines be implemented to ensure that shares of the company are handed out fairly. Without a clear algorithm, there will ultimately become a top-down system of power in which the people with the most shares choose how shares are distributed, and people with the most shares never want to give any of them up. A way of awarding shares to customers for instance is to create a social media site where the people with followers own x percent of the company, where x is the total number of followers on the entire site divided by the number of the user‚Äôs total followers. Their percentage of followers is equal to their percentage of stock. The only issue with this is that the powerful people with the most exposure get the most followers and therefore the most money, which is basically how society already functions.  Could I code a website like twitter that awards share allocation equal to social media followers? Yes, probably. Would anyone use it? It would be hard without some serious marketing dollars or social media influencers promoting it. 

- To create a better ‚Äúoperating system‚Äù, you really want to make close-end devices that prevent apps and hackers from taking over the device and spying on all of a user‚Äôs personal information. Sure, there are ways to do this. But it requires not allowing apps to control a person‚Äôs camera or microphone, and who is going to want to use such a device when iPhone and android offers so many useful functions even though the level of algorithmic spyware is going to skyrocket in the decades to come. 

- For improvement in online commerce, the internet really needs an Amazon and eBay where the new website takes close to no fees. Because currently, both websites take over 9% from sellers for doing almost nothing. Could I code an eBay with zero to low fees? Probably. Would anyone use it? Probably not because who‚Äôs heard of it? Unless there‚Äôs huge marketing capabilities people will never become aware enough of such a service to make a true dent in the internet economy. 

Overall I‚Äôm sure I sound like a bit of a cynic. But then again I also have people downvoting my initial post here that says I want to live in a world where we don‚Äôt make plants and animals go extinct, where we don‚Äôt have wars, where people have homes, etc, etc. I mean, who would downvote such ideas? I just don‚Äôt have confidence in the current system to be able to even make a true dent in it without the right team of forces making it happen.

But if you guys have the right means, power and influence you could convince me otherwise. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre motivated to do good work. If you decide that you want me to work on something that looks promising, feel free to dm me. And according to the javul initiatives website, they‚Äôre claiming to give money to people to work on these projects. If they have money to give me feel free to let me know.",1569888123

I alternate between getting a job that I'm truly happy and satisfied with, even if it meant working to 62-65 OR trying to save as much and cut down my FI number as possible and get the hell out of the rat race.

Sometimes it's worth leaving things be - there will never be another Titanic, launched in 1911, sunk on her Maiden voyage, going down into the crushing abyss with 68% of its passengers and crew (\~1500 people).",1569888123

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","We usually eat bacon and eggs at diners here in the U.S., and you can usually see the kitchen in action at a diner from the counter, which is where I usually sit.

I've had hundreds of breakfasts sitting at a counter in my lifetime, and any time my eye has caught sight of the flattop, hashbrowns are always cooking in rotation -- and usually bacon too, unless the diner pre-bakes bacon for a rush. Scrambled eggs are often prepped in advance and sometimes kept in rotation as well. Sometimes onions, too. The kitchen uses those same eggs for omelets, otherwise made to order. Some places use a flat top for the fried eggs, but they're usually made to order in a small skillet.  In any case, most eggs coming out of a diner kitchen in the U.S. can be cooked in well less than three minutes--poached, fried, or scrambled.

You can be all ""that's not proper,"" but I'd simply respond, ""that's not reality for me."" And I'd be shocked if breakfast joints in other countries didn't churn out eggs at the same speed Americans do.",1569888124

I don't know about you, but I think it would be pretty nice to have a major part of national culture built around some sort of community service instead of our current culture, which is mostly based on what we consume, where we came from, and who we hate, and I think some amount of top-down leadership in that is not a bad thing.

"DnD5CommunityRanger","t5_kmgfe","But Ranger is not a full caster, it's a half-caster. So the comparation should be made with the Paladin (which prepares a number of spells equal to half its paladin level + charisma, so it gets 1 spell per 2 levels, more with ASIs). Also of note is that the DnD Community is very vocal in that Sorcerer lacks spells known (there are many revisions who give them extra spells with its bloodlines), and Warlock can pick the Tome Pact to have a LOT more spells. Wizard also prepares level + INT.

All in all I think it is more ressonating with the class intentions (half-caster) to get a spell each other level, so spells are not one of the main concerns of the Ranger (a spell per level could give the feeling of being full caster, I don't know how to express this).  


Edit: Also I forgot to mention, the intention here is to give every Conclave 2 spells per tier, so that would cap at 23 spells, which I think is on the same level as the Paladin (and also giving more ""out-of-class"" or ""conclave-feeling"" spells would help with conclave fantasy).",1569888126

It really *really* does take a village to raise a child so find your village and lessen your load a bit. Parenting is about teamwork not pushing yourself so hard you break. Your kids will learn so much from you and if you teach them how important self care is, they will grow up to be adult who know how to take care of themselves.

Because it's less clunky than the mod was there's this expectation that *must* mean they've completely dumbed it down, when it's still packed full of mechanics that I'm almost certain people miss completely or just take for granted as they've been introduced over time. For a game of this scope, and not limited to a specific niche like Tarkov is (no open world, only a dozen players per server, no vehicles/basebuilding, and so on), there's still a lot they manage to pack in this game and get no credit for, focusing only on the negatives that come as a result of being the most ambitious one by far, trying to juggle and get everything in. 

Plenty people critical of the game admit to, or betray the fact that they're not even playing it, so no need to go there. Hate to take it down this route as I'm not looking for a battle, but your series always struck me as it highlights little spoken about aspects, or the fact somewhat understood mechanics are deeper than suspected.",1569888128

I've seen other posts where people are trading within their Roths. That's why I assumed you were too. 

I just continually max VASGX in my Vanguard Roth (which automatically rebalances since it's a characteristic of the fund) and I max my Fidelity 401k. I do manually rebalance my 401k however. 

Used to trade in my TDA and Vanguard taxable accounts, but have become waaay more conservative for my age group with a current 60/40 equities/bonds allocation across all my accounts. I'm also growing my 13+ months of cash in VMFXX. Hoping prices drop soon and if I don't lose my job in the next Recession, I will pounce on good deals.

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","Seek legal advice is probably the best course of action.

Legally the landlord is liable (I'm assuming you are renting) as your contract is with them. The landlord may not be responsible for the building envelope (building management typically is) but the landlord has the responsibility to sort that out.

I'm aware of one case where a landlord had to leave a property empty due to an issue that the building management were responsible for. The buding management company ended up covering both the cost of the repair work and the lost rental income due to the issue not being resolved.

Some good suggestions here: https://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-during-your-tenancy/standards-and-repairs/
https://www.threshold.ie/news/2011/10/25/threshold-advice-for-tenants-coping-with-flooding/

If this was me, I'd notify the landlord of your intent to vacant the property due to the issue and that you need alternative accommodation until the issue is resolved. At the same time, inform the local authority and indicate the issue has been outgoing without resolution for some time.

If I could afford it (and the landlord wasn't prioritising the issue), I'd find short term accomodation (even a hotel) and notify the landlord that you expect them to cover the cost. The key thing here is less about the money and more about the pressure it will create to resolve the issue. The landlord should be able to recoup the costs from insurance or the building management company (if they are liable). Clearly not the tenants fault.

This stuff really sucks so hope you get sorted.",1569888131

Went upstairs to add a box to one of the bedrooms, and the wife up there removes the child from the room so I can show the husband all the porn channels and how to set parental locks. 

At least they were setting parental locks, but still one of the strangest things I've ever encountered.

Executive Branch have oversight of the Judicial Branch.

Judicial Branch has oversight of the Legislative Branch.

Legislative Branch has oversight of the Executice Branch.

Basically, the courts rule over whether or not a law has been broken. But before the court can make a ruling it needs a prosecutor to make an indictment, which is not in their purview. That's a responsibility of the Executive Branch, namely the Attorney General. The A.G. can't exactly indict the President, that's like trying to fire your boss. So in order to work around that, Congress has the power to impeach members of the Executive Branch.

If the impeachment falls flat, which it likely will unless more evidence comes out, there won't be any legal consequences for Trump. 

As a side note, you have to be put through trial and found guilty in America before any legal consequences happen. Trump hasn't been committed to any crimes by the supreme court. So there isn't any legal consequences he would have to face.",1569888132

If nothing else, Trump's presidency has been a lesson in what the President's 'rights' are. Or rather, virtually nothing is defined so theoretically the President's 'rights' are endless. It's a huge weakness that largely has been treated with respect, even veneration. Until Trump.

Does Trump have the 'right' to ask foreign leaders for dirt/assistance finding dirt on his political opponents? Legally, I suppose. Is it a conflict of interest and grounds for impeachment yet again? Undeniably.

Compounds found in some commonly ingested ""medicinal"" mushrooms have even shown promising in-vitro effects on cancer cells, antimicrobial properties etc. but this is in no way supports any medicinal benefits of ingesting the fruit body of the fungus. 

*""One of the problems is that the results of studies on single chemical compounds are unlikely to apply to the consumption of whole fruit bodies or concoctions made from dried mushroom powder. It is impossible, for example, to link the immunological consequences of injecting mice with cell wall polysaccharides to the expediency of drinking hot tea brewed from shiitake. Nevertheless, companies that market herbal medicines exploit references to studies on mice in their promotion of mushroom capsules and throat sprays for treating all kinds of ailments.""*

My wife even got mad at her friend for bringing dick-themed straws, candy, etc. We both went out with friends alone the same night, then both groups met up around midnight. 

All I'm saying is that for us, this would have been wedding-cancelled territory as soon as the foot stepped in the strip club. I'm not an expert at arguing the criminal degree between cumming in a towel vs. cumming on my fiance. Both seem worthy of not getting married.

I never said ""left good, right bad."" I, someone who most closely identifies with the democratic socialists, voted for a republican in a local election because I had talked with him and agreed with his methods of improving my local economy. Again, I'm unaffiliated, but definitely on the left.

That said, in the broader sense, the democratic party is for all intents and purposes a centrist party. There is a progressive wing which is gaining significant traction, but the DNC itself has a history of aligning with the center-right wing of the pool of candidates. Hillary, for example, was a low-calorie Bush in a lot of ways.

As for the problem of anti-intellectualism, I'll give the Democratic party a C and the Republican party an F. There are certain policies supported time and again by studies, and I've done some studies myself. Food stamps, for example, have an economic return of 170%, or, in economics, what we call a multiplier of 1.7. Tax cuts on the rich, on the other hand, have a multiplier of 0.3, meaning that 70% of the money is essentially removed from active circulation.

The Thwomp run at the start was pretty fun. I think using the custom scroll feature to ease the player into the fast speed and keep the camera more focused could improve the section, but it was still satisfying to beat.  

The 2nd section was very messy and felt impossible until I found a hidden Star to run through the fire. There were just so many hitboxes and the bumpers make controlling yourself super annoying.  

The autoscroll part after also could've used some easing in, but this time it felt random and like it wasn't possible without damage boosting.  

The boss fight had lots of spam and I felt lucky after beating it, not skilled.  

Also I was confused by the Super Mario Kart music randomly coming in and out (You can attach music/sound effects to Mario himself and it'll be constant).

Coming from a kid who was raised by my stepdad, I think the way that she's handling it is wrong.

I think the whole meal thing is a little petty, but it's the way that you are trying to make a point.  If you're having that many problems then it might be time to re-evaluate your entire relationship with her.

Does left clicking a banker to bank count since it skips the mechanic of right clicking the banker and picking talk?

Does a stat timer count as bypassing the mechanic of keeping track of your stats ticking down manually?

Runelite already co operates with jagex on taking down plugins, they can just tell runelite what is ok and what isnt and then it's as simple as use whatever runelite has. 

They could do the same with OSB but I doubt OSB will listen considering it started this whole mess, so I guess they can just say use OSB at your own risk. Or they could file a cease and desist to OSB like they did when runelite first came out, despite runelite offering to talk with jagex and make their client comply with their guidelines. Strange they were so quick to jump on runelite but they let OSB get away with so much, tho they may have good reasons for it I'm no expert on legal stuff.",1569888138

As for your anxiousness there isn't much advice any one can give other than to just prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","I don't know why this got downvoted. I love venge mid. She gets so beefy and pushes so hard early, and your build is also fine. I I have done the 1/1/4/1 build many times and I stack a lot of agi early with a straight rush on 4x agi slippers, basically you're getting a big chunk of damage so early that builds into treads+yasha+Dlance, but each slipper is worth 30% more due to aura and you're hitting for like 120 damage at level 4. 

Like, sometimes you just get a slipper delivered, throw out a wave, and the enemy mid comes to the wave and you Rclick them and they lose a quarter of their health, like, you just chunk them at level 4, stun to the face and they die.

The early Rclick power is downright retarded. I've won many games with venge snowballing early on Rclick power, and when you can deny your own ranged creep from 49% health in one hit... good fucking luck to the opposition, you end at level 8 to their 5 and theres no chance.

my usual build is to max stats early with WB+treads+Dlance+wand, and just take objectives. Drums, yasha into manta just amps your damage and you're so tanky that nobody can toe to toe with you, your manta is a decent escape, but also serves to safely push lanes, amping creeps with your aura to accelerate lane push...  But you can also go early BKB or hood of defiance to act as a tanky initiator or go for gank with an early SB or blink or medallion.... shit, she just has so many options.

I've learned to cheerfully say, ""I feel much better than I did!""

Also, we are allowed fifteen sick days per year, which is incredibly generous and, as someone with a couple of chronic health conditions, I am grateful. However, we get a strongly worded letter after five days and again after eight days, talking about how staff calling in sick puts burdens on other staff members, and the kids don't learn, stuff like that. If someone takes ten sick days in a school year, they have to have a meeting with their administrator to discuss an attendance improvement plan. As someone with a couple of chronic health conditions, one of which is covered under ADA, I got my doctor who oversees my care for that to write a strongly-worded letter to my superintendent saying why that was harassment.

So if you‚Äôd need 1 ¬Ω cups (180g) wheat flour for this, substitute about 1 ‚Öì cups GF flour. As for the xanthan gum, my rule is a scant 1/4 tsp per cup of flour, particularly if you also have more than 2 eggs since they help with binding. So, I‚Äôd recommend 1/4 + 1/8 tsp here.

If concentration camps can only refer to the German ones, then what should we call all the others in history?


What do we rename the British ones from the Boer war?
( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_concentration_camps )

How about Cambodia under the Khmer Rogue?


What the Nazis did was unimaginable evil.  It was tragic.   But calling other things concentration camps doesn‚Äôt lessen their evil any more then calling someone who kills three people a serial killer lessens the sins of Bundy or the Zodiac Killer. 


Part of the true horror of Nazis was that they were so calm and dispassionate about it. 

And part of the true horror is that Germany was by all accounts, a civilized society not that different from the US, or Canada, or the UK. 

By reserving the word concentration camps, we run the serious danger of saying that that true evil was something that could only happen there. 

That we are not always just a few steps from it. 


I am not saying that our current policy of holding people seeking refuge or asylum is any where close to what Nazi Germany did on any level. 

I am saying it‚Äôs wrong, and fits the meaning of the word. 


(And if you truly believe that the Nazis were special and that any country couldn‚Äôt be just as evil given the right circumstances, then I wish I had your faith in humanity. 

If there is one thing we as a species excel at, it‚Äôs finding ways to butcher efficiently).",1569888142

"wow","t5_2qio8","My personal theory is that there's something so horrible that Sylvanas said ""the Horde is nothing"" but meant ""compared to the threat we face you are doomed"". She said it in an exasperated frustrating tone because .... She's exasperated and frustrated with the other Horde leaders. From that Tauren Chieftain fucking up her plans to Saurfang who has always treated the undead like shit... 

My brother's theory is that because Blizz always goes ""step one: Fight champion of old god. Step two: Fight old God"", he thinks that Sylvanas is the next champion and soon we'll fight another old god

With the whole Blood-hoof thing he committed treason so that's not crazy to me. And then with the duel it's bullshit hearing some Orc go in about ""honor"" and especially dumb AF that people think ""no magic"" is a rule for every duel when we've had plenty of shams using magic. 

And as far as the magic tree.... Who cares? I mean I'm Horde, even if we weren't at war I wouldn't care. Of Alliance hate her for that I get it. But that's just old fashioned Alliance V Horde 

The one thing that may be legitimate as a complaint is that Sylvanas ordered the undead who participated in the Undead+Human meet-up to be killed. 

But to be fair to her *most* of the Hans treated their lost undead family like shit and every undead that tries to side with the Alliance is butchered. I mean still a dictator move admittedly. 

It's just that in that respect she's the same as 90% of the Alliance so I'm like ""lol""

I guess what I'm saying is she's not a good guy. She's definitely not the worst though but gets treated worse.",1569888142

If you're applying for 1st line type jobs, they won't care so much about technical ability anyway, since you won't be doing anything very technical. They will be more concerned with customer service skills, being able to work with people, and your enthusiasm.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","&gt;On the topic of tax deductions, how much gets reduced? Is it dollar-for-dollar? If it's not, is it a percentage? What's that percentage?

Are you speaking of business expenses? Business expenses reduce your overall taxable income - you are taxed on your net income, not gross.

There are also tax credits, which can lower the amount of tax that you pay. This affects only the payable tax, not the income the tax is based on. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;E.g. if I'm a small business owner, sole proprietor, and I buy business assets. Let's say 10k worth and claim that. Does the government take 10k less of my income that year? Probably not, but what's the Percentage?

That depends on what you buy. If its a consumeable, like paper, than its an expense and reduced your taxable income dollar for dollar.

If its a capital expense (e.g. a vehicle or a building or machinery) then its depreciates over time and you can only claim the depreciation as an expense. The percentage you'd use for depreciation depends on the asset class.

Darf ich dich daran erinnern das dein Originalargument war: ""Weil ich keinen T√∂tungsdrang habe, liegt es nicht in der Natur des Menschen""? Es gibt auch Leute ohne Fortpflanzungsdrang. Ziehen wir daraus den Schlu√ü dass eine zentrale Eigenschaft aller lebenden Organismen nicht in der Natur des Menschen liegt?

&gt; Willst du mir ehrlich erz√§hlen dass alle Tiere Neid haben? 

""Weil nicht bewiesen ist das *alle* Tiere ein √Ñquivalent von Neid haben, gibt es das nicht."" (Sch√§tzungen gehen von etwa 1-2 Millionen Tierarten aus. Kein Wissenschaftler w√ºrde verlangen, alle, die man auch gar nicht alle kennt, Tests zu unterziehen bis man eine Aussage treffen kann. So funktioniert Wissenschaft nicht). Ich belege, das Tiere diese Emotionen entwickeln k√∂nnen. Nicht das 100% der Tiere diese Emotionen entwickeln k√∂nnen.

&gt; Au√üerdem konnte man Primaten den Futterneid ab gew√∂hnen

Extremity by Warren-Johnson is amazing but I don't know how to describe it succinctly

Fairlady by Schermer is a fantasy detective story that got cancelled

Gideon Falls by Lemire is horror

God Country by Cates is about a magic sword kind of...

Head Lopper by MacLean is a viking fantasy which is great

Infidel by Pichetshote is an incredible horror story

Isola by Fletcher &amp; Kerschl is a really beautiful fantasy story about a tiger (kind of)

Low by Remender is a post apocalyptic underwater sci-fi and it's gorgeous

Orc Stain by Stokoe is about orcs and is a must read

Outcast by Kirkman &amp; Azaceta is a horror about possesion

Planetoid by Garing is a cool sci-fi and pretty short

Redneck by Cates is about vampires in the deep south

Rumble by Arcudi is amazing and again I don't really know how to describe it. It's fantasy I guess, but this one is also a must read IMO

Seven to Eternity by Remender is a beautiful sci-fantasy I think? The story is cool but it's worth reading for the art alone

Skyward by Henderson is about the earth after gravity disappears but it's kind of teen angst-y

The Weatherman by LeHeup is a really good scifi story that's just getting started

"bloodborne","t5_31k9i","You masterfully chose to skirt around the obvious, though. Weapons in Bloodborne do a lot of damage. *A lot*. A properly gemmed weapon kills in like 3 hits. And landing a hit in Bloodborne is extremely easy, just see the Saw Spear. That's not ""outmaneuvering"". The most typical no-heal duelists are Bloodletter users for example. They have to do nothing but dash attack, and you fail to dodge 2 for whatever reason and you're basically done, because you can't trade anymore and one more and you're dead. And yes, this is with 50 vit. What happens if you can heal, however? His insane advantage is lost because of the inherent flaw of the weapon: it can't be transformed easily, so he's suddenly bad at punishing heals. And this balances the whole ordeal. And of course that's just an example! No heal duels promote luck, because if you get a good hit in, say, an R2, the match is basically yours, thanks to how trade potential works. With any weapon! Meanwhile Heal duels make the fights last way longer, and so, skill can suddenly appear. Because you do not need 1 good hit, you need several. Every time you make someone get close to death (which is, again, 2-3 hits) you get a massive chance at closing the fight. There's no luck involved there, just get better at heal parrying. It is pretty consistent. And you can always finish them off with a regular hit as well.

Something that is indeed a flaw in the system is the whole ""running away"" aspect. You know, when the game came out and the PvP scene half-formed (it never truly developed) the heal duelists had the rule that you couldn't hide behind objects to heal and such. This has been pretty much lost except in reduced circles where the best PvPers are. If you suddenly can't just try to backdash away 16 times in a row to heal behind stairs like every second Mensis duelist does, *avoiding* a heal parry becomes much harder and skill based.

No heal dueling is only worth it on controlled environment where people use weak or no gems. As long as people can put 3 32% Thrust gems on a Holy Moonlight Sword and things like that, No Healing and the excuses people use to justify it are completely foolish.

And in an invasion, well, you don't want to die do you? Heal, backdash 16 times in a row, hide to heal, do whatever. The invader will do whatever too, and that's the charm of invasions, which aren't supposed to be duels.",1569888148

Indians almost always eat fresh because the culture is still like 1950s America where the man works and the housewife cooks. India also doesn't have a climate which forces Indians to store food for the winter. 

Indians use spices because they taste good and smell fucking awesome and are readily available. Maybe the spices have other properties like antibacterial or digestive properties but they are happy coincidents, the primary use for spices in India is flavour.  All that talk of ""hiding foul food in bad climate"" sounds like Eurocentric nonsense trying to over explain things in a foreign culture.

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","&gt;Spirituality advising against this is just ego and repackaged religion to control.

With all due respect, you have fundamentally misunderstood spirituality. Spirituality is the search of knowledge from within. Spiritual wisdom is not something you can be told by someone else or scripture, it is something you have found for yourself and agree intuitively. Don't get me wrong but I believe  you have formed this opinion on the base of what other people have told you (because you don't agree with it), you have not found the answer for yourself.

I will give the answer I have found but I encourage you to contemplate this for yourself

&gt;You can be a rich baller and be spiritual at the same time.

Absolutely true but it's the way you look at money (without attachment, or greed) and your life that is what changes. Spirituality allows a person to remain high spirits whether they are rich or poor. The power of contentment. This doesn't mean you give up the pursuit of wealth it just takes a back seat because you realise the real wealth is within yourself.

&gt;avoidance of wanting to be a billionaire or having many large homes and cars and possessions

With more material wealth, comes its own problems and when is it every going to be enough.

I will leave you with one line from Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh Scripture). You should contemplate and find your own positions.

"gamecollecting","t5_2s8fe","I live in New England. Humid in the summer, wet in the other months. I have a ~700 sq ft. unfinished basement I've been converting into an office/ gameroom.

When I first decided to make it livable space, I purchased [this upright dehumidifier](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Keystone-Energy-Star-50-Pint-Dehumidifier-with-Electronic-Controls-in-White-KSTAD50B/205167137?MERCH=REC-_-pip_sem_mobile-_-207015203-_-205167137-_-N).

To minimize mold and make a space livable, the air needs to be kept at or below 50% relative humidity. When I started, it was consistently over 65 -- and frequently in the 70s. It now hovers around 44.

Keep in mind it pulls a fuck-ton of water out of the air and you'll constantly be emptying the basin if the space is naturally damp. I installed a hose from the outlet on the dehumidifier that drains directly into the sump pump basin (another staple for keeping things dry).

Overall, I've been very happy with it and its actually helped me decide to go forward with converting the space.

I'd be happy to share some pics if anyone's interested.

Edit: Because this particular dehumidifier doesn't have a way to dial in the threshold,  I also got [this Humidistat](https://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-APSCD-Dehumidifying-Humidistat-White/dp/B01N30Y0F4/ref=pd_bap_m_rp_16?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01N30Y0F4&amp;pd_rd_r=0c67a458-f4ae-45f3-8630-b424f82f85aa&amp;pd_rd_w=8TMQ1&amp;pd_rd_wg=eQgeQ&amp;pf_rd_p=c3219280-80f4-43e6-abee-1a8cf87bc0ee&amp;pf_rd_r=NE3EWWM1KXD0DXX5YFZJ&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=JB6Y46SR808FWS0HWZSB)",1569888150

(which is my weakness) :)

loose around 8lbs: ""only"" ended up losing 4-5 but that's ok!! that's the most i've ever had.

stay in calorie goal: did pretty good in this area.

beat BED: one month binge free for the first time in almost two years!! (let alone a week)

10-15k steps: eh i could've done more each day.

stick with IF: got 30/30 days with this one.

It was a normal thing to us who lived in the city, they advertised their chimpanzee with signs and people came from all over to see him.

One time Moe bit someone and the family had to put him in a sanctuary. So the family put up all types of signs saying things like ‚Äúbring Moe home‚Äù in front of their house. Then things got really bad after the family went to visit Moe for his birthday, the family was attacked by two other chimpanzees that were out of their cages. While they waited for Moe to come out. The husband was left mutilated and disfigured. 

It was one of the craziest thing that happened in my city. It was all everyone could talk about, and even then I remember seeing those signs that said ‚Äúbring Moe home‚Äù after the attack.

Same goes for the ending to a lesser extent. There have been plenty of episodes where the characters are in too deep to reasonably escape a situation, so they just make some shit up. That‚Äôs the advantage of being an animated sitcom with little to no carryover story episode to episode. The one when Brian, Peter, Joe, and Quagmire get amnesia comes to mind here.

Near the end of the war when it was pretty much inevitable that the Third Reich was going to get rekt there were other assassination attempts once again not because they thought Hitler was evil but because if they did so it might allow them to surrender to the Allies and Soviets under their own terms, thus none of their war crimes would have been investigated and the process of Denazification would never had taken place.

Samoa‚Äôs game plan was cynical, committing fouls in the ruck was all about slowing Scotland‚Äôs game down and preventing quick recycling and quick line speed, frustrating Scotland. 

Absolutely not surprised Samoa did this and got away with it, they were doing it all game and not penalised by the ref. Which is the danger you run when you don‚Äôt penalise a team for being cynical.

Scotland should‚Äôve had another penalty try for the stopping on the line with the foot by the Samoa defender. The ref even refused to TMO that call for no reason whatsoever. 

There were a few dangerous tackles and risking other players safety that happened because the ref was scared of stopping or slowing the game, by which time Samoa had already got away with their game plan and was able to push the boundaries further of reckless and dangerous play.

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","I don't understand the logic of ""let's abandon our programmed plan we've been doing for countless cycles just cause some lowly human managed to get to the Citadel"". Like, why does that even matter at all? The Star Child could just be like ""Yeah congrats for getting here but I'm going to lock down all controls, get ready to lose bitch"". Obviously it wouldn't really talk that way but you see my point. Also, if the Reapers really wanted to do synthesis, they could have just built the Crucible and done it. They did not need organics to do it for them since they're way more advanced.

At least Indoctrination Theory actually A) acknowledges the Chekov's Gun that is indoctrination and B) all the weird obvious hints Bioware drops, like the Star Child looks exactly like the kid Shepard saw on Earth that just so happened to also be impossible to exist.

My personal favorite though is the one offered in this fanfic:  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7952484/43/Razor-s-Edge-Requiem](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7952484/43/Razor-s-Edge-Requiem). It offers a logical way the Reapers can be beaten conventionally. It's also a marvelous story in general so I highly recommend you read it. But if you don't care then I'll spoil it for you: &gt;!Shepard essentially threatens the Reapers with a bold plan to run asteroids into the mass relays with fleets he had pre-positioned, thereby blowing up all the Reapers and ensuring the next cycle continues unmolested. Since their tech is so puny, it follows that there is no harm in letting them freely activate the Crucible since the alternative is mutually assured destruction. Harbinger agrees and discovers that the Crucible's function to release its control of the Reapers, allowing the suppressed consciousness of the races that made the Reapers to gain full control, and they annihilate each-other in a fit of rage. !&lt;

Lastly, I'll just add that I would have preferred it if the Reaper's weren't explained. They're essentially supposed to be a Lovecraftian cosmic terror that is *beyond our understanding.* Being mysterious and unknowable on a cosmic scale is what made them interesting and horrifying to me. We don't even need to understand their motivation since the story is about how sapient life reacts to their presence. The choices we make, etc. Reducing them to a goofy galactic anti-virus running on a glitched loop of machine logic (let's kill people to save them) absolutely kills their villain presence. Which is a shame since that is something Bioware did so amazingly well in ME2 every instant Harbinger is on the screen.",1569888154

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","So I guess what I fail to understand (bear in mind I am new but own V5+Camarilla) is why Vienna was the only centralized point of the entire Tremere clan? I mean I understand the whole concept of the pyramid and the Vienna Chantry most likely had the council inside, but *surely* having almost the entirety of your clan fall apart because of one blow? I mean from a lore standpoint it's really interesting to see what happens if the fool pokes the bear (Arrogant Kindred vs the SI) but it just feels somewhat disheartening to me being somewhat less defined as an entirely outsider clan.

That is exciting news to hear about possible future Thaumaturgy for V5, because that is where things get creative. I unfortunately want to explore Thaumaturgic powers in my game, but V5 is rater ambiguous to what effect Vampires can still use it. As I want to be genuine with my story first time I go to do this, I at least want get it right if that makes sense? That's why I turn to Reddit when I can't figure something out.

The fact that the dog responds to the e-collar immediately in the  presence of the trigger could just as likely be explained by the intensity of the stimulus. You say it doesn't hurt but then by is the mechanism is the behavior modified?  I will grant that  there are graduated levels of pain, but with positive reinforcement there are also graduated levels of pleasure.  Just as there is a difference between a 1 and 10 setting on a collar there is a difference  between a piece of kibble and a piece of steak. My point being that in either case it is safer to start with indoors and gradually work your way up to the presence of the trigger so you don't have to rely on a more intense and therefore risky (if aversive) stimulus",1569888157

"Actingclass","t5_n7rr8","I don‚Äôt find auditioning ‚Äúbeing‚Äù, instead I think it‚Äôs ‚Äúacting.‚Äù  I really think it‚Äôs a whole other piece of art.  I just don‚Äôt think there is enough time in the 4-24 hrs you get between getting the sides and the audition to dive into a character.  I can write their whole backstory in a night, but to live it? Make sure those experiences feel real? It‚Äôs just not enough time.  However, can I substitute the situation I(as my character) find myself in with a different one?  One that will give the same type of intensity and stakes required for the casting director?  
Also meisner‚Äôs focus is so much on listening and reacting, but what do you do when you‚Äôre reader isn‚Äôt giving you anything? Or drops their line? Or is taking too many pauses in the dialogue?  A master meisner actor can weave through this scenario.  I unfortunately can not.  Instead I focus on the choreography of the audition.  Hitting my mark, making sure my eyeline is right, giving them multiple choices that show off my range.  So all my pauses, breaths, choices, they are all calculated/polished.  It‚Äôs let‚Äôs casting/director/producer know I‚Äôm a professional on set and can do what is asked for me.  Once I get cast, I don‚Äôt have to worry about being perfect anymore.  Now I can concentrate on the work.  On my scene partner.  On listening, reacting, being.  

This isn‚Äôt something that works for everyone, actually I don‚Äôt think it works for most people.  But you have to do what works for you, in my opinion lol. So every monologue you see me do, I‚Äôm using the Mesiner technique.  If you want, I can send you one of my auditions where I use good ole Stan.",1569888159

same could apply to Stein, Loony or Collins. 

Sabonis have been and will continue to be an on going discussion. depends on how both players perform and their market value mid season.

Cs control JBs rights for the next 5 years, they won't have an interest to reduce their asset pool so Galo for example won't fit this window.

It‚Äôs happened when I‚Äôve had very vivid dreams too and I wake up- I can‚Äôt see out of my right eye- only my left eye can see. I‚Äôve looked in the mirror (this has been going on years, and I‚Äôve had a lot of time to examine it) and my right eye is dilated, I can move it- but it‚Äôs black. I‚Äôve spoken to a doctor about this (didn‚Äôt say I was in a trance) and they actually worried it was my autoimmune disorder, so they took scope through my right leg and up behind my eyes to look at the blood vessels. Strangely enough, my LEFT eye has a cluster of ‚Äúabnormal blood vessels‚Äù - they explained it as being ‚Äúextra blood vessels, and a lot of them‚Äù but my right eye was normal.

"KalistaMains","t5_34nfa","The thing with sudden impact is, with kalista she will technically have it on permanently when hitting a champion because how the rune reads is like this.  
After a dash if you hit a champion, then you gain armor pen for 5 seconds. This has a four second cooldown. Technically if you hit someone every 4.5 seconds you will have it permanently active and will even get 14 lethality(though for a super short time). Vs ToB which gives around 18-35(AD\*.2), health per proc, and this can only happen every 20 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

From what i've taken from this discussion and everyone here is that, ToB is better if you want to trade periodically in lane. While Sudden Impact is better if you are gonna be fighting longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I get some free time, ima take it into a few games and compare the value of the two. Im not a very high elo player though im only gold. So if you want to help that would be appreciated. It's always good to try new things, and getting some help would be nice \^.\^",1569888161

I totally get where you're coming from. Money is likely very tight for you both, without an additional loan on top of mounting debt. That said, your doctor isn't the one feeling the pain- your husband is. I understand being hesitant with money, but if your husband is already suffering from PTSD- his mental health is going to be tanking. I think you have this part backwards when you said his mental health is confounding his pain. If he's in so much pain that he can't work, then his pain is very real and it's likely making him worse emotionally. 

I hate to be like this, but living in pain daily with mental health problems usually results in suicide attempts, and men are often successful. Your husband clearly needs help- whether it's physically with another back surgery or emotionally with some counseling. 

I know it's difficult because of the money, and I wish there were easier things that could be done. Best of luck.",1569888161

Did you ever think maybe he's talking about you? Maybe he needs to vent about his parents who do things like harass his therapist for private, personal information? Maybe he's trying to maintain what relationship you do have by not divulging, or maybe the therapist is helping your almost adult son prepare to get the fuck away the second he's 18.

"TheGlowUp","t5_umlus","Your eye area can change your life. Never sleep on it.  Experiment with defined (but natural looking) brows.  You have a *gorgeous* smooth, complexion and large eyes eyes that you can max with long lashes (check out Latisse) or extensions. Whatever you do do not go for those clunky super dense stripper lashes unless you're going for that look in a night wut setting. Its about 100+ to do the lashes individual set by a pro but you wont be able to stop looking at yourself 

For the wig, you need to remove detection at the hairline so maybe a finer lace, plucked for proper density. Application is key, you need it to ""melt"" down. It's too ""high"" and obvious right now with the sudden high density telling us it's a piece.  You can avoid ""baby hairs"" which you don't need as a professional anyway but the plucking and melting down is still critical for a natural look. Theres a bunch of guides on youtube and IG for this or you can always go to a pro.

Also, you want to select styles, even this one, that exude health. Shiny healthy groomed hair is your friend.

I don‚Äôt think any of the people sitting in on Trump‚Äôs calls are perfect, blameless souls. What matters is who is the most credible and who has testimony that is backed by evidence.  The whistleblower doesn‚Äôt have a record of lying to the American people over 7 thousand times, so that puts them way ahead of Trump. They haven‚Äôt contradicted themselves multiple times within a 3 minute segment on cable news, so that puts them ahead of Gulliani. And their account is corroborated by the official notes of the call that have been released, so that‚Äôs a mother fucking bingo (IMHO).  That said, we‚Äôll see how the investigations pan out.

If the American voters chose 45\*, and American voters chose to keep the senators who are propping him up  (ie, Devin Nunes, Mitch McConnell, et al.), **and** they support the people in the appointed positions (such as Barr and Pompeo), **and** they are still against impeachment, then perhaps that's just part of how democracy works? If the country collectively turns their heads away from the fact that serious laws are being broken by our leaders, then maybe that just means that the country is undergoing a certain kind of revolution (or paradigm shift...I don't know the right word to use here). 

For instance, if Beto was president and forced a buy back program for automatic weapons, then there would be a valid perspective that said Beto is enacting a law that goes against the second amendment in the constitution and breaking one of the fundamental rights granted to us. However, I would support that incidence of the executive branch ""breaking the law."" 

My point is: democrats believe 45\* broke the law (many laws, many times), and there are many ""talking points"" (backed with evidence) to support that perspective. Republicans also have talking points to justify their perspective that all of this is perfectly fine. So if they have the most votes, then they win. They can break the law as long as the ends justify the means (to them). Just like I would support Beto's measures to take all the killy guns away from people, even though I do understand the perspective that the measure goes against the law. 

For the last year or so I have decided that America is going to get what we deserve. If we have allowed corruption to run rampant in politics, and we continue to vote for representatives that will not serve our best interests, and we haven't educated people well enough to be able to think critically (because government seems to always lop off education budgets, which we allow to happen), then fuck us. We get what we deserve. We reap what we sow.

I was mad and went back to the dr and switched to vyvanse. I did ramp that up but it just caused me too much anxiety (you never can tell, many switch to vyvanse because the other stimulant make them anxious) My doctor would not switch me back to concerta and I went cold Turkey.

"HistoricalWhatIf","t5_2si7z","&gt; I think his Parthian campaign would ultimately kill him. The Parthians were able to beat the Romans in the field multiple times, and their superior mobility would give them a distinctive advantage in a protracted war. 

Not sure I fully buy that reasoning. The Romans nearly annihilated the Parthians just about 150 years later with roughly equivalent military technology. It seems to be that the Roman performance against the Parthians depends most heavily on the quality of leadership, and Caesar is by all accounts a military genius likely surpassing that of Trajan.

I don't know enough about the relationship of Caesar in this time period to the Kings of places like Osroene, Adiabene, and Armenia, but I think his performance in a long campaign against the Parthians also requires a very good diplomacy game, considering how dependent Romans would be on these border nations for food and guides through the land. Caesar is also identified as a skilled diplomat by his contemporaries, so I'd give him an advantage here over the Parthians. But I'm curious to see where OP goes with it.",1569888170

&gt;its because of a large amount of geo-political studies context

...like what? How does geopolitical studies context mean that a single quote, from a guy known to completely contradict himself regularly, is enough to determine what the actual goal is? Honestly, this really is the rorschach presidency, it's like people just attribute exactly the policy ideas they want to Trump, regardless of his actions or previous comments that completely go against it.

&gt;Snopes has been wrong many times before

As has Foodbabe, a blog that engages in pseudoscientific nonsense. Foodbabe also clearly has an axe to grind, considering the articles they're pointing to are for false claims of their own that Snopes fact checked and referred to, rightly, as false. Foodbabe is also just making up accusations with zero evidence, again, something that should be suspect to anybody. ""Everyone who calls my baseless claims false is a Monsanto agent!"" should really start ringing a person's bullshit detectors. 

&gt;I have had media literacy for a long 

You're doing a really poor job demonstrating it. 

I just want to point out one of the most ridiculous things I read in that article:

""This is treading too close to the line of censorship and can stifle our freedoms to express our ideas.""

No, Snopes teaming up with Facebook to fact check the constant stream of bullshit is not censorship. A person's lies or misinformation being fact checked, and shown to be false, with evidence and sources to back it up, is not censorship. You can say whatever you want, you can lie about whatever, you do not have a right to have your lies and misinformation hosted with someone's else's property and you do not have a right to not have your lies criticized and called out as lies. Foodbabe should be fucking ashamed of themselves here (they should have been a long time ago, but this is some next level burying their head in the sand). 

Again, you really don't seem to understand media literacy, at all. You don't seem to understand what makes a source reliable or credible, and place random blog posts with no evidence, filled with speculation and opinion, on the same level as credible articles that cite their sources and provide evidence for all claims.

What makes you believe fucking Foodbabe is a source that should be taken seriously, while Snopes should be summarily dismissed and any evidence or sources provided completely ignored?",1569888172

"ratemysinging","t5_4biks","To add to the above, you have such a solid foundation to your sound and you are incredibly expressive in your voice and body. At your age (under 18) it‚Äôs really great and sets you up nicely for considering a professional singing career. Having said that, there are two key issues that stick out. One of which was mentioned, the other of which you just addressed. First is the breath support, stay tuned on that, I‚Äôll come back to it, and brace yourself this is kind of a long one üòÖ but bear with me, it‚Äôs worth it. The second issue is tonality. For you, pitch seems to be wrong for three reasons, 1) breath support, 2) vocal health issues (likely cause by lack of support, but I‚Äôm assuming as you didn‚Äôt mention it) and 3) good ol fashioned practice. 

But let‚Äôs ignore pitch for a little bit because the breath support one is a huge topic that will help whatever vocal issues you‚Äôve been having, regardless of whether they are due to singing stress or genetic. And here I‚Äôll apologize again for the length of this comment, please let me know if anything is unclear, I‚Äôd be happy to talk with you about what I mean:

Something that changed my world was learning what the diaphragm is and how it actually works. I know I was told wrong all through middle and high school, and in hindsight I still had 2 fantastic teachers and an amazing high school choral program, but they still taught wrong.

The diaphragm is a shallow upside-down-bowl-shaped tissue that stretches across the bottom of your rib cage, under your lungs, and runs parallel to your hips, *not your abs*. It‚Äôs connected by muscle but is mostly membrane, which means you **cant** control it. Like physically there is nothing you can do to sing from your diaphragm. And even the mental image of doing so, while on the right track, still doesn‚Äôt set your breath up in a way that will help you, or even eliminate the tension that‚Äôs causing the vocal problems. Even worse, 9.9/10 singers I‚Äôve taught who claimed they were singing from their diaphragm, were all adding tension somewhere else in their body that can contribute to any number of other injuries. So let‚Äôs just throw that phrase out the window and never use it again, yes? Let‚Äôs call the act: breath support. 

Some people say breath control, it‚Äôs not wrong, but I prefer support because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre actually doing, supporting the breath as it leaves your body. ‚ÄúControl‚Äù comes with this subconscious pretense of holding something back and we don‚Äôt want that. 

So first, what is breathing: As you inhale, the muscles around your diaphragm pull tight and the bowl shape flattens. This creates a vacuum in your chest that stretches your lungs down, which creates a vacuum in them that allows air to flow in.

Exhaling is basically the same thing, the muscles holding the diaphragm relax, the plate pushes back up into a bowl, pushing your lungs, pushing the air out. 

So how do we support that? Make room for the plate. When you inhale deeply while laying down, you‚Äôll notice the bottom of your stomach seems to fill up instead of your ribs. *this is the most relaxed way of breathing*. 

What‚Äôs happening is your lower abs (and all the guts behind them) push out, which makes a little more room for that bowl shaped diaphragm to draw downwards towards your pelvis into the plate shape that makes the vacuum to fill your lungs. *this is the part you get to control, the lower abs*

**Breath Support: physically expanding the lower abs before you start to inhale, then keep them expanded while you sing so they‚Äôre already expanded before your next inhalation.**

This does several good things for you, your body, and most importantly, your voice. First, it alleviates tension out of your chest and shoulders that will end up in your throat. Second, it gives you command over the speed at which air passes your vocal chords which affects pitch, expression, articulation, overall health, and more. Third, it allows you to take a full breath and utilize the strongest stream of breath. And finally, it prepares your body for the next breath, allowing you to breath deeper, faster, which means less breaths in the middle of phrases and better overall musical line.

If you‚Äôd like further reading, this breath technique is called ‚Äúappoggio breathing‚Äù and is one of the most widely used singing techniques for music theater and opera.

And again, if any of this didn‚Äôt make sense, or you‚Äôd like more detail, or want to talk about how to practice pitch or anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask, I can talk for hours on this. Great job again, you‚Äôve got a ton of potential to be a really amazing singer",1569888172

To a certain extent he's ""right"" in the sense that NASA should be doing the tasks that industry wouldn't necessarily want to or are not economically feasible for a profit-oriented entity to engage in and NASA shouldn't have to rely on private companies doing that job.

Ex: NASA should have experimented with reusable rockets and pushed them rather than SpaceX needing to come along and do it.

Ex: NASA shouldn't be making simple orbit-rockets, they should be focusing on what they can do with the rockets they can buy, such as constructing a proper interplanetary ship in orbit that's optimized for a pure spacegoing existence.

There might also be just a hint of annoyance that in the PR war between SLS and things like Starship/New-Glenn, Musk in particular is not terribly concerned about stepping on toes when he points out the capability discrepancies. An example was in the presentation the other day, when he was asked about the NASA admin's complaint about them spending effort on Starship when the Commercial Crew program is behind schedule, and Musk's response is ""Did he say Commercial Crew, or SLS?"" and gave an amazing troll face to the camera.",1569888174

The only way I can sleep on a plane is with the tray table down, resting my head on that. If someone reclines their seat, I'm SOL. And I can't even sleep this way anymore because they make the spacing so small that I have to be in ""Economy Plus"" to do this, then hope and pray the person in front of me doesn't recline their seat! This really, really sucks on transatlantic flights that are really only offered as a red eye.

So, being honest, I think it's an asshole move for reclining your seat because it digs into the small space someone else has. I also, equally think it's an asshole move not to be able to recline your seat when you want to (even though this is not my preferred flying configuration). Therefore, ESH, but mostly the airlines for not just giving you the decency of enough space to breath.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

&gt; SINGAPORE - An immigration offender, who was facing money problems, armed himself with a chopper, fake gun and bogus bomb belt to try and rob a pawnshop in Boon Lay.

&gt; But former construction worker Sheikh Md Razan failed to coerce the employees of a ValueMax outlet in Boon Lay Way to hand him any valuables.

&gt; The Bangladeshi fled empty-handed but left behind his ""bomb belt"" during the failed robbery attempt on July 28 last year.

&gt; It prompted officers from the Bomb and Explosive Branch to be sent to scene, and exits at the nearby Boon Lay MRT station were also shut for more than two hours as experts inspected the device.

&gt; They were reopened after police found the ""bomb belt"" did not contain any explosives, a district court heard on Monday (Sept 30).

&gt; Razan, 30, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years' jail with 18 strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to one count each of attempted armed robbery as well as exhibiting the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" when committing the offence.

&gt; He also admitted to overstaying in Singapore for more than 200 days, being in possession of a forged work permit and using a second bogus work permit to seek illegal employment here.

&gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua said Razan hatched his robbery plan last year.

&gt; She added: ""The accused decided to disguise himself with a turban as he had observed that his Sikh roommate's face was partially covered when he wore his turban. He also thought that he could throw the police off his trail by disguising himself as a member of a different ethnic group.""

&gt; On July 27 last year, he made the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" by using such items as a metal pipe and components from a battery-operated toy dog.

&gt; The next day, he went to the pawnshop around 4.30pm. The outlet had about $72,000 in cash and more than $15 million worth of jewellery.

&gt; The court heard that he showed its employees the fake bomb before ordering them to place money and jewellery inside his bag. But none of the workers obeyed his orders. Instead, they tried to get away from him.

&gt; Realising his plan was falling apart, Razan removed the fake bomb belt from his waist, placed it on a counter and fled.

&gt; The outlet's branch manager, thinking the ""bomb belt"" was real, grabbed it and flung it towards an open space outside the shop before calling the police. Officers found the device was a fake.

&gt; Meanwhile, Razan changed his clothes and shaved off his facial hair to alter his appearance. To shake off the police, he also took four different buses and a taxi to get away.

&gt; He was arrested at Sultan Mosque on Aug 1 last year after a five-day islandwide manhunt.

&gt; On Monday, DPP Chua urged District Judge Teo Guan Kee to sentence him to at least 3 1/2 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane.

&gt; She said: ""While the accused may have failed in his planned heist, his actions caused considerable disruption and disquiet to the unsuspecting public. Exits at Boon Lay MRT station and Jurong Point had to be cordoned off and shut down for more than two hours as the authorities dealt with the threat from the accused's imitation bomb belt.""

&gt; Defence lawyer Siraj Shaik Aziz, assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, said his ""genuinely remorseful"" client is determined to turn over a new leaf and restart his life in Bangladesh

&gt; Offenders convicted of attempting to commit armed robbery can be jailed up to seven years and caned.

If you own one, hang on to it no matter what.  If you can buy one, do it.

The BMM lore clearly states that these are heirloom items.  There has been a lot of speculation that buying one in game will not be as simple as walking up to a dealer and placing an order.  The theory, and it is just that but solid with lore, is that you will need to build reputation with a Banu clan before being able to purchase one of these in game.

If I am right, then bonus to those who planned ahead like me.  If I am wrong, well then you still end up with one of the coolest ships in the game.  Its a win win ;)

I say buy as many as you can.  I had 3 in my hangar for a while, but upgraded one recently.  Have a couple in buy back and CCU options that I will fill before they start beta.  Great in game commodity.",1569888176

I actually want all round stones but I love the simplicity and proportions of hers and how it looks on her hand! I was thinking 8.5 mm center stone but I'm not sure exactly what size side stones - I was thinking around 0.25-ish carats? I don't want them too big and taking over the center stone but don't want them to get lost either. 

I got an [at home trial](https://imgur.com/a/1Umq3f3) \- the center stone was equivalent to 1.5 carats and the side stones were 0.1 carat each I believe and I thought they were way too small for the ring and that the center stone was too small for my huge fingers. 

If I got side stones at 0.25 carats or even bigger would the moissanite still not be as sparkly?  I'm totally cool with doing either moissanite or lab diamonds, I just wonder will they look similar enough to the center stone if I do the lab diamonds or will they look super different? Is that what you have for your side stones? 

I'm totally fine with a 2 mm band! I prefer danty but like I said I don't have the dantiest hands so I'm sure 2 mm would look totally fine and still plenty thin enough for my liking.

And a labor power standard simply means basing currency off this commodity that is labor power through a job guarantee programme. 15$ = an hour of labor power for instance, if the minimum/ job guarantee wage is 15$/hour. 

(This simply explains how a job guarantee does this) a job guarantee anchors the value of currency to labor power by abolishing the reserve army of labor and forcing capitalist enterprises to reach or go above the job guarantee wage. This allows the government to do two things: affect prices by having direct controle over markup and wage as well as effect the melt (monetary expression of labor time) by having controle over price levels as melt is simply the price level multiplied by productivity.

As for snlt, if you're talking about the labor value of the labor power of a worker, than the snlt for labor power is just as large, if not larger, than the snlt for gold or any other rare metal. The ammount of labor needed to maintain the workers labor ie: food, housing, healthcare, etc. Is huge. In fact, this means that labor power is better than gold or any other commodity for being the money commodity as, with gold for example, improvements in the production of gold mean that the currency value falls, but with labor power there would need to be major improvements in multiple sectors of the economy in order for its value to fall. 

If you are talking about dead labor or industrial tech than this does not matter as this is not labor power. the only thing that creates value is human labor, dead labor only increases the productivity of the workers. If a capitalist spends money in production, ends up with a sum of commodities, and then sells them for more money than what he put in, it may seem that the capitalist made profit by simply buying and selling, but all that happened was that commodities switched hands. But with the worker, he is paid to create value, but his pay is based off sustaining his labor, his life, which allows for the worker to produce more than what he is payed with the wage. 

As for capital, i have read the first chapter and plan on reading it full after finishing revolutionary strategy

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay he was this skinny, twig-like little white boy who wore the same red jumper every single day, with curly blonde hair... And literally everyone at school knew exactly who he was but no one knew him. It was a big school of about 6,000+ students, and you could grab any random kid in the hallway and ask ""do you know that guy in the red jumper who runs everywhere?"" And they always immedently knew who you were talking about because my god, this kid *sprinted full speed* down the hallway every passing period. He was ducking and dodging and weaving through crowds like a god damn expert. It was almost impressive how agile he got.

Anyway I got to senior year and I started to get curious about this kid. Why does he run? Why does he wear the same jumper everyday? Who is he? What is his name?

I asked some friend about it. Everyone knew who I was talking about, but no one knew his name or grade or any helpful information. I asked more ppl. Same result. I asked basically everyone I knew, and the most I ever heard was a girl who heard a rumour he shared a class with a different girl. 

 This is when I decided... My goal for my senior year... Was to *catch him*

I WANTED ANSWERS. And I knew if I left high school without them I would NEVER FORFIVE MYSELF. This kid was basically a school meme and cryptid. No one seemed to know his name, his grade, his classes... I asked hundreds of students and none of them even knew his name or shared a class with him.

I was starting to doubt his existence. At that moment I wouldn't have been surprised to discover he was a ghost the whole time.

So from that point forward I *chased that motherfucker down the hallway every time I saw him.* I just couldn't seem to catch him! He had years of practice dodging ppl in the halls. I had none. 

As we approached graduation I feared I would catch him... Then spirit week arrived. One of the themed days in spirit week is ""Senior Day,"" the seniors dress up like senior citizens, and it's always chaotic. Kids bring walkers and canes and hobble down the halls complaining about their ""replacement hip.""

Well, I was heading to class when I see it; that stupid red blur of his stupid fucking jumper as he bolts past. I run after him, and I think he's about to escape me once again when...!

Two senior kids start having a mock sword fight with their canes. Kids gather around to watch and it creates a wall of students, blocking his escape. NOW IS MY CHANCE, I thought! But I could see him looking for a different route, and as he turned to take a different path, I grabbed his arm.

He startled like terrified rabbit seeing a dog for the first time. His eyes were blown wide and he gave me this baffled look like he was surprised my *humble mortal form could touch his ethereal being from this side of the vail.*

Panting and out of breath, I know I only have a few seconds to ask my questions because *surely* a ghostly being such as himself cannot be on our plane for long! I ask, ""why do you run everyday?""

And I think, *god, please impart your wisdom on me, you higher ethereal being! I worked so hard for this moment! Got way too much exercise!*

He says, deadpan, ""because I love running."" Then takes off like the majestic supernatural being he is.

*NEVER* in my *LIFE* have I understood the phrase ""do what you love and don't let others' judgement stop you,"" more than I did in that moment. 

This *absolute legend* turned himself into the school meme, a local cryptid, endured years of people shouting ""RUN FOREST RUN!"" at him as he sped past... All because he loves running.

I *never* saw him again, but I hope somewhere he's out there running, doing his thing, and not caring what anyone thinks about it because I respect that boy an *absurd* amount now!

And that's the story of the school weirdo, and how he taught me the true meaning of doing what you love and not caring what others think.

And my friend,,,, I still don't know his name, and I'm still not convinced he wasn't a ghost.",1569888185

English portions: @9:40, @24:15, @32:26.

**Summary Points**

* 10/1 will be a milestone of this entire movement.

* No one can mobilize everyone to come out/attend assemblies; some must have come out because their conscience was calling them.

* HKers do not desire or commit to terrorism.

* We hope the government will respond to public opinion after 10/1.

* @8:20 of the video:  ‚ÄúOn 6/9, we were 1 million strong.  On 6/16, we were 2 million strong.  What was our reason for stepping out without regret onto the streets?  The reason was, by the 70th Anniversary of the PRC, to show with our numbers to the Chinese Communist government, to the pro-Beijing HKSAR government, and to the world that Hong Kong persists in our pursuit of the Five Demands, not one less.  We would rather die than surrender, and will resist this cruel totalitarian government to the end.  This is the best of times, this is the worst of times.  We don‚Äôt know what the era will be like after tomorrow.  Regardless, this era has chosen us to create it.  Hongkongers, we once set a date, on the day we reclaim Hong Kong, we will meet at the bottom of the pot &lt;tr. note: the Legco building is shaped like a pot&gt;.  Tomorrow, will you step out with us to bring about that day?  Five Demands, not one less.  Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of an era.  October 1, celebrate their mother.  Thank you, everyone.‚Äù

**Q&amp;A**

Do you agree with the police that frontliners are violent?

* No.  We protect the peaceful protestors from being subjected to violence from police and pro-Beijingers.  The violent people are those who attacked ordinary civilians on 7/21.  They don‚Äôt need an excuse to beat people anymore, but Hongkongers will not be afraid.

What do you expect on 10/1?  Why is 10/1 a milestone?

* Since June, we have not known what the next day would bring.  But we believe that, with numbers, we will be safe.  The government is waiting for our numbers to dwindle but they will never see that day.  Five years ago, we didn‚Äôt know how we‚Äôd go on, but here we are today.  **Conscience has no expiration date.**  10/1 is a milestone only because it‚Äôs a milestone for Beijing, for their face.  Beijing wants to show a peaceful, harmonious, celebratory face to the world, but if we can hold our voices through that date, our movement will live on.  After that date, we hope that Beijing will seriously consider how they are going to approach this situation.

* We don‚Äôt want bloodshed or arrests.  But if the police are out of control tomorrow, it‚Äôs up to them.  It was they who taught us that peaceful demonstration is futile.  But we sincerely hope that that won‚Äôt be the case tomorrow.

What do you want?

* When the Japanese troops finally left Hong Kong after WWII, a peace memorial was set up.  At the time, we want only to peacefully live our lives.  We want the same today.  We hope for a real peace, with input from our younger generation, with democracy and freedom.  We only want the freedom to live our ordinary lives.  What we want may be the world to a totalitarian regime.  But to an ordinary person, it is a very small request.  We want to say what happens in this city, to decide our future, it‚Äôs that simple.

What format?  Six districts across HK or one concentrated location?

* The format is unimportant.  What‚Äôs most important is the numbers.  Whatever you choose, the most important choice you make tomorrow is to stand up and step out for what you believe in.  Once you make that decision, all you need to do is watch the online messages like you normally do, and everything will fall into place.

Question from Taiwanese reporter:  Do you expect tomorrow to be violent?  The police said that they collected information that said frontliners are planning on killing police tomorrow.

* We very much appreciate Taiwan‚Äôs support, and we hope to be able to return the support if needed.

* Tomorrow, please try not to be injured or arrested.  On this eve before the storm, think of what you have achieved, and let your conscience guide your next steps.  We are not violent, they are.  We are not terrorists, they are.  We Hongkongers are not out to protect ourselves, but to protect each other.

&lt;Tr. Note:  Regarding the so-called ‚Äúinformation,‚Äù the police are relying on a Telegram channel.  But the Telegram channel is suspicious.  It was registered/named using Mandarin, which is not the dialect that Hong Kong uses (it is what mainlanders use).  Almost all of the messages on the channel itself is questioning the authenticity of the channel and its creator.  In sum, the protestors have NO PLANS TO BE VIOLENT, and the ‚Äúinformation‚Äù that the police pointed to is not reliable.&gt;

How will you sustain the movement after tomorrow?

* People sustains movements.  People follow their morals and conscience.  The CCP wants to suppress, repress, and oppress us.  If we weather through tomorrow and the White Terror, we will be able to go on.

What do you say to those who are losing hope?

* This is society‚Äôs movement.  It will take a long time, and may span the entire world.  It‚Äôs not just you.  You have all of us, too.  **We want to see everyone at the ‚Äúbottom of the pot.‚Äù**",1569888185

Have you ever convinced any one of anything ever? You might be the most pedantic, inane , and unconvincing person I've ever encountered. Impressive.

The reason you completely ignore it, is because you can't refute it.

Enjoy the many many ways to adjust CO2 outside of cutting emissions.

You might have the most pointless liune of argumention on reddit.

Nothing to say about your outright lies. ""thers no proof iut will scale up""- How dumb are you?

I''ll be setting your annoying ass to 'Ignored' from now on, but just know that you are already wrong, while ignoring the reality that cutting emissions that is enhanced by literally any other method of adjusting the CO2 equation, is not only a win, it is already in place.

When I was sixteen, my grandmom died of lung cancer. Last thing she ever said was that she wished she could have seen me--my parents were going through a fractious divorce, and I was in another state. Didn't even get to go to the funeral.

When I was 22, my granddad died of lung cancer. He was kinda a racist shit, but it still sucked.

A couple of years ago, step-grandma woke up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe. She died before the ambulance could get her to the hospital. Smoking-related airway distress.

About three weeks after that, grandpa was diagnosed with stage IV throat cancer. He didn't even fight it, he missed her so much. He died a couple of months later.

And in the middle of all this, my darling auntie, Mom's baby sister, only seventeen years older than me, was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. She'd been smoking since she was twelve. She died, horribly, at right around 50 years old.

This shit kills. This shit kills over and over and over and over and over. It's addictive as hell! I lived with a couple of smokers, down the years, and *I'm* addicted despite never having had so much as a puff; when I walk past someone who's smoking, the secondhand smoke makes my brain light up like a pinball machine, it feels *so good* to get even that little whiff.

On an individual level, I'd say my favorite was Tokihara. While she and Yuika both overstep comfortability and force their fetishes onto Keiki, I'd say she's slightly more tame about it. Nanjo would have probably shattered my confidence if I was in Keiki's shoes by telling me how pathetically average I was. Yuika is a little too boundary stepping in my eyes; and Mizuha is it's own deal.

I assume the last episode will detail Keiki struggling to figure out and sort through all of the feelings from the girls and his own, though I'm not expecting him to decide on much of anything.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Paying twice as much will continue regardless of the system we have if we continue over-budgeting resources provided to medical care.  The government has to lead in this actual cutting  of growth rates.

In the past 24 months twice the Democrats in Congress along with a few Republicans have said no to limiting the per capita funding increases in Medicare and Medicaid spending to the national inflation rate. 

Instead increases are tied to a higher medical inflation rate.  

It doesn‚Äôt matter the system if you don‚Äôt cut the growth of healthcare funding per capita. The vast majority of hospitals in America are officially nonprofit which means non-capitalist. The non-profit hospital prices are even higher on average than for-profit hospitals. Removing capitalism alone without cutting healthcare budgets per capita from all private and public sources will not decrease our cost.

Will Congress ever have the guts to do that? More specifically, will the majority of Democrats ever have the guts.


Number two, medical is not the biggest cause of bankruptcy. The study that launched that myth counted every bankruptcy that included any medical debt, even if medical debt was only 2% of total debts.

&gt;The answer they came up with will surprise even critics of Warren et al.: The fraction of bankruptcies caused by medical events is just 4 percent. And even among those bankruptcies, it seems that medical bills may be less of a problem than the other things associated with an illness, such as lost labor income.",1569888192

There was also the fact that Shaw was held captive, and a Dreadlord pretended to be him([part of the rogue orderhall was discovering this](https://youtu.be/O0bSrNpon18)), which likely influenced the decision as well. Legion had quite a lot of really nice nuance. Nuance that BfA now completely smashed.

Sylvanas intention was known only to her, and she went on the journey alone. The rest of the Horde was specifically ordered to focus on finding the pillar, aiding the war effort. 

In Legion's descriptions of the different main characters; Sylvanas was described as who she had to chose between doing something selfish or what was best for the people trusting her. With some heavy indication that she would choose the latter. This never really came to fruition though in game, but we latter saw her much more integrated in the Horde. *Though, i guess that's ""nothing"" now...*

"sorceryofthespectacle","t5_2zojk","Dugin internalized enlightenment values, his national bolshevism, and now seems to be returning to classical reactionary creeds, against good old conservatives like burke and hume (who more and more sound like liberals to our ears). He's a de Maistre fascist, and he is mixing old believer Russian orthodoxy with guenon and Evola, a potent fascism indeed. On the second point, I draw attention to these currents because they deserve to be known. If this is construed as promotion I can only say I dont hold people's judgement in such contempt. The myth of bad majorities is also a reactionary one. Ortega Y Gasset's revolt of the masses paints such a view, but conservatives always overestimate their own influence. That is why they pour so much money into their pathetic think tanks. The left doesn't even need to try to influence ideology because history is always on its side. The rise of fascism is a sign of a failed revolution, so any reactionary creed is also the sign of an opportunity to do away with barbarism in the form of democratic plutocracy and oligopoly. It is true I have something of an obsession with Traditionalism in general and that is because it provides answers, the wrong ones, to current social and political aporia that illuminate much more consicely the kinds of questions that the left should he raising. Instead, the left, as zizek almost alone points out, is further drowning in its own identity politics to the exclusion of all fundaments, and gets caught up in language games and the superficies of name calling while the world literally burns.",1569888196

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive &amp; spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct &amp; incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets &amp; capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

Remember guys, the above quoted is what leftists actually believe.

They're too stupid to understand basic concepts like Briffault's law, Hypergamy or even the fertility window.

**Refutation of the hard-cuck's argument**: 

Men can waste  their 20s and even 30s doing absolutely nothing and that's fine because the SMV of men is based neither on looks nor age and can be increased at any point in various ways.

Conversely, a woman's value is frontloaded from 18 to 24 and begins to decrease gradually. When she reaches 30 she starts to plummet and at 35 she hits the wall at full speed.

**tl;dr**

The above quoted is classic hard-cuck drivel attempting to white knight for the degeneracy of women, aka thots, sluts, whores, etc.... I say let them be garbage, the best part about young adult women is that while I get older, they stay the same age. Harr harr.",1569888197

"PCAcademy","t5_9qtyf","Well first step is to always be prepared with what you are planning to do with your commands. Necromancers tend to end up with a lot of undead (obviously) so they have a lot to control. If you wait until your turn to decide you end up wasting your parties time.

Next step. Chose a class. Just because the Wizard subclass is called Necromancer doesn't mean its the only option. There are also Death Clerics, and to an extent Spore Druids. If you wanted back into half caster realm you could go Oathbreaker Paladin, which is busted, but it isn't as much undead army as it is undead strike force. So with Necromancer Wizards you tend to focus on having all of the undead minions (preferably archers, don't want zombies in the way of fighter or zombies close to clerics). Death Clerics tend to be more of the do tons of necromantic damage while also having a bit of a minion hoard. Spore Druids have access to animate dead and also have like spore minions, not as familiar with them.

Second, the natural rights protected by the 2nd amendment are for all, regardless of race, sex, or any other background. Want to win the culture war over guns?

I can't remember which channel it was, but there is one of them that doesn't allow you to sort coverage by date. Meaning you'd have to spend hours clicking through, hoping to find something relevant. 

The coverage that is included in the timelines now is there because those outlets were easy to search and sort. You just go to their web site, and use the word ""delphi."" You don't even have to type in the word ""murder"" since there are so few stories about Delphi, apart from local football. From there, you sort by date, and it's easy to find the ones that are relevant and should be included. 

Many other channels have terrible search features. You search for ""Delphi' and get maybe 10 articles, one having to do with the murders, and the dates being all over the place. 

The methodology behind the timelines is to include the stories that were easiest to find. I'm going to guess a lot is missing.

It's why they're called ""guidelines"" and not rules. It wasn't meant to show the *best* diet, and guidelines are meant to be easily followed by, well, dumb people. Guidelines which came later followed the same principle.

Organizations like hospitals also use dietary guidelines, and they're looking for actionable information, and meals their patients will actually eat. No one needs patients refusing to eat because the food is unpalatable and proclaiming, ""But at least you know the truth!"" isn't helping anyone.

People who want the cold hard truth and the science will buy the books and come to places like /r/ScientificNutrition. Dietary guidelines are meant for everyone else.",1569888203

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Sorry to jump in here again--they can put whatever they want about when the lease is 'binding' but it's irrelevant. You're in a rent-stabilized apartment and your tenancy is legal and continues until the landlord gets a formal judgment of eviction against you in housing court. Their failure to send a signed renewal lease in no way affects your tenancy. You don't stop having rights to the apartment just because they fail to send in the new lease; they all try this, especially if they're new and just bought the RS building, but as I mentioned below (sorry didn't see this one earlier), if they don't send a new signed lease, your legal rent is what you were paying in the old lease--they can't charge the renewal amount until they send the new signed lease.

Again, I'm not your lawyer, I don't practice in NYC anymore, I just have a deep and abiding hatred of NYC landlords on both a personal and professional level, but my advice to my old clients was and always would be:  keep copies of everything and as much as humanly possibly only communicate with them in writing--text, email, letter, etc.",1569888205

I would highly recommend putting the NVR and all it's networked cameras into it's own part of the network, not routable from anything else,  then put something like an rPI in front of it to act as an SSH gateway into the network. Then port forward a port to the rPI's SSH, then you can safely route to the box. This is not only to prevent the cameras from accessing your network, as well as keep them from reporting out. Many of these pieces of crap have DDNS systems built in, or come from China and have some dubious data collection/emission/retransmission.

If you still want to allow the NVR and it's cameras to access the network, but not the internet add this to your firewall script.

"Wellthatsucks","t5_2xcv7","&gt;A loophole exists in federal law under which ‚Äúany person may sell a  firearm to an unlicensed resident of the state where they reside, as  long as they do not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person  is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms‚Äù.

And yes, for what ive read background is checked, at least one thing is right. What about acttively doing a psychological investigation?

&gt;Out of 50 states, [35 do not require that gun owners hold a license, obtain a purchase permit, or register their weapons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state)

Hmmm...

&gt;Yes. It is legal to own a fully automatic Class 3 firearm. This is pursuant to the National Firearms Act of 1934 or NFA 34.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those  who wish to own a Class 3 weapon must undergo an extensive background  check by not only the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives (BATFE) but also their local sheriff's department. It's far  more extensive than the background check given for buying a rifle or  pistol. A $200 tax must also be paid for every Class 3 item that is  registered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and destructive devices are also included as Class 3 items.

Also, although it seems to be ""hard"", you can actually buy fully automatic weapons.

&gt;."" Even though the .50-caliber rifle is a military-grade weapon, federal gun laws treat it like any other hunting rifle, and Barrett can sell the gun to civilians ""

50cal? What are you going to defend yourself from with that?

&gt;""Albama has no law restricting assault weapons.""/neither does Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida--

Last updated in 2018 on [lawcenter.giffords.org](https://lawcenter.giffords.org),  The list goes on. Repeat me again, what use do you have for that kind?

&gt;...Census, that would mean that the country's 393 million guns are distributed among 50 million households. The implication is that the average gun-owning household owns nearly eight guns

I would have to assume theres no limits either. So you can not only buy them easily, but also have several?

&amp;#x200B;

Ands thats only the first few results, Im sure If I cared enough I could find the specific regulations for each state. Or did you thought I wasnt going to look for it? -- and no I have not a discord account btw

The fact is that even if you need to get background check for felonies and misdemeanors, is NOT thorough enough and you can still easily get a gun, even if they were not.

Limit the amount of guns. Enforce registration of those guns (everywhere). A THOROUGH background check ,psychological AND physical testing, a legal statement to let the reason behind the purchase noted, at LEAST a short training, banning of concealed carry at least for normal civilians, and if you have to carry them, at  least with the ammunition and the gun in different places. Thats what I would call heavily regulation.

Not just fill a form in Walmart.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to fill in the blanks and correct me if im wring, but it doesnt looks like it.

Edit: And you CAN own a firearm in my country and of course theres a black market too, but:

&gt;""...out of the 2.583 deaths by firearms in the country in 2016, 2.3% (59 cases) were accidental 21% (543) self inflicted, and the remaining being intentional or undetermined (32.2%)""

Sorry for my rough translation. By the way, 2583 deaths. In 2017 an article said they were **1.562.332** guns legally owned (84% to civilians) - which represent about 3.5% of the population, vs 393M in the us that represent 120% in the US if you go 1:1 - The amount of deaths (2k-ish) represents more or less 0.005% of the population, in that particular year. The gun deaths in the US, taking 2012 data:  73,505  non fatal injuries, 33,636 fatal ones (including suicides which is about a third of that) That number represent in total 0.03, but even just fatalities is 0.01% of the population. Thats double, and I live in the third world.

 Thats just an example, and I dont even live in a particularry safe country.",1569888206

During the American Revolution and the War of 1812 the United States relied upon privateers for most of its sea power. Privateers were privately owned ships crewed by civilians who contracted with the US government. The ships were not subject to military discipline or command and they sold their captures for profit.

Hello /u/iEatSammich, welcome to Knife_Swap! Please read this entire message if this is your first time posting here!

Make sure you obey any laws that are applicable to your country and the recipients country. If we find out that you are breaking them we will ban you.

As a reminder, all posts require a timestamp with the knife open and the blade visible.  This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. Additionally, please make sure to have a grade:

Quality [Q] Levels (use + or - accordingly):

* ""A"" - New, has been taken out of the box a few of times, never used to cut or been carried
* ""B"" - Light wear, been carried, non damaged. Sharpened by someone who knows what they're doing (e.g. original manufacturer or a very well established modder like REK). Non-permanent mods like new clips, new screws, or similar will fall into this category since the knife has been disassembled or worked on but not permanently changed or damaged. If these modifications have caused changes in the knife's performance e.g. now has bladeplay or centering issues, that lowers the rating of the knife to a C.
* ""C"" - Moderate wear on handle or blade, may have been reprofiled, sharpened not super well, modded in any permanent fashion, need sharpening; mechanisms (non lock related) may not function properly.
* ""D"" - Things are broken.


Until you have successfully completed a sale or trade, you can only post one knife at a time. This means one thread, one knife, and that's it. NO EXCEPTIONS  

Once you successfully have completed and got trader flair a sale or trade, you can post however many knives for sale as you want! Please still try to keep them all in one post, though, to avoid spamming our page.  

Please make sure your prices aren't ridiculous.  You will be called out if you're asking an unreasonable amount.

Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services, with any fees added.  All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 

Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  

If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear. 

As always, please don't be a dick.  Message the mods if you have any questions!

But ever since that day he's been my #1 and really happy I stumbled on those songs that day.

And its been the best ride from then to now. My friends are all into other artist and they like to talk crap about others. But Drake is literally impossible to not like.

"TarotCards","t5_2s2l3","Three Of Wands Keywords
UPRIGHT: Progress, expansion, foresight, overseas opportunities. This is a good answer. 

The lovers reversed key words: Self-love. Once again, pretty good!

King Of Pentacles Keywords
UPRIGHT: Wealth, business, leadership, security, discipline, abundance. These are good things! 

The Knight of Swords reversed can appear in a Tarot reading when you are brimming with energy and motivation but cannot effectively channel and release this energy. 

Finally, the Ten of Swords reversed can appear as a welcome sign that the pain and sadness you have been feeling is ending. When upside-down, the swords in the man‚Äôs back look to be falling out, releasing him of the pain and hurt he has been suffering. You are releasing the memories of the past and allowing yourself the opportunity to move forward with a sense of renewal and hope for the future.

The Death card is probably the most feared and misunderstood of all the cards in the Tarot deck. Just mention the card‚Äôs name and most people freak out, worried they will suddenly keel over and die as soon as this card appears. Relax! The Death card can be one of the most positive cards in the deck.

After a period of pause and reflection with the Hanged Man, the Death card symbolises the end of a major phase or aspect of your life that you realise is no longer serving you, opening up the possibility of something far more valuable and essential. You must close one door to open another. You need to put the past behind you and part ways, ready to embrace new opportunities and possibilities. It may be difficult to let go of the past, but you will soon see its importance and the promise of renewal and transformation. If you resist these necessary endings, you may experience pain, both emotionally and physically, but if you exercise your imagination and visualise a new possibility, you allow more constructive patterns to emerge.
Similarly, Death shows a time of significant transformation, change and transition. You need to transform yourself and clear away the old to bring in the new. Any change should be welcomed as a positive, cleansing, transformational force in your life. The death and clearing away of limiting factors can open the door to a broader, more satisfying experience of life.
The Death card has elements of a sudden and unexpected change. Death happens to everyone, no matter who you are, how much money you have, where you live, or what colour your skin is; it is the same with a significant change. So, the Death card can be a sign you may feel as though you are caught in the path of sweeping change and cannot escape its effects (especially if accompanied by the Tower or the Hanged Man). Although the upheaval may seem unwanted and painful, this massive change could bring with it a series of unexpected surprises that create new opportunities and advantages for you.
Finally, Death is a sign that you need to learn to let go of unhealthy attachments in your life to pave the way to a fuller, more fulfilled life of deeper meaning and significance. Death teaches you to let go of outworn and outgrown ways of life and to move forward from them. This is a perfect card to break a bad habit or pattern of behaviour. See this as a time to cut out excess and let go of what is unnecessary for your life. Purge the old belongings, memories and baggage that are getting in your way.",1569888210

But I always loved my uncle and wish we could have spent more time with his family, but my dad couldn‚Äôt get past his childhood memories. So I‚Äôm glad that if/when either of you have kids, it hopefully won‚Äôt trickle down to them.

Their parents actually got a divorce when my dad was around 2, and my dad grew up with his step dad while my uncles both grew up with their real dad which I think caused some of the issues. My real grandfather was an abusive bipolar alcoholic, while my step grandfather(who to me has always been my real grandfather because I never even met my dads bio dad) was the sweetest loving man. Weirdly, my dad was able to put his issues aside with his other brother, even though from what I‚Äôve been told treated him worse as a kid. We spent a lot of time with him, he even lived with us for a few years. But unfortunately he passed away 4 years ago, which is part of the reason I wish I had a better relationship with my living uncle.

The people who denounce the Democrats who voted for the popular invasion never praise Robert Byrd when the Republicans attack him for being in the KKK in the 1940s. What these people don't know is that the Republicans never mentioned his KKK past because he was a conservative Democrat who was often an ally when voting.

&gt; **I‚Äôve always wondered: Where does the name Lyra come from?**
&gt;
&gt;There was a hymn I particularly liked called ‚ÄúJesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of the Easter hymns. And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica. I thought it was somebody‚Äôs name, and I thought that was a nice name. In fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the ‚Äúharp of David.‚Äù ‚ÄúLyra‚Äù is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.
That‚Äôs where Lyra comes from. I thought it was a name, but it wasn‚Äôt a name, but now it is a name, because I have lost count of the number of little Lyras there are. And not-so-little Lyras, now. I‚Äôve signed many, many books for Lyra.

"decoyrobot","t5_11j7vg","This is honestly all completely fair except for one thing...the game never actually addresses this.  It's not a part of Nate's character arc, nor does it offer any level of contemplation within the game's narrative.  And for a character driven game, that seems like a flaw, or rather a disconnect in the way the gameplay adds up to the story.  
Your reasoning is absolutely sound, but my issue wasn't with the killing per se, it's with the fact that the killing is never actually brought up at all even though Uncharted 4 has:

- Nate looking for reasons to stop treasure hunting (killing people and destroying countries isn't even a consideration?  They keep labeling him as an ""everyman"" character, but he doesn't even think like a human)

- The narrative make a point that the villains are ""evil"" because they're willing to kill, yet Nate is also willing to constantly kill.  That entire ""twist"" and cliff scene makes it out that Nate is on a moral high ground, and the emotion of that seen is swayed that way (that it's tragic because of what Nate is subjected to).  Rafe's line about them all being similar is meant to spite Nate's attitude, and through the rest of the game the narrative proves that Nate and Rafe AREN'T similar, because Nate has love, and family values, and morals, etc...but he's still a guy who kills people with no regard.  Never even questioning it.

- Has the characters (and developers) actively joke about mass murder in context.  Nate and Sully have that whole ""can't go back to this city"" line together, and they threw in a Ludonarrative Dissonance achievement (literally named that) which you get by killing a certain number of enemies.  They KNOW of the problem, even acknowledging it in interviews and they laugh it off.


My problem here isn't violence or shooting.  It's the fact that the violence and shooting within the gameplay has absolutely nothing to do with the character's arc within the cutscenes.  Take out all the gameplay and Nate's character is still EXACTLY the same (this is competely converse to something like MGSV where the active gameplay of choosing to save or kill soldiers is part of Venom's self view within the narrative).  The death and murder can be justified in a way...but what can't be justified is that the gameplay is completely useless to the story they're trying to tell.  The cutscenes are what matter and the gameplay is a means to get to them.  What happens in gameplay never comes up.  It's never a point of contention for characters.  Everything that matters is held within the narrative itself...
 The shooting segments are there simply to waste time until you get to the ""real"" purpose of the game.  It never gives Nate any nuance or things to think about; nor the player.

And for a game to not use its gameplay...that seems wrong.

Edit: For clarity, I think what you're saying is the thought process that they employed and it works from a standpoint of this being a movie, or just a story.  But the justification is less the issue, and more so that nothing that the player does is in service of the story.

See the main point of U4 is this struggle within Nate to leave the life or keep going and all you do in the game is...shoot people and go forward.

There's no struggle, at all.  Even when Nate has those moments in cutscenes the gameplay never adds to it or is used as a way of conveying that going forward isn't a good idea.  Never in the game is there a moment that isn't fun or played for excitement.

They literally blow up a market place with civilians in this game (who didn't enlist in a mercenary army).  Not once does a bullet, say, hit a civilian.  Hell you're not even allowed to shoot near them.  All you're allowed to do is score headshots.

There's nothing in the game to suggest that there's an issue or a problem within Nate's mind.  Would the game's story be any different if you didn't play those scenes?  Not at all.  Take out the gameplay and you still have a linear tale.

That's my issue.  That U4 as a game...never utilizes that it's a game - an interactive medium - to enhance or justify its story.

What frustrates me is that ND outright states they recognize the issue.  Their defense: other people have done it so we should be able to do it too.

The issue isn't the killing.  It's that the killing is irrelevant to what occurs in the cutscenes.  The killing is just there so you can kill stuff.",1569888213

The biggest thing is to apply smartly. 

Formatting a good school list is the utmost important thing in this process. Ensuring you are picking schools that you are within the stats of  ( it is perfectly fine to have a few reaches, and you should).

 Know each schools broad mission. Some schools love service/volunteering. Some schools will not go near you without a decent research background. Know where you are applying and pick schools that line up to your story. 

Do not add schools that are OOS unfriendly. Some schools flat out do not take OOS students or they only take a few of them. 

Ensure that you apply to every public institution in your state as most, not all, look out for state citizens. An exception to this is cali which has weird regional things, and are competitive state schools. 

Finally apply financially informed. Do not add a school that you know you will not complete the secondary. Example. Miami is an extremely long secondary and many people change their mind once they see it. 

Each school will cost you two fees. A primary of 40 dollars each and I think 140 for the first one?? A secondary that range from 30-150$. On average each medical school is going to cost you 140$ and a few hours/half a day of writing. 

Use all this to decide how many and what schools.

*Dry shampoo can be used in between washing. Corn starch is also good if you can't afford a lot of beauty products. 

*I have had chronic eczema and have had sores. One thing that worked great - Head and Shoulders shampoo - with tea tree oil. I use it just like body wash. Tea tree oil helps by being antibacterial. The zinc in the shampoo helps with the eczema. 

*After the head and shoulders, use shea butter. The fats in it will assist in moisturizing. 

*You can find shea butter VERY cheap if you look into African American hair products. I bought a huge container for $5 - you want the pure stuff and it does not have to be name brand. Just 100% shea butter. It's cheaper than coconut and actually better for your skin. 

*I am not sure where you have sores/eczema - I get it on my hands. Wear gloves when you can. Even the ones you sleep in. You will find relief with these tips. I have an autoimmune condition, so I had to experiment until I found something that works.  Wear cotton, wool - natural fibers. These are going to be the more breathable.

I think you gotta remember too that fans of various stuff do real crazy shit sometimes.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","Part of the problem isn't that refs aren't paid enough, part of the problem is that there aren't enough refs making it up through the system to graduate to this level of sport.  Offering more money isn't going to make people want to become referees when they can go on reddit and see how referees get treated.   

Also, NFL refs make between $1000 and $10000 per game based on seniority (remember, the full time program was cancelled), and there are only 121 of them.  The level below, college, in the SEC pays between  $800 and $3000 per game.  A little more for conference finals, and the bowl games are about at SEC paygrade for regular season games.

So even if you're talking full time salary for MLS refs, you're probably talking between $35,000 and $65,000 a year at best.  That's not a lot of money to convince people to referee soccer instead of another career, doubly so when you consider that only the top 30 or so positions in the US will get that, and that eventually you're going to have to quit.",1569888215

I got my vanilla hack experience, now for something different. I've only played 2 Touhoumon hacks so far, but both had a lot of things to love, and some things to hate. The hatred is focused on the difficulty and bullshit RNG that hurt me in those hacks. Those hacks are Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced (Reloaded), and Touhoumon Purple. This hack has a hard mode patch that the creator said brings it to the level of Touhoumon Purple. So since I finished Touhoumon Purple, for the most part, surely this hack would be mostly tolerable. I gave up on Touhoumon's Purple horrible 5-trainer gauntlet in Southern Island, which was torture. The rest of the game was nowhere near as torturous, so I have faith that this hack won't punish me. So not only I'm using the Hard Mode patch, but I'm using the 1.8 Sprites patch. It changes the Touhoumons to their sprites from Touhoumon 1.8, the base patch had the 1.5 sprites. There's a third patch that removes the IV guide feature, the one where there's a letter grade assigned to each stat. I didn't use that patch. Alright, God, I hope this isn't bad. I didn't want to use Touhoumon Purple's hard mode patches, and I'm thankful I didn't. So I hope I don't regret this. The Hard Mode also disables item use during battle, on both my end and the AI's end, which is great.

1. An interesting thing right off the bat is that your rival is not Blue, it's Green. The sprite was wonky, with inverted colors and then the icon sprite was Blue when you got to the naming section. So just in case, I used a somewhat unisex name: Brooke. I had a male friend named Brook, so I figured it would work. Anyway, this hack doesn't change the FRLG story, it's like Touhoumon Purple in that respect. So I won't have to type a lot of shit about the story. The starter trio is different from the Chibi Alice, Reisen, and Sanae. This seems to follow the 1.5 Touhoudex, the starters are Chibi Reimu, Marisa, and Kokoro. The 1.5 Touhoudex doesn't have the many different evolutions for Bon√©kas. That means no Attack, Defense, Speed, etc forms. There are ""EX"" and ""Alt"" forms, the former evolve by level-up, the latter require Mystery Shards. There are other, more specific, niche forms, with different evolution methods as well. Professor Oak does a neat thing when you look at your starter choices. He describes what each starter's battle specialty is. Reimu is a balanced attacker, Marisa is a ""special force,"" and Kokoro is a ""fast but quirky attacker."" I used a randomizer to select my starter, and it selected the one I was thinking of using the most, Chibi Kokoro, Heart/Ghost-type. A special thing about this hack is that Dragon and Fairy-types are added, bringing the total amount of types to 20! Most of the mechanics at play are 1.8, the evolutions are the only ones from 1.5.   

2. The type chart supplied for this hack is a bit daunting. I think the red means that it's not very effective, green is super effective, and black has no effect. The Dragon, Wind, and Fairy boxes are mostly gray, which I'll assume means it's neutral damage, like the white boxes.

3. I thought I used the Hard Mode patch, but after seeing the first gym leader use items during the battle and that he only had 2 Bon√©kas instead of 3, it turns out that I didn't use it. So I restarted the hack but still chose Chibi Kokoro as my starter. Same thing happened on the first rival battle, Chibi Kokoro just had a better set of IVs and a better nature. Something I didn't take note of originally was the rival's dialogue. It's not Blue, it's Green, she's much nicer. She even told me to go get a spare Town Map from her sister. Blue would say that he'd tell her not to give me the map. She always gives me the map though. I had the same troublesome Route 22 battle with the rival as before. I kept losing. One difference is that I got Teeter Dance, leveling up to 15 to get it. As such, I got lucky and caused Chibi Reimu to hit itself, and I also got a flinch with Astonish. Without those, Chibi Reimu would've killed me with its super effective STAB move. 

4. I lost against Slash, who is the gym leader of Pewter. Same sprite as Brock, but a different name, and Steel-type as the team. Instead of using Potion, Berry Juice was used as a hold item. I don't think I can even get access to that item this early. I forgot to mention that there's custom music. I usually play with the sound muted, but goddamn the gym leader theme is beautiful. It doesn't sound like a Pokemon battle theme, but it's still epic. Oh, and I lost a second time. I'm overleveled too, level 19, which is crazy this early in the hack. I did read the creator describe this as Challenge Mode from Black 2/White 2. Levels are boosted and other small tweaks in trainers. Even so, this early feels like a bother. I won the third time, and that's thanks to Covet stealing Chibi Youmu's Berry Juice. That helped a lot, keeping me in the fight to KO the Chibi Youmu, and then Chibi Elly was an easy KO. TMs are reusable here! I got TM05, Sharpen, which in this hack, is like Hone Claws. That means Attack and Accuracy are increased.  

5. Magikarp was replaced with Fairy, I'm considering keeping it on the team because it can evolve to Alt Lily Black, which looks very appealing. The Touhoudex supplied doesn't display the middle evolutions. I didn't know they existed in this hack. I used G3T to look into the game, which is the best ROM editor for this hack, but it doesn't seem to display any info on the Kokoro line, so it's not great. Anyway, that ROM editor showed that there are middle evolutions by level up, Bon√©kas that drop the ""Chibi"" part and are just whatever their name is. So Chibi Kokoro evolved to Kokoro. To get the EX form is through more leveling up, and for the Alt form, it's the Mystery Shard. There are only 5 you can find before Trainer Tower, where they are sold. Back to the middle evolutions, they are mentioned in the original post of this hack. There's a good explanation for why the provided Touhoudex only displays the final evolutions, but it would've been more useful for me to just list everyone.  

6. The good thing about Fairy is that it levels up quickly, its growth rate is Fast. The level curve already sees trainers using level 15 Bon√©kas, in Mt. Moon! Kokoro is level 24, which makes it overleveled, but I don't feel I have that great of an advantage, having a second team member is necessary on this occasion. I can already tell that I'll be relying on the Vs Seeker hardcore. 

7. Fairy's evolution methods are similar to Tyrogue. Fortunately, I got Lily Black, which is when Chibi Fairy's Attack is greater than its Defense at level 20.  

8. I think this an elephant in the room, the sprites. This is more on the Chibi sprites, their heads are way too big and stretched out. I thought it was from using the 1.8 Sprites patch because it's not native to this hack. The hack originally had 1.5 sprites. As it turned out, the big and stretched heads are from Touhoumon 1.5 sprites, like the hard mode patch, somehow I didn't apply it despite thinking I did. Now things are more familiar for me because the previous 2 Touhoumon hacks I played were completely 1.8 ones in terms of mechanics, moves, typing, and sprites.  

9. Moving on, I lost to my rival in Cerulean the first time. I was close though, one last Bon√©ka in her team needed to go down, but I went down before that. I was slightly overleveled, but it was a case of quantity over quality, having more Bon√©kas got her the win, 4 vs. 2. I lost a second time, I'm convinced that Lily Black should not lead, it takes too long to KO her lead Kogasa and then I get 1 shot by Reimu's Pay Day (I'm serious). I lost a 3rd time, switched the lead, but Kokoro got paralyzed and that messed up. The fourth time was the charm, and Kokoro did all the work. I even got a Critical Hit on Reimu with Shadow Punch. Kogasa has Intimidate as an ability, so the Critical Hit was needed. The other Bon√©kas went down to Mirror Shot. The rival gave me HM08, instead of that pointless Fame Checker. In this hack, HM08 is Teleport! 

10. The Cerulean Gym got a makeover. It's not a pool, but a maze of trees. The type-specialty is Wind, but other types are mixed in, according to the gym assistant. Aria is the leader, her sprite is similar to the rich lady sprite. I lost to Aria the first time. Type chart mishap on my end, but goodness, I spent too long trying to find the type for Chibi Iku. It's not pure Wind like in the other Touhoumonhacks I played. I'm not sure if it's part Fairy or something else. A full Touhoudex would help, the Fairy-typing isn't canon to Touhoumon, at least the 1.5 and 1.8 Dexes I looked up. I lost a second time, but at least I learned who Aria's 3rd Bon√©ka is, Aya. Her Sanae had Sitrus Berry, that's perfect for Kokoro's Covet. I lost a 3rd time, I need to stop being paralyzed by Chibi Iku. It affects the entire battle. Sanae also has Thunder Wave, which is troublesome.

11. I skipped to Vermillion with the expectation of getting the Vs. Seeker there. Instead, it's a damn Oak Aide who gives you the EXP Share if you have 15 species registered in your Dex. Dammit! I'd rather have the Vs. Seeker. The Oak Aide on Route 11 still gives you the Itemfinder, but only if you have 20 species instead of the typical 30. Crap, I was hoping the Vs. Seeker would be there. 

12. MOTHERFUCKER! One other reason I skipped to Vermillion was to get a Cheri Berry from SS Anne, it's typically hidden in a trash can in the kitchen. It's not there, that has to be blatant. There's Pecha, Chesto, which are useful, but not at this time. The third berry does nothing, it's something to sell for cheap, the Cornn Berry. Fucking bullshit man. Aria is taking me down because of paralysis, she benefits from having priority and the occasional lack of movement on my end. I'm overleveled and can deliver some hard hits to her team, but she can do the same when I'm paralyzed.",1569888216

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","Damn fine work. I saw that Terran Population figure and felt some math coming on myself...

TLDR: If the population of Terra above is correct, the entirety of Terra's Oxygen would be depleted inside 5 days (not accounting for anything to reverse the process)

If we take the following as true:

1-A human requires approximately [0.84kg of oxygen](https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/166504main_Survival.pdf) per day to survive

2-Assuming the atmosphere of 40k Terra isn't hugely different to 21st century Terra (a stretch I know, but hey we need numbers from somewhere, and it's surely not getting any better), we can assume that [23% of our atmosphere, by mass, comes from O2](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-composition-d_212.html).

3-Earth's atmosphere contains some [5.15\*10^(18)kg of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth).

Using points 2 and 3, we can calculate there is (5.15\*10^(18)) \* 0.23 = 1.1845\*10^(18) kilograms of O2 in Earth's atmosphere.

Using point 1, the human race will consume all of that in 1.1845\*10^(18) / (0.84\*0.31467\*10^(18)) = 4.481 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this isn't taking into account oxygen movement, which will cause localised depletion sooner. Also it doesn't factor in Partial Pressure, which will actually cause humans to start falling unconscious long before we actually strip the Earth.",1569888216

Maybe you've seen my never-end posts about high-end weapons, which contains this info:

All items that spawn have:

* LIFETIME on the ground  
* RESTOCK timer until placed into the spawn queue.  
* MIN/MAX(NOMINAL) before any respawn is done. Once its at max, no more will spawn . When it hits min, more are put into a queue to spawn in an appropriate place.  
* QUANTMIN/MAX are for items with capacity like water bottles, canteens, mags, etc  
* Flags to decide what to count (can be IN_CARGO, IN_HOARDER, IN_MAP, IN_PLAYER) Also flags for crafted and DYNAMIC EVENTS (deloot/heli crash)  
* Spawn Location - class of buildings/location (Military, Police, Farm, Village, Town, Hunting, School, Industrial, Medic, Firefighter, Prison, Coast)(floor, shelves), and tiers (1,2,3,4)
* Tier 1 is the SE coast and tier 4 is the NW woods. I don't know the exact dividing lines, but you get the idea.

And if crime goes across multiple communes, most likely the communes would work together and maybe send a representative to assist each other, share facts, cross-reference, that sort of thing. But under no circumstances would there be police. The people are perfectly capable of maintaining order and justice without someone else barring down on them.

Before: I walked into the classroom to see my friend Matt, the class clown.

Depending on the context, still possibly overdoing it, but the point stands: don't tell us he's a clown, show us. Another common mistake is using informal language or unnecessary slang. Example: ""If Matt ever acted serious I'd call a doctor."" Bland and unoriginal.

It's not bad to know that Matt is the class clown, and it helps to have your cast of characters in your mind. You can write a whole first chapter describing characters; just hang on to it for yourself.",1569888218

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; what makes you think they DIDN'T want more than they had, but had no means to do anything about it?

Because they were satisfied. IF humans naturally wanted incessantly then there would have been an innate INCENTIVE for them to make MORE. But they DIDNT, and they were satisfied. 

&gt; being naturally lazy and greedy does NOT mean that our ancient ancestors would never have participated in teamwork or gotten out of bed,  thats absurd.

Yes it does. Greedy is anti-social - it involves taking more than you need, often to the detriment of others. It‚Äôs an anti-social behaviour, and impedes upon trust and other socially binding aspects. Laziness is not the same as efficiency - laziness means that you are unwilling to work, often to the detriment of yourself and others. We would have gone extinct if we hadn‚Äôt been able to develop such strong social connections and work towards our goals. That‚Äôs a fact of anthropology and science - humans are not naturally greedy or lazy, if you want to discuss this point further then provide scientific evidence. 

&gt; so do introverts and antisocial people just not exist then, or....?

Yes and yes.. but are these people born that way? Everyone needs social connections, even the most introverted.

You‚Äôre the only one who is getting offended here. You came to me throwing more insults and tamper tantrums than your parents when they realized you survived the abortion.

So let me break this down so someone with an IQ score so low if you were to take a jump off from your pride and try to land on your IQ you would die from asphyxiation before you would even hit the ground.

Salvador isn‚Äôt seen or heard from either iirc

Krieg has a few echo logs in one area which is nice I guess but not much. 

Gaige is vaguely referenced in one echo log with a dude who said he‚Äôs gonna finally track down the person who murdered his daughter. 

Also where‚Äôs brick and Mordecai? I know they‚Äôre in the game, but barely. And they never talk to Lilith iirc. 

*And where‚Äôs Athena* she had a pretty important role in everything in TPS, including the scene at the end with the watcher *which is also not referenced at all*.

Anime | Score| Comment
---|---|----
Akkun to Kanojo | 8 | A fun shortform anime. I did get tired of the MC a bit, though. Probably deserves a 7 but it had IM@S seiyuu so I was a bit biased.
Grave of the Fireflies | 8 | I wanted to see if it really was sad. Can confirm. I'd have been more depressed if I didn't tune out during some points of the movie.
Sounan Desu Ka? | 7 | I got attached to some of the characters (surprisingly), but overall I think it's just pretty deece.
Fruits Basket (2019) | 9 | I would enter cycles of getting behind on this anime and then thinking ""why did I ever get behind on this anime?""
Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo | 5 | I would have liked to give this a higher score, but those last couple of episodes were *rough*. Originally got a 6 but the more I think about it, the more those last episodes soured my opinion of the show.
Demon Slayer/Kimetsu no Yaiba | 9 | [](#yuishrug)
Takagi-san S2 | 9 | Like with Fruits Basket, I ended up getting behind on this anime, but when I caught up a few days ago, I really fucking enjoyed it. Shoutout to Yuki Kaji btw, he really carries his weight as Nishikata.
Machikado Mazoku | 8 | I'm just glad I can still enjoy moeblobs, tbh, although for what it's worth, I liked this anime's style of comedy a lot.

So I am writing this drunk and just got back home from a night club.

There were this two Polish girls in front of me waiting in line to grab their coats at a night club. Suddenly their two Polish friends cut in line and I confronted them because I was just too tired and wanted to go home.

They went back behind me and gave their bracelets (for the coats) to their friends in front of me. I confronted them again saying I just have one bracelet and want to grab one coat really quick and let me pass through but they did not budge.

The girl was holding like 6 bracelets and her friends cut in line. I told her to let me wait in front of her.

I yelled at her, what the hell is your problem? And she said that back to me.

Later the security guard passed by because the girl called him to come. Fortunately I speak some Polish and managed to explain the situation to him. He just went and grabbed my hoodie really quick at that moment.

I feel guilty because I do not like to be mean but I got pissed because I always wait in line regardless whether my friends are in front of me.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I am so fucking sick of everyone assuming Congress can't enforce their subpoenas. If you look at the history of the times Congress has held people in contempt in the last 70 years or so, you'll find that in almost every instance, the person held in contempt has stopped ignoring Congress and provided whatever Congress was asking for. Don't take my word for it, [here's the list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress#Partial_list_of_those_held_in_contempt_since_1975) of those people and their response.

So historically, those congress enforces their subpoenas against - by holding them in Contempt of Congress - almost always have cooperated once Congress held them in contempt. Congress has the power. Just because the bad actors always decide to cooperate and do what congress asks, because they don't want the year in jail Congress can impose, doesn't meant Contempt of Congress is toothless. It means nobody they've held in contempt wanted to get butt-fucked by a 300 lb guy named Bubba for a year. 

If Congress starts holding people in contempt, then - according to history - they'll get cooperation. Unfortunately, our current Congress is run by a bunch of pansies with no backbone. And the dems are so busy squabbling over which of them gains the most power when the music stops that they can't even agree how to deal with trump.",1569888224

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I'd probably go straight battle master. It fits the theme of your character, and you can use your shield as an improvised weapon to make your combat maneuvers work. I'd check with your DM to make sure they're cool with this, but if anything it's suboptimal, so I don't see why they wouldn't be okay with it. You can do nonlethal damage with the shield and it's only a d4 of damage (plus strength). You could probably request to do no damage, if you wanted, but you'd be doing just a bit of nonlethal damage. There's lots of potential support maneuvers you could take--you can knock people prone, push them back, let somebody else attack instead of you when you need that extra damage, give allies advantage, etc.

Shield master would be a good feat to take (variant human would let you start off with it). That gives you a bonus action shove, and it's just thematically pretty appropriate. You can also take the protection fighting style, which would thematically be you throwing your shield in front of allies to protect them.

Tavern brawler would give you proficiency with improvised weapons, which your shield would technically act as. It also would make your unarmed strikes a bit better, which would fit with your character idea. You could think of it as just being super skilled with hand to hand combat, instead of a rough and tumble brawler. But you could also just ask your DM if you can be proficient in using shields as an improvised weapon. I'd allow it, though tavern brawler gives you some other perks too.

Cavalier or paladin could also be good options, but battle master was the first thing that came to mind and I think fits really well thematically.",1569888224

Seeing as I dont know him or any of the mystery women who came forward or what he is alleged to have done, I have no idea.

These days the term sexaul harrasment has a very broad scope. If a guy was drunkenly flirting with someone, I dont think thats a big deal. If he was grabbing someones breasts or sticking his hand up their skirt, thats a different story. Seeing as the details of the allged actions are unknown, it is sensible to not jump to conclusions. That being said, the internet loves a good mob attack, so in their minds he is a brutal rapist, despite there being no details.

&gt;Yeah, a lot of people are unwilling to listen when victims of abuse try and come forward. I wonder why that is.

Do you wonder why or do you have an idea in your head that fits your beleifs? Im guessing probably the latter. Personally I am willing to listen to all sides and not jump to conclusions, especially when no details are given.

&gt;Yeah, it's totally unrelated when you think there's 0 politics involved in the dislike of some people for Hoogland and them loving Steven's response to the accusations.

I would assume for a lot of people, politics are not involved. Jeff is irritating regardless of if you agree with him. Some people go to twitch to watch people play MTG not to have their political beliefs confirmed or denied.

&gt;Anyway, I'm done with this. If you want to know more about the whole situation, you know how to look for information. You can decide whether you want your previous lack of knowledge become wilfull ignorance, or not.

I know how to look for information and as far as im aware the current information is that multiple (so more than one, probably two) unknown persons said that Todd sexually harrassed them. No details about what consitiutes sexcual harrassement in their eyes have been given. SCG got rid of Todd based on this. Them doing this doesnt add anything to the validity or seriousness to the acusations, they are protecting their own image and working within their own beliefs.
The internet hate mobs have decided that Todd should now not be allowed to play MTG or earn money from streaming based on information they dont have. You yourself refered to him as a monster based on very little information.

Libertarian writers often claim that the depression was aggravated by government intervention, but they never present any evidence.  They simply claim a priori that intervention is harmful and conclude from there that it must have been harmful.

The evidence suggest otherwise.

"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","&gt; I feel like 'don't sleep with students and employees because power dynamics' is from a generation of feminism before Wokeness, and backed up by corporate interests wanting to limit liability. I could be wrong about the history on that, but I think this is not really a woke issue.

The legal liability, at least in the United States, came first, well before the corporate interest.  While there were a few probing legal attempts in the 70s (such as the infamous _Barnes v. Costle_), it wasn't until _Meritor_ in 1986 that there was clear ruling against demanding favors from subordinates or reporting co-workers, even if those subordinates believed their jobs depended on compliance.  Establishing norms against such explicit or implicit demands was a major plank for that entire generation of the feminist movement until the mid-1990s.

While broader prohibitions on workplace romance were not actively opposed by these feminist groups, they were as often dropped as created in the 90s, and in the limited environments they existed, they were more often originated from religious grounds than by the feminist argument over abuse of power.  Expanding that norm to hold that such relationships were presumptively abusive was a far more recent change.  See [this](https://www.commerce.usask.ca/faculty/colin%20boyd/personal/romance.pdf) for a discussion of the legal history from the viewpoint of 2010, or [here](https://www.workforce.com/1998/07/01/the-truth-of-workplace-romance/) (note: while only one-fifth approved of dating subordinates, fully half of managers _did_, the author is advocating explicitly allowing such with a required disclosure) from 1998.

&gt;  The standards really are meant ot be applied fairly to everyone, just like they said when they made them,and they wantthem to be applied fairly to everyone, and fully expect that many people on their 'side' will fuck up and be held accountable. Occam's razor fits with 'they are being honest and consistent' here, as opposed to the added epicycles of 'they are both dishonest and incompetent.'

Barring Jekyl and Hyde situations, this was the same fellow whether he was on Facebook to share feminist articles, or hitting on students.  And _especially_ in the Trump Days, it seems like a hefty assumption to presume that the man had not stated support for this philosophy -- particularly in academia, since 2015, it's quickly become a matter that insufficiently strong support is itself seen as a moral failing.",1569888226

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","**Atmosphere of Earth**

The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).

By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. 

Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere.

Canada might actually benefit from warmer climates to a certain point. Most of your shitty country is basically in the Arctic and frozen over.

I have good money. I'm worldly. I'm generous and kind. That I shouldn't sell myself short, that I should put my self out there. That women would ""make it easy"". To elaborate he told spoke about one time he met a lady at the bar, then the same night went back to her place. After excusing her self to her room, she came out naked.

He is 6'2, white, and built like a rower. In college he was in a frat.

I'm skinny, shorter, mixed and bald. 

I'm not going to claim that that means its impossible, that these can't be improved or compensated for. Just that it wasn't apparent to him all that there may be circumstances about my life that make my situation markedly different from his. If I would use social justice terms to describe that conversation I would call it 30 minutes of micro aggressions. It was nice to have a community that understood that.

Basically this morning I called the clinic and they then told me to call this health and addiction place that handles Medicaid and methadone. They need to give 30 minute interviews to see if you're eligible for Medicaid methadone but before we started they had to check that insurance stuff, so they sent a voicemail asking my clinic if they're in the network (I hope to god they are) and said they'd call me back when my clinic responds. In typical fashion my clinic didn't respond today. Gonna call really early tomorrow.

-----------------------

All under the same conditions tested... No external libraries added to the source, just what the languages load by default. Just pure raw language compile startups.

Rust and Swift ( surprised me ) just kick ass. Go was surprisingly slower. D was a even more surprise given their focus on DMD as a ""fast"" compiler compared to their LLVM counterpart. If it was not for Kotlin/Java, Crystal will have been last. I suspect that dotNet will have similar numbers like Kotlin.

From what i am seeing, i fear when Crystal its library grows, so will its compile times. And these results are very much related to system CPU usage, where the ""fast"" languages tend to use less CPU power. And the slower simply massive spike the cores.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;Did this great God create billions of children in his image only to condemn them to hell because he also gave them no other choice?

Not necessarily all christians, at least not explicitly, but yeah there's the concept of 'vessels of wrath' and 'vessels of glory' - basically, god has created people who exist only as examples and as filler to flesh out a world where people can exercise their faith by not just having the truth handed to them, and having to 'choose' to be saved. You wanna get *really* freaky and down the rabbit hole, there's 'christians' who believe that there's people born without souls that are pretty much just walking NPCs that god uses to test and teach you. Like, you know those videos where people beat up a stuffed animal in front of a pet or small child to demonstrate what happens if they don't do what they're supposed to? Pretty much that, but on a cosmic, eternal-suffering level.

Absolutely mad the rationalizations that come along with a worldview that includes souls/sins/heaven/hell.

From Romans chapter 9:

&gt; [**21**](https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm)Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? [**22**](https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm)What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? [**23**](https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm)And *He did so* to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Cucu does decent against aphro and is decent all around(not top tier but can be decent in the right hands).  For a warrior his damage is probably above average... his weakness is outside of ult and his enraged form he has no CC.  So when you can apply CC is limited and might not be available when you need it most.  So managing your energy and not transforming at the wrong times needs to be learned.  Most of the time players will use their 2 to prevent the transformation.  But if you have to(when your 2 is on CD, fire off your 1 or 3 purposely missing targets to prevent the transformation.

&amp;#x200B;

Cucus one has a heal debuff on it... so couple that with pest/contag you have a good amount of healingreduction... if you can also afford to get a beatstick late game(if they have lots of healing you may want to otherwise your kit and the aura item is enough as long as allies are also getting anti healing)

&amp;#x200B;

As for the Glad vs Beserker Shield = if you are going to get one... Glad is your answer on cucu pretty much always.  Cucus autos feel fast but not fast enough to amke up for the CD and the more burst healing that glad brings... and as someone else mentioned... you get a new set of abilities during transformation to get more glad procs.  This is not really close.  Bellona and maybe Erlang are the only warriors you might even consider beserkers right now.",1569888231

But the crime is not sequestered in poor, minority neighborhoods like in other cities.

Tough on crime DAs sound great for rich white people (and most Asians, around here). But for blacks and Latinos, it's a declaration of war, always has been.

I won't vote for Tung. I refuse to vote for someone whose primary qualification is that they are of a certain race. That's just racism, whether white, black, Asian, Latino, whatever. I refuse.

&gt;Plus, as Goya's Perez points out, absorbing international foods into the larger supermarket ecosystem can hurt the sales of those products. A few years ago, when William Rodriguez was building a new Billy's Market Place in Ridgewood, New York, he considered ditching the international food aisle and integrating the Latino, Chinese, Indian and other products into the standard supermarket shelves. But he was discouraged from doing so - by some of the very companies that supply these foods. In the past, supermarkets that attempted such integration saw their sales drop on international products, says Rodriguez, who is also president of the National Supermarket Association. Shoppers apparently buy more of the same foods when they are lumped together, which is good for both supermarket and supplier.",1569888233

"PokemonHallOfFame","t5_x5g5e","13. Trying to get over this crap, I tried to fulfill the EXP Share requirement, but recent captures don't count because they're not part of the Kanto Dex. It seems like I got the National Dex at the start, as it already goes past 150. That's so annoying when hacks keep that Kanto dex requirement for Oak Aide gifts because they put in non-Kanto Dex stuff in the wild. That's not a problem, but they don't change the Oak Aide shit to include non-Kanto Dex entries as you fulfill the requirement. Now that I think about it, looking at the game through G3T should help in deciphering what's part of this hack's Kanto Dex and not, because of the dex numbers being easily readable. So I looked at G3T, I encountered a Chibi Aya. The number G3T gives it is 16, meaning that it should be number 16 in the Dex. I catch it, the Dex number in the game is 164. As in, not part of the Kanto Dex. Fucking bullshit. This is outrageous. I want to like this hack but I'm finding these little bothersome things that just pile up to something maddening. At this point, I caught 23 Bon√©kas, but only 13 in the Kanto category. Dude...fuck this shit. 

14. I need to forget about the Oak Aides, so I went back to Aria. Both Kokoro and Lily Black passed level 30, very overleveled compared to Aria. I lost. Sigh. The act of losing to Aria yet again isn't so bothersome, it's that it follows extreme frustration at not being able to get the Vs. Seeker in Vermillion, not being able to see what is the Kanto Dex of this hack effectively, and not being able to fulfill the Oak Aide requirement of 15 Kanto entries, for a multitude of reasons. I'm getting pissed. I stopped playing this hack hours ago after the first outrage of not being able to get the Vs. Seeker. I watched Ip Man, loved it, came back to this hack, and now I'm back to the mood I was before I watched the movie. Maybe I'm taking this way too seriously. The Aria losses aren't even a big deal, now in hindsight, I know what I have to do to win, it's just the stars have to align, as in RNG has to be on my side. Speaking of Aria, I had Chibi Yamame as the lead, unintentionally. I was catching Bon√©kas to try and fulfill the 15 Kanto Bon√©ka requirement. That failed, but I didn't deposit the recent captures. I had it in the lead as a way to weaken wild Bon√©kas and catch them, because my two main Bon√©kas are way overleveled and would kill these wild ones. Surprisingly, Chibi Yamame outspeeds Aria's lead Chibi Iku. Yameme has Mud-Slap, so the accuracy drop should help me. It got KO'd easily, it's 5 levels lower than Chibi Iku, but I can see that this is a potentially great lead. Anyway, I lost again, that damn Sanae. 

15. I beat Aria the next time, but some real bullshit happened. The Chibi Yamame Mud-Slap strategy worked, lowering Chibi Iku's accuracy once or twice, allowing for Lily Black to got get a Thunder Wave or Razor Wind and knock that little thing out. Aya spammed Wing Attack, and somehow I missed with Charming Cry, which is a move that doesn't miss. I don't know, I wasn't paying attention. It did have Sand Attack, but even so, Charming Cry shouldn't miss. I'm not sure if flinched. Anyway, Lily Black weakened it, Kokoro took it out. Here comes Sanae. I confused it Teeter Dance, it paralyzes me in return. It snaps out of confusion the next fucking turn, hitting me, but I survived and Coveted the Sitrus Berry. It hit me again, I survived, then got a Critical Hit on Shadow Punch, KOing that motherfucker. That's RNG payback for RNG bullshit the turn before. Now I am begging that I have a smooth run for a while, to alleviate the pain I've been suffering over the many nuisances I found with this hack.

16. Brooke said she caught 40 Bon√©kas. Must be fucking nice. I lost to her. Same shit as before, Reimu, and shit. I'm not in the mood to describe the situation, I just lost. Second time got me the win. Lily Black swept too, Reimu was OHKO'd with a Critical Hit Charming Cry. I needed that, last 2 Bon√©kas were weak to Flying-types, and Lily Black had Wing Attack. Good, I'm less mad now. I don't know what happened, but now the Oak Aide recognized that I caught 18 Kanto Bon√©kas. I only caught 1 since all this crap, and that was Chibi Medicine. Maybe because I deposited the 4 previous captures in the PC? I don't know. That would make sense, 4 plus Chibi Medicine is 5, he and the Touhoudex kept saying I had 13 Kanto Bon√©kas. Well, whatever the case, I have the EXP Share now. Yay, but I still need someone with Cut. None of the Bon√©kas I have can learn it, that's ridiculous.  

17. I did my first in-game trade, catching a Chibi Koakuma to trade for a Chibi Kana. Ghost-type, but I already have a Ghost-type in Kokoro. It had a Blue Flute attached, which is nifty. It can't learn Cut though. I still didn't find a Bon√©ka with Cut, but I found 2 new potential members of the team, on Route 24 no less. Chibi Minoriko, which is Nature-type (Grass), and Chibi Sanae. After getting owned by Aria's Sanae, I was able to see the power of the Sanae line. I want it for myself, they all have the Serene Grace ability, Faith/Wind-type. Chibi Minoriko is slow, but its evolutions can learn Sunny Day, and they all have Chlorophyll. Its Alt form adds a Ground-type as well, so things are looking up. It's crazy how I haven't found someone that can learn Cut though. Or rather, haven't caught someone that can learn Cut. I have an idea who can know it, but I failed to catch it. Soon after typing that, I caught the thing. They're called ""Dolls."" Seriously. They have multiple evolutions though. They're literally a pair of dolls, the Dex entry even acknowledges that. One has a drill-like blade, the other has a shield. Oh...Dolls can't learn Cut either. Well fuck. Cut's a Steel-type move in this hack, and while Dolls are Reason-type, their evolutions are Steel-type though. There's one Bon√©ka that I just realized can learn Cut, but the travel to reach it is a bit of a long one. I'm talking back to Route 2. Chibi Nazrin. I caught it, and Route 2 is where I get HM05, so I ran down there and got it. Great. The cool thing is that trees stay cut in this hack, don't need to cut respawning trees.  

18. Now I can enter the Vermillion Gym. Another makeover, it's an ice puzzle, meaning this is an Ice-type gym. I beat on all the trainers while having EXP Share attached to Chibi Sanae. I didn't battle the gym leader yet. Instead, I skipped and went through Route 9 and 10. Vermillion is a skippable gym, watching Pikasprey's 6 Smeargle Fire Red Challenge made me realize that. Vermillion gets you to use Fly outside of battle. I don't need Fly yet, so I can skip all the way to Celadon if I want to. I'm going to see how far I'd get before I feel ready to go back to Vermillion. I want to buff up my 2 new team members, and also I need to see if I can get Vs. Seeker soon. The Route 10 Aide gives you Everstone, as usual. I'm convinced now that the Vs. Seeker is on the Route 15 gate, the Oak Aide there. That would make sense because normally that Aide would give you the EXP Share, and I got it in Vermillion this time. Dammit, that's a long time in the making. Anyway, Chibi Sanae evolved, so it should be capable of doing battles itself. 

19. Remember my complaint about the Cheri Berry being removed from SS Anne? Well, I found one on Route 10, and Nazrin's Pickup ability obtained another one. That's like the game telling me ""HAHA,"" like Nelson from The Simpsons. I made it to Celadon. During the time spent traveling, I had EXP Share given to Chibi Minoriko while Sanae was out. Both ended up getting in the high 20s, which is great. I found out how useful Water Pulse is on Sanae because of Serene Grace increasing the confusion rate. 

20. Now on Celadon, let's see what the Department Store has. No TM salesperson, damn. The stone merchant sells Touhou Orbs instead (Poke Balls). That's it, everything else is the same. Well, the X-items are changed to ""Liquids,"" which are items that have no effect, they're just there for selling. That could be a result of the hard mode patch since it bans item-usage during battle. The salesperson for the X-items sells those Liquids. I noticed that move tutors may not exist in this hack. Fossils don't either, I forgot to mention that. I just got a Blue UFO. Well, the Old Amber is still present. The Counter move tutor is replaced with an in-game trade, Reisen II for his Rinnosuke. Reisen II can be traded for 9k coins. Yikes. So the game corner as Bon√©kas, stat-boosting berries instead of TMs, stones and the ""Advent Shard."" The latter is 7500k coins, more yikes. There aren't a lot of Advent forms, but even so, that's ridiculous. The stones though, what Bon√©ka even evolves with stones? That's weird, they're 3k too. The point is, Celadon has no TMs to purchase in this hack. That is lame. It could be a consequence for them being reusable in this hack. One thing that is 100% true, this hack doesn't hold your hand. So really, the Bon√©kas are the only things I would want from this place, and an Advent Shard if any of their Advent forms are in the hack and I want them as well. 

21. I'm hesitant to go challenge the Vermillion gym leader because I just realized that Ice-type is super effective against the types that both Sanae and Chibi Minoriko are: Nature and Wind. That would mean once again, Lily Black and Kokoro would have to carry the match. I'm not sure I want to do that now. I can do Rocket Grunts though. Eevee is replaced by Akyuu, referring to the Celadon Mansion gift. Akyuu is the Smeargle of this hack. No thanks. Back to the point of this hack not holding hands, the NPC that gives you Psychic in Saffron is now blocked by a Rocket. More on Saffron, the dojo is gone.",1569888233

"CampHalfBloodRP","t5_34k5q","As much as Arthur bragged up Brandon's technical skills, the smith who made that Mycenaen cuirass is probably his favorite person in existence currently.

The spear slams into the chest armor, stoving in a portion the size of a laptop, and sending Arthur tumbling.  The bruise and broken ribs?  That's going to be the problem for ten minutes in the future. That, or he's going to be dead instead.  Sunny prospects, either way.

Struggling his feet, wheezing, Arthur sizes up the situation.  He can't see anyone, save for Sho and himself, charging?  He blinks, and the pair are still there.

*Either I'm concussed, or someone's doing something fucky.* Ever the eloquent one, Arthur racks his brain for a solution. Killing Ajax is something no one ever achieved in The Iliad, he's too much of a beast.  The broken bones attest to that, and that was just a thrown spear.  The guy is a monster.

*You know, there's an idea...* Arthur's expression darkens. He may not know anything about Diomedes, or Ajax the Lesser, but he knows how this Ajax dies. Fear is the wrong way to go about it... Perhaps shame and guilt is the better way to go.

*It certainly worked on him the first time around,* he thinks dryly.  Under the cover of the illusion, Arthur begins to change, into the inky blackness a moonless night aspires to be. The darkness the Hades kids flit through like nightingales. The darkness that his terrifying sister embodies... Except not quite. He cannot wield it as an indiscriminate weapon, to become the blender he saw on his first night at camp. No, he can only imitate the dark. Luckily, the darkness that he can manage is all he needs... Hopefully. The coil of darkness slithers across the ground, hiding in pools of shadow and other natural camouflages, edging closer to the hero.

*""Ajax, Slayer of kin.  The jealous hero, who sought the death of innocent lives in a fit of pique. Do not think the world has forgotten your blasphemous misdeeds, for they are told as parable even now.""* The words are sibilant, a snake testing the mental armor of the hero.  Olympus knows it isn't as strong as his physical Bulwark. At the very least, a shadow will not die, either.

Second, taking statistics courses is not the same thing as being a specialist in statistics, to say nothing of being a specialist in using statistics to detect election fraud;  among other things, I would imagine that there are factors that someone who is a specialist in election fraud specifically would know to take into account that someone who does not specialize in that area would think of including.

Finally, personally I've taken several graduate level courses in physics but you'd be a fool to hire me to work on particle physics because it isn't remotely my specialty.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Look, I personally think the prevalence of guns in our country is a huge problem, but I don't think diminishing the reasons why they are so prevalent is helpful in working to cut back on our gun numbers.

We literally founded our country through violent revolution. Our country is younger than the invention of guns, and it was our go-to tool to solve any problem. We murdered countless people who were already living here, and we were afraid they'd be as terribly dangerous as we were. We crossed a continent, relatively devoid of advanced civilization (obviously entire populations of people were here, but the land was pretty wide open) with very little in it apart from animals that we could shoot and eat or animals that we could shoot so they didn't eat us. We lived in areas with minimal governance where the only security provided was a gun on the hip. And then, when we'd taken the chance to grow up a bit, we took our guns to the rest of the world, becoming the ""hero"" in not one, but two world wars. This brought about a whole lot of problems regarding arms, but the basic gist is that in every significant aspect of American history, we've had guns by our sides. In the civilization that we've developed today, they absolutely have no place outside of highly regulated activities and regions (i.e. hunting), but it should be understable why they're so ingrained into our notion of what defines us.


Also I was going to make a point about dangerous animals but went on too long, but I found this fact: the United States has 20 - 28 times the number of bears in it than all of Europe, and that's not even including Alaska, Idaho, South Dakota, and Wyoming!",1569888237

If I were you, I would deposit the wedding account into your son's account. Sue this dude for child support and put 40 a month from that into his account to match what you're already depositing. It will suck because it's 40 less you'll have for his actual support, but you seem to make a good living.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I went through this with my best friend in college. I loved this girl more than anything and she stayed with her abusive boyfriend for nearly 4 years. I would pick her up at 3 am when he locked her out of the house in 15 degree weather, field his calls when she was away and he got drunk and mad, cover for her in classes when she was too bruised to go. Anything I told her she would just counter with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do any better than him‚Äù. He cheated all the time, beat her, let his own brother try to beat her when he got mad at her, constantly accused her of cheating, etc. I love her to death but we eventually fell out of touch when she turned down her dream job to stay in our college town with him and I moved away. 
She did eventually get out and got away from him and we‚Äôve tried to reconnect but it‚Äôs also not the same and we‚Äôve never been as close. It wears you out to never be heard and there‚Äôs only so much you can take by staying silent and just being supportive.

The downside after a couple hours of nonstop righteous foreplay ... I still remember being barely able to walk to my car ... my nuts hurt so bad! Plus, I was too righteous to relieve the pressure myself.

I went to BYU, then on a mission. We wrote to each other the whole time. When I came home, I lost interest and married someone else. She never married ... taught school ... sang with the MoTabs ... and retired. Still single, and probably still righteous.

Maybe she will ""get lucky"" and marry an 80 year-old GA after his first wife dies. I wonder how many TBM old-maids are hoping to pull off a Wendy or a Kristen?

But the only thing I left out is that my mother has voiced her thoughts about changing the internet provider - since there's a company that offers all those 67+ free telephone calls on their landlines. And I was thinking that it would be the perfect time for blocking sites that contain malware, because I could probably pin it on the new internet company and get away with it (I was also thinking about perhaps buying mesh routers, hence the username, but will probably just use the router provided by the company).

If the sites my brother is trying to reach say something like ""Your parents have blocked this"" or ""This website was blocked by a request from a user"" then that is no good, and he would know he could argue with me to open it up (he knows my parents have even less technical knowledge than me).

As for the anti-malware thingy - it's just I'm getting really tired of having to scan the computer and there can be weeks even months before I remember. So I was just thinking about buying a security suite that would also block webpages without letting the user know it can be reverted (I'm pretty sure my brother wouldn't dare go into the Settings in a security suite). 

I know I could probably use some software, such as Remote desktop to log onto the family computer from my laptop, to manually scan, but I'm not comfortable with that. I'll perhaps end up buying a pro version of Malwarebytes.

Yesterday I downloaded Bitdefender and their parental blockage let the user know who blocked it - and I was going to download trials of all the wellknown security suites and to try to find one that just blocks websites without giving anything away. But just to safe myself time: do all security suites let a user know that it's been preconfigured by someone with access to the computer that webpages have been blocked and thus can be unblocked easily?

I know there are also stand-alone parental software, but what would be the best site to request info about those?",1569888241

I ran a half marathon a few months ago and had  the time of my life but essentially could not walk the next morning. I went to get a sports massage the next day and was told there was something severely wrong with my hip and that I probably needed medical attention. I went to my doctor the next day who directed me to a dermatologist about the scalp thing. I didn‚Äôt realize the hip pain connection until I went to the dermatologist, she immediately sent me to the ER to get imaging done of my spine. 

Turns out my moms brother has PsA too. His doctor is a PsA specialist at The Brigham Women‚Äôs dermatology center in Boston and is completely focused on PsA. When he found out that I was related to my uncle and got ahold of my imaging, he immediately called me into his office and told me that having a direct relative with PsA makes a person 30x more likely to have it.  My uncle then called me up to tell me that 3 other extended relatives have it and all will never admit to it. 

Ask your family if they have it. Ask again. Ask one more time. I wish I had known, the shame is such an unnecessary burden to bear on your own.",1569888241

imago dei got nothing to do with intelligence. it's about acting your life as reflection of God's justice &amp; grace.

but it's kinda hard to reflect what God is &amp; do, cos He is invisible.. but luckily Christians got a sample:

But, two things: Nobody pays the full amount unless you take delivery, so what really happens is...MARGIN.

The margin required to carry 1 OJ futures contract is...$1,575 approx. You're only putting up &lt;10% of the value of the actual contract paid in full. There is also a Maintenance Margin amount that you have to have so that fluctuations in the price don't trigger an immediate margin call.

So if you are buying or selling 1 OJ futures contract, the initial margin is approx. $1,575 (that pays for the position) and you need an additional $1,260 for maintenance margin.

But...price will fluctuate, and, for example, each minimum price change or tick on the contract (5/100 of a cent..like $0.0005) is a $7.50 change in your P&amp;L.

A 5 cent move on one contract would be 15,000 x $0.05 = $750

That's just ONE contract. Imagine if you're swinging multiples of 10 on the contract size.

Buy 100 OJ @ 99.80! (thats $0.9980)

That's 100 x 1,300 = $130,000 initial margin to carry the position.

Every tick on 100 contracts is 100 x 7.50 = $750 up or down.

A 5 cent move on 100 contracts would be...$750 x 100 = $75,000.

But worse, if you are long the position, and it drops (Dukes scenario), the dollar value drop is the EXTRA margin that you are required to put up, in order to maintain the position. Essentially, the loss on the position have to be continually backstopped by $$ in the account.  Math is essentially the same if you are short the futures contract.

In most cases, that's never a problem because you would never bet the entire capital you have on the trade...but the Dukes did.

No matter. The Dukes got flush again when that dude from Zamunda dropped the roll of Benjamins into their cup.

I know I probaby messed something up in that explanation. 

Feel free to call compliance.",1569888242

"civ","t5_2rk3b","Thanks for the detailed write-up! I have a few thoughts on some of the Pantheons, if you're interested:

\-God of Craftsmen is also a good Pantheon pick for Scythia and England, since they both have start biases for Strategic Resources (Horses and Iron/Coal, respectively). \[Note: I'm not sure if England's Iron and Coal start biases exist for both leaders, or just for Victoria.\]

\-Goddess of the Hunt is actually a really good Pantheon with the right map generation, especially for Civs that aren't inclined to take any of the Faith-generating Pantheons. For example, I took GotH in my last Kongo playthrough, and it was immensely helpful.

\-Lady of the Reeds and Marshes is close to being useful, but it feels like it needs some sort of buff. Maybe it could provide +1 Production to all Floodplain tiles, not just Desert Floodplains? If that's too strong, maybe it could provide +1 Production to Lake tiles? Either change would probably make it the default Pantheon for the Netherlands.

\-As someone else in this thread pointed out, River Goddess is a really good Pantheon for Japan. Japan gets an automatic +1 Faith Adjacency for building the Holy Site next to the City Center, and that adjacency gets higher as Japan continues their customary district clustering. The extra Housing and Amenities that the Pantheon provides help Japan's cities grow larger faster, speeding up the construction of those juicy district clusters.",1569888242

"blogsnark","t5_39xf0","It‚Äôs common in bigger cities for private practice clinicians to be out of network, and most ‚Äúelite‚Äù and upper middle class won‚Äôt use insurance. There are limitations of going through insurance, one being your insurance now has record of your mental health diagnoses and session counts, so lot of people do it for confidentiality assurance. Also, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to go through insurance. They might not approve Caro going 2x weekly or however often she goes, limiting sessions. Insurance will also only cover you if you have a diagnosis, and it has to be a diagnosis they will cover (e.g. personality disorders will not be covered as a primary diagnosis). This brings up an ethical dilemma amongst clinicians about ‚Äúhaving‚Äù to diagnose someone with a billable diagnostic code in the first session. 

Needless to say, notice how I mentioned to elite and upper-middle class therapy normals. It‚Äôs a huge privilege to be able to work with an out of network clinician TWICE A WEEK! Many military servicemen and women often are unable to see a clinician out of the military, because they do not want their diagnoses documented with insurance (tricare is their insurance and it‚Äôs through the military and sidenote is also a nightmare) and do not make enough to afford the services out of pocket. I am a clinician who had a DIFFICULT ass time finding my own therapist IN-network...in SF. At no point could I have afforded to see a therapist once a week without insurance, let alone twice. 

Good for her for seeking help and I admire her being open about it (to the extent which it isn‚Äôt performative or a crutch). But I think it‚Äôs just another example of her being clueless about the privilege she has, and herself in general.",1569888243

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Let me begin by telling you this isn‚Äôt ‚Äòyour problem‚Äô, it‚Äôs simply a preference and an uncomfortableness. When I first got with my husband nearly three years ago, he had a really difficult time telling me about his ass obsession. I‚Äôm not saying ass fetish, liking ass, being attracted a little more than the next guy, but an *ass obsession*. I was a little curious as to how. literally just how. Then I eventually grew to understand, as the longer I was with him the more I watched ass-centered porn, the more he said ‚Äòoh her butt is nice‚Äô and guess who else in this relationship genuinely *loves* ass now? this girl. Getting comfortable with this is just as difficult as learning to accept yourself, as well as love yourself. I never understood, and never really made him feel bad or denied him, but I didn‚Äôt really care much. When you can learn to just lay there and *be comfortable* will you only then start to actually enjoy it. Now him playing with my butt is my favorite thing ever, and we can literally do it for hours. It‚Äôs such a simple and easily accessible thing, and it begins to be the start of most sexual times between us. Yes, it‚Äôs okay to not enjoy it and do it while he does. However, if you‚Äôre genuinely just *waiting for it to be over*, that is more traumatizing than asking him to wait. Now, getting my ass ate is seriously sooo relaxing, getting my butt smacked or played with in any way is so addicting and I never want him to stop. I got used to it very very quickly, I just simply had to be a little on the ‚Äúbut(t) why??‚Äù side for a few times. I hope it all works out and you get to genuinely enjoy it soon!!",1569888244

People are not inherently able to identify a series by a panel or page so it makes it difficult for any new readers to try the series if they don't know what it is. Thats why it is important to add the title of the series, so please follow the rules and sumission guideline next time.

In addition, don't use an initialism or shorthand in place of including the title as these aren't inherently understood by every new reader either. The Reddit Character Limit for titles is quite large so there isn't much excuse to not including the series title in the title of the post.

"Genealogy","t5_2qmdf","So, I love Wikitree, personally.

I love the collaborative aspect - both for the tree itself, and the [challenges](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Places_to_find_unconnected_profiles) people can do to connect Notable people such as governors (scroll down to the table). I also love the fact that you can connect GEDmatch to it, and have your Wikitree profile show up on GEDmatch itself. The Wiki links make GEDmatch that much easier to use when it comes to trying to figure out how people are related to me. Also, the fact that you can add your DNA test information (the fact that you've tested on Ancestry, 23andme, etc, or have done a MTDNA or YDNA test) to the site really helps. I find it particularly useful when I'm looking at profiles of ancestors, since it helps show me closer cousins that I can compare to to confirm my lines. For example, [this profile for Thilda (Johansdotter) Nelson](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Johansdotter-1153), owned by Jamie Nelson, one of the Wikitree team members, has three different DNA testers listed in the sidebar. You can see that whether you're logged in or not.

Another really useful thing is cousin bait. That's Wikitree's term for Google SEO. Because of cousin bait, I've gotten a lot of emails and information from people that I otherwise wouldn't have had. This is simply because a non-member stumbled across a Wikitree profile I made through Google. I've gotten pictures, sources I didn't have, anecdotes and stories, and so much more, just simply because I added my ancestor to Wikitree at the right time. Of course, cousin bait is mostly just ways to improve SEO. When you manage a profile, it gives you a page for cousin bait tactics. [Here is a similar one, with less suggestions](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Cousin_Bait), and [here is what you see when you manage the profile](https://www.wikitree.com/treewidget/Johansdotter-1153/99). (This is for the same profile as the DNA one above.)

I also really like the free-space pages, as I can create them for anything I want. I've seen some pretty cool ones dedicated to family bibles or scrapbooks made by people - trying to get the pictures out there in the open for people to see.

The final (and perhaps biggest) thing that I love is the fact that Wikitree forces me to confront how well sourced my tree is. I have to go through and add everything individually - and it means I realize ""oh, I don't have her death certificate"" and, ""where is the source for this marriage?"". It really, REALLY helps for the completeness of my tree.

As for downsides? Well, the biggest downside is how many unsourced and unconnected profiles there are. I'm not the most patient when it comes to sourcing, but I also don't abandon my unrelated profiles until they have a few good sources on them. However, there was a time in Wikitree history when you could upload your GEDcom, import it all, and then leave. Even though you can't do that anymore, there are still thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of profiles that are messy, due to the fact that they are either unsourced, or still affected by GEDcom import madness (it looks really ugly). There are also a LOT of unconnected profiles - and Wikitree is all about connection. However, these problems are being fixed every day.",1569888246

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","in my situation i think yes - in a sense that they‚Äôre mentally hurt. enablers that don‚Äôt actively protect the narcissist but passively allow it to happen are perpetrators too but from what i‚Äôve experienced they‚Äôre also victims. fear of the abusive narcissist, and other factors like a lack of money and social support (probably also because narcissist has led to such an absurd environment for the family), rule them to the point of lost agency. 

even if they actively protect the narcissist, i feel like it‚Äôs possible that they‚Äôve been abused and psychologically tormented by the narcissist (and not even aware, especially considering how boomers or older probably had way less understanding or even awareness of mental health than younger generations) that they themselves are confused and fail to understand or see the abuse and stuff for what it is. they don‚Äôt know what boundaries mean because, especially if they‚Äôve been together a long time, the narcissist behaviour has always been there and accepted or even affirmed.

even if they do know something is wrong, they‚Äôre probably deep in denial about their own mistakes or even the narcissist‚Äôs mistakes because they don‚Äôt want to believe they‚Äôve done something bad, especially if the source of it is the narcissist and the enabler didn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúactive‚Äù role in perpetuating the abuse and stuff. 

and it‚Äôs really sad. i am quite an idealist and i believe that deep down, everyone wants to be good. but they just don‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt know better, and i don‚Äôt think anyone can possibly be happy when they‚Äôre so deep in shit like this and, worst still, refuse to climb out of it.",1569888246

&gt;Powers of police officer

&gt;(3) The appointment of a special constable may confer on him or her the powers of a police officer, to the extent and for the specific purpose set out in the appointment.

https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2007/2007canlii21963/2007canlii21963.html

&gt;A TTC Special Constable is appointed by the TTC, as provided by agreement with the Toronto Police Services.  The Police Services Act provides for such an agreement in s. 53 (3), which states that such an appointment may ‚Äúconfer on him or her the powers of a police officer, to the extent and for the specific purpose set out in the appointment.‚Äù  It is clear that the powers of such an officer are circumscribed and limited to those specifically and expressly conferred.

&gt;Clause 30 of the Agreement provides that TTC Special Constables have power to enforce certain legislation, including:
 
&gt;1. The Criminal Code
&gt;2. The Trespass to Property Act
&gt;3. Specific provisions in The Provincial Offences Act, ‚Äú(POA)‚Äù, including s.146 (use of reasonable force), and s. 149 (release on bail with the exception of need to establish identity).

&gt;[...]

&gt;The issue of the scope of the powers of TTC Special Constables was dealt with in R. v. Ambrose, [1999] O.J. No. 3607 (O.C.J.) where the Court determined that Special Constables do have power to arrest and to use reasonable force under the Trespass to Property Act.",1569888247

"arenaofvalor","t5_3mynb","Yuange with 3 skills oh boi

Explaining his skills will be quite long so I'll just summarise what he does:

He can use his puppet to act like a ward and spot enemies, there's no limit to it's range and it copies an enemy (cannot choose which). Example, there's a wukong on your side, the puppet copies it and you see the puppet as wukong, in the minimap you can see 2 wukongs. One thing to tell if they're fake is if they're approaching towards you which your allies probably won't do. 

His main job is to catch a squishy with his puppet, gildur ult the squishy (his puppet does a small gildur ult), bring his body near the puppet and unload his abilities on the squishy and get out. 

Yes, it's a hard hero but he has a very formulaic combo that once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy, you just have to know which skills to press in certain situations. His and his puppet's hp are very low due to how long range they can be. If you kill the puppet it's dead for a while and the main body gets stunned

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I'd say it definitely still has issues, but they're all with the RPG design of the game.

The writing, art, design, soundtrack, and core mechanics are all absolutely top-tier, and among the best I've played. It's the best-feeling shooter I've ever played on console, and it's pretty good on PC too, especially for a first-time PC dev. It's also got a quantity of content comparable to the fully-expanded Borderlands 2, which was a major issue with the first game.

---

The RPG design, however, has, up until Shadowkeep, apparently been handled by monkeys.

---

There exists an exotic armor piece which allow you to draw and hold bows (which no one uses) indefinitely (which was never the problem with them). There also exists an exotic armor piece which allows you to one-hit kill minibosses. The two are mutually exclusive; guess which one has never been used by anyone.

There exists a class ability which allows you to instantly reset the cooldown of a throwing knife. There also exists a class ability which allows you to instantly reload your gun. The two are mutually exclusive; guess which one has never been used by anyone.

There exists an entire class of weapon (sidearms) which is outclassed by every single other class in every way. They aren't even unique and exciting to use, like bows; they just suck.

There exist, in the same loot table, a perk which enables you to carry more sidearm ammo, and a perk which enables you to gather more rockets; guess which one has never been used by anyone.

The (only) three stats in the game are armor, speed, and recovery, and each class has a general focus on one (titan, hunter, and warlock, respectively). They are, however, not even close to equivalent; recovery is far more important than armor, which is lightyears more important than speed. And there's an entire class that's focused on speed.

All armor pieces - until Shadowkeep - have had literally identical effects on the player, regardless of source, rarity, appearance, set, or anything at all - a bonus to one of the three stats, plus two rolls from the global perk table that literally every single armor piece pulls from. There is no reason whatsoever to ever try and hunt down unique armor pieces, except for appearance, since any armor piece from anywhere can roll identically.

There is a material in the game (Baryon Boughs) which is so valueless that players (myself included) have stacks of thousands, each collected one or two at a time. Literally all it can do is buy one single item (Tincture of Queensfoil), which is frequently dropped in the world anyway.

Shaders - unlike every single other cosmetic in the game - are one-time use only, and they take physical inventory space in your vault. That means that in order to collect and try a bunch of different shaders, you are literally taking storage space away from your armor, weapons, and gear. This issue was so bad that Bungie gave a vendor a specific capability to trash entire stacks of shaders all at once.

The vault UI is impossible to use. DIM is the only way anyone could put together and organize anything resembling a collection.

--------

The game has serious issues - but literally all of them are with the game's RPG elements. It absolutely baffles me that they were partnered with Activision Blizzard, who run the most successful MMO of all time, and still managed to get so much of the RPG stuff so wrong.",1569888249

We ARE like other boys!‚Äù because the stigma around homosexuality emasculates them and attributes feminine qualities to them. Not only do they *lose* their masculine privilege  but they receive the negative attributes of femininity as well so it‚Äôs a *double lose*. This is also why SO many gay guys stay closeted their entire lives! Besides from the typical estrangement or even danger they may receive from their social groups as a consequence for coming out, another huge reason why they don‚Äôt come out is the self identity crisis that may arise! Due to all the negative connotations and stereotypes surrounding homosexuality, it is *very* difficult not to internalize and incorporate them into the denotation itself. This leads to thought processes like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not effeminate nor flamboyant!  That means I‚Äôm *not* gay!‚Äù And to no fault their own, they have misattributed said stereotypes of being gay to *actually* being gay (which is literally, and simply, *just* liking guys).  Again, I‚Äôm not generalizing this to *all* homosexuals (since as you stated yourself, some gays like you are proud and desire their femininity), but rather the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that generally speaking, boys *want* their masculinity. Therefore, if they somehow ‚Äúlose‚Äù it through whatever means (in this particular case, coming out as non-heterosexual since a integral part of masculinity is physically and sexually dominating women), some would do whatever it takes to get it back, such as denying or hiding their homosexuality (similar to how I exemplified earlier how some women berate other women to alleviate their femininity).

No, your comment doesn't offend me in any way. It just made me realize we're from completely different cultures, and that made me smile. I didn't give much background so your reaction should have been pretty obvious, I guess.

Westerners seem to view the women where I've grown up as being extremely feminine. Especially where the the gestures and movement of the older generation are concerned. Think of tea ceremonies and geisha.

That is not affectation. Rather, it's largely affected by the clothing. Even the least expensive outfit cost hundreds of dollars and formal ones tens of thousands. Since they're handwoven silk they have to be dismantled for a proper wash, and resewing costs a few hundred more.

The sleeves have to be protected when serving at tables. This means using both hands. This in turn means maintaining balance in all three dimensions, since one can't prop or support oneself with the other hand and there are no chairs.

Eating with chopsticks means the use of fingertips. This habit carries over to other activities as well. (It also means taking smaller bites to prevents food from dropping on clothes.)

The  narrow hems mean balance must also be maintained when sitting down or standing up from the floor. Balance equates to grace in both men and women. However, it's more pronounced in women because it to some extent compensates for lower muscle mass e.g. when learning to fight with a broad spear. Or lifting heavy objects, etc.

Yes, cleanliness is important regardless of sex. However, many of the gestures seen as feminine here do originate from the care taken to prevent expensive clean-up jobs. Someone with horrible posture will probably trip in our traditional clothes. And ham-fistedness when eating will result in spillage.

It's funny, but when some of my very normal male friends from more traditional families visit e.g. the U.S. they've been seen as feminine gays. While part of it was how they moved, another part apparently was that the fact that they tended to listen and not talk over others made them seem demure. So regardless of individual differences, these traits do seem to be regarded as generally feminine in the West.

Anyway, thanks for your input. I tend to forget that differences in cultural backgrounds result in different ways of looking at things, and that what I may think to be obvious can offend others.

My apologies for making you upset. I hope this clarifies what I wanted to say a bit.

*Edit:*

By the way, I myself am not genderqueer or genderfluid, but transsexual. I was seen as too girly to be accepted in the boy group even here, and when I attended school in the West I was labelled as a ""homo"" the very first day. At some point some kind souls tried to teach me how to sit, stand and walk like a boy. Most of it amounted to always using more strength and relying on stability rather than sense of balance. It did work enough that people mostly stopped shouting profanities at me, but never felt very comfortable.

So I guess this may have colored my perception as well. I'm just glad I don't have to act the part any more.",1569888249

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","&gt;Depends on how long they hold out

Who? And at what cost at this point?

&gt;How long has the USA been giving farmers handouts for sugar? We starting giving subsidies back in 1933

And how many problems has that caused? We're seeing the ag industry increasingly become more and more corporate, as small farmers get pushed out. We're seeing issues like in Florida where the runoff of sugar farmers is causing environmental problems, but they have the state by the throat and the state refuses to do anything about it.

&gt;we have gotten a net gain in jobs

and those jobs seem to be mostly in, as I said, mainly retail and service industries like fast food. They tend to be lower paying. 

&gt;and those jobs are higher paying jobs

Where? in one small slice of the country? What about the rest? Are you going to tell the rest of the country to just wait it out as they watch their communities and the ones around them fall into poverty as the wealthy take them over and squeeze them?

&gt;Let me say this... why do you believe in free trade between Florida and Oregon? 

Because these states ultimately have a net of the federal government to help them adjust to changes when one ends up benefiting from the other.

&gt;This is why retraining is key to a fast moving market

While it's good to offer programs like this, we also need to face the music that these policies will make a chunk of the workforce unneeded, especially when we allow capitalism to dictate everything. Or are you expecting thousands of people to spend months to retrain then uproot their lives to chase jobs? How often will they need to do this? What happens when many of these displaced people enter the more advanced industries all at once?

&gt;Retail requires you to be on site

maybe you missed one of the biggest economic booms in the past decade, this is no longer even the case. Amazon makes far more and does far more business while employing even less, and they're constantly looking for ways to do that even more for the sake of their own profits. Sure there will always be some retail, but what happens when there's hundreds of desperate people per each retail business that wants easy unskilled labor? We're already practically seeing it, but it will only get worse.

&gt;Again, if these people could have access to skill training, they can get skills for jobs we need.

what jobs do we even ""need""? Doctors? We don't need more doctors, we need to stop treating the ones we have like shit and driving them to suicide. We don't need more anything, we just need to stop allowing companies to treat the workforce as disposable, and allowing as many impoverished people as possible to fill the jobs needed by companies to earn profit will lower the value of our workers whether they do that by outsourcing the jobs or bringing the desperate poor of other nations here. 

Do you think the people who were made next to worthless by these policies are going to feel energized to vote when the politicians they're supposed to be voting for aren't speaking about the problems these policies have caused domestically? They aren't going to vote for someone telling them to just wait it out when they're starving and living paycheck to paycheck.",1569888250

"Watches","t5_2qls5","Okay, I got a bit unlucky earlier today and smacked/got my watch hung up on something while working on something, resulting in the bracelet flying off. It ain't the first time it has happened to me over the years, but its the first time I've found any of the remaining pieces of the spring bar in the bracelet/strap.

As you can see in the picture, pointed at by the arrow, (sorry, I don't have a macro lens) the spring bar actually teared right up from the impact the watch had. I guess the damage would've looked a bit different if this bracelet didn't have hollow end-links, as the spring bar then wouldn't have any space to expand/tear?

Also, sorry for the title, but here in r/watches, one of the first thing that gets screamed every time someone thanks their nato/zulu strap for saving their watch as a spring bar fails, is that ""the spring bar only broke because of the added pressure of the nato/zulu strap"". I've broken many spring bars on both bracelets, two piece straps and nato/zulu straps, so I honestly doubt there is much of a difference in the pressure added, only thing is that on a nato/zulu strap both spring bars needs to fail before your watch hits the ground.

So, how many of you guys have lost your watches due to spring bar failure? How many of you have considered soldering a solid piece of steel in there instead of some weak spring bar?",1569888250

It looks good, so do a lot of games on PC. Odd that you picked a game where no comparison can be made because it's an exclusive. IF it were on PC it would look better on PC, and you know this. You KNOW that the consoles cannot use the same graphics settings that PC's can. They can't do high framerate 4k, they can't use the same texture resolutions, they can't do high end AA techniques... everyone who knows anything knows this.

Quick comparison: PS4 Pro has 5.5gb of GDDR5 memory, the 2080ti has 11gb of GDDR6 memory. GDDR6 is literally TWICE as fast as GDDR5... the PC in this case has DOUBLE the memory and that memory runs at DOUBLE the speed. Because of this it can support DOUBLE the texture resolution. Not much adds more to high-fidelity graphics than the resolution of texture and shadow maps...

It's just fucking simple, just look at the hardware specs.

Pick a game that exists on both PC and a console and I'm sure you can find DIRECT comparisons from the same scene in the game... I know why you aren't doing this... I know what it will show.",1569888251

"skiing","t5_2qig7","Like others have said, maybe wait until canada before getting your gear. For boots, the most important thing is the fit, so If you have a boot fitter you trust, get them before you move. If not, there are plenty of well qualified bootfitters in Vancouver and Whistler. For Goggles, a rose or red metallic tint will be the best. Most of your days will be under clouds, and even sunny days are not too intense. The goggles are primarily to prevent glare. As for type, get what fits your face and helmet.

As for Skis, while there will definitely be days and groomed trails where piste oriented skis will excel, the Pacific North-West (PNW, Primarily consists of Oregon &amp; Washington in the USA and British Columbia, Canada) is known for getting heavier snow, and a lot of it. I also want to note that what is considered ""inbounds"" in North America is not the same as in europe. ""Inbound"" here is everything in the ski area boundary, and they are not necessarily all groomed, even if they are named. You may find yourself in ""off-piste"" conditions more often than in europe. That being said, they typically do avalanche control within ski area boundaries.

The smallest waist widths you typically see around here at 85mm, with your average (not hardcore) skier usually getting something in the mid to upper 90mm range. I think starting with a narrower all-mountain ski will yield the best experience, and you can get a racier ski or wider powder ski if you find yourself joining local teams or venturing out more.

Skis that I woud recommend

* Nordica Enforcer/Santa Ana 88 or 93

* Blizzard Brahma

* Volkl Kendo 88 or Mantra 98 / Secret 88 or 92

* K2 Mindbender 90 ti",1569888251

It turns out that the father had an old and very bitter, spiteful grudge against a woman who jilted him in his youth.  Rather then forgive and move on, he had harboured a festering hatred for this woman and for the man she eventually married.

Whilst visiting his home town, a small band of roving goblins attempts a raid looking to steal some livestock:  the PC and their father rush out and handily dispatch them...

The Hag has been watching; when the call went out, the brave husband of the coveted woman also rushed to give aid and with a subtle breeze of fey magics was made to resemble, in the PC's battle shrouded eyes, a goblin.  Now he lies dead by the PCs hand and the father walks up, spits on the still warm body, and revels in the pain and suffering it will cause the woman he so resents.

He is proud of the PC for exacting his revenge, the Hag has kept her word, the PC has killed a good and innocent man.

Use the enchantments in subtle fey manipulations, the emotions are then raw and real.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Movement prediction makes your champion move locally (within your running game) a bit sooner than they would move if your game was to wait for the server tell your character to move (what normally happens).

This is especially noticeable for people with higher ping because if you've ever experienced 80+ ping you can start to notice a delay between the moment you click and the time it takes for your champion to move in response to that click (especially at like 100ms and up).  

By moving your champion a bit sooner locally, you are given the illusion that your character is more ""responsive"" because you're not waiting for the server to tell your character to move.

In my opinion, movement prediction only makes the game feel better. But I think its best left off because sometimes it doesn't accurately represent where you are on the screen (even if its a few units off).  

The reason people may say it feels easier to dodge skill shots is well, because it actually does *feel* like it is easier, but in reality they would have dodged those shots anyways if the movement prediction was off.",1569888253

I would also use a larger screen on the grinder then filter out plant material with the ryot box. Also when I sorted large batches of bud I did not use a tray, I used a honey bee polen tray.

Forger of Worlds by Simon Archer. It's a bit strange, and I'm a little confused as to what the game actually is... Because it doesn't seem actually playable. But despite that, it was a fun story. He's a ""world champion"" of the game, and basically just kills everyone and everything. It's all described well, and is plausible. I liked it and will be getting the second when it comes out. (There is a bit of sex, 3 or 4 times mayo, including right when the book starts, I know some people don't like that)

Party Hard by David Petrie. The MCs have been playing the game for a long time, so they're actually just good. Unlike many stories, they don't get their character reset or forget how to play. They're just high level and really good.

If you haven't read The Idle System by Pegaz, the MC is OP kind of to the point where it's silly. Couldn't really say what I enjoy about it, but I do :P",1569888255

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","They hold deliberately contradictory positions so that they can be critical of Israeli behavior regardless of what they do.  Were they consistently to be pushing for one state then things like settlement (mixing the population) would be a good thing.  Israeli-Arabs starting to attend Jewish schools would be a good thing...  Were they consistently pushing for two states than enforced separation would be a good thing.

BDS' position is that Jews are an intrinsic evil or at least Jewish self determination is an intrinsic evil.  Therefore nothing Israel ever does can be right and since Israeli policy is mixed to achieve that they need to hold contradictory objectives in their platform.

That being said the underlying issue is that they are representing 3 groups of people who have essentially nothing in common with one another but whom BDSers like to group:

&amp;#x200B;

a)  Israeli-Arabs who have some discrimination problems hence demand (2).

b)  West Bankers who dislike Jews moving to their neighborhoods. They want discrimination turned up tremendously hence demand (1).

c)  Descendants of refugees who demand a return to a country that never existed under conditions that would be impossible to create, hence demand (3).",1569888256

You could either buy all of the contents of a monthly box yourself for less, or it'll just be assorted odds and ends that they need to get rid of slightly below MSRP to turn *nothing* into money/free space. There's no world in which you come out ahead from random MTG subscriptions. Choose the product you want and buy it; be it singles, packs, boxes, sleeves... you're going to be getting ripped trying to get it in a random drop of stuff.  
  
  
The absolute most efficient way to get a good deck is to buy the exact cards you need for that deck. It's not as exciting as opening packs, but you get what you want for less.   

If you're just looking to build a collection and you don't really care if you're getting a ton of cards relevant to certain formats, you could buy a Common+Uncommon playset (4x of each card) of a recent set for $30ish on eBay and get a lot of play value out of that.   
  
  
If you're just looking for the fun of getting lots of cards, Bundles run $30-40 and include 10 packs and Booster Boxes will be in the $100 range with 36 packs. You can also use a box to play Sealed or Draft with friends, which can add to the fun value when opening packs.

""Gotta go fast!""

Tried to have the court order to have either the children or the dog removed, court ordered assessment and dog passed, then cps tried to say they were neglecting their kids because the roof of the garage in the corner was damaged. Ended up costing them a couple thousand to get the whole roof of the garage and the corner of the wall fixed and took well over a year to get rid of those people.

Dryosaurus may have just been moved up to the Herbivore pack and we'll see something else in the 1993 DLC.

The comment in the email in regards to dinos not eating plants they don't like could just be a misinterpretation.  It does say 'in summary'.

This style of heel hooking in reverse order (trapping the toes and exposing the heel **before** securing the entanglement)...I've been playing with it since Kinetic, and am I off-base that it seems at least *slightly* more dangerous than securing the entanglement first?

When using it against other enthusiasts I've noticed that (at least with the inside heel hook)

1. They don't really feel a ton of danger when their knee-line isn't secured in a tight bite ahead of time, even if their toes are trapped
2. Without the leg entanglement in place first, less experiences partners are more freely able to spin the wrong way or at a risky time
3. When the knee-line is finally secured with a strong bite the tap seems to be immediate and often is a verbal tap.

None of this means I will stop working it. Against larger and more athletic partners it's been helping me a lot. And I'm also positive that I'm not seeing the full picture and am possibly doing some things wrong here. I'll definitely support and buy the instructional when you drop it. And my hunch is that the answer is ""Yeah, it might be slightly more dangerous, but it can still be practiced safely, as long as you are more careful and work it with people that are experienced with the leg game.""

If you've always wanted a Moog modular, this is THE THING for you! Buy three! If that's not your answer then maybe the right thing to do is ask which 3 modules you could use to get started with the sounds you're into. We'd LOVE IT if somebody would ask that question!

It was my first module, followed by Clouds, maybe 5 years ago? I didn't know what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and I ended up a long long way away from subtractive synthesis.

"CBDOilReviews","t5_lphjr","It's 3.3mg per mL. There's 60mL per bottle and approx 200mg total CBD per bottle. This information is shared in the review, on the product pages and also on batch specific labels on each bottle.

If you read through my somewhat biased review, you'll see that the point of our products is not to provide a huge dosage of just CBD. There are plenty of other brands that are better suited to deliver that.

Our products are intended to provide a small amount of highly bioavailable CBD in conjunction with 5 other herbs in the case of the Feel Well and 4 other herbs in the case of the Sleep Well.

Regarding my claim of higher bioavailability, I encourage you to read this article that was posted on a completely unrelated dispensary's website regarding the effectiveness of glycerin-based extractions:  [https://www.cvdvt.org/cannabis-meet-glycerin/](https://www.cvdvt.org/cannabis-meet-glycerin/) .

I have been searching for human studies that feature a comparison of glycerites vs CBD-in-carrier-oil type products in terms of bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, but at this point I have not found any. I'll admit in this regard that I am basing my statement on what I have been taught by my mentor who is a Master Herbalist.

Herbal tinctures featuring multiple ingredients that support the same desired outcome can include less of each ingredient per unit volume while maintaining effectiveness. The idea is to provide the desired outcome in the gentlest (read: most widely accessible) way possible.

If you rate our products based solely on CBD per mL then we are clearly not impressing anyone. I even list the other brand as the winner in this regard. We recognize that there are certain people who will benefit from higher CBD dosages and for those people I believe that another brand would be better suited for them.

Churchill‚Äôs hostility toward Indians has long been documented. At a  War Cabinet meeting, he blamed the Indians themselves for the famine,  saying they ‚Äúbreed like rabbits‚Äù. His attitude toward Indians may be  summed up in his words : ‚ÄúI hate Indians. They are a beastly  people with a beastly religion.‚Äù On another occasion, he insisted they  were ‚Äúthe beastliest people in the world next to the Germans‚Äù.


The nauseating racism of this man is fully evident in this disgusting statement that he made before the Peel's Commission -

I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.

Took a shower, did the detangle with DevaCurl NoPoo Original and a Denman brush (five bristle-rows)... it went so fast! Still losing a lot of hair.

I brushed in DevaCurl One Condition Original, then rinsed while I hung my head upside-down. Applied DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel with praying hands, squeezed out the water, plopped into a Jersey towel for half an hour. 

These are NOT the happy boingy curls of yesterday! Then again, I'm no professional stylist. But still, I have hair goals! So I endeavor to improve my routine. 

Now, Tania did NOT use gel when she styled my curls, but rather she used a leave in conditioner. She also used a technique she called ""hula hooping"", where she individually selected each curl, applied a bit of product, and, taking the curl by the end, spun it, like a jump rope, releasing it to coil itself up perfectly. This seems WAY HARD! &amp; TOO MUCH WORK!! üò±

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our sidebar rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""higher"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

Thanks for understanding!

#NOTE: **Do not message us asking how much karma you need or how old your account must be.** The threshold for post and comment karma is **VERY** low and will not take you long. Persistent ignoring of this message will result in you being muted.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","No, you're misreading both me and the overall message. 

""Accept all"" is only kind of the message. ""Accept all"" means, ""don't shut queer people out of your life and especially out of opportunities just because they are different."" What it does NOT mean, is ""everyone has to be together and the same"". That's assimilationist thinking - very 1990s. 

So, queer people accept you. No one's out here saying ""straight people should be denied housing bc gross."" We could not care less what they are up to in their private lives.  But acceptance doesn't mean being all in each other's business. It is valuable and beneficial for minority groups to have spaces away from the majority.  It leads to stronger messaging, stronger intra-community bonds,  and better self-determination.",1569888264

If you google around, you can see where Russia is gaining ground or has surpassed the USA in key areas. At the end of the day, when it comes down to it, hard power is the ultimate force, and Russia is able to maintain it without the giant economy. Their influence in the Middle East is growing, they maintain good relations with China, and the gap between Russia and the USA in key areas is only growing. 

Is it likely Russia becomes a superpower again? Hard to tell. But they are the most likely candidate, with China after. China is a fragile country that break apart the second their economy hits the gutter. They've been around for 3000 years but have only been unified for 300 of those years.

However, it is my understanding Trump also wants to investigate Clinton collusion in the 2016 elections with Ukraine.  Funny how suddenly that is silly and stupid compared to the apoplexy of people over Trump when he was found to not have colluded.

I would not find it surprising if this present smear is more about deflecting from that investigation as the accusations are stupid and warrantless after reading the transcript, and finding out its placement in the alternative  server was not unusual, it was standard practice after early leaks in Trump's administration.  

The cherry on the top is Schiff tweeting about this shit weeks before it was released to Congress.  Kind of makes it sound like the whistleblower may have been working with Schiff and Democrats all along.

"PokemonHallOfFame","t5_x5g5e","22. I was seeing success with Stun Spore on Chibi Minoriko, so I skipped on learning Sunny Day, its moveset is stacked so far. As such, I allowed the Chibi to evolve to Minoriko. Then I found the first Mystery Shard, it's in Rocket Game Corner. Now I'm torn on what to do with Kokoro. Both of its evolved forms are mixed attackers, but the stat spread is different. The secondary typing is different as well, one form is Heart/Ghost, the other is Heart/Steel. Kokoro recently learned Line Slash, and here I thought it was weird. Because I'm unsure, I gave the Mystery Shard to Lily Black, I'm much more sure about it evolving to its Alt form. Lily Black's ability slots are confusing. It has Spring Charm as its only ability, but its Ex and Alt forms have Speed Boost as a second ability, the first still being Spring Charm. It was a crapshoot I guess, to get Speed Boost. I didn't get it, I kept Spring Charm. Ah well. Spring Charm is just Marvel Scale renamed. 

23. The first major trainer battle where I used more than Kokoro and Lily Black, Sanae KO'd 2 of Giovanni's Bon√©kas, Water Pulse doing wonders as Giovanni specialized in Earth-types. Kokoro did take over for the first half of the match though. I'm satisfied though, and I didn't need a second attempt.

24. I skipped the rival battle in Prism Tower (Pokemon Tower), thinking it would be difficult. After all the Rocket stuff and other battles, I finally went to challenge Brooke. I beat her, first attempt. I'm not sure if I would've beat her if I hadn't beelined to Celadon. I definitely would not have had a strong Sanae and evolved Minoriko, so this was the best outlet. Hmm, I think I can challenge the Vermillion gym leader now.

25. The gym leader's name is...Celsius, that's cheeky. Well, that was easy. I should've challenged him as soon as Kokoro learned Line Slash. That move wrecked Celsius' entire team. Steel-type with a higher critical rate than normal, it was a massacre. Sanae led, but it would have got owned by his lead. I had no choice but to at least use Kokoro. Alt Lily Black could've at least took out his lead with Psycho Cut. Anyway, I won, woohoo. 

26. Celadon Gym is next, and it's a foggy version of the Vermillion gym trash puzzle. Great. Judging by the first trainer, the type-specialty is Fire. That's perfect for Sane and its Water Pulse. I forgot to mention that Celsius' sprite is of the Gentleman, in battle, in the overworld, it's some other old man sprite. For the Celadon leader, Cole, his overworld sprite is a cop, yet his sprite in battle is a kindler. Sanae took out two of Cole's Bon√©kas, and Alt Lily Black took out the last two with Psycho Cut. Reason-type isn't super effective against Fire-type, but his last two Bon√©kas had a common weakness to it. Faith and Fairy. That's pretty logical. Reason conquers Faith and Fairy: beliefs and fantasy.  

27. Next is Prism Tower. The weird thing with the Pokedex, yet again, it shows that I caught Chibi Lunasa, but I never did, it's my first time encountering it. Chibi Merlin was another that had this issue. I caught it, and it didn't take me to its Dex entry, indicating I already caught it, though I didn't. Anyway, Minoriko got to learn Heat Wave. That's strange, it's pure Nature, but it can learn a Fire-type move. I replaced Extrasensory with it, Sanae already has Extrasensory and I don't want to replace either Stun Spore or Leech Seed. Mega Drain is STAB, need that. I was kind of regretting Heat Wave because it kept fucking missing, and its accuracy is 90. Typical RNG bullshit. Layla replaced Marowak, and you can't catch it. I wish I could, but ah well. Sanae made it to level 40, eligible for level-up evolution, to Ex Sanae. I didn't want that, that one's defensive while I want something offensive, thus I need Alt Sanae. That means I need another Mystery Shard. The next one I can get is in Silph Co. 

28. Snorlax is replaced by an old turtle. Not an old turtle hermit, that's Roshi. Ground/Flying, Sturdy, 220 Defense! Wow. Weak stats everywhere else though. I caught the Genji on Route 12 because I wanted to get the Super Rod. The house where you would normally get it isn't there. Goddamit. It must be in the house that requires Surf to get to. The one in Celadon. Yeah, where the Softboiled move tutor is. He's gone, and the house has a door here. 

29. Despite being able to jump to Celadon without having to beat the Vermillion Gym, there are some other blocks. Silph Co is blocked until after you beat the Fuchsia Gym. Clever, I was going to go there and nab the second Mystery Shard. Looks like I have to go Fuchsia. 

30. The Oak Aide on Route 16 still gives you the Amulet Coin. That must mean the Route 15 one has the Vs. Seeker. MOTHERFUCKER! The Oak Aide on Route 15 isn't there. So where the fuck is Vs. Seeker? God, typical. I should've known. Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced (Reloaded) doesn't have it, Touhoumon Purple is an Emerald hack so of course, it wouldn't have it, and now this hack potentially doesn't have it. Shit. 

31. I went to the Nature Preserve (Safari Zone). I found a Mystery Shard there, which I didn't expect, but that's great. God man, more changes that prove that this hack isn't about hand-holding. HM03 isn't gifted, a Master Orb is. Great, but Surf is more desirable. So that means I won't get Surf until Saffron.  

32. Fuchsia Gym is Ghost-type, and the layout is similar to Saffron's gym, warp tiles and all. The tiles take you to different spots, so it's not a carbon copy of Saffron. The gym leader is Wisp, who uses the Hex Maniac sprite. Surprisingly I got swept the first attempt. Her lead Ex Tojiko is super fast, and its Shadow Ball is powerful. Kokoro is my best bet because it has Ominous Wind and is a Ghost-type as well, but damn. Alt Lily Black can outspeed it, but I think what happened in the first attempt was that I missed or something. I already forgot. I lost again, but I have a clearer sense of what I need to do to win. I'm not overleveled by the way. I went into a reset kick, rather than let Wisp finish me off completely, I reset when I knew I wouldn't win. During this, I noticed that her strategy is based on speed. Whether it's natural speed or weather-boosted speed. Ex Tojiko even demonstrates speed control against me, with Thunder Wave being used. For the most part, I have to be faster and pack more of a punch to win. Easier said than done. 

33. I didn't need to reset many more times to get the win. Here's what I did. I gave Alt Lily Black the Cheri Berry and had it lead. Play Rough needed to be used twice to KO Ex Tojiko, and it always used Thunder Wave. Paralysis is bad for this match. That worked, Alt Lily Black than KO'd Ex Yatsuhashi with Play Rough. Alt Kogasa came in with Intidimidate, but I 2HKO'd it with Play Rough. Ex Murasa took out Alt Lily Black. I brought in Minoriko to Stun Spore it. Ex Murasa KO's it, here comes Kokoro, who took it out. Unfortunately, her last Bon√©ka wiped out Kokoro after my Ominous Wind didn't KO it. Sanae came in and thanks to Serene Grace and Extrasensory, I flinched my way to victory. Woo! I did it without using the Mystery Shard I got to evolve someone. With that said, I deserve to use it now, and on the one that helped me at the last minute, Sanae. Now I have an Alt Sanae, yes! 

34. I can enter Silph Co now, but the Rocket grunts and scientists follow the level curve more consistently, they're in the low 40s instead of the high 20s and low 30s. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that they're like this as a way to compensate for no Vs. Seeker. Because of this, I lost to Grunts a couple of times. I made some mistakes because of not studying the type chart, but at the same time, these Grunts were packing serious heat. On the 4th floor, I found the next Mystery Shard and gave it to Minoriko, she was falling behind because Mega Drain is weak and Heat Wave is her only great attacking move at this point. Upon evolving, I taught her Solarbeam, but now I need Sunny Day. Fortunately, I got the TM so I replaced Leech Seed with that. Now I can utilize Chlorophyll. 

35. The Brooke battle in Silph Co took a bunch of tries. It was down to getting the right Bon√©kas in. I would have bad exchanges and learn from them. I also constantly looked up the types of each of Brooke's Bon√©kas, I should've just wrote them down so I didn't have to keep bringing up the Touhoudex. Alt Minoriko was an early-match MVP with Sunny Day and Heat Wave/Solarbeam coming through, making me glad I brought in Sunny Day and Solarbeam. I looked at the IVs and natures of Brooke and sure enough, she has perfect IVs and natures. No EVs, but that must extend to all the other major trainers. 

36. It took several tries against Giovanni. The same thing happened, I needed to get the right exchanges, otherwise, I allow myself to be swept. The best Bon√©kas to use were Alt Sanae and Alt Minoriko, because of super-effective coverage. So it was a matter of getting them in advantageous situations, then have other Bon√©kas take on other threats, for whatever reason. I focused a lot on Alt Sanae for a while, and it ended up being the first to break level 50. Alt Lily Black followed, but the other two haven't made it yet. I could fix it if I had a fucking Vs Seeker. There is grinding in the wild, but I think the level curve in the wild is low. The Silph Co president gave me Surf.",1569888267

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","Corporations don't exist without laws. The foundational authority for laws is actual people. Literally, we the people own the rights of existence for corporations. UBI is a dividend paying you for your share of that ownership.  

[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend)

&gt; A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. 

Also, I seriously think that a UBI should be based on actual ownership of stock via a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Three reasons:

1. At a relatively low level of ownership (about 20%), it would be possible to eliminate many kinds of taxes permanently. The reduced cost from zero taxes becomes a huge price advantage in global markets. 
2. If the UBI comes from actual ownership of shares, then it can't be futzed with by later politicians.
3. When the population has a stake in the ownership of the businesses, the people will be willing to look out for--to care about--those businesses, and without resentment.",1569888268

"Grimdawn","t5_2s6i9","&gt;Now I will assault the necropolis and my character is dying frequently. 

A Witchblade should not have to die too often.   
Invest in Soldier skills that boost your character's toughness and survivability. Carry a shield and use Overguard when the going gets tough. Force Wave is an AoE attack, scales with your weapon damage, and offers a stun against mobs. Especially useful if they have been speed-boosted by Fevered Rage (a skill I would suggest skipping, btw).

&gt;The core skill I'm using is bloody pox, nearly skilled it full with all additional enhancing skills.

Blood Pox is more of a debuff than a killer, at least on its own. Combine it with Curse of Frailty, to make your bleeding and physical damage more effective. Alternatively, switch to Dreeg's Evil Eye as your main damage dealer. 

I don't know how much you rely on weapon attacks with your build, but do consider boosting them with either Cadence, or one of the Soldier's Weapon Pool Skills, like Markovian's Advantage. 

Finally, Blood of Dreeg is a very useful self-heal.",1569888268

Again you can ohko siegfried easily, this isn't some hard ass shiet that needs you to go get super meta supports.

let me just give you a very simple example

shakespeare, friend kintoki(np1), leonidas(gives you protection vs trash and 25% buff), paul bunyan(ox king)

np damage with event CE is avg 564,910 damage (508,431 to 621,388) and boom you fked it because siegfried only has a 90% specialdefmod as his def is ignored, no need for any sort of merlin waver or some big ass boost.

remove the ox king and you still do 522,970 damage (470,686 to 575,255), sub for lubu if you want more time to gen your NP charge, in case you gonna use the(gotta use friend ssr argument)

and as for herc you can solo him with various supports that does not give 2 fks about his debuff immunity, a case of the best example is cu alter support as well as the fact there are at least 15+ servants that can already solo him plenty of those does not need any sort of debuff on him, not to mention way more if we are talking about full teams that does not need to put any sort of debuff on him.

You seems to be clearly ignoring that the 2 things you added meant shiet outside of just restricting it more when the pool of solutions to it is basically so large already regardless of your budget and the people that knew what they are doing are still just gonna shiet on the boss hard with 0 problems.

Also, the only way IIRC to gain proficiency with any improvised weaponry, ie. your shield is with the Tavern Brawler feat, and the only way to ensure you have that from level 1 is to be a variant Human... it also would supplement your unarmed damage some, so that's a nice bonus.

Monk is a good unarmed choice... but it won't let you use a shield, so I believe that a Fighter (which has a couple broad archetypes that could work) would be a better choice out of the gate, or... more to the point... an Oath of Redemption Paladin.

If he can't get a $2,500 auto loan from his bank, he's likely a bad credit risk - that is, has a history of not paying his debts - and you should prepare for that risk if you continue. There's every chance he'll ghost off into the distance, with your truck, and without paying you for it. There's no legal document that makes that risk go away - all the legal options kick in _after_ you've been screwed.

If you want to go ahead with this, keep the title in your name and write out an agreement that spells out the amount due each payment, as well as promising to turn over title at the end of the contract. Spell out your expectations regarding the return of the vehicle in the event the buyer doesn't pay, but realize that your only real option is to take the buyer to small claims court.

An instant, near painless (in most cases) method is vastly preferred, and harder to fuck up than hanging, jumping, or poisoning.

What is extremely controversial is that we should force all citizens to permanently give up their right to effective self defense to make it 6% harder for depressed male gun owners to commit suicide.

Even if that number was far higher, why would we ever restrict people's access to effective self defense just because some people will use a weapon to harm themselves? 

Are we so far from individual freedom that we deny any right to end one's life on their own terms AND are willing to restrict everybody else's rights if it might measurably reduce the percentage of suicide attempts that are successful?

If everybody just reached out to two quiet coworkers and neighbors, they'd stop far more suicides, but reaching people is hard for a government, so they just ban guns because it's cheap to do.

And don't bother to ban handguns that are commonly used to commit suicide. Heck, what politician is even mentioning handguns these days, despite often asserting that their gun bans will reduce suicide deaths. No, ban AR15s that are used in no more than a handful of suicides every year.",1569888271

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","Jesus was a Jew and the Jews believed homosexuality was as a sin worthy of death.  The only reason they didn‚Äôt stone people to death for various offenses described in the mosaic law is that they were under Roman rule and not allowed to do so.

In the 4 gospels, Jesus is recorded as saying a number of things that contradicted some interpretations of the law.  Some of these created a lot of controversy.  But Jesus is not recorded as saying anything about homosexuality.  The fact that he didn‚Äôt is telling.  There are two options:  
- Jesus was a liberal LGBT activist, but none of the early Christians who listened to him talked about it, so when the gospels were written decades later, no mention is made of Jesus‚Äô progressive stance.  I find this unlikely, as it would have been his most controversial teaching amongst his Jewish followers.  There‚Äôs no way they wouldn‚Äôt have talked about it.  
- The second, and simplest, explanation is that Jesus never really discussed the topic.  He saw no need to as he and audience all held the same view of homosexuality described in the Old Testament.  

We can be near certain the historical Jesus disapproved of homosexuality.  Modern Christians understand that homosexuality should not be a sin.  They know and understand that gay people are just as good and loving and kind as straight people.  So they often look to the fact that Jesus didn‚Äôt explicitly condemn homosexuality in the gospels as somehow being evidence that he supported, or at least condoned it.  But if you actually think it through, it‚Äôs easy to see that this is fallacious reasoning.  They are projecting their own modern, progressive, more enlightened, morals onto an ancient historical person because it‚Äôs what they want to believe, rather than extracting that persons likely beliefs from the available evidence.  

I‚Äôm not saying this to encourage any Christians to become homophobic - quite the opposite.  I‚Äôm just pointing out that the historical Jesus probably was.",1569888272

"CrazyHand","t5_33vle","70:30 seems really radical to me for Ness Pika. Sure you stuff me out but I touch you once and do crazy damage, and I still have top tier tools.

For Ness Pichu, those are all really good reasons for why Ness wins neutral against Pichu. That doesn't change the fact that if I touch you once you should die because you're the easiest character to loop in the game and thunder or bair finishers put you so far offstage you get edgeguarded for free. So you'd better not screw up once in neutral or you're going to get blown up.

Lucas doesn't have the one thing that makes Ness good against Pika and Pichu in neutral: fast, meaty aerials. I don't care how disjointed they are, because quick attack and roll-cancel grab are some of the best anti-disjoint tools in the game. I care about if they're fast and if they beat my hitboxes up close. Ness can do both, Lucas can't do either.

I'm nowhere near as afraid to edgeguard Lucas since getting hit by up b doesn't mean death almost ever, it moves slower so it's easier to catch and beat with dair (about as easy to catch as fox up b,) and I have so many multihits that you'd be dumb to even try to tether. I can't gimp you, but I can bully you forever and push you out far enough that I can catch your up b with a dair and kill you, so it's all the same, really.

As for you edgeguarding me, lolno. Ness d smash is pretty much the only thing in the game that can edgeguard rats without a hard read. In fact, I haven't actually seen many Lucases go offstage for edgeguards in tournament, probably because your recovery is so slow and linear that you're prone to getting reversaled. His ledge trapping is pretty great, but Pikachu and, to some extent Pichu, can opt out of getting ledge trapped with up b from ledge.

&gt; His pk fire in particular is really good against the rodents' recovery... it is perfect for going deep and sniping them out of skull bash

Here's where I have to question if you've played any good rat players. Skullbash is only ever for if you're so low or so high that the opponent literally can't hit you out of it without SD'ing. 99.99% of the time, up b will get you back just fine, and it's basically impossible to intercept without 2 framing, and even then, I can just go past the ledge, especially with Pika since my second zip will interrupt your 2 frame attempt.",1569888273

"carnivore","t5_2rvme","I've been cooking with cast iron for many decades.   When I have cooked on stuff from meat and some fat I let the fat cool until solid or soak it with a paper towel to minimize fat in my drain.  Toss the towel, or scrape out the fat with a spatula into a garbage can.

Then the pan goes to soak for some hours in my sink with hot water and dish detergent.  When I come back later I turn on the hot water again while I scrape the pan again with my metal spatula. That gets rid of most baked on stuff.  When the pan is warm again from the hot water I scrub lightly with a ""scotch bright"" fiber sponge.  With little actual effort I have a CLEAN pan.  I lean it sideways to air dry.  Sometimes the pan ends up with a little orange surface rust but that's just iron color and iron is a necessary dietary ingredient.  Iron makes our blood red and distributes oxygen.

I never get fat coating the sink or sponge.  Extra fat goes into my trash can.  I rinse the sponge after scraping the pan and let it dry until next time.  They last a month or more.  My pans have lasted most of my life and are just as good as I bought them half a century ago.

Don't believe those who say ""not wash.""  The secret of cast iron is that it is porous.  Fats soak into the metal.  They eventually soak all the way through and make the bottom black.  You don't need fats coating the surface except while in use.  Most people don't understand the difference between cast iron and steel pans.  Steel is non-porous.",1569888274

When you do that, Microsoft doesn't actually check that account and doesn't share the password. Your MSA password is handled by Microsoft and your email password is handled by the provider.

If they are the same, it's a coincidence. 

Yes, it's confusing. It's designed to be ""simpler"" and less intrusive than making people make a Microsoft email address. IMHO, it's only simple until it's not, and then it's super hard to explain, diagnose, or fix.

BUT the best way to start is just to build the F2P Ginyu Force team, every day you can farm for a different Ginyu Force character, you want to farm them, dokkan awaken them and then max out their potential system to rainbow them. Once you finish the full set you get a copy of LR Ginyu Force (Goku) as a mission reward which you can use as a leader. The Ginyu Force team can beat a lot of the normal content in the game including many of the Dokkan events and gives you a great start for working on other better teams.",1569888277

Original Post:

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our sidebar rules:

&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""higher"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

Thanks for understanding!

#NOTE: **Do not message us asking how much karma you need or how old your account must be.** The threshold for post and comment karma is **VERY** low and will not take you long. Persistent ignoring of this message will result in you being muted.

#REPEAT: DO NOT MESSAGE US ABOUT THIS.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I'm no expert and I'm certain there is a better way to explain this but you know how you do a bicep curl and can feel the bicep muscle extend and protract like an elastic band at different parts of the range of motion. And then by the end of it your bicep would be slightly sore due to time under tension? Until maybe 6 months ago, I never ensured that my legs, especially my quads, felt anything like that. I honestly don't know why. But now, I ensure that I go ATG, and ensure that I activate my quads at the bottom when the muscle under tension is at the highest, I believe. Also I failed to do the same when I did leg extension and curls mainly because I progressed way too fast. I have lowered how much I curl and extend with my legs and focus heavily on muscle and mind connection to get that muscle activation. 

Luckily I did it properly at the top with the glutes hinge, so I'm really happy with my glutes.

Lastly, even if I was doing everything right, I firmly believe I wasn't doing enough squat volume. And my legs were just fat, which helped a lot with being able to lift so heavy.

"HongKong","t5_2rbn0","**Citizens‚Äô Press Conference ([video](https://youtu.be/tkC6Dhz58sE))**

English portions: @9:40, @24:15, @32:26.

**Summary Points**

* 10/1 will be a milestone of this entire movement.

* No one can mobilize everyone to come out/attend assemblies; some must have come out because their conscience was calling them.

* HKers do not desire or commit to terrorism.

* We hope the government will respond to public opinion after 10/1.

* @8:20 of the video:  ‚ÄúOn 6/9, we were 1 million strong.  On 6/16, we were 2 million strong.  What was our reason for stepping out without regret onto the streets?  The reason was, by the 70th Anniversary of the PRC, to show with our numbers to the Chinese Communist government, to the pro-Beijing HKSAR government, and to the world that Hong Kong persists in our pursuit of the Five Demands, not one less.  We would rather die than surrender, and will resist this cruel totalitarian government to the end.  This is the best of times, this is the worst of times.  We don‚Äôt know what the era will be like after tomorrow.  Regardless, this era has chosen us to create it.  Hongkongers, we once set a date, on the day we reclaim Hong Kong, we will meet at the bottom of the pot &lt;tr. note: the Legco building is shaped like a pot&gt;.  Tomorrow, will you step out with us to bring about that day?  Five Demands, not one less.  Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of an era.  October 1, celebrate their mother.  Thank you, everyone.‚Äù

**Q&amp;A**

Do you agree with the police that frontliners are violent?

* No.  We protect the peaceful protestors from being subjected to violence from police and pro-Beijingers.  The violent people are those who attacked ordinary civilians on 7/21.  They don‚Äôt need an excuse to beat people anymore, but Hongkongers will not be afraid.

What do you expect on 10/1?  Why is 10/1 a milestone?

* Since June, we have not known what the next day would bring.  But we believe that, with numbers, we will be safe.  The government is waiting for our numbers to dwindle but they will never see that day.  Five years ago, we didn‚Äôt know how we‚Äôd go on, but here we are today.  **Conscience has no expiration date.**  10/1 is a milestone only because it‚Äôs a milestone for Beijing, for their face.  Beijing wants to show a peaceful, harmonious, celebratory face to the world, but if we can hold our voices through that date, our movement will live on.  After that date, we hope that Beijing will seriously consider how they are going to approach this situation.

* We don‚Äôt want bloodshed or arrests.  But if the police are out of control tomorrow, it‚Äôs up to them.  It was they who taught us that peaceful demonstration is futile.  But we sincerely hope that that won‚Äôt be the case tomorrow.

What do you want?

* When the Japanese troops finally left Hong Kong after WWII, a peace memorial was set up.  At the time, we want only to peacefully live our lives.  We want the same today.  We hope for a real peace, with input from our younger generation, with democracy and freedom.  We only want the freedom to live our ordinary lives.  What we want may be the world to a totalitarian regime.  But to an ordinary person, it is a very small request.  We want to say what happens in this city, to decide our future, it‚Äôs that simple.

What format?  Six districts across HK or one concentrated location?

* The format is unimportant.  What‚Äôs most important is the numbers.  Whatever you choose, the most important choice you make tomorrow is to stand up and step out for what you believe in.  Once you make that decision, all you need to do is watch the online messages like you normally do, and everything will fall into place.

Question from Taiwanese reporter:  Do you expect tomorrow to be violent?  The police said that they collected information that said frontliners are planning on killing police tomorrow.

* We very much appreciate Taiwan‚Äôs support, and we hope to be able to return the support if needed.

* Tomorrow, please try not to be injured or arrested.  On this eve before the storm, think of what you have achieved, and let your conscience guide your next steps.  We are not violent, they are.  We are not terrorists, they are.  We Hongkongers are not out to protect ourselves, but to protect each other.

&lt;Tr. Note:  Regarding the so-called ‚Äúinformation,‚Äù the police are relying on a Telegram channel.  But the Telegram channel is suspicious.  It was registered/named using Mandarin, which is not the dialect that Hong Kong uses (it is what mainlanders use).  Almost all of the messages on the channel itself is questioning the authenticity of the channel and its creator.  In sum, the protestors have NO PLANS TO BE VIOLENT, and the ‚Äúinformation‚Äù that the police pointed to is not reliable.&gt;

How will you sustain the movement after tomorrow?

* People sustains movements.  People follow their morals and conscience.  The CCP wants to suppress, repress, and oppress us.  If we weather through tomorrow and the White Terror, we will be able to go on.

What do you say to those who are losing hope?

* This is society‚Äôs movement.  It will take a long time, and may span the entire world.  It‚Äôs not just you.  You have all of us, too.  **We want to see everyone at the ‚Äúbottom of the pot.‚Äù**",1569888282

"CHIBears","t5_2s0u3","I'm not really directing this at you personally, but this sentiment always gets on my nerves. Fans love to think ""they need our ticket sales to stay in business!"", but it's just not true. Similar to teams in the NBA or MLB, the Bears would be just fine if not a single game ticket was sold. Ticket sales pale in comparison to what these teams get from TV and advertiser deals. Plus, profit sharing in the NFL ensures that as long as the league as a whole remains popular, everybody stays afloat. That's why teams like Miami and Washington can continue exist even though they have a combined 70 people that show up to the games.

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

My husband is awesome, he does a lot of stuff to help me out around the house (I'm not disabled, but I have a chronic pain condition that makes some things harder than they used to be, so he tries his best to make things easier for me). He's super thoughtful, he'll just do nice things for me randomly, and I try to reciprocate. In the last couple years I've tried to be mindful of making more of an effort to be appreciative. So I'll thank him for stuff, tell him I appreciate him, tell him how cute he looks, etc. We've been married a long time and I don't want him to think I take him for granted so I will tell him how hot he is, etc (he is always telling me I'm beautiful, why not? It's not like I don't mean it). Maybe she's just realizing what a catch she has and trying to let him know she's not taking him for granted.

Hell, as I was typing this my husband texted me thank you because earlier today he saw me doing some outdoor chores on our security camera (stalker!) since I work from home. So maybe it just seems normal to me because we make a point of being appreciative/complimentary, but I don't get what's suspicious about this.

That said, if being complimented makes him uncomfortable, he could (nicely) tell her to cool it. But my advice is to just enjoy it. She could also be seeing the effort he put in to lose a bit of weight and wants to encourage him to keep taking good care of himself.",1569888282

There's a good movie called 'The Seven Percent Solution' that proposes Holmes was a brilliant detective but was also a cocaine addict (what else did you think is in that pipe?) and Professor Moriarty was actually a harmless gentleman whom Holmes harassed after becoming convinced he was a criminal mastermind, and the true reason for Holmes' absence was recovering from his drug addiction.",1569888282

"PokemonHallOfFame","t5_x5g5e","37. Saffron Gym's interior is like the Cinnabar one. The type specialty is Dream, and the gym assistant thankfully told me its weaknesses, saving me some trouble. I needed to decide on Kokoro. Since it has more Special Attacks and that stat is higher, with a Mild Nature on top of all of that, I had Kokoro evolve by level-up. Now it's Ex Kokoro, Heart/Ghost. I was struggling with the Saffron gym, so I grinded up Ex Kokoro and Alt Minoriko past level 50, I battled trainers on Route 14 and 15.  

38. Surprisingly the Saffron gym leader, Tatakai, didn't require a second attempt. Ex Kokoro got some action, but the MVPs were Alt Lily Black and Alt Sanae. The latter didn't have super-effective coverage until her last Bon√©ka, but Extrasensory hit hard, and it was overleveled so that extra power helped.  

39. Time for some ""Legendary"" hunting. First, Magan, who is in the Power Plant. Level 55, so it could instantly fit into a team at this point. My team at least, everyone's in the 50s. Magan is the one that's just 5 big eyes. Power Plant turned out to be a good training zone, Bon√©kas in the low 40s. I had to use save states, it's still a hard bitch to catch. Power Plant had Thunderbolt by the way, sweet. 

40. Seafoam Islands has Ice Beam. Now the Legendary, it's Kikuri. Not as hard as Magan, thankfully. HM07 got moved to this location, but I have no use for it now. Making it to Cinnabar, the Fossil guy recognizes the Old Amber, but he also acknowledged something else I don't have, ""Mini-Hakkero."" Maybe that's the Blue UFO I got, but a bug has it turned to that instead of this item? I don't know, but this can be used to resurrect a Chibi Marisa, who was a Fossilmon in Touhoumon Purple. The Old Amber can be revived to Chibi Shingyoku.

41. I was wrong about the Celadon house that's accessed through Surf. An old woman offering a Chibi Mima for a Chibi Yukari is in there. Also, the Move Relearner is there. Sweet. 

42. I kept Chibi Marisa and grinded it up from level 20 to level 45. During that time, it evolved to Marisa, and I kept it from evolving until I got Thunderbolt and Nasty Plot learned. Then, showing that there are a few Stone evolutions, I used a Thunder Stone on it and out comes Kirisame. That's a Bon√©ka I've seen in postgame areas such as Mt. Silver in TPPE. It's Electric/Flying with great Speed and Special Attack, and the ability Vital Spirit. Its other ability is Flash Fire, but I don't know if I can obtain it. 

43. Pokemon Mansion got renamed to ""SDM."" It's the same interior as Pokemon Manion, but with a bonus underground floor. The TM for Flamethrower is there, and at the new bottom floor is Elis. Dark/Electric. I could easily have it instead of Kirisame, possibly, but I spent too much time on this to just switch up. This was a problem because most of my team could OHKO or 2HKO it with different moves. That's not a good sign of how viable it would be, even though it has a crazy high Special Attack stat of 140. I had to use save states on this, but eventually, I caught it. I found another Mystery Shard here by the way. 

44. The Cinnabar Gym isn't locked, you can go there without needing to go to SDM. The interior is similar to the Fuchsia Gym. It's a Dark-type gym, the leader is Umber. I wasn't overleveled, but Kirisame swept him! Now I'm happier that I had this one join the team. His lead made the mistake of trying to put it to sleep, Vital Spirit prevents that. So all it took was 1 Nasty Plot and Thunderbolt to KO his 5 Bon√©kas. Woo!

45. Treasure Beach in One Island has TM04 since there's no Sabrina to give it to you. Two Island has the Fishing Guru that gives you the Super Rod. There's a new NPC in the house where the move relearner used to be. It's a Channeler that requests Ex Rin for Ex Yumeko. On Three Island, I battled those bikers, and one of them had an Alt Sekibanki, pure Dark-type. Its sprite is kind of scary, namely the face. 

46. Berry Forest has wild Tewi, which have a small chance of holding the Lucky Charm, which is the Lucky Egg of this hack. There is a Lucky Charm you can get in the overworld, you need Surf and Cut. Lostelle's dad gives you the Advent Shard instead of a Moon Stone, sweet. Now that I've been steadily keeping up with the level curve, even being overleveled often, I've now come to terms with the lack of a Vs. Seeker in this hack. Some wild spots have high-level Bon√©kas to battle, and I don't think any Bon√©ka has a growth rate higher than Medium Slow. So in some ways, you level up quicker than usual. Getting the Lucky Charm at this point, being close to Victory Road, where I assume will have great level Bon√©kas, I think grinding won't be an arduous task later on. Anyway, went through the Sevii Islands stuff on the first 3 islands. Ex Kogasa replaced Hypno by the way. Before leaving, I had to check out who replaces Moltres in Mt. Ember.  

47. There's a new path in Mt. Ember's cave area that leads to the Nature Dojo. That makes up for the lack of the Saffron Dojo. The choices after beating everyone in the Dojo is Chibi Yorihime and Chibi Toyohime, Faith/Steel and Water/Earth respectively. I passed on choosing in favor of getting to the Bon√©ka on the top of Mt. Ember. It was Konngara, pure Steel with 120 in Attack and 135 in Special Defense. I had to use a lot of save states, this thing was on a Fury Cutter rampage. Back to the Chibi choices in Mt. Ember, I chose Yorihime. 

48. Viridian time, no changes, it's still Giovanni. One attempt was enough to beat him. Almost everyone got involved, his last Bon√©ka Ex Tenma went down to my relatively new star, Kirisame. A bit of a spoiler to myself, I looked at the Trainer Level Guide, a useful txt file that's provided with the hack. It shows the levels of the major trainers. I noticed that the League goes up to 70. The rematch teams go up to 86! Goddamn. 

49. Back to my playthrough, I beat my rival Brooke in just 1 attempt. It was steady, not a long period of domination, it was down to 1 on 1. Not much to say, I didn't make any mistakes, surprisingly since I didn't look up the types of Brooke's Bon√©kas. I went off memory for most of them and some good guesses. For example, Thunderbolt by Kirisame was super effective against her Ex Reimu, I didn't know it would be. Now I do, this is good for the Champion battle. 

50. I tried to skip trainers on Victory Road, but this hack has trainers moved around to where most are hard to skip. I wanted to go to the Indigo Plateau Touhou Center and heal there. I don't have a flyer for the Victory Road trek. I did make it and then went back to battle trainers I skipped. There are some useful TMs in here: Fire Blast and Blizzard for example. Before challenging the League, I tried to farm for Blue UFOs, which can be used to pay the move relearner. I need to at least replace Kirisame's Thief. That sticks out like a sore thumb, but first I need Thief to farm for Blue UFOs. I also intend to farm for Lucky Charms and do some grinding. I want to bring everyone up to level 70. 

51. As expected, since the National Dex is given to me at the start of the game, that means I can do the Sevii Islands postgame relatively early. This should help with grinding, namely the wild areas, I want to save the trainers for after the first League victory. This also means I can go to Trainer Tower sooner than originally thought, and obtain more Mystery Shards if I wanted. I did have to beat on those 2 Rocket Grunts at Mt. Ember, they were in the high 60s. They weren't hard to beat though. The Mt. Ember cave area behind those Rockets keeps the level curve steady, Bon√©kas in the high 60s! 

52. I was hoping Trainer Tower would have more than the Mystery Shards, but nope. Standard items in addition to that. The Mart on Six Island also sells the Mystery Shard. There's an issue with a building that replaced the Mart on Four Island. It's a player linking place, making up for the fact that there's no second floor of Touhou Centers. The problem is that when you go in, you can't come out. So don't bother going there. 

53. I gave up on trying to farm for Lucky Charms. I didn't get any, not counting the one you can find in the overworld. I did grind on the grass region of Water Path. I made sure to avoid trainers. Some of my team went over 70, but the minimum is that number. I couldn't get a good move for anyone to get tutored from the move relearner. I did find that Kirisame can learn Aurora Beam, which is a TM in this hack. So I replaced Thief with that.",1569888284

Cersei stumbled over a rock.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to get up now,‚Äù she told herself.  ‚ÄúYou need to find the babies.  Four babies...why would they wander away from Mother?  They can‚Äôt count on their father, or the king‚Ä¶ I am their mother.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Her father stood in the middle of a plowed field.  The crops grew up around him as she watched, 

Jaime wore a blue cloak around his shoulders.  The two men spoke to each other but she couldn‚Äôt make out their words.  Jaime gestured with both hands, Tywin would offer a quick nod, or a gesture of his own.  It looked like some kind of game.

Neither would speak to her, even when she screamed.

‚Ä¶.

There was Marcella, sitting on a fallen tree, in the middle of the grey wasteland of stones.  The cold breeze was whipping her blonde curls and bright yellow cloth of her skirt.  Her arms were full of yellow flowers, huge and lush, from some impossible summer.  ‚ÄúI am not a piece on your chess board,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúI am not one of your fingers, I am not one of your jewels.‚Äù

‚ÄúHelp me,‚Äù said Cersei.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever helped anyone else?‚Äù  asked Marcella.  Her head tilted and her green eyes narrowed.  

The girl turned her back, and took a few steps, and there were just the rounded stones of a dry river bottom, and the sound of the wind.

‚Ä¶

The ring of hammer against anvil stopped as Cersei approached.  The man‚Äôs soot-stained hands pushed something back into the flames of the forge, and he set the tongs on the anvil.

‚ÄúHave you seen my children?‚Äù she asked.  The young man (why did he have Robert‚Äôs blue eyes?) still held the hammer.

‚ÄúDo you know,‚Äù he asked,  ‚ÄúHow long will it take the stonemasons of King‚Äôs Landing to rebuild what you have destroyed?‚Äù

‚ÄúThose were Daenery‚Äôs dragons, not mine!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is a thing called peace, have you heard of it?‚Äù  He turned away, lifted the tongs and pulled hot orange metal from the yellow glow of the forge.  

His hammer rang against the anvil, and he would not listen to her pleas.

‚Ä¶.

Cersei was tired of walking barefoot over stones.  She turned towards a keep made of translucent gray stone.  

The Lady Brienne‚Äôs feet were bare against the marble.  She held a sleeping child against her shoulder, with its tiny hand clutching folds of her red dress.  

‚ÄúHave you seen my babies?‚Äù  demanded Cersei.  

‚ÄúIf they were really yours, would you have sold them?‚Äù  The Lady eyed her suspiciously. ‚ÄúThe Mother will protect them all.‚Äù

The child turned her blonde head to gaze at her.  It was Cora.

‚ÄúGive me back my daughter!‚Äù  Cersei reached out.",1569888285

I had to miss a week due to vacation and when I came back it was only a day or two before our performance. I remembered the routines for all the numbers I was in and just needed a little catching up. One of the coaches just told me to follow along what this one girl was doing, lets call her Tara. So I tried to keep up and it seemed like I was in all the numbers Tara was in. The day of the show everything is going good, and everyones family and friends are there. We are getting prepared for another number but the group seems different from what I remember but Tara told me to just follow her because we were in the same numbers. It was dark backstage so I couldn't see much and just walk on stage with the rest of the group. The light hit us and they song begins to play, I didn't recognize the song but I started to try to do the same dance the other girls were doing because I don't know maybe I forgot the routine or something. and it didn't hit me that THEY WERE ALL WEARING DIFFERENT COSTUMES THAN ME. I soon realized that I was not in this piece and froze. For some reason in my head I thought it would be a good idea to try and finish the routine until they got into this hand holding circle thing and refused to hold my hand bc I clearly was not in the dance. So here I am, 9 year old me in the middle of these girls all holding hands in a circle around me, my face is bright red and I just push one of the girls hands away and walk off stage shamefully.

"AskMenOver30","t5_2y9pw","Bro, trust me - I worked restaurants, sales and customer service until I was like 35, those last 5 years being with a work-from-home telecommunications company that paid like shit and worked the hell out of me.

Turns out, I'm trained in everything.  Because 95% of any job is dealing with people, and you've got that shit on lock.  The other 5% is specialized knowledge, and hell, you can learn it.  So pick something you want to do, learn about it, look for opportunities and dive in.  Your already acquired abilities of conflict resolution, customer service skills, and ability to talk to others and explain things clearly, I shit you not, all that is a breath of fresh air in most fields out there.

For me, it was the healthcare field.  I'm not in any way involved with caring for people personally, which I don't think I'd enjoy, but I do well in problem solving and places like nursing homes, group homes, etc have a LOT of problems that need to be solved.  My job is to basically look out for people and make sure they're taken care of properly, so I'll assure that so-and-so is in a locked dementia nursing home because that's what she needs, and if her living situation doesn't meet her needs, I contact other people and have them work toward correcting it.  I talk to doctors and nurses to get updates on patients and make sure they're making the right decisions.  I have a psychology degree, but in reality, anyone could do what I do if they can pass the exams.

"MorganaMains","t5_38rbi","Morgana is a fundamentally simple champion and because of that she has an incredible amount of outplay potential.  Because she's so easy to play at a base level, and her skill ceiling is pretty low, she becomes an increasingly bad pick as your rank/mmr rises. 

Even so, she is a very good counter and situational pick.  You should win or stalemate every match up mid.  The issue here, however, is that unlike traditional mids she doesn't scale well with kills and farm.  She'll never have the damage output or kill pressure of other mages.

So it isn't enough to just win your lane.  You need to at least stalemate your lane and provide enough pressure to win one or two other positions.  For example, the moment you get ult you should look to repeatedly gank bot lane.  At a minimum you can force the enemy bot laners to burn summoners every time you ult. 

She's also very good at skirmishes with a jungle.  Her 2v2 ability in the early levels is pretty unrivaled as a mid.  Near the start of the season she was very good at securing crabs.  Now that's a bit less important.  

I'd say she's an average to strong pick mid. She's virtually unplayable as a support.  (Morgana is so OP with her 47% win rate as a support.)

If your team has a good late game adc like Vayne or Jinx and you have a skirmishing jungle then Morgana is a solid pick.  If your team has no engage and no late game then Morgana is the wrong pick.",1569888286

(I feel a project that I devote this type of energy to deserves quality materials). I will never find a ready-wear coat that fits in my shoulders and my waist at the same time. I don‚Äôt know what it would cost to pay a professional tailor to make me a winter coat but I have a feeling I can‚Äôt afford it lol, so it‚Äôs fortunate for me that I enjoy it.

It's like EVE online, except it's probably even worse. The only reason everyone aren't blowing others up is because of the big corps who have ALL the big guns (I.e. Titans) keeping everyone in check. You think the battle for Anorak's castle was big? B-R5RB was bigger. It was estimated that the damage incurred in that battle was worth more than 300000 dollars. For an online battle. If we assume each giant mech Wade and the gang pilots is worth a Titan, then let me tell you B-R5RB saw the destruction of 78 Titans. CFC/Rus alone lost 19 of them bad boys, compared to 13 Titans lost in TOTAL in the second biggest battle of the time. Yeah, a crippling blow on an economy right there. Businessmen would hate that.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","He is looking after the kid while she works. The kid cannot be left alone because he goes around breaking shit on purpose and being an asshole. So he has to sit him, waste all his time making sure this kid behaves while not having the authority to actually make him behave. Sounds like he is doing her a favor for free that most people wouldn't even do for money. She says leave the parenting to me, but doenst actually parent him because she did not punish him either, doesnt even offer to pay for the broken statue.

If the kid doesnt need babysitter then he can just stay at his own house while the mom visits the bf. She probably doesnt leave him alone because he is an asshole who breaks shit and would probably wreck her house or throw a party. So he DOES need a sitter but she just throws this responsibility on OPs shoulders while not granting him any authority.

The point is that she tells the kid he needs to stop disrespecting OP, and listen to him. Even if the kid still doesnt listen, the fact that the gf backs the bf up would have made a great difference. 

Funny how the bf needs to act mature in his approach while the kid that is an asshole and the mother that enables his behavior by not even punishing him get a free pass. OP is NTA here, he tried to bond, he tried to be a parent, the gf told him he doenst have to listen to you. So he stopped trying to bond and trying to be a parent.",1569888294

"algorand","t5_3k6uh","Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network‚Äôs liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.  You can pick either gross incompetence on the part of the economic architects or you can pick the project operating as a borderline scam.  In either case, it does not engender a lot of confidence.",1569888294

"vandwellers","t5_2rnwo","&gt;The good thing though is that insulation is a lot better at keeping heat IN than it is at keeping heat OUT. So in winter, although insulation cannot do very much useful all by itself, it is pretty good at trapping the heat from a heater and keeping the inside of the van warm.

This has been so extremely evident in my results. Today is a good example. 


* 7am 70F outside and inside car and coolers

* 4pm 81F outside after it got cloudy, 78F inside, 88F inside coolers, meaning car was a lot hotter previously

* 7pm 82F outside, 82F inside, 87F inside the coolers

* 30 minute drive with A/C on max

* 7:45pm 77F outside, 72F inside, med cooler 82F, Xtreme cooler 85F

So, basically, after almost 4 hrs those coolers have cooled down very little. It's also interesting and a bit depressing to see how little difference there is between 1/2"" of foam and plastic and 2"" of foam and plastic. The medium cooler is not as efficent in staying cold, but when it comes to trapping heat, the difference is not pronounced. That raises some questions about just how much van insulation is really best. I think eliminating thermal bridges is probably more important than sheer thickness of insulation for vehicles. 

I suppose I should build some polyiso insulated boxes both with and without steel beams to the outside to similate vehicle frames.",1569888294

I suppose HvV could be done theoretically once AI heroes are all viable but it wouldn't be a case of just shoving them into a new mode as they'll currently be programmed for the IA maps and to capture command posts, etc.

I doubt there will be any more Starfighter updates at all, it was a different dev team that has long gone to other things that worked on that stuff .

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Hello! In my retrospective, Only few new players who jumped to Dota starting as a support didn‚Äôt last longer than what they anticipated since its usually the most looked down role out there (buying wards, dust, literally giving 30% of your items before the start of the game, not being allowed to take cs, and so on.) support in dota 2 is damn tough. But judging you coming from league, I think you also know the standard of making the lane easier for the Hard Carry/ADR to farm and such which is a +1 for you. Pos 1 or being a hard carry usually is always the best start for some since its always farm, get items, win fights and the game. It primarily focuses on the basic of last hitting, creep control, power spikes. Being a support however overlooks the map on whatever the core needs, does it need an early gank? Wards? Or just even babysitting. Ward position is very very important in Dota 2. Me trying league before can say that dota 2 wards cover so much more area than league. It costs money for you and if destroyed by enemy, it gives them  almost the equivalent of 2 creep kills. I can generally go over and over since I basically started as a support like 8 years ago. But the very best thing to consider right now is watch purge gamers and other dota 2 starter tutorials. Its pretty damn hard considering over 100+ heroes are free and are ready to use. So be ready because every game is very much different from the other.",1569888298

"PokemonHallOfFame","t5_x5g5e","54. For the Elite 4 and Champion, I took things very slow. I would speed up for animations and what not to play, but everything else was slowly paced. Like I did in Pokemon LoL, I took note of each Bon√©ka's name and type, and looked at the type chart to see what works and what doesn't. I didn't even take notes of the match, just the types, so I can only summarize what I did instead of going step by step. There's not much to detail on some of the battles because those were closer to sweeping territory. Kadira was first, Heart-type specialist. I don't think I had one solid answer for Heart-types, I had to take advantage of each Bon√©ka's other type. I ended up losing 3 Bon√©kas. Again, I can't go into detail about this, I just don't remember. I won though, most of my team was used. Sabrina, yes, that Sabrina, is an Elite 4 member in this hack. She uses Reason-types, which is the equivalent to Psychic in this hack. Alt Lily Black is Fairy/Dark, so guess what? Yep, sweep. Admittedly I was overleveled against the E4 and even the Champion. The Champion had only 1 level 70, while my team ranged from 70 to 75. A level advantage mattered, but not entirely. Theo is a Faith-type expert. Alt Lily Black did most of the work thanks to Play Rough, which was super effective against Faith-types. I think I missed a Play Rough and got KO'd. Sanae took out his last Bon√©ka, Ex Advenstor, Faith/Earth, so it went down easily to Surf. Harry is a Beast-type expert. Alt Lily Black, Ex Sanae, and lastly Alt Minoriko, got involved. Alt Lily Black probably would've done it all solo if not for Giga Impact missing. In this hack, Giga Impact is Dark-type and is like High Jump Kick. The miss led to bad recoil. Ex Sanae got in, but I think I had a misclick. Ex Sanae could've stayed in the battle longer if not for that, but I managed to get 1-2 KOs. Alt Minoriko used Sunny Day, then Heat Wave to take out Ex Momiji, then Solarbeam to take out Ex Kagerou.  

55. Brooke, the Champion, of course, had a balanced team. I couldn't keep up with everything, so just believe me when I say that everyone got involved, and I think everyone got a KO. Her Alt Daiyousei lead was taken out by Play Rough via Alt Lily Black. Ex Sanae took out Ex Tenshi with Surf after it knocked Alt Lily Black out, but not before Alt Lily Black hit it hard. Ex Rika was Steel/Dark, so Sanae got Heat Wave in. Alt Ran came in and took Ex Sanae out. My starter, the OG, Ex Kokoro, came in and used Performance which is a Ghost-type Uproar. It took out Alt Ran, but it was still on a Performance trip when Ex Reimu came in and wiped it out. Kirisame came in with Thunderbolt. Ex Raiko is Ghost/Electric, so a good counter to my Kirisame. It knocked Kirisame out, leaving me with just 1 more Bon√©ka, Alt Minoriko. Thankfully it survived some crushing blow to set up Sunny Day and then take it out with Solarbeam, getting me the victory. Yeah, that was a long challenge, simply because I made sure to be very careful, and it paid off. This was on a first attempt too, so it shows how beneficial it is to just play at a slow pace, at least when it comes to these major trainer battles. I'm very satisfied with how this all turned out. I'm not done yet, of course. 

56. The wild Bon√©kas on the Sevii Islands goes up to the mid-70s! I was struggling against some of them more than trainers. Now I can see why the Vs. Seeker was removed, it's very useful, and it felt like the encounter rate was jacked up a bit in certain areas. Eventually, I got through all the trainers and my team ranged from the 75 to 82. It was a long postgame period because of lots of wild battles that I didn't simply escape from. Some changes: the Tanoby Key room is gone, the Tanoby Ruins is changed to where there are only two chamber entrances that act as the ends of a giant chamber. There's nobody in there, no wild encounters. There's some item you find called the Mystic Dew. This is used to water a special tree that's on Route 4, and the tree spits out ""Festive Dust."" That's used to evolve certain Bon√©kas to Festive forms, the description includes a mention of Christmas. 

57. Cerulean Cave has some more high-level Bon√©kas, and replacing Mewtwo is Sariel, Dark/Faith. It's level 80 too, yikes. On top of that, its catch rate is 3, and boy did I feel it. I was questioning whether I was supposed to catch it. I kept using save states and I only had one Bon√©kas that hasn't fainted. I even left the game running while taking a shower, thinking that coming back at a later frame would get me a capture. Immediately after the shower, it didn't. Sometime later, I finally caught it. I'm close to the end, the next step was to train my team up to 85. 

58. It took a while to get everyone up to 85, but I did it, Cerulean Cave taking over as the training spot. Now it's time for the final 5. This was worse than I expected. It took a couple of attempts, at least 6. I did the same thing as the first Puppet League challenge, taking my sweet time, writing down each Bon√©ka in each team, their types, and refer to the type chart. Most of the Elite 4's teams were the same, a change in form for certain Bon√©kas, and of course a 6th one for each member. Brooke, the Champion, had a mostly revamped team. Her starter wasn't even part of the team, indicating that this was carefully constructed to be a tough team. Surprisingly though, it took 1 attempt against Brooke specifically, but others required more than 1. Some of the defeats came from mistakes and even less from the fact that the opposing Bon√©ka was simply better. I think the most costly thing in those matches was fucking misses! There was a streak of failed attempts that happened because I fucking missed with Giga Impact on Alt Lily Black, among others. It pissed me off. The good thing is that I likely would have won my first attempt if not for bullshit RNG. The failed attempts saw me level up, more than I would've liked, as you can see by the image proved in my review. Alt Lily Black was level 91 and Ex Sanae was 90. 

59. I'll attempt to describe my victorious matches. Kadira got swept mostly from Ex Sanae. I don't think the original Puppet League challenge had Ex Sane sweep. I didn't realize that Faith-type is super effective against Heart-types. So there's that. Sabrina was mostly swept by Alt Lily Black, just like the original match. It would sweep as long as Giga Impact didn't miss! Ex Ran was always faster, so Alt Minoriko would take care of that. Theo could be swept by Play Rough on Alt Lily Black, but I would fucking miss and pay for that. So the rest of my team got busy, I can't remember who KO'd who, but yeah, that happened. Half of Harry's team was taken out by Alt Minoriko's Solarbeam. Kirisame would then take care of the second half.

60. Brooke, like the original match, saw almost everyone get involved. I got a good bit of luck with my lead Alt Lily Black getting an OHKO with a Critical Hit Play Rough. Alt Tenshi went down to Play Rough as well. Brooke's other team members went down. Again, I already forgot the details. Even though I won in the first attempt, that's because RNG didn't fuck me over, so I won't say this was the easiest battle. My team had to get involved, and previous matches relied on 1 or 2 of my Bon√©kas to sweep. This was NOT easy, that's for sure. Yes, I had some sweeping moments, but trying to get all of that in one run, is not easy. RNG bullshit and sometimes just not being powerful or fast enough, so I needed one little boost in level or more. At the end of this, I just said: ""Finally, holy fuck."" Something like that. It was frustrating, but I finished this hack, I can find some happiness in that. I would be happier if bullshit RNG didn't come through, but ah well. These League challenges proved to me how essential it is to take it slow in important battles, and to be very careful and just take note of the foe's team. It also proved to me that my team was strong, there was no weak link. Alt Lily Black was the lead for most of the League matches, and I believe that's what gave it the edge over other team members, it was the best possible lead. Other than that, everyone on this team was essential. A 6th team member would've been nice, but I got by just fine with 5.",1569888299

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Well, I think that‚Äôs the reason everyone‚Äôs mad at you and you think everyone‚Äôs wrong. The whole concept of him being wrong is revolved around OP‚Äôs emotions. There is no valid, non-emotional argument, because this entire problem is based on her emotions.

OP‚Äôs boyfriend made her feel super insecure, and really hurt her. I‚Äôve thought about other people during sex before, but I know not to say their name or bring them up while having sex. 

OP also did try communicating with her mans, and he shut her down and left. She tried practicing good communication skills (and honestly, handled it way better than I would‚Äôve), and he fucked off without giving a decent apology. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the asshole.

I think most of us try to put ourselves in the poster‚Äôs shoes when making our judgements, and if I put on lingerie for my boyfriend, I‚Äôd feel like shit for stepping out of my comfort zone just for him to think about ‚Äî and then TALK ABOUT ‚Äî another girl while I‚Äôm literally riding him.

It might be a little harder for you because I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre a guy? But as a 20 yo with insecurities myself, wearing lingerie IS really hard to do, so hearing OP get shut down like this hits a nerve for me, ya feel?",1569888300

-two cracked tiles in the kitchen area floor (two separate deductions)

- one Cambro bucket of dressing not dated (iirc they had made it and then the inspector people showed up, the guy said he threw it in the fridge and forgot, the irony lol)

-our bar dishwasher water was one or two degrees I forget off it's mandatory temp (that was a huge deduction, and an instrumentation failure)

-the table/rack where staff kept their purses in the back was one too few feet away from the ice machine (I don't remember how many feet that was?)

"dragonballfighterz","t5_3ltwg","The problem with ranking in Dragon Ball is that the upper limits are constantly changing and reached via training not just form changes.  In the cell saga alone the range of super saiyan goes from 'unable to harm any one of androids 16, 17, or 18' to 'Cell's 2nd form is a complete push over, who was himself trouncing androids 16, 17, and 18 combined' (Android 16 is a good benchmark as a fully mechanized being with an upper limit that doesn't change via training).  Super ruins any and every scale set by DBZ.  I got the impression that even non-super saiyan Goku was reaching what was once the realm of God-ki, which started off as stronger than a fully realized SSJ3.  Not to mention there's no context for how strong a SSJ4 (GT-ku) is relative to anything shown in Super.

You have to set clear contexts for when you are taking any one character's snapshot of power.  

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my comment is just a rant:  
In the context of taking power levels from the end of DBZ and additionally counting each form as the strongest version of that form prior to getting the next form (Base Goku and Base Vegeta):

 I would argue Vegeta should be above cell (since he can go SSJ2 unless we want to be super duper strict about SSJ1)

Kid and Majin Buu should switch (Majin buu is canonically stronger than kid buu who is himself just too stupid/ benevolent because he absorbed the old Kai's to abuse his power)  

I would argue SSJ3 Gotenks as a fusion is stronger than both Majin and Kid buu.

Trunks should move to just below cell and above Piccolo as someone who could trounce cell's 2nd form, who could trounce 17, 18, and 16 who would beat Piccolo through a battle of attrition.

17 should be brought in line with Piccolo, 18, and 16.

Broly is directly beneath Cell.  Cell can make cell juniors to beat a group of super saiyans, and Broly was barely defeated by the same group of super saiyans.

Ginyu Vs humans is weird, because we never get context for how much stronger the humans get in context of the Namek Frieza force with the exception of what I'm fairly certain is a non-canon joke of them sending the Ginyu force to the Home of Infinite Losers.  He's either just over Tien/Yamcha/Krillen, or just under the strongest they become.

Bardock is weird.  In his now cannon Super reveal, he falls to probably equal or under Nappa, who was an elite Saiyan warrior who worked with young Prince Vegeta.  In his non-cannon episode and non-cannon-er special he reaches super saiyan, but still barely defeats a member of Frieza's clan who is probably far-far weaker than the prodigy Frieza is... unless Frieza pre-super cannon is just an average member of his own race..........

This article discusses the trend of [businesses hiring philosophers](https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/mar/29/i-work-therefore-i-am-why-businesses-are-hiring-philosophers), especially in Silicon Valley.

Cognitive scientists [engage heavily with philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science?wprov=sfti1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science?wprov=sfti1).

It‚Äôs also worth noting that philosophy has been so fertile in birthing other disciplines precisely because philosophers were toiling away at abstract problems no one else was thinking of. Biology, economics, psychology, and early computer science are all fields that originated under the umbrella of philosophy, but the early philosophical practitioners of these fields were hardly ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù in the sense you‚Äôre describing. Gottlieb Frege and Bertrand Russell were concerned with such highly abstract questions as the definition of a number and the meaning of the indefinite article ‚Äúa‚Äù, but the system of predicate logic they created underpins the entirety of modern computing. It‚Äôs entirely possible that work being produced by contemporary philosophers could have similar importance for empirical science in the future. For example, as the tools we use to study the brain become more sophisticated, the rigorous models of cognition produced by modern philosophers of mind could have relevance to neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of consciousness.",1569888303

"AskWomenOver30","t5_2ya5k","I was raised in a less-than-stellar home and s a result my ""normal"" meter was broken, regarding how relationships function. If her home life isn't great, a relationship like this could be what she thinks is normal, or what people should expect, from a relationship. I was her age when my relationship with a shitty dude started.

It's not like people in abusive relationships loooove to be treated like shit. On the contrary, I hated to be treated the way I was, but I also thought that I couldn't expect any better.

I thought that leaving was a sign of weakness and that adults put up with this kind of treatment in order to live an otherwise happy life-- I didn't want to be seen as some kind of over emotional sensitive flower with super delicate sensibilities.

It can be very, very hard to reason with someone at this age especially if they had a shitty homelife. Trying to reason with her might put her on the offensive, like you are implying that she is dumb. It's likely she will have an excuse for every shitty behavior this guy throws at her-- his past sex abuses are in the past, and adults don't dredge up the past! He loves me so much he'd rather die than live without me! He misses me so much he can't bear to lose contact for even a minute!

Try to build up her self esteem. Tell her you are concerned about the way her boyfriend treats her, but don't push too hard. Show her examples of healthy relationships-- maybe hang out with some of your friends who are also coupled up with her. Let her know you are there to talk with her.

She won't leave until shes ready. For me, it took a year or so away from my shitty (at the time) family and around people who come from more loving backgrounds, and observing examples of good relationships, to make the connection that, hey, the guy I'm dating is a total POS and I'm going to leave him.

Above everything, no matter what happens, it won't be your fault if she doesn't break free. It's a tricky situation for sure. You can try but sometimes nothing happens.",1569888303

I‚Äôd also add that I‚Äôm stronger on some guys than I am on others and definitely haven‚Äôt had a chance to look at the legitimacy of their performance. For instance, Victor Robles mostly sucked but at times he seemed to really put it together and he was a highly touted prospect. If a guy like him does finally put it together they could be a league winner. Additionally, some of the guys on this list are obviously going to be drafted in earlier rounds. The reason I added them is because they had a strong second half and I have a feeling their ADP could be a really good bargain next year. I apologize if the format sucks as it‚Äôs just copied and pasted from my Evernote.

If you have access to good quality Sauerkraut, I'd recommend Schupfnudeln with Sauerkraut and Bacon cubes. 

Schupfnudeln are essentially very thick Potato Noodles, they're all over Germany. 
Either that, or look for ""Kn√∂del"" recipes. Same thing really, tho the dough is a bit different, since the Noodles are pre-cooked, then pan seared, and the ""Kn√∂del"" is a huge ball of it that's just being boiled. The Kn√∂del doesn't really need sauerkraut, you can use some much easier to find ""Rotkraut"" instead (Red Cabbage, basically)

You can add some ""Sch√§ufele"" to that, which is braised Pork Shoulder.

Means nothing. ""Good"" is subjective. In other words, what is good to you is not necessarily good to someone else. Why do I bring this up? When you're trying to discuss something you should stay away from subjective statements because those are just your opinion and not facts. 

Look, if you think Prime has "" much more""  then join Prime. Oh wait, maybe you just wanted a bitch and actually Netflix has ""much more"", eh? 

Now I realize what your problem is. It's that you don't realize you have a problem. It's actually quite a typical problem for people to have when they think that they're smarter than they actually are.

I'd definitely recommend bringing it up to your therapist. And in the meantime, I really recommend reading through some of r/CPTSD, see what you think about what other people are saying and if you can relate. I also recommend reading stuff from Pete Walker, he has a lot of free articles on the subject as well as some books.

It might also be good to take notes, jot down things to bring up in therapy. Reasons you do or don't think it applies to you, etc.

If it does apply to you, reading some of this stuff can be both revelatory and really difficult. If you need to pace yourself, by all means do it. I get exhausted after a chapter of his book from all the light it sheds on my life.

As a side note, a lot of the talk surrounding CPTSD relates to family abuse, but that's not the only way it comes about. Aspergers leads to lack of understanding among peers, which leads to bullying, and systematic bullying over time can absolutely fuck with a kid enough to cause it.

I guess cause of that not many people felt that close to me at school and my dad was somewhat distracted so didn't really let the school know or do much himself. I came in on my birthday and... Nothing. Made me fee awful, all the other kids got balloons on thiers, and nobody even said happy birthday to me, thought everyone hated me or something!

"Kenshi","t5_2td4i","1) Nope.  Water is handwaved as being drank whenever your characters eat, you don't need to carry it around.  There are mods that turn water jugs into low nutrient food items though, if you find that important for your immersion.

2) No practical use aside from selling them, those items just exist to be realistic clutter for buildings.  I hang on to stuff like that for roleplay reasons though, to pretend that cups and bowls and such in character inventory are being used with meals.

You want food in inventory to avoid starvation.  It needs to be in the inventory of the person who is hungry or in a backpack (characters share food if it is in a backpack as a default AI setting).  When the hunger meter number hits 250 a character will eat.  Below 200 and you are starting to suffer from poor nutrition.  As the number gets lower, you take increasing stat penalties.  At 75 on the meter you will collapse, and without someone else bringing you food will starve to death.

4) If a shopkeeper dies that is it, their shop is gone for good.  There are mods that add regenerating NPCs for that kind of thing, but it isn't in the vanilla game.  Though the barman may not be actually dead even if he isn't manning the counter.  If they were beaten up badly enough they might be  lying somewhere nearby in a recovery coma, it will take some time before they heal enough to be back on their feet.",1569888311

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt;  **Article:**

A record number of American public-school teachers have walked off the job over the past two years‚Äîand now another strike looms in Chicago. Chief among the teachers‚Äô demands is higher pay. They‚Äôre often right‚Äîteacher pay is too low‚Äîbut for the wrong reasons.

Teachers and their unions typically attribute low salaries to flat or falling state spending on education, with skinflint politicians to blame. But in most places education spending is rising. It isn‚Äôt showing up in teachers‚Äô paychecks because so much of it gets diverted to pay for expensive retirement benefits for former teachers. Politicians‚Äô overly generous past promises, sometimes made at the behest of teachers unions, are now coming back to bite the education sector.

The Chicago Public Schools have a pension shortfall of $11 billion. Retirement costs devour more than 25% of the money the system receives from the state. Such costly benefits constrain it and other school systems from offering higher salaries to teachers, increasing support staff, and reducing class sizes. This is the under-the-radar driver of teacher protests in Arizona, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Colorado and North Carolina and cities such as Los Angeles and Denver.

For years, states and school districts didn‚Äôt save enough money to cover the retirement promises they made to teachers. Now the bills are coming due. They have to be paid; strong contractual protections mean that outside of bankruptcy it is legally impossible to reduce these pensions. It is also morally difficult to cut retiree medical coverage for midcareer employees who have been planning on receiving it.

Today nearly 90% of teachers participate in defined-benefit pension plans. According to a report by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a Washington-based nonprofit, these plans have total estimated unfunded liabilities of more than $500 billion. Consequently most employer contributions aren‚Äôt saved for future retirees but used to pay off debt. In Arizona 82.7% of the employer contributions to the teacher pension system goes to paying off unfunded liabilities. Chad Alderman of Bellwethers Education Partners, an education policy group, estimates that West Virginia teachers forgo compensation equivalent to more than 20% of their salaries to pay down pension debt.

The cost of providing health insurance for retired teachers has also been rising. By 2016 states and localities were on the hook for about $231 billion in unfunded nonpension benefit liabilities for teachers and other public-education employees. Because the Los Angeles Unified School District covers retirees, its high health-care costs‚Äî$2,300 of the $16,000 it spends per pupil‚Äîprevent it from offering teachers even higher salaries.

Although America‚Äôs public education systems have accumulated huge debts to finance expensive benefits, only the few teachers who spend their entire careers in a single state or school district will earn full benefits. In many places, it takes 20 years or more of service to qualify for health coverage in retirement and 25 to 30 years to receive a full pension. Meanwhile, 4 of 5 teachers will leave the state or district before earning complete benefits.

Unlike the 401(k) plans that prevail in the private sector, public pensions and retiree health care aren‚Äôt portable. Some 75% of teachers are shortchanged because they quit teaching or change districts before vesting or leave when their contributions are still greater than the payout for which they are eligible. The teachers, including most of the younger ones, subsidize the lifers.

These trends belie the argument that ‚Äúgood benefits‚Äù are what attracts and retains good teachers. When only 20% of teachers stay in the state or district that provides their retirement benefits for their entire careers, those benefits are hardly sticky. Offering generous retiree health-care coverage may even encourage teachers who qualify to retire early, depriving schools of experienced instructors.

Most teachers today are mobile, and compensation systems should change to reflect that. States should leave the traditional defined-benefit pensions behind and move toward portable defined-contribution plans. That way, teachers who move will accumulate retirement savings and states will begin to reduce their liability. And more of the money in state education spending needs to show up in the paychecks of working teachers.

States could offer teachers a deal: We‚Äôll raise your salary if you switch to a defined-contribution pension plan. Governments would reduce their long-term pension liabilities and teachers unions could claim credit for winning salary increases. States in the South and Southwest, with Republican governments and weaker teachers unions, are well positioned to lead the reform effort.

School districts and states have little choice but to reform. Teacher retirement systems are at the heart of the budget crunch that increasingly leaves teachers, parents, communities and students unsatisfied.

"PokemonHallOfFame","t5_x5g5e","This was my 3rd Touhoumon hack, so the question in my mind is which one is the best so far. That honor still goes to the first one I played, Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced (Reloaded). The difficulty was intense without a hard mode, specifically in the late-game. The fact that the creator was able to squeeze in the Johto region along with Kanto and Sevii is very impressive. It's longer, the level curve takes you up to 100, and the grinding is nice on its own, but you can also farm for Rare Candies. Also, the postgame area is very unique. Touhoumon Purple's difficulty is more spread out throughout the game, and this is without its difficulty patches. However, that Southern Island gauntlet match is fucking torture, and it's designed to be like that. That's a postgame event, and the prize is not worth the challenge, so that's just sadistic shit. Even though it's optional, that was the last thing I did in the game before giving up. If it wasn't, I'd have nicer things to say. Yeah, ugh, that was awful. You could farm for Rare Candies on this hack too, and being able to reset my team's EVs and bringing them all from level 5 to 100, with great postgame EV training, is nice. Again though, that Southern Island event, ugh.  

This hack doesn't have Rare Candies to farm, so it's a relative grindfest, but the grinding isn't that bad. I had to do a lot for the Puppet League challenges, but it's worth it. This is the hard patch though, I bet the base game is a much easier time. The difficulty patch was a way for this hack to be like Touhoumon Purple in terms of difficulty. I think Touhoumon Purple is more difficult, maybe even more difficult than Touhou Puppet Play Enhanced. However, this is difficult. They're all hard, dammit, that's my point. I never thought hacks that use little anime girls would be so difficult, but that's the consistent feature of these Touhoumon hacks. With that said, I'm more hesitant to play another so soon. These are great hacks, but man, I need a break between them. 

**Tl:dr. I played this with a Hard Mode patch. It bans the usage of items during battles and increases the overall level curve of the game, along with more difficult teams on major trainers. It is a grindy hack, but the wild level curve mostly follows the trainer level curve, so you can level up at a decent pace. There is new music in this, some fully original, others are just remixes of classic themes. All of the music is great in my opinion. It's regular FRLG in story, though with some added roadblocks. TMs are reusable, the Physical/Special split is implemented. Gym leaders and the Pokemon League are changed, and the rival is Green instead of Blue. It's a hard hack, at least because of the patch. It's tolerable though, for the most part. It was very frustrating at first because of the lack of a Vs. Seeker, but it becomes acceptable. I recommend it, especially if you like Fakemon hacks and playing with anime girls. Also, of course, if you like Touhoumon hacks, this is highly recommended.**",1569888317

After that I had a therapist that would have been good for someone else (maybe even me a little later in life).  Very much the classical let the patient do all the talking type, but since I still didn't realize how damaging my family had been, it was no practical good. 

And my most recent doctor decided that it was a good time to try a new medicine when I was feeling down after a really bad breakup.

Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification. And if they can't justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just.

"productivity","t5_2qh1k","Yeah, in my experience the tips above won't help much once you have carsickness, I'm afraid. They're preventive measures. Once you have carsickness, only medication or a travel stop can help.

You might also consider audiobooks where they're available. Have a jotting notebook at hand to make any quick notes you like.

If an audiobook is not available but ebooks are available, I load them on my phone and use text-to-speech to narrate the text. You'll need to find a compatible app with this feature. You can stop glance down at the screen too see what is being narrated if you need it repeated again.

I've used both methods above while driving, and they work pretty fine, with the occasional rewind (most apps let you rewind 15 seconds or go back to a previous line easily). They're slower than reading, of course, but far better than carsickness.",1569888318
"lucifer","t5_2sbp9","Lucifer is in a bit different situation than something like Sabrina tho. Sure, there is sort of an occult angle in both but with Lucifer you have direct biblical ties. You have God. You have Angels.

You just can't separate the inherent religious connections there. I will say its far more likely that Netflix would dare do a Christmas special than a Network like Fox would, but still thats probably a step too far for them.  You just cant ignore the ""Jesus of it all"" if you do a Christmas special for a show that is centered around the Devil.

ATA 30-41-01 Flight Deck Forward Window Primary Heating Systems

Interval   C   Installed  2   Required  1  Procedure --

One may be inoperative provided:
  - Associated window backup heater (MEL Item 30-41-02) operates normally
  - Both left and right side (No. 2) window heaters operate normally
  - Airplane is not operated in known or forecast icing conditions
  - Associated switch remains OFF
  - Flight remains within 120 minutes of landing at a suitable airport

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","I‚Äôm the same way. I look young, I have a quiet voice and I‚Äôm small. I couldn‚Äôt look tough if I tried. If I find a controlling guy it‚Äôs an immediate ‚Äúno‚Äù and a block from me. Otherwise it‚Äôs too easy to get steamrolled into a relationship. I‚Äôve found if you try to talk about future plans and see how much they‚Äôre willing to be flexible about your wants and needs is a good way to screen. Like if there‚Äôs no room in their life for a partner then that‚Äôs a good enough sign for me that they want to dominate everything and I‚Äôll get lost in the relationship.",1569888320
"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;And that's the only positive change they managed to make in like 20 years of pushing for changes to our healthcare system.

The only positive change? Should we talk about the historic increases to social safety nets that Obama was responsible for? The financial regulations? The consumer protections? How about the fair pay act? Or the largest increase to student aid in six decades? The hate crimes prevention act? Lobbying and ethics reform? Regulating the tobacco industry? All thanks to those evil incrementalists! 

Meanwhile, Bernie's biggest accomplishment in 30 years as an elected official was writing a book and making himself a multi-millionaire. 

&gt;Sorry. Slavery wasn't ended *incrementally.* Labor rights weren't won *incrementally.* Civil Rights weren't won *incrementally.* 

With the exception of slavery, which took the emancipation proclamation, a civil war, and a constitutional amendment to end, everything else you named above happened over time via multiple pieces of legislation. Stop being ridiculous.",1569888320
