Not such a surprise. Women that identify as lesbian have said similar things.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","I paid 35% on the earned income, the $100,000.  Then I invested that money--I used it to buy stock. That $100,000 is my [cost basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_basis) in the stock.  When I sell the stock, for $ *X*, I don't pay income taxes on all of *X*, *that would be double taxation*.  I pay income tax on *X* minus my cost basis (*X* - 100,000).  I pay income tax only on the net income.  (*X* - 100,000).  

I think you may be thinking of the concept of double taxation of distributed corporate earnings.  Corporations are taxed on their net income. Then, when the corporation distributes the income to its shareholders as, for example, dividends, that distribution becomes income for the individual shareholder. The individual shareholders then pays income tax on the dividends (the distributed earnings). This is double taxation.  But when you think about it, all money is double, triple, x-tupple taxed.  When you earn a $100 bill, it is taxed as income.  When you use that same $100 that you paid income tax on to pay the barber, he earns income and he pays tax on it, etc. 

Favoring capital over labor is a fundamental parameter in capitalist society. It's why we bail out banks but not debtors. It's why saving Wall Street is so important, but funding school lunches and paying teachers a respectable wage is not.  

Don't get me wrong. I am a capitalist myself. It may not be the greatest show on earth but its the only game in town. Let's just be honest. ","1285891276"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Nordic countries, for instance. There are quite a lot of Yield signs in use, and the larger road has a right of way automatically. (Also a metric asston of roundabouts.) The actual Stop sign is somewhat of a rare breed, of which you really take notice. It usually means that for some reason the intersection requires more attention, perhaps because of low visibility or something. You really need to come to a full stop in front of a stop sign before you proceed. It's a well-known point that often comes across during your practical driving test.

I must say, that the often maligned motoring culture here, while having it's downsides, pales in comparison with the picture of the US one I get from these comments. O_o Perhaps one thing making driving a bit less terrifying here is that one needs to be 18 years old to get a driving licence (except for mopeds and tractors and suchlike) and the driving test is fairly strict. 

*Edit: Also, the rules about the right of way are quite explicit and involve a number of things in addition to the aforementioned Stop sign, so you will often need to stop in an intersection even without them. (I think that's what Sir_Knumskull was getting at.) Personally, I have no idea what one is obligated to do in the US when one encounters a stop sign. A friend I was riding with when I visited the US tended to treat them as Yield signs, but then again I probably shouldn't use a guy who had no problem driving underage when he lived here as a model for appropriate behaviour in traffic.","1285891300"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","One last thing-- just to focus on what we have in common, rather than what we have apart.

As I said earlier, I think it's very rare for a team that ""deserves to win"" not to. I do think the Bears deserved to win that game. And I think a lot of people bitch and moan too much about one particular incident-- perhaps a bad call by the official, an interception at an inopportune moment, a player slipping-- and then say ""we deserved to win, and didn't just because of that mistake."" For example, when the Cubs lost in the playoffs because a fan knocked the ball out of a players hands, a lot of people blamed that person for the loss. But in reality, there were 7 games played, 9 innings each, and lots of things happened both ways that affected both teams. A lot of times, you could respond to ""but if that didn't happen we would have won"" with, ""yeah, well, but if this didn't happen we would have won by even more.""

This is the concept that I think you're fixated on. And I agree with it. And normally I would support you telling people ""don't bitch about that one thing that went wrong and act like it was the only thing all game that mattered, when you didn't play well enough to covercome it for the rest of the game.""

The problem is that you said ""by definition."" Had you not incorrectly used the phrase ""by definition"" (and then done it again later), we would be shaking hands and drinking internet beers. But my point is, while 99/100 times, no one bad bounce determines the outcome of a game, *sometimes enough bad bounces happen* such that a team cannot possibly overcome those random events and win. Even if it *never* happens in practice, I *still* disagree with you, because in theory it can happen, and therefore it is not excluded *by definition.*

I'm guessing we've both exhausted the will to argue. I'm going to leave you with this request: don't use the phrase ""by definition"" unless you're willing to provide a definition and allow others to see how the definition of something logically leads to your claim. If you have a request for me, I'll read it carefully and consider it.","1285891359"

Well, you can't have everything. There is nothing you can name as expensive as a woman. If you ask how much a car costs, you will get a definite answer. Same for a plane or a boat. But when you ask this about a woman, the answer is, ""You don't have enough.""

And it doesn't matter how much you have -- by definition it's not enough. As soon as the woman discovers how much money you have, two things happen:

1. It becomes hers.

2. It's not nearly enough to make her happy.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I think there is some sort of misunderstanding going on here.  So I'll sort of start over and see if this clears it up.

&gt;I'm not a capitalist, and the last thing I want to see is armies of poor women being forced to bear children for the rest of the world (which is what would happen if childbearing was monetised)

Okay so we both then agree that women should not be paid or given an incentive to have children especially during these times when overpopulation is an issue.

&gt;but if you ARE a capitalist, how do you go about deciding what is paid work and what should be unpaid work?

I wouldn't call myself a capitalist, but for the sake of the argument I'll assume I am.  Paid work is what people won't do for free.  If People won't clean toilets for free, it becomes a paying job.

&gt;Don't you think it is unfair that it is almost always ""women's work"" which is unpaid?

I don't agree with this premise at all.  I assume you mean 'women's work' by the stereotype, cooking, cleaning child rearing.  She does this by choice.  She could work and hire a babysitter, or she could not if she decides not to.  This is usually decided by the couple when they decide to have children.  Nobody is forced into anything.

If I choose to stay at home and do housework instead of working, I choose to work for free in exchange for not having to have a paying job.

&gt;And don't you think, considering childbearing and childrearing is so essential to society, that people doing that work deserve the same kind of pay and benefits as say cops and soldiers (the closest I can think of to a biological role for men)?

As stated above, and especially considering in this argument I'm a capitalist: No.  People have children for FREE, thus there is no reason to monetize it at all.  And given the economic times, we want less children, so really tax people who have children (or at very least remove all tax subsidies).

Having children is not an essential service.  The human race will not die out as we are not in any situation where people will just simply opt to have no children as a society.

I would ask why you'd bring up such an argument though unless you think the free market should somehow pay women to have children?  And if you do, this is why I'd consider that opinion insane.  It makes no sense from really any standpoint except that of greed.","1285891444"

entirely ""gurl pwr"" and is targeted at the female sci fi  buffs
That's fine...  but I found it very degrading as a male.

All the leads are female, every male is either corrupted, criminal, 
broken or plays second fiddle to a female character. 
This is a female character driven show.
They're the inside players, the movers and shakers that drive the story along.

Not to mention the writing in of religion into the story line.
BSG had more than enough due it's referencing mormon myths and sourcing from the 1970's show.  But Caprica goes too far ... to include it into their cannon myth vs downplaying  it (it's science fiction not theology fiction) .

*edit:*

To explain, the effort required of your legs in during a stable track stand is about equal that required of, you guessed it, standing. The deceleration can be a little bit tasking, as it requires that they actually counter the inertia of the bike with their legs to slow the rear wheel (notice the absence of brakes), but once you're stationary, it is more of a balancing act. The only wheel that can really be described as ""locked"" is actually the front. Notice how they prefer to keep it pointed to the right, up the slope of the embankment? Note also that their leading foot will also be the right one.

**You're halfway to track standing, folks.** Wheel cocked right, right foot forward.

The whole thing is rather more intuitive than it looks. While standing, one's reflex if they were falling to the right would be to put more weight on their right foot. The same applies here. The rider stands slightly more on his right pedal, countering his own tipping, but also pedalling the bike slightly forward, but more importantly - because his front wheel is turned right - back under his shifted body mass. Likewise, if he is falling left, his response will be to stand slightly more on his left foot, countering his own fall but also - because of the same turn of the wheel - swinging the bike back and to the left under his shifted centre of gravity. 

Or, you'll see them throw the wheel over, putting its support on the side of the bike that needs it. But it's not preferred for sustained balance, and they'll use it more as a recovery tool, then return to locking it and using their feet to do the balancing.

Tight jeans, dated Ray-Bans, and unseasonably warm scarves are also great aids. Why these two aren't dressed appropriately is beyond me.","1285891481"

"wikipedia","t5_2qh3b","&gt;There were no jolly little signs saying: You Don’t Have To Be Pitilessly Sadistic To Work Here But It Helps!!

&gt;But there were things to suggest to a thinking man that the Creator of mankind had a very oblique sense of fun indeed, and to breed in his heart a rage to storm the gates of heaven.

&gt;The mugs, for example. The inquisitors stopped work twice a day for coffee. Their mugs, which each man had brought from home, were grouped around the kettle on the hearth of the central furnace which incidentally heated the irons and knives.

&gt;They had legends on them like A Present From the Holy Grotto of Ossory, or To The World’s Greatest Daddy. Most of them were chipped, and no two of them were the same.

&gt;And there were the postcards on the wall. It was traditional that, when an inquisitor went on holiday, he’d send back a crudely colored woodcut of the local view with some suitably jolly and risqué message on the back. And there was the pinned-up tearful letter from Inquisitor First Class Ishmale “Pop” Quoom, thanking all the lads for collecting no fewer than seventy-eight obols for his retirement pension and the lovely bunch of flowers for Mrs. Quoom, indicating that he’d always remember his days in No. 3 pit, and was looking forward to coming in and helping out any time they were short-handed.

&gt;And it all meant this: that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.

&gt;Vorbis loved knowing that. A man who knew that, knew everything he needed to know about people.

    Mount options for tmpfs
           size=nbytes
                  Override  default  maximum  size of the filesystem.  The size is
                  given in bytes, and rounded up to entire pages.  The default  is
                  half  of  the memory. The size parameter also accepts a suffix %
                  to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical
                  RAM:  the default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified,
                  is size=50%

That means there's a hard limit on the amount of virtual memory a tmpfs mount will take up.  (When I first read your comment, I thought you were saying tmpfs had a limit on how much RAM it took up before it started swapping, rather than a limit on how big it can be total before it starts returning `ENOSPC`.)","1285891517"

Just a couple of months ago wasn't there a flap of how FB made it very challenging to make your account fully private? I remember loading up a script that found certain settings were still open despite my thinking that everything was private. I also wouldn't put it past a company such as this to have underhanded tactics to mine information that they shouldn't have access to.

The other problem is the friends who post everything online with labels. So despite trying to control my end, I can't control there's or sometimes even know that it exists.

Also, there are/were accounts that I had opened on FB, Myspace and other Social Networks 5-10 years ago when this wasn't an issue. I've since forgotten about there existence or the login info, and there's nothing I can do about it.

So unless there's a way for me to scrub things off the details off the net that I basically don't have access to, I think that it is an invasion of privacy to a degree. Plus I don't think that personal details that they're looking for are relevant to work. There is a work me, where I try to behave in a socially acceptable manner, and am focused on work. And then there is a private me, where I don't want to have to worry about work, or what the corporate overlords may think.","1285891517"

"reddit.com","t5_6","The problem is that the sound was originally mixed to sound good in a large space (i.e. a movie theater) on a multi-channel sound system with plenty of power behind it.  And, yeah, this can sound great on a large home-audio system in an environment where you don't care how loud the movie gets.  

If somebody else is asleep and you don't want to disturb them or if you live in an apartment / condo and don't want to disturb your neighbors, you're out of luck.  If you have small/underpowered  home audio system or you just want to listen using the TV's built-in speakers, you're also often out of luck.  

Yes, even on a cheap surround receiver, you can usually work around this issue (a bit) by raising the center channel volume and lowering the other channels.  But this can be a chore because settings that sound right for one movie frequently sound terrible on the next one.  

The auto-volume feature on most TV's doesn't usually provide enough compression to help, either.  It really should be a continuously variable control so you can pick how much compression you need rather than a simple on/off setting.

I think the ideal solution would be a secondary (probably stereo-only) audio track where the original movie audio was remixed with a much more limited dynamic range.

**tl;dr:** Blu-rays and DVD's should have a secondary audio track with limited dynamic range for use when watching at night or with the TV's built-in speakers.","1285891520"

Stalin killed priests, leveled churches, and persecuted, killed, or sent to the gulag thousands of believers. Mao didn't have much of a church to destroy, but to establish himself as supreme he abolished any other belief

None of which establishes that either of them committed those atrocities in the name of atheism.  All it establishes is that they consolidated their power, which included getting rid of any potential competition from religion.

&gt; 2) this is not the not true scottsman fallacy. this is one of several passages in the Bible about false Christians

I'm 6'0"", 280 lbs. I've been overweight since around middle school, about 11 years ago.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Marriage is a lot of things, but one of them is a live legal concept.  It is the concept of a romantic partnership. Much like a business partnership, you combine two entities into one. In a romantic partnership, you combine to economic individuals into one, so that they may make joint economic decisions as a unit. It is a useful concept because it frees the partnership to make decisions in the interest of the partnership instead of as individuals.  For example, the partnership may choose to invest all its money into one 401(k), or put all its resources into the more promising of the two careers while the other partner maintains the home life.  The state sets standard terms of the romantic partnership, but they may be freely altered via prenuptial agreement.

It's funny because that's the second time an MRA has told me they want a contract about what happens when the partnership splits. That's what marriage is, like a business partnership most of the terms are about what happens when the partnership dissolves.  

Edit: As far as women taking the house, this is a wide spread myth.  Whoever takes the house will have to pay the other partner half of its value in other assets.  Usually if the couple cannot agree who takes the house, it is sold and the proceeds are split.","1285891552"

If the neighbor is the bossman in a circa 1920 Virginia coal mine and his laborer steals some food to eat, then this guy's claim is much like you describe.  Technically the laborer is free to leave, but unofficially he is bonded.


Who decides?  Well I guess we have to answer how is crime handled in a voluntary society?  Who enforces?  These are the ones who will ultimately decide.  The enforcers.  They will answer these gray areas.  They will resolve the issues.","1285891586"

With that being the case there does not seem to be much evidence that they are brandishing or firing their weapons for small altercations.

Your argument comes off as ageism.  Your comments show your inability to trust young people due to the stereotypes that you hold about them.  Are some college students immature?  Yes.  However some 40 year old's are just as immature. It is easy to generalize and we all do it.  We have to realize that our views are not always correct and look to challenge them or back them up with evidence.

It is uncomfortable to be around people you don't trust but there doesn't seem to be any evidence to support that view point besides thinking up worst case scenarios.  In many of the cases you brought up there are laws against those actions and anyone, not just college students would face their CC license being revoked or even jail time.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","I am associating capitalism with the state because the two are codependent partners and are inseperable.  What I am describing is the rise of capitalism and that process repeats itself to this day all over the world.  Likewise, capitalism colonizes our very lives and interactions as well, commodifying them and profiting off them, so I'm not even limiting myself to a description of its land-property relations, capitalism's cravings go quite beyond merely privatizing the land (when convenient).  In essence, I'm answering your question about why I associate capitalism with theft and violence.  The first reason is its history.  The second reason is everything that followed.

I think what you're running into is one of the big problems with so-called anarcho-capitalism: it, at the end, hates the initiatives of its victims while glorifying and excusing the attacks of the capitalist class.  It treats wealth as earned rather than stolen.  It treats capitals predations as natural, or even non-existent.  It mistakes coerced relations under capitalism for ""freely associated"" ones.  That's why it is not anarchist and never has been.  Anarchism is anti-capitalist.","1285891660"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","As somebody who was keenly watching the Tea Party in 2007, before it deviated from its roots, **I am not a racist.**  I am not a Christian.  I want no borders, I don't even want police.  The reason the name ""Tea Party"" was chosen was because the first ""Tea Party"" represented a rejection of British imperialism, while the current one is a rejection of U.S. 
'imperialism,' both inside and outside its borders.

vagabondvet is full of shit.  The people that are into fear and statism were lured into the Tea Party after FOX et al got involved - before that, they were the people supporting Bush.  The members of the original Tea Party **objected to Bush's actions,** while Ron Paul represented, to them, a reduction in the size of government.  That is the distinction.  Anybody who's showing up at these rallies holding an ""I &lt;3 Sarah Palin"" sign does not represent the whole movement.

I'm sure big corporations putting Facebook connect in places where it's not really necessary is motivated by things like scrapping your public graph for data. But there are times (increasingly more frequent) where you want to push an lightweight app out the door really quickly, and have it immediately accessible to a large audience. Facebook Connect makes that really easy. People who flat out don't have a fb account for most web app user bases are in the extreme minority, so it's really hard to justify making tons of people sign up for another web service, with a new authentication system, where most people will use the same password they use for everything else, rather than just forgetting about the few people that refuse to sign up for facebook. If I were making newvideogamrapp.com, of all my potential users probably &lt;5% don't use facebook, 50% would want their NVGA stats to get pushed to their feed, 30% wouldn't care, and 15% would have a facebook account but choose not to sign up.

As someone who likes to draw, I'll offer a critique on your work. You seem to have miles of talent as far as putting the lines where they're supposed to be. That's only 1/8th of the work though. The real hard part is reading the light and shading the area, and that's where the real talent it. Honestly i'm not sure how you have the ability to do such an amazing line recreation of his face while having gained absolutely no knowledge of light and shade. It seems like the amount of time involved in learning the anatomy and proportion and just gaining the talent to reproduce a picture nearly flawlessly would require you to learn *something* about light and shadow ... but I guess not. That's where i'd focus my energy if I were you. 

Part of this is because I've seen quite a few traces before. You can tell when someone traces something because the lines are right on, but everything else is very amateur ... very undeveloped. That's why i'm so surprised how good this is. Anyways, I'm sure you don't want people to think you're tracing things for praise on the internet, which would be very sad indeed, and I believe you because you're a redditor and typically they have a higher standard for themselves.

Don't take my critique so hard, it really is an amazing piece of work. ","1285891765"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; The Jupiter system is a good enough example as any if you want to look at gravitational relationships that yield this behavior.

And you don't think it's the low mass of the Galilean satellites that made them unable to hold onto an atmosphere? It's only because they are tidally locked to Jupiter?

Titan is tidally locked as well. Why does it have an atmosphere?

Same goes for the Moon, and Mercury. They're too small and too warm. Mars is colder and more massive than either of them, has a 24 hour day, and it is still too small and warm to hold onto an atmosphere for long.

&gt; Here and here. Or here.

Thank you, I will read those.

&gt; a small terrestrial planet could probably keep its atmosphere if it became tidal locked. But if it was tidally-locked from the beginning, it would likely not have an atmosphere.

Is there reason to believe Gl 581 g was tidally locked from the beginning?","1285891816"

To begin with, [look who else is using the Standard System](http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/metric-map-which-countries-dont-belong-with-the-others/); third world countries that aren't industrialized so they have no need to conform to international standards, and only two of them at that. 

As if the WHOLE WORLD using a different system than us wasn't enough incentive to switch (it is), Metric is also clearly better than the Standard System for a number of reasons. Mostly because the prefix system it uses makes it easy to remember and convert between units. Oh, you need 43768 cm in km? That's easy I'll just divide by 100 to get meters and then 1000 again to get .43768km. Easy. I fifth grader could do it. I'm a college level science student and I still don't know ALL the ins and outs of the Standard System because it's so obtuse and complicated and all needs to be learned by memorization.

At least we don't get too much freezing rain around here. Sometimes we do in the winter...and thats just miserable.

Tip: Take your vacations to sunny places in the winter.
Tip: Get good winter boots that don't slip easy...or if you're more daring get normal ones and slide for fun. It's quick winter fun.

Tip: If you haven't had winter experiences...I strongly suggest falling on ice on purpose....obviously not a running start but a controlled slip and fall. This way you will learn how to fall in the least painful manner...how to walk on ice calmly....and how not to split your head open. You kinda learn that when you are young here....for people without that experience it can be painful. So just get it over with.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The first article is about practices like: 

  * sleep deprivation
  * solitary confinement
  * stress positions

These are horrific, but these are also practiced in mainland US jails. Just look through the posts here: http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights - it's depressing reading. Are they torture? Perhaps, but not in the sense typically thought of when the word is used. My point being: the complaints are about practices on a par with the (worst of the) status quo in general US prisoner treatment. Perhaps the above are torture, and perhaps they fall foul of the Geneva conventions. I certainly don't condone them. They are not, however, the targeted and institutionalized torture practices authorized by the Bush regime.

The second article is a precis of the Scahill interview I commented on above. The only incident he cites as occurring under the Obama administration, unless I'm reading the interview wrongly, is the one of feeding tubes being forced on hunger strikers. (Every other specific he gives, it seems, is from the Bush era.) It's certainly possible that the IRF are continuing to grossly abuse prisoners, and, again, I don't condone that; but they sound like the typical prison goon squad, guilty of some flagrant abuses (at least) under Bush. 

The paragraph about rendition questions the Obama's administration's assurance that rendition is no longer leading to interrogations where prisoners are tortured: ""why transport terrorism suspects to other countries at all?"" Simple; for the same reason Clinton did it: so that the prisoners could be held, and questioned, outside of our legal system. It, again, is a horrific practice, but it's not clear evidence of torture. 

I have not seen a single citation of a prisoner who has been systematically tortured under the Obama adminstration. Under Bush, leaks about the abuses were frequent and plentiful. Of course absence does not prove the negative.

To be clear: I'm not trying to be an Obama apologist. I'm just saying that we need very clear and specific evidence before the accusation that ""torture continues under Obama[/H. Clinton]"" is valid.","1285891893"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I was watching their blog for months now. I loved BBB and Sintel is just an amazing proof of what Blender is capable of.

Technically, as a demo of Blender it's a 10/10.

As a movie itself, I'd say they aimed for a very challenging goal and were not able to hit it. BBB was great because it was just an animation - simple, short, funny.

Sintel is aiming for a complex, emotional plot, and it seems that they had to strip it in a few places which gave us some wtfs.

Don't get me wrong. I love the movie, I admire what they did, but Fantasy genre is a subtle matter. You aim for realism mixed with fantasy and there's a very thin line between ""believable"" and ""unrealistic"".

I noticed several plot holes:

 - Why she is attacked by that stranger? In the early plans there were three guardians which she had to fight. Probably in order to get to the Dragon's Land. Not sure.
 - How did she know where to go? The whole piece between the Scale disappearing and her starting her journey seems to be missing.
 - How did she survive? Who was she? In order to survive on such a long journey, she had to be a very fit person. But in fact we don't know her at all. It's making it hard to connect with the character and makes the whole journey very... scenic. I focus on the background, not her story.
 - How long was the journey if the dragon has grown so much? There seem to be a time distortion somewhere around...

The good news here, no, the actually awesome news, is that it seems like a perfect community project material. Take the sources and continue! Maybe in a year we'll get Sintel 2 - twice as long :)","1285891893"

A solly with 3 rockets is only 3/4 of capability that a regular solly is. Even with +20% sentry resistance, you're not going to take out a sentry if an engi is behind it. Also, with that entire pack just for the defense, you don't get the shotgun, so you've got 3 rockets total. It almost always takes 2 to kill a person(s).

It's almost like you're saying drunk driving is faster to get home compared to walking, but somehow don't take into account that drunk driving can kill people. You've basically ignored the disadvantages. 

Also, for league play, almost all update items are banned anyways.

Edit: These items haven't even been out for a day. Give it some time to start complaining/casting judgements. This happened like 2 years ago when the drop system started.

Hood river area: post canyon, washington side has Syncline which you can ride almost all winter.  Post canyon has a lot of free ride elements to it; ladder drops, big doubles, skinny's, etc.  

East Side of Hood: Barlow district is best, there is about 70-80 miles of sweet single track there.  Surveyors ridge, dog river, oak ridge, gumjowac, gunsight, high prairie, 8 mile, 15 mile, knebal.  Get the Adventure Maps map of the area, it really is the best one out there for this area.  I should be out there tomorrow doing 50 or so miles...things should be in great shape this time of year.

Sandy: Sandy Ridge has a sweet, but short piece of single track.  This is a really fun trail. [PDF](http://www.blm.gov/or/resources/recreation/files/brochures/sd_ca_sandytrailbrochure.pdf) of the trails there.

SW Washington: Falls Creek Falls, Ape Canyon, Smith Creek, Lewis River, three corner rock, siouxon creek and a bunch I am forgetting/not mentioning.  These are great trails, Gifford Pinchot is very pretty.  Here is a [link](http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/recreation/mountainbikes/index.shtml)

Tillamook: Gales Creek, Brown's camp, wilson river (Start at elk creek) can be ridden almost all year around

Black rock is south of us near corvalis.  Very free ride oriented, but you can have fun on a x-country bike as well.

There are also some trails off of Rocky Pt road on the way to Scappoose.  These trails generally aren't that great, but if you only have a couple of hours and want to ride, they are there.  Sis

If you are willing to go a ways away outside of eugene you have the Oakridge area which has hundreds of miles of awesome single track.  You need to go here if you haven't.

After all, if you saw some 300 pound guy you wouldn't say ""oh he needs to find someone who thinks he's attractive"" because shit, that narrows the field. If he CAN lost the weight and get in better shape, he should, if you want my opinion.

Is it shallow? Yes. But people are shallow. You are shallow, in a way. Yet the great thing is, you find her emotionally attractive. People can change physically, and you should realize that. Especially depending on your ages, which is a huge factor.

I can honestly say that I have never heard an argument favouring Christianity which has really made me think. 

That said, that doesn't mean that I haven't heard a fair share of arguments which apply to the existence of god or theism in general. Though, it is worth noting that these haven't been particularly thought-provoking either. 

Now, the arguments that have been somewhat difficult to deal with haven't been thought-provoking, but instead been harder to falsify. I am specifically talking about when they have used arguments which presupposes detailed scientific knowledge in order to falsify, whereas it would take some matter of research in order to debunk the claim.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","As an American this is an affront to the very notion of Democracy, justice, religious tolerance and Western values.  

Their revered religious leaders write books on how and when it's permissible to kill a Goy. Something of which they have repeated experience doing. From the USS Liberty to the flotillas. Americans are expendable, our lives are worthless to the chosen folks. They kill our people, humiliate our Presidents and other leaders, yet the fiction of some unbreakable bond continues on.

Israel is a cancer inflicted upon the world. America constantly disregards its own best national and strategic interests to defend this racist, terrorist state. At the potential price of our own destruction.

The right-wing Israelis laugh and the subservience and inexplicable fealty certain sections in America line up to give them.

They are as dangerous to America and the very idea of Democracy as bin Laden or the Taliban. 

The national past time (other than manufacturing non-existent existential threats) is laughing at how incredibly stupid the Goyim in America (and every where else) are.

With alleged friends like this do we really need any enemies?

We both spend equal money.  It's not just me asking my bf to pony up the dough for fancy trips.  

So, you could be correct, especially the way the OP described it, or it could be what you were talking about in the rest of the post, that she is considering him as a more long-term prospect now than she was before.  ","1285892040"

I said (well, Einstein did, not me) that space and time are not absolute, the way they were in Newton's model. In relativity, the speed of light is absolute; space and time are relative.

That doesn't mean space and time do not exist. That doesn't mean ""I'm not even using"" space and time. It just means they are somehow ""freely floating around"" and the hinge that keeps them together is the universal constant called speed of light.

EDIT: It means, if one of them changes, the other must suffer changes too, so that the speed of light stays always the same.

For example, if the light burnt out, it would indicate that the safety gates were closed, which wasn't the case. This led operators to believe erroneously that the gate was closed, so they continued to look for the problem elsewhere.  It wasn't until a new shift came in that they isolated the problem, but by that time lots of damage had been done.

Today, plants are engineered with this situation in mind, and indicators are made to be unambiguous.  There is also a safety checklist, so in the event of a problem, the crew has specific steps to follow to isolate the problem.

It was a mix of poor design and poor staffing, but its not something I would have expected engineers to foresee back in the late 1960s when it was built.","1285892046"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; This is not a flaw. Should we drop dark matter as an explanation because we don't know what it is or where it came from? If you discover arrowheads in the backyard should you drop Indians as an explanation if you don't know where the Indians came from or where they went? If you discover machinery on Mars should you drop aliens as an explanation even though you have no idea what/who/where those aliens are or where they came from? Of course not.

Yeah, the thing about dark matter?  [We're devising means to test that theory](http://www.kqed.org/quest/blog/2009/12/28/dark-matter-tests-positive-sort-of…/).  If it doesn't pan out then the theory itself will eventually be abandoned.  Every test every conceived of for gods have either failed or been impossible to attempt.  Why haven't the theory of gods been similarly abandoned?

We know a great deal about Indians, including their modern descendants.  We can verify what we know, which makes this example not in your favor.

If we discover machinery on Mars, aliens will be an excellent theory, but it would need a lot of investigation before we could say anything for sure.  After thousands of years of investigation into gods, we still don't have the first scrap of evidence to suggest they even exist.

It is not rational to persist in a belief when all the evidence suggests otherwise.  All that's left for God to do is to poke the quantum state of void that preceded our Universe, which is a *huge* departure from the meddling gods of our forefathers.

&gt; Contingency vs necessity. Here's a cogently argued essay on why the universe must have a necessary cause. No particular God (or indeed, intelligence at all) is argued for.

The difference between his translucent ball and God is that the translucent ball can be independently verified.  ""I don't know"" is a perfectly valid answer to these questions that has the benefit of being accurate.  Now, if you were to encounter this ball and declare ""God must have put it there!"" despite the lack of any evidence to that fact, I'd call you a looney.

I'm sure you find the essay quite convincing regarding the argument for first cause, but it doesn't explain why the Universe needs one and God doesn't, especially when God's existence has never been demonstrated.","1285892050"

You can pretty much treat it as an English speaking country, apart from the sign-age and older people.

Best 2 travel things to see around that time are Octoberfest in late September, we just rented a car and drove over for a weekend, parked beside the park it is in and slept in the car. The other one is Karnival in Cologne. 11 November - one of the best parties I have been to, the whole city comes out and drinks all round town for the day. Its about a 2-3 hr train ride from Amsterdam. Cant recommend this enough.

Agreed on the bike, buy one on your first day there, you will regret every day you go without, when I lived there I would only leave my flat about one time a week and not be biking. Also get 2 locks for your bike - there is no getting round this, there will be a Junkie (addict who supplies their lifestyle by stealing bikes) who can open ANY type of lock, so you are only safe(ish) with 2, I know a number of people had their bike stolen within the first hour of buying it as they thought they would be ok. Also an older looking bike will be less of a target.

At any rate, short of cap gains tax benefits, capital owners pay more taxes: they pay income (at higher rates), capital gains, property (again at higher rates by virtue of estimated house size), and estate taxes (again, higher rates for more capital).

My girlfriend and I live 10G's under the poverty line, and your estimated figure is 60 mil and you don't consider yourself rich? People with less money than you have made much more daring claims about their wealth. Honestly, it's all well and good that you attempt to endeavor the serious nature of poverty, but the realistic consequence of your gift was likely met with a excursion to the local crack dealer, the local liquor store, the local adult shop, and the nearest Motel 8. I'm not saying that hand outs are wrong, or subsequently that I am contradicting myself, but let's face the facts: the homeless or impoverished are not the only people who meet serious financial struggle with limited resources. More to the point, I'm glad to see you're investing in education, I'm a student myself, but unlike everyone else, I don't have parents who support me to fulfillment. I barely receive any support actually. My point is thus: the people who need your help are not simply the ones most aligned with the impoverished imagery presented to you. The most alarming and inalienable sense of poverty doesn't merely come from homelessness - it comes in the medium where people of substance and character meet true financial hardship with a resolute ability to support themselves and fulfill their obligations synonymously; both to themselves, to their family, and to the community.","1285892135"

It's gone on to be covered by ReligionDispatches.org, Belief.net, HuffPo, and all thanks to John.  And that pissed the TBMs off.  And they tried to exact revenge.  By doing things that were unethical.  And they happened to be admins at MM.  John had little choice but to revoke privileges at MM until he could sort out where loyalties stood.

Andrew is being very dramatic here.  It wouldn't be the first time.  And he's not a disinterested observer.  He's already made it clear he's part of the new blog.  That's fine.  I wish him well with it.  But keep in mind that the folks he's teaming up with are bloggernacle types.  That's fine, too.  But they're definitely not disinterested in John's 'attack' on an LDS general authority.

**John never censored anybody's posts at MM**, other than his own.  What Andrew and the other MM folks got upset about is that John wouldn't let them tell him how to handle his own post.  Give me a break.  What a bunch of WATBs.","1285892144"

It depends a lot on what you're coming up here to do, and where you're going to live.

If you're in an apartment near the subway, or living in student housing near campus, the biggest problem with your day will be making sure you don't slip on the ice, and that you wear enough layers to stay comfortable during any long walks you've gotta take.

If you're moving into a house in the suburbs and driving to work every day, you're gonna have to deal with shovelling snow, warming up your car before you leave the house, and of course learning to drive on snow. It's different. If you've never driven on snow/ice before, take things carefully until you get used to it.

I wish you'd talk about the referee situation again. I wish you'd address it explicitly. I think that might open your mind to the fact that you are arbitrarily exempting this one factor from the treatment that you give every other factor. The reason you are doing this is because in your head, you are simply unable to imagine something going wrong that involves a football, a cleat, a green and white field, a helmet, or whatever, that is beyond a player's control. You may say it in words, but then you immediatley forget it. Yet when you think of the referee, you suddenly are able to appreciate my argument-- which is the fact that things beyond someone's control can shape the game in a way that has nothing to do with how well or how poorly they played, how well or how poorly they prepared, or how good or how bad they are. So if you want to respond to one thing, please explain that to me-- why is a referee the one unique factor in the universe that can go wrong that can cause at team that didn't deserve the win to actually get it?","1285892221"

Not having to spend on housing, may give them the freedom to pursue occupations that would make paying for housing difficult (eg: mimes... sorry but there can only be one Marcel Marceau) if that is where their hart lies. I also have that freedom, but the corollary of that will have to be a huge shift in lifestyle (particularly when it comes to housing). Having a place to live rent free gives you the freedom to be what you want; and self-actualization is my greatest hope for my children,  grandchildren and so-on.

As for ""defending their turf"" - I don't understand you. If they do own several properties, my assumption has to be that they offer those for rent, so that people that choose a different path than mine can too have good housing. I am also certain that anyone that has a nice place for a decent rent does not have ill will for their landlord.

I was walking around the city, taking pictures of abandoned buildings, when a police cruiser pulled up, and the officer got out and began to question me. There was no one around. He asked to search my bag - I had nothing but a camera, coffee, and some SD cards. I explained that I often do location scouts for work, and I showed him my card. I figured that was the end of it.

Then he called for backup. Backup! I was amazed. A few moments later another cruiser - this was the bad cop. He got out of his car, said nothing - just stood there with his hands on his belt (taser and gun). The first cop continued to question me.

Then he took my picture with his cell phone. Twice. For the second photo (a close up for his records) he put the phone right in my face. I think they wanted me to swat it away, and I would have if they were not cops.

Then they told me, ""You're done taking pictures. You take one more picture and we're going to get the FBI involved and we're going to ruin your day""

This is no claim some totally other unimagined type of life might not exist, there's just a better chance to convincingly show something relatively familiar is on another planet. For eg, for life similar to one on earth, you could be almost completely convinced of there being such life on another planet based merely on a spectrogram of its atmosphere.

Most humans in the world oppose gay marriage. Most cultures oppose gay marriage, just as they oppose incest. There are quite a few situations in which we deny people the right to marry - age, relatedness, and sex.

He gets a bad rep, but he did a lot of good: For example, he abolished the war laws which outlawed anti-american speech and pardoned the people who were imprisoned for it. He abolished ""war socialism"", which was the a system of corporate cronyism in which politicians awarded contracts for war materiel for their friends. When the post-war recession set in, he did nothing - which prevented it from growing into a depression. 

While he was involved in some corruption affairs, this were nowhere near the magnitude of, say, WWI. All in all he was a pretty likeable guy IMO.","1285892431"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","We had a teacher in the 4th grade that gave candy to those who could multiply and divide the fastest. I ended up figuring out most of these rules on my own that year... 

related: In the 7th grade, we learned divisor rules, i.e. ""does x divide y?"" And we were told that there was no divisor rule for 7. I took a couple hours that night and proved to my teacher the next day the following:

&gt;take all but the last two digits of any number, multiply them by two and add them to the last two digits... if this number is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. Repeat if necessary.
&gt;
&gt;for example: 200,067
&gt;2000 X 2= 4000
&gt;4000=67=4067
&gt;40X2=80
&gt;80+67=147
&gt;1X2=2

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If by 'censoring child porn' you mean investigating, tracking down, and locking up the people who actually commit child abuse, yes, I wholeheartedly agree.  The theory for going after viewers is usually either that they are 'creating the market' (which is an issue of desire, and answerable to no law) or that those people are more likely to become abusers.  I'd be interested to see any study of the subject, though I don't imagine one could ever be done, to see if people who view child pornography are then more likely to molest children than if they never saw child pornography, but I have a hard time imagining any potential mechanism whereby that might work.  And I have a pretty active imagination.  The real basis of most all of the laws is a simple ""thats really creepy"" and a lack of understanding that ""thats really creepy"" is not sufficient justification for any law.  Laws are meant exclusively to prevent harm.  And no matter how much people pine on about it, just no one is hurt by some creep getting his rocks off.  There was a news story the other day bout a guy in a pedobear costume at Comic Con (the news agencies reported he was a convicted sex offender, which turned out to be fiction) with people hand-wringing over the fact that some pedophiles might be able to get their sexual jollies off of thinking of simply giving a piece of candy to a child.  How they can get from that thought to the idea of putting people in jail when they have harmed no one is beyond me.

And yes, I realize that the viewpoint of virtually everyone today is ""Fuck principles, just lock up everyone you can, if they were actually innocent the police wouldn't even be involved"".  I simply can't bring myself to abandon intellectualism enough for that.  My main point is that police resources are limited, and they take away from investigating actual sex crimes to bust these imaginary thoughtcrimes of people who they think might have accessed illegal images, or talked to someone online about sex who they thought was a teenager.

There is no other crime which it is illegal to distribute photographs or videos of.  If someone gets murdered, and a video surfaces of it, they go after the murderer.  Same with every single other crime.  And it's for good reason - the aim is to prevent harm, not to prevent people from thinking about certain things.","1285892494"

* The graphing needs work. I can't tell whether the data I'm looking at is the average or the instantaneous value. I'd like to see max/min etc.. and be able to see aggregate values (e.g. max/min/avg Apache requests per second for each day of the month)
* IMO $10/m per server is very steep considering that their service is pretty basic compared to a lot of other more mature solutions.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Upvoted for Canada. I live in Toronto -- the coldest it gets here is maybe -30C, but I generally stop running at -15C too. Anything colder and my lungs just start burning, although sometimes I'll head out anyway. I used to be one of those run-every-day kind of runners, but... meh. I have a weightlifting gym and a pool at my disposal.

Toques are made of awesome, although my head starts to feel kind of sweaty. Those earband things work too. I mostly just wore my over-the-ear headphones, to be honest, but the earband/headband things work pretty well for keeping earbuds in place, as a bonus.  Running tights under some sort of baggier pant look dorky but keep you warm. I don't know what you dudes run in, but frankly, it gets a little cold in yoga pants when it dips below -15 to -20. For the upper body, my go-to clothes for running in the winter are  a long-sleeved wicking layer, a hoodie, and, optionally (only if it's REALLY bad out there), some sort of light shell jacket to break the wind. Gloves (or mittens, if your circulation sucks as much as mine does) are a must, obviously. 

Another thing that OP should definitely look into are [YakTrax](http://www.yaktrax.ca/). They slip on over your running shoes and make it possible to run on icy roads, while not feeling weird on open concrete. Another, cheaper option that was put forth in Runner's World some issues ago (can't find the link) was to get an older pair of running shoes and make them into ""screw shoes"" by putting small screws into the bottom of the sole in a pattern to create more traction, but I'm not sure how well they perform on concrete. I got a lot of use out of my YakTrax -- around four years or so of running almost every day through the winter -- until the rubber on one broke during a run and it came off without me noticing. :(

Of course, once cable comes in I'm switching to that right away.

But today, more and more mental conditions are turning out to be physical and/or genetic conditions with mental symptoms, a fact that your local clinical psychologist would rather you not find out.

The big picture is that neuroscience is [splitting off from psychology](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits) in the same way, and for the same reason, that astronomy split off from astrology many years ago -- only one of them is a science.

This division between science and superstition wasn't the end for astrology, because some airheads don't care that astrology is total bullshit. In the same way, psychology will survive well past its sell-by date and will continue to appeal to idiots who think talk therapy actually cures something.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I went to a private Christian school in the midwest from K-12. Like you, I was a very good debater (we had very comprehensive mock trials and debates and such in history class).  In 10th grade science class, we were assigned a debate on Creationism vs. Evolution. The class was divided into groups, with half the students arguing for each side. I chose the evolution side, which was considered by my fellow classmates as ""the hard side"" since they were all indoctrinated and thought Creationism was ""correct.""

I spent the week preparing harder than I had ever prepared for a class, which was a feat considering I was ""the smart guy"" and tended to overachieve as it was. I didn't care about the grade or what the other students or teacher thought, I was searching for answers for myself. I ended up with a ridiculous amount of information and knowledge and I could finally stare at a page and see in black and white that I had, indeed, been lied to.

On debate day, I got up and was so nervous I could barely speak. I somehow got myself together and delivered what, in my 10th grade mind at least, was a complete destruction of Creationism, religion, and my opponents. As I sat down, the teacher quickly rose from his seat, even though the other team still had to do their closing, and proceeded to try and argue against my points himself! It was clearly a desperate move, and I think everyone knew it. I always found it ironic that my religious education was responsible for cementing my atheism more firmly than the ""faith"" of my youth had ever been.

tl;dr I took evolution's side in a debate and won.","1285892598"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First, let me start off with the Cosmological Principle (which I'll come back to later):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle

Basically, it sez that we don't occupy a privileged spot in the universe, we're just in some random spot, same as anywhere else, without any better view of things than anywhere else.  For example, we're not in the center of the Universe.

And also I should mention I'm not an atheist, I believe in God but not in any one religion (and not in a God that looks anything like most people are taught as kids), so I'm in agreement most of with the things you read here on r/atheism.

There are a whole bunch of different religions in the world, many of them having a holy book said to be the word of, or inspired by, God.  They can't all be true; in fact, at most one of them can be.  This means that there are many books in the world which were written by people at some point, and have over time come to be considered divine in origin.  Clearly there's some piece of human psychology that leads people to believe that human-created things are divine in origin.  As a human myself, I (and my co-religionists) suffer this same cognitive fuckup.

People who are true believers in the Bible will tell you that the Qur'an, believed to be the truth by a billion people, was a product of its time, developed by people, subject to analysis by the same methods you'd analyze any other book with, and they'll tell you it looks like a piece of literature from that time period in form and content.  It incorporates mythology, lingustic patterns, literary devices, etc, from that setting.  It has contradictions and repetitions, and weird anachronistic shit, and it's setup indicates that it's probably culled from a bunch of different sources from that time and put together.  Well, applying this analysis to the Bible yields the same conclusions, but the same people saying the Qur'an is clearly a human creation, will still insist that the Bible isn't.

As an aside, I'd ask myself, what evidence is there that any holy book is true?  Very little; there's not much archaeological evidence for any of them, except for very general stuff, and never any of the supernatural stuff.  And for every general detail there's some evidence for (existence of King David), there's way more stuff that there's no evidence for (exodus of slaves from Egypt).  For Christians, for example, other than the gospels there's no written account of Jesus for hundreds of years after, and most of what there is was embellished or just made up by monks copying old texts (eg the testimonium flavianum).  And there is evidence against the truth of holy books, mainly in contradictions which must be harmonized with some circuitous logic, and more broadly in the questionable morality in these old books.

People try to excuse this by saying that whatever book was written for it's time.  I always ask, if God was gonna intervene in the world, why would he do it once, and leave a book for people to read once, only in one part of the world, and have it only really apply to that time period?  If you imagine God's strategy for telling people of his existence and precepts, this is a pretty shitty way of doing things.  But as a model for a human-created phenomenon, it's perfect.

Going back to the cosmological principle, apply it not to astronomy but to your own life.  Don't assume that you're in a special place to know about God that others aren't.  If so many others believe in a false religion, then that means you are capable of doing so.  It's presumptuous to believe that everyone else's holy books are false, but yours couldn't possibly be.  All you have to go on, is all the people who believe in its truth, but we know that that's not really evidence for a holy book being true.  Throw that out, and what's left?

TLDR if so many people believe in a false religion, and you suffer the same cognitive biases as them, how can you be so freakin sure that your religion is correct?  Do you really have any evidence that they don't have?","1285892608"

I'm simply wondering why everyone seems to want to give a free pass to vaccine manufacturers so far as the safety of their product is concerned.

I'm following an alternative, delayed vaccination schedule with my daughter. She'll have been vaccinated long before she would be going to school (though she's home schooled) and well before she's getting exposed to carriers of most of the diseases in question.

As an adult it will be her choice to get her booster shots or not.

You do get all of yours, right? Every single one? Because otherwise you're not doing your part and are contributing to the spread and perpetuation of diseases like Whooping Cough and everything else. The overwhelming majority of infections are in adults - who are at almost no risk of serious complication or death, but go on to pass the infection to an infant.

"video","t5_2qh1x","I think the views he expressed in ""Capitalism: A love story"" were at times shallow and uneducated, and always very naive. He ends it by saying capitalism is doomed to fail and that it needs to be replaced, vaguely enough, with 'democracy'. If that means participatory economics than I think this counts under all 3 deficits: shallow, naive and uneducated all at once. 

His views on war, the Iraq war in particular, are simplistic and jaded. His association with Code Pink, moveon.org and Cindy Sheehan type pacifistic, Nam nostalgic anti-war campaigns annoys me.  I think the war was disastrous but how he attributes everything to a mishmash of oil profiteering, disaster capitalism, and retarded conspiracies with respect to the bin Laden family's connection with the Bushes is totally pedestrian and uninformed.  

I was anti-Bush administration throughout his terms in office but I never considered it evil. As fun as the Cheney-Sithlord comparisons are it is hyperbole, particularly when compared to the catastrophic and immoral presidents of the past half century, including but not limited to Clinton, Reagan and Nixon. Moore was fanatically and disproportionately anti-Bush.

I also have problems with Sicko, Bowling, Roger and Me, and the 2 books of his which I've read. But to keep this from being TL;DR my main gripe with Moore is his basic non-intellectual, blue-collar democrat and unsophisticated approach to politics. He 'goes with the gut', and isn't at all analytical, so it can produce a surprising amount of dissonance. For instance, despite all the sodomite love this clip contained Moore is supposedly a devout catholic; he even claims to be influenced by Christian Socialism. Why he isn't anti-sodomy, anti-abortion and so on probably has to do with his a la carte, emotivist political attitude crossing over to his theological attitude.

edit: I think of Moore as a sort of less academic but equally shit for brains Naomi Klein.","1285892637"

It really is almost a compliment that you'd think that I work for Comedy Central. I've been trying to think as if I were one of them from the beginning, when [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7g54/john_stewart_please_hold_an_event_at_the_lincoln/) post was made. I thought that it just didn't make sense for Jon Stewart to hold a rally. It wouldn't match... official canon, I guess. But, Stephen Colbert's character? He's a total egomaniac. He thrives on meaningless hyperbole. He already is a mirror of right wing punditry. It just made perfect sense.

I walked away from my computer for awhile, not really thinking much about it. Then at some point I started thinking about the Presidential Correspondents dinner when Colbert made fun of GWB right to his face and how great that had to feel. Then I started thinking that if Colbert held a rally in character, wouldn't it just make sense for his audience to also show up in character? Then we could all partake in something just like it. And it just snowballed in my brain until I had to make my own post on here.

I mean, the rallies that Comedy Central is promoting now don't even really resemble that original thought, do they? The steam built up here but it's clearly become something else now and I've got nothing to do with all that.","1285892641"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Yes, and people can draw the wrong conclusion from excellent evidence. Happens every day. But belief and evidence remain different ways for evaluating reality.

I really am trying to understand your post.  But what you are implying is that rational people don't have beliefs.  They have evidence.  However, what happens when they can't carry that evidence around with them?  Belief.

&gt; No, a tentative conclusion based on evidence is rationality. Beliefs are always contrary to science, because theories must remain falsifiable, therefore all conclusions are tentative.

Okay, we haven't defined ""belief"", either.  I am using this definition: ""An idea that is accepted as true"".  This means that a belief can be accepted as true because of evidence.  This does not contradict science, which brings me to the next counterpoint.

&gt; Belief has no place in science or reason.

A scientific belief has place in science.  A reasonable belief has place in reason.  An irrational belief has no place in science or reason.

&gt; You're trying to make a place for belief in the life of an educated person in the Age of Reason. But you cannot do this -- to believe is to draw a permanent conclusion and stop being skeptical and open to new evidence -- this is by definition.

No, I am not.  There is no place to be made for it, for it already exists.  I cannot do it, because it already exists, as I have shown above.

&gt; Your entire world revolves around your earlier question, ""then what are my beliefs based on?"" What you don't seem to realize is this is the wrong question to be asking, and the wrong premise. You should be asking yourself why you believe anything. But that is a distinctly unreligious perception, not the the faint of heart.

I believe things, because it follows from methodological naturalism.  However, that in itself can't be justified, as far as I have thought, except for the fact that I and other people are more satisfied when it is used, and that I and possibly others are dissatisfied with it.  From here, all of my beliefs follow.  All of my conjectures, which are beliefs, follow.  This means that I don't believe anything supernatural, since it is unobservable by any natural means.

I think we have a contradiction of definitions.  It seems you are using ""belief"" synonymously with ""faith"", while I'm using it as ""an idea accepted as true"", which can mean anything from a scientific theory to a hypothesis, or to a religious tenet or religious conjecture, to the simple anecdote from someone else.  It can arise from ignorance or in the pursuit of knowledge.

I feel as though the entire problem with the discussion is that we never tried to define or agree upon a definition to certain terms we used, thus basically strawmanning each other silly when we assumed the definitions are equal.","1285892649"

What's relevant is that relationships are built upon trust, and there is not much you can do to more violate a persons trust than this.

It is psychologically easier, and often healthier, to simply break it off with the assumption that it may happen again.

It could be that she feels a lot of pressure to have come from sex and that she is letting you down, and that probably makes it hard for her to want to have sex.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I haven't argued to force banks to lend to minorities and everyone knows that that was a short-sighted initiative by Clinton.  However, Clinton created a surplus and chose to use that surplus to provide housing to minorities.  If we didn't enter 2 wars, who knows, maybe we'd still have that surplus and it wouldn't have turned out to be such a crappy policy.

The argument for breaking up banks centers around this question: How much in terms of Assets Under Management is it safe for banks to own before they pose a systemic risk so large that any benefits that their size would bring are outweighed by the risks.  Many leading economists have suggested that no bank in the U.S. should have AUMs over 4% of U.S. GDP, and as of right now, those 6 banks all have AUMs that exceed this amount.

By the way, the innovations that you claim banks have created (Oh wow, scanning checks is AMAZING!) have actually done more to increase their bottom lines at the consumer's expense.  Credit default swaps, mortgage backed securities, adjustable rate mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, home equity lines of credit - these are all innovations that almost brought the U.S. to the ground.  

Banks weren't invented yesterday.  They've been around for thousands of years and the owners of current banks do not deserve any of the glory that would have been merited by the initial founders of banking.  Steve Jobs deserves the profits that he makes off of the iPod/iPad, while banking C.E.O.'s do not even come close to being as deserving of their paychecks.","1285892688"

Religion is not alone in that light of being a special case, similar reasoning can be can be assigned entities like corporations, as well as problematic ideologies.

If it's the people to blame, then their motives could be in the name of any ism, - but would people themselves be accountable. There's real risk of extending the goal posts here

Atheism gets treated in so many ways, and is often intermixed with areligious and antireligious attitudes. Atheism has no creed just as theism doesn't have to, the extended sense of religion (say belief in a materialistic universe) comes about, and is formalised when rules are put in place, implied or otherwise.

Here is a valid definition of a rally: a large gathering of people intended to arouse enthusiasm. This isn't a comedy festival, its a **rally**. Sure, it will be funny, but he is trying to make a statement here. I am just expressing what many of us here on Reddit hoped to achieve with the rally.

Colbert seems to be right on with his satirical approach. But as I said, it's overshadowed by this Stewart rally which is increasingly lacking focus and now turning its back on reality.

What you've got to understand is that thousands upon thousands of people work on military projects and that if you've got a degree in aerospace engineering, your likelihood of working on something *not* designed to kill people at some point in your career is slim to none.  There are nearly [900,000](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/) holders of top-secret security clearances in the United States... and there are four levels below that.

What you *also* have to understand is that creative people are often crazy, and that those with hit songs but not hit careers have to get a dayjob at some point.  A friend of mine mixed at [The Record Plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_Plant_Studios) for a number of years.  One of his little indie bands came in once saying ""we'd love to find a session saxophonist who can play just like X on their track Y"" (names redacted) to which my buddy says ""well, the Z was saxophonist on that track and he's working at Guitar Center on Sunset.  I'll bet we can get him pretty cheap.""  Somebody once asked [Vicki Lawrence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6-4N0IPVh8) if she was disappointed to be a ""one hit wonder.""  She said ""most people are no-hit-wonders.  I think it's great.""  My personal favorite one-hit-wonder success story is [Strawberry Alarm Clock's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYLz63csS0) keyboardist and founder, [Mark Weitz,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weitz) runs a truly awesome [tropical fish store](http://www.markstropicalfish.com/) that provides most of the aquariums you've ever seen in most every [tv show or movie.](http://www.markstropicalfish.com/index-5.html) 

The last thing you have to remember is that creative, intelligent people tend to run across other intelligent, creative people on a regular basis.  A friend of mine worked at Total Media for a brief time before they went under.  He also worked for [Geordie Hormel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordie_Hormel), turned down a job with [Jerry Yang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Yang_%28entrepreneur%29) and managed the Back Street Boys and Britney Spears early in their careers.

This is where Bilderberg rumors get started - successful, interesting people tend to hang out with successful, interesting people.  If Philip Taylor Kramer hadn't committed suicide, you probably wouldn't have thought anything of it... after all, how much attention does the fact that the [""blinded me with science"" guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V83JR2IoI8k&amp;ob=av3e) also [founded one of the biggest companies](http://www.headspace.com/seminar2002.htm) in music compression and file management and is the music director for TED?

The basic flaw in your argument here being to belief that all beliefs are equal. They are not. Sure, we wouldn't be able to function in this world if we insisted on accepting only that which can be proven with certainty (note: which can, of course, not be accomplished outside the realms of math). We would, however, also not be able to function in this world if we were to accept anything that cannot be disproved with certainty.
It is perfectly acceptable to sit down at a table in the belief that the chair would hold your weight without putting it to rigorous tests first. Trying to cure your cancer by prayer instead of medication, because you think, your god might be in the mood, if you just asked nicely and faithful enough, is not.

Shovelling your driveway and sidewalk is the most annoying part I find.  Snow is a lot heavier than it looks.  Be careful of ice when walking, we are pro’s here, but you can get hurt.  Also be VERY careful driving in ice and snow.  If you are not used to it, it is very dangerous.  Think like having no brakes or steering whatsoever suddenly.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; but ""incentive"" is ridiculously off-the-mark

Incentive being a figure of speech ""the conditions for life to emerge being present, forming the incentive for life to emerge, it will emerge"". Work with me here, davesidious. Nobody's paying anyone to make life happen somewhere.

&gt; but on the universal scale, that's practically indistinguishable from no planets.

I made that point earlier.

&gt; Just because billions is a big number, doesn't mean we'll find a single planet with life on it in our galaxy.

I'm not saying you're not right. It just *might* be that the conditions for the successful emergence of life are so precarious that it only ever happens once, at best, in every galaxy [or, in some galaxies the conditions are so favorable in general that it happens a couple of times, where it doesn't happen at all in other galaxies].

However life, as we know it, comes from the combination of basic elements, that are among the most common in the universe, that find the right ""petri dish"" to spark into existence [can we not do ""spark doesn't mean anything""?]. I would be -totally- on board with the sparsity of life, if it took rare elements in very specific conditions and hopelessly long odds that it *just might* have a sliver of a chance to maybe ignite into life. Then I'd say: yeah, it really doesn't look like we're going to see too many of those occurrences.

What is the reality: our kind of life needs Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen, blended together in the right mix to make amino acids [which have been found in space], add a splash of water, use the atmosphere as a spark plug, *boom*, before you know it you've got primordial soup cooking for a few billion years.

The elements are not rare at all, the environment in which life *can* emerge will prove to be abundantly available. The chances of life beginning somewhere are going to be common. To me, the fact that we are here, unlikely though it seems, is just a feature of the universe. Life is going to prove to be spectacularly abundant and incredibly diverse because the conditions for it are neither rare nor exceptional. There are so many tosses of the coin that it'll flip to 'life' very regularly.

I'm going to have pissed you off with my frivolous assumptions by now. Please be assured that I'm not doing it to annoy you. Sometimes I find myself being intentionally irritating, but that's not what I'm trying to do in this case. I'm just very optimistic [without being blind for the reality of the thing] about the potential for life in the universe. There's going to be a lot of it because there can be.

It isn't just the bullying it is the cultural approval of the message the bullies attack with.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Thirty years ago I liked *Economics in One Lesson* enough to buy and give away several copies. But, as I've matured and my understanding of the subject has broadened, and as we've seen what 30 years of globalization and corporatization has actually done to the economy and the middle class, I've come to see Hazlitt's cookie cutter black and white opinions to be those of a child. To be fair to him, he did write that back in 1940's,  without benefit of seeing just what some of his simplistic ideas would lead to, so I'll cut him a little bit of slack in that regard. But, with what we know now, his pronouncements can really only be seen as a form of cartoon caricature of the insidious and extremely naive belief that free markets can even exist. By historical examples, unicorns are more plentiful than free markets.

One has only to look at his chapter on tariffs, which he intended to be the centerpiece of the book to see that he evidently never contemplated what the appropriate response is to a major trading partner that uses tariffs, and subdues it's own citizen's purchase power in a form of economic weapon to claw it's way from 3rd world status to a hoped for 1st world status in the space of a couple generations. Hazlitt quotes Adam Smith and shares misguided assumption that cheaper goods, as measured only in terms of price are the only measure of value to an economy. 

I think this book succeeds in raising a lot of interesting questions, but taking it's pronouncements as policy has had ruinous ramifications that future generations will wind up paying for dearly.","1285892832"

It seems ridiculous to say that a 36 year old with a long sexual history isn't qualified to determine his sexuality, but it also seems ridiculous to state that a 6 year old can accurately determine his sexuality. In an ideal world this would be a subject that requires no interference from external actors, but unfortunately we don't live in an ideal world. A statement of homosexuality from a 6 year old could have very real and severe consequences later in life. In an ideal world, people would be assumed pansexual unless they later explicitly stated that they were not physically capable of loving someone of the same sex. But as for an age at which I would definitely say they are qualified to make a decision regarding their *potential* ability to experience same-sex sexual attraction, whatever age they can achieve orgasm purely from same-sex thoughts and masturbation.

It's a bit like me coming up to you and asking if people can fall up waterfalls?  You might think, ""Well I guess I can't say it's not out of the realm of possibility entirely, although I can't see how.  Certainly I don't avoid waterfalls for this reason.""

The answer to the question is irrelevant.  What is at issue is how we go about discussing and identifying the things that we actually wish to consider knowledge.  

How do I distinguish any information as knowledge or not knowledge?  Do I want to set up different classes of knowledge?  Let's say I have an electric thermometer.  To the limit of the precision of the device and significant figures, I still know that I can take a hundred samples and get a hundred random results.  However, I can take these samples and ratiocinate, I can establish mathematical relationships between all these observations.  Odds are we can identify outliers and graph a pattern of the results.  

Observations are touched with randomness, possibly even paradox.  However, the ratiocinated relationships are a different class of knowledge divorced from experience.  The functions themselves are timeless, crystalline, and unambiguous, even when they are applied to inappropriate scenarios.  Whether we are looking at Coulombic density of energy in droplets of oil, or measuring the lensing effect of gravity wells, the large reams of contingent data we are churning out is passing through a very small pool of hard knowledge found in those formulae.  

When a religious mindset looks at reality, or gaps in our understanding of it and decides to &lt;insert supernatural here&gt; he or she adds nothing to our knowledge.  Compare this with both the simplest and the most complex cosmologies alike where acknowledgment of their veracity was critical to your continued ability to think about the problem or being alive period.

We might not have been able to understand experiments conducted by the likes of Coulomb or Millikan without Aristotle's categorical philosophy of things having noumenal properties or identities independent of themselves.  For example the greenness of grass as an independent part of the plant, or the weightiness of a stone as a thing in itself.  However, Aristotle assumed too much without adequate information.  He assumed that there would be a magnum bonum, and that all his categorae must point to this.  If we look at the data we have, it is reasonable and it is humble to assume that we have insufficient information to decide whether or not the universe is maximally coherent or if it is paradoxical, or neither.

One philosophic reason a person might decide that supernatural cosmologies are acceptable is that although human access to knowledge or gnosis is remote if not ultimately impossible, access to spirituality or faith is more accessible.  Such a philosopher may conclude that spiritual intuitions are actually more important that knowledge. 

I stand accused of being non-theist without complaint, and as agnostic as a matter of being conspicuous.  It is our greatest annoyance when declare this or that to be true in ambitious fashion.  They are contributing only a crackle of static even when they are not beheading those with poor reception.","1285892946"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","You know, I feel bad for the reception you're getting, as you're probably not very much in control of what goes on.  But, it's completely understandable considering the travesty Microsoft unleashed on the web with IE6 and the continual loss of productivity the world continues to suffer due to Internet Explorer.  I could probably legitimately blame the entire recession just on IE6.

It's like you shot a person and went over to the BBQ after the funeral and started chatting with everyone.  You are actively loathed by the millions of web developers supporting your previous incarnations of a ""browser"" and by the millions of people who have had to repair computers compromised by the poor security model.

You're not going to gain much ground with technical people (the people who are actively converting everyone else away from your product in droves) until you implement some new policies:

1. Anytime anyone mentions IE6, apologize.  No excuses, just apologize.  You know there's nothing you can do to save face, so just eat the humble pie and move on.
2. Implement standards.  Religiously.
3. Anything new you add should be in the form of a proposed standard.  Propose cross-platform standards, because you will most likely never get the majority market share again.  If you do, it will be by playing nice.
4. Differentiate by excelling, not by being quirky.  Browsers aren't meant to read pages differently.  Just do a better job for once than the competitors and people might switch back.  There's still plenty of room for improvement in UI and the backend.
5. If you can't directly answer a question, say so.  We're trained to spot BS because we work with it every day.  Yours is not appreciated.
6. Realize that you have to be either purely corporate or purely authentic.  The last will get you far more favor, at the risk of saying something indiscreet.  But your indiscretions will earn you far more ground than ""spinning"" people's questions into a sales brochure for your product.
7. The technical populace is heavily marketed at on a daily basis.  We see it everywhere and we recognize it.  We permit it as long as it doesn't demean us, but the reason ""viral"" marketing gains ground is because people desire a more open dialogue as opposed to listening to your prepared speeches. There's a strong desire to connect, but with people, not puppets.
7a. I can guarantee your marketing team isn't nearly competent enough to pull off a conversational facade over here.  We eat marketers for lunch, but we buy products from people who participate instead of mandate.
8. Never ask for feedback and then ignore it. It's your funeral.

I hope this helps.  I'd actually love to work with Microsoft more, because you make some great things.  But your PR department is sorely in need of a reality check.","1285892951"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You haven't shot shit to shit, dude. I'm not arguing ethics. I'm arguing the bottom line. In this model, piracy means people lose money.

And yes, indie authors can make money when they go solo. I know several people who have self-published and made some side money. You would be greatly exaggerating to say that up and comers generally make more money than they did in the old system. One or two might find a measure of success in a large metropolis like NY, or if they are savvy with online media marketing. But the fact of the matter is that indie authors do not have the means or resources available to large publishing houses. They couldn't live on this. As an *artiste*, you can feel the smug, self-aggrandizing arrogance of having kept true to your art; of having gotten your word out without relying on The Man....but as a person trying to make a living doing what they love, it's really not feasible. You'd still have to keep your day job. Or two. The literary behemoths like Vonnegut or King or even JK Rowling couldn't exist in this model. They were all quite prolific. They were prolific because they had the financial means to be. 

Really, what are the odds that a first-time author, who is busy with a regular 9-5, a family, and  hundreds of little day to day worries, writes a book of such stunning quality (without editors) and is able to market it out to a large audience (without marketers, publicists, or connects) enough to be reasonably successful (I'm going to say ~24K/yr, as that's the min. wage). 


Though your half-hearted olive branch to publishers is cute...why in the hell would a publishing company give an author an advance without an assurance that the book would do well. It's a publishing house, not a bank. 



Granted, it would be interesting to have an underground black market of beatnik revolutionary types writing and sharing their work for free...but the kind of people who have the time and fervor to do so aren't exactly the type to write engaging beach reads. ","1285892999"

The ""god model"" of existence is similar in that in takes an unnecessary assumption of the universe, and then crams all further reasoning around it so that it matches the observed behavior and predictions.  This leads to drawn out apologetics to reconcile the theist model with the predictions of the much more simplified and straight forward scientific model.

Licensed fiction is always a crapshoot, but Christopher Golden's books are among the better ones (*The Lost Slayer* series is pretty good, but perhaps a little continuity-heavy).

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","That is a very real concern and it applies to all drugs, especially grey area ""legal"" ones like GBL and research chemicals.  Because they are sold ""not for human consumption"" there is no guarantee what you're getting is actually 99.9% GBL.  You can't really complain that your wheel cleaner is making you sick because that would imply that you are ingesting it which is illegal.

That reminds me that companies have actually sold 1,4 butanediol as GBL before.  1,4 butanediol feels much more toxic and harmful than GBL.

I never converted GBL for a couple reasons.  I'm pretty lazy and GBL works pretty much just as well as GHB.  But another reason I didn't is because GBL is so much easier to dose than a powder.  You just use a pipette rather than having to buy a scale and weighing out your dose each time.  Liquid GBL is also much easier to conceal.

When an extraordinary claim is made - some kind of evidence, preferably of similar level of extraordinariness to the claim - is required.

If some dude walks up and says ""I just saw a unicorn!"" should you just believe him?

Or do you say ""show me!""

If he says ""oh, it's invisible, you have to have faith and *then* you'll feel its presence and see it in your mind"". it's perfectly reasonable - indeed incumbent on us - to say ""ye-he-ah, *right*"" and point to an article on cognitive bias.","1285893073"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Alright then, my problem is rooted in the fact that you labeled your article as a defense of ""religion"" as a whole, and the content therein makes equally broad strokes.

You defend the more vanilla concept of ""destiny"" on the basis that it's ""fairly harmless""; I beg to differ.  While I can't imagine a person would commit some sort of atrocity in the name of ""destiny,"" the concept of ""destiny"" is one that is rootless.  If someone wishes to rely on destiny as a watered-down version of dogmatic faith then so be it, but the conclusions and impulses one takes from that belief aren't any more valid than those from, say, Christianity and its dogma, which you seem to write off.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems as if you're drawing an arbitrary line as to which faiths are ""harmful,"" and as to what ""harmful"" even means in this context.  From my point of view, these belief systems are equally irrational and equally superfluous to our problems.

When I said ""everything inherently religious"" was indeed referring to the notion of all dogmas, historical accounts, testimonies, et al. that believers are commanded to take on faith, things that have and will continue to be either exploded by scientific means or acknowledged as purely allegorical (if even educational or moral to begin with).  It is this stuff that puts the faith in faith, yet you seem eager to discard it, recognizing its invalidity.  While I can agree with you there, I would hold the vast majority of people who consider themselves religious would do no such thing.  This is the core of where I am at ends with your argument: you are defending a skeleton of religion that no one religious would dare adhere to.  This too is what I meant when I said yours was a ""non-point"": it's a defense of a position that doesn't exist, and duly so.

In regards to your last paragraph, I won't argue that it's more appropriate to find community or tradition, whatever those may be to you, inside or outside of religion, but culture and morality are veritably retarded by religion.  Undying adherence to a moral code doesn't breed clear moral reflection, and the introduction of taboos and authority by fiat doesn't breed free exchange and creation of culture.

And finally, I think it's a bit disingenuous to imply that only ""Western traditions"" place a strong emphasis on belief.  I don't really have much to add to that, but yeah.  Shoot me a response.","1285893073"

As some of the other posters suggested, it seems unlikely that you got over 275 without eating more than 2000 calories a day.  Until you started counting recently, were you extremely aware of how many calories you were taking in?  Until you're paying attention, things that look ""healthy"" can have lots of hidden calories.

To give you an example, here is a sample from my food log:

(the numbers are Fat (g) Carbs (g) Protein (g) and Calories)

Pre-workout					

* Muscle Milk	5	9	20	160
					
Smoothie					

* 3/4 cup yogurt	2	12	8	105
* 3/4 cup skim milk	0	9	6	60
* 4 oz pineapple	0.2	14.2	0.6	54
* 4 oz mango	0.3	19	0.6	72
* 1 scoop protein powder	2	2	27	130
					
Lunch					

* 1 chicken burrito supreme	12	51	21	390
* 2 chicken cantina tacos	4.5	53	23	340
					
					
Snack					

* Zone Perfect	7	24	14	210
					
					
Dinner					

* 1 cup red beans	0	46	16	120
* 1 cup jasmine rice	0	48	4	213
* 9 oz chicken breast	9	0	80	425
					
Snack					

* Muscle Milk	5	9	20	160
					
Totals		47	296.2	240.2	2439

To sum up, I drank 741 calories in my protein smoothie and muscle milks, ate 730 calories at lunch, 758 at dinner and had another 210 as a snack.  That was filling, but no way an excess of food.  I'm 6'0"" and 175 lbs as of this writing.","1285893082"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","It is a bit of a gamble, but I would consider just adding water and no additional sugar.  Either that or just add some higher attentuative yeast as suggested by the others, but no additional sugar, since there is obviously an overabundance of it anyway.

The yeast are probably maxed out in their attenuation, being inhibited from further fermentation by the high levels of alcohol in the solution.  If you add water, they might come out of hibernation and ferment a bit more while in the bottle, thus carbonating your beer, but there's no guarantee.  

Since it is already overly sweet, I'd be wary of adding more priming sugar and would look to another set of techniques to finishing it off.  Maybe some ultra-high attenuating yeast is the way to go.  

As another side note, you may have to let this one bottle condition for at least 6 months in light of this ultra high gravity and ultra high alcohol content.  From what I hear, and from what I've personally experienced, imperial stouts sometimes won't carbonate until 6-12 months in the bottle, and its under similar circumstances as are before you.

Good luck, and maybe try a few different approaches with a few bottle sets, i.e., yeast+water+sugar in bottles 1-12, yeast+water in bottles 13-24, just water in bottles 25-36, etc.","1285893115"

"business","t5_2qgzg","By ""eliminating the middleman"", we could eliminate the ""profit"" aspect of healthcare funding.  While, technically speaking, the government would be a middle man, it wouldn't be one prone to skimming off the top (i.e., diverting healthcare money for non-healthcare use (over 20%)) or refusing to pay for healthcare services in order to pad its bottom line.

As a financial professional, I NEVER assume greed is the only price driver, but I am aware of the effect greed has on private sector motivations.  It comes from decades of working with executives and executive compensation.

While I don't view the public sector as a panacea, it has proven itself capable of defending the country so there's NO reason to believe it's incapable of handling healthcare funding.  I don't recall hearing many service complaints from Medicare, Social Security or Government pension beneficiaries.  Furthermore, I haven't heard too many doctors complaining about Medicare servicing (aside from reimbursement amounts), but the list of complaints against private health insurance companies is unending (and includes significant service reimbursement deficiencies).

As for achieving optimal economies of scale, it doesn't get much bigger in the U.S.  That's why pharmaceutical companies and U.S. healthcare providers cut sweetheart deals with the Obama administration leading up to healthcare reform legislation.  They feared the government's negotiating power.  If you believe the private sector can beat the U.S. government on achieving the optimal healthcare ""economy of scale"", then you're ignoring the true economic scale involved in the public/private sectors.

I'm well aware of the overcharges by the private sector, it's why I oppose it's stranglehold on healthcare in the U.S.  The prices you quoted above were charged by government contractors in the PRIVATE sector.  You've blamed the costs on government agencies, but you forgot to mention the cause of the over billing (i.e., private sector billing abuses).  At the risk of sounding partisan (unintentional), just look at what KBR (a private company &amp; Haliburton subsidiary) charged the U.S. for it's NO-BID contracts.  Contracts which Dick Cheney, Haliburton's former CEO, personally approved.

If the private sector was the healthcare/economic panacea you appear to believe it is, healthcare costs would NOT have grown as large as they have over the past 3 decades.  So, cut it any way you want, but the healthcare industry will never be able to erase that record or its ongoing predatory behavior and abuses.  You see, business is based on trust.  Once that trust is destroyed, it's only a matter of time before the business disintegrates.  

Since the American people have no alternatives in the private sector, they will increasingly pressure their government to reform healthcare to correct the problems created by the private sector.  While the private sector prevailed in recent healthcare legislation, the fight over healthcare is far from over.  You can count on one thing, the issue will be revisited since the healthcare industry refuses to change.

It's not a matter of if we'll have public funding for healthcare, it's a matter of when.  The fundamental economic trends in healthcare are deteriorating by the day.","1285893130"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I'm about to finish grad school, will graduate in December, and I can tell you what I plan to do. Basically, it's a very simple concept: live as you have been living. 

I really hate debt, especially student loans. (One of the few types of debt you can't discharge through bankruptcy.) If you take the standard ten-year term, you might end up paying 40% extra in interest. Even more if you stretch it out longer. In the current market environment, it is impossible to find any guaranteed investment that will return an interest rate greater than 6.8%, so it is in your best interest to pay off student loans as fast as possible.

I've been pretty frugal through college, have worked when I can, and will graduate with $17,800 in loans. I could easily stretch them out over ten years and end up paying a buttload of interest. Instead, I plan to pay them off in 6-8 months. Fuck the banks. They're not getting interest from me.

How will I do this? Simple. I'm not going to increase my living expenses. I'm going to keep living the student lifestyle - roommates, cheap food, etc. I'm not getting a mortgage. I'm not getting a new car. I'm leaving it all the same.

Now, I do have the benefit of a decent starting salary ($68k standard, more if I work beyond 45/hr per week.) In a city with a decent cost of living like Houston, I can do a frugal lifestyle of $12k per year, or $1000 per month. 

And that's just what I intend to do. I'm going to kill the loans and get on with my life. While I may have a higher-than average starting salary, this tactic will work with anyone. You might have to take 2-3 years instead of 6 months, but the principles are the same. Don't increase your standard of living. Keep living like a student. You can tough it out for a few years and not have this great debt burden hanging over your head.","1285893137"

The best thing is to scour weekly grocery ads (most of them are available online these days) for good deals on non-perishables and perishable things you can freeze.

I cook, I'd say, about 95% of my meals from scratch these days and it's actually been a real money saver.  Those tuna helper boxes and other semi-homemade convenience food items may seem cheap, but they really don't go very far and they're not very good for you (not to mention usually made of really cheap ingredients that you're overpaying for).  The real frugal trick is plan ahead and try to buy ingredients you can use in a lot of different ways so you don't end up throwing stuff away (like half an onion, for example). 

That said, of all things to scrimp and save on, food is one of the least that I worry about.  What you eat plays a large role in your future health, which means if you buy brown rice, fresh veggies, and good meat today, you'll probably end up saving a lot of money on prescriptions and doctors' appointments tomorrow.

So in conclusion, after a lot of assumptions, you should get more money in Germany if you are expecting to be in the lower 50-60% of income distribution, otherwise you´re better of in the US, counting only the income. This does not surprise me at all. 

But I should add that it might even be more profitable in Germany up to the 70-80% in the end, because of the money saved through free education, health/dental care and social services. Also the stats about Germany exclude taxing and retirement funds, which are pretty high in Germany (25-40% of income). 

Those are some very nice points to be made. Maybe we should write an article as well about all this research...

They don't need sports, either. Is it child cruelty to involve your daughter in something [adults have sexualized?](http://www.tunc.biz/vuvuzela_soccer_chest.jpg)      
I, HazDomain, think it is okay to dress little girls in pretty outfits and let them wear makeup and go to pageants because little girls enjoy these things and will often use crayola markers and dress-up clothes to act out ""beauty pageants"" in their own homes with no adult provocation whatsoever. I don't believe it is cruel or abusive to ""force"" children to do something they voluntarily do for fun.         
I don't think that the inability to put makeup on correctly qualifies as abuse *or* child cruelty, and no matter how poorly adults do it, it still beats the train wrecks that girls can and will create on their own faces. Makeup does not look flawlessly perfect every single time you put it on, believe it or not.         
I don't think it's wrong to brush, wash, comb, or style the hair of a child. The cruelest part of hairstyling for children is the combing, because getting knots out pulls and hurts. If you aren't against combing, the most painful kind of hairstyling, than being against painless, pretty hairstyles is hypocritical.          
I maintain that the basic components of a child's body are approximately the same as that of an adult (two eyes, ears, a nose, a torso, four limbs, etc)and that there are a limited number of ways to adorn these basically uniform components. No matter what style of clothing you can imagine, [some woman somewhere](http://daveandthomas.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/hwang_mi_hee_sexy_schoolgirl_12.jpg) has sexualized it, [revealing or no,](http://www.nerve.com/files/scanner/2010/04/shelving_in_silhouette.jpg) and therefore attempting to prevent little girls from ever dressing in any way that any woman has ever made sexy is a pointless and impossible endeavor.         
As I said in my original post, despite the fact that the girls in OP's post are wearing makeup, and some claim this is sexual, I've seen few things that are *less* sexy, and that's because it's not makeup that's sexy, and it's not clothes. There is not one form of makeup, not one style of lingerie, not one outfit ever imagined by any being at any point in recorded or yet-to-be-recorded time that would make me want to fuck a 700 lb woman. Because 700 lb women are not sexy, and there is no ornamentation on Earth that will ever make them sexy. The only reason that you would ever want to have sex with a 700 lb woman is that you were *already attracted to fatties.* Likewise, there is no form of makeup, no style of dress, no elaborate hairstyle that will ever make someone want to have sex with a 6 year old, unless of course, they were already attracted to 6 year olds. And if they were already attracted to 6 year olds, then they're a pedophile, and the makeup and clothing didn't have a damn thing to do with it. Thus my original statement ""it's too late.""        
I didn't say any girl not wearing makeup is a garbage smeared mutant. I was responding to the apparent opinion that ""kids look fine as they are"" and therefore don't need to bathe, wash/brush their hair, change their clothes, brush their teeth, or any other thing that adults do to improve their ""sexual"" attractiveness. If you don't take active steps to keep a kid clean and attractive, they quickly become (if not a garbage-smeared mutant) at the very least a sticky, smelly mess. ","1285893193"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Hey man, lets talk about this first before you try anything. The shitty thing about growing old is that your friends grow old with you. Do you remember that movie Dazed and Confused when Wooderson says ""That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age..."" Unfortunately of course nobody stays the same age. The people you know and trust will evolve in some ways and possibly devolve in others. 




The same is happening to you. It seems you are somewhat disillusioned and perturbed by how people are seemingly eroding in front of your eyes. You have parted with your girlfriend, your BFF is gone, and it seems nobody is around when you reach out for someone. This is, undoubtedly, quite a shitty situation. 




However, there is a solution and it's not suicide. I encourage you to go out and try meeting new people. Forget about the past. Rejection happens to everybody. I know I've been rejected a lot myself and, even though I consider myself somewhat masculine, have cried alone about it as well. It's normal to be depressed about this. People often damage other people unintentionally. I doubt many people have a personal vendetta against you so strongly that it is their life's goal to ruin you.




Just start out with introducing yourself to new people in other situations and work from there. If they reject you, well fuck them. It's their loss, not your's. You are a force on your own of confidence. Take a look at /r/seduction for more tips on this or also check out this useful book: http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671723650




I know you've been hurt in the past and those scars will stay with you forever but there's no need to end yourself over a few scratches. Also, if you need someone to talk to, we're ALWAYS here. I may not know you in real life but I can assure you I'm a human just like you who genuinely cares. Please man, stay with us and keep fighting the good fight. ","1285893199"

I dunno, if what guys like Joseph Fresno is doing is 'disrespectful' and 'undignified,' he seems pretty happy despite it. Maybe it really doesn't benefit anybody as much as you claim. If observing that makes me 'childish,' I think I quite like being a child.

In any case, Mr. Futrelle still hasn't refuted the claim that even women from non-Western cultures who aren't impoverished (ranging from wealthy immigrants from counties like Bangladesh or the Phillipines to women from well-developed places like Japan or Singapore) are much preferable to many men. What's the 'economic' explanation for those girls?""

Nevermind that a lot of places like Bangladesh and the Philippines are very religiously-oriented and conservative, thus women get much less pay and fewer rights. Japan and China, also, have distinctly misogynistic undercurrents in their society, and most Asian immigrants won't deny that Asia has gender relations problems. A lot of Western guys, like the commenter above, just really, really like focusing on me, myself, and I. I don't doubt these guys are libertarian or Objectivist.

The canteen one though, the junk food makers change their product *just* enough to get out of the ""causes diabities on the first bite"" category, but then again, any change for the better is an improvement.","1285893224"

You can't tell for certain whether or not God exists (we'll forget to mention that God *could just show himself* and end all debate once and for all).  But, that doesn't mean we *can't know* what the truth is!...  We can go about it another way...  

Just imagine two possibilities:  

A: God exists

and 

B:  God does not exist.  

It's a yes or no question, so there's only 2 possibilities, either A is correct, or B is.  Now, we can't look at God and decide if he exists or not - but we ***CAN*** look at the universe around us!  We simply have to imagine that each possibility is true - then imagine what the universe would look like in that case.  First, we ask what the universe would look like if A were true, if God actually existed?  It would be a place where magic exists.  Where the Earth was the center of the universe.  Evolution wouldn't exist in Universe A, as it was all created 6000 years ago by God.  Miracles would exist.  Statistics wouldn't work (because prayer would sway the results).  Etc...  

Then, we ask ourselves - what would the universe look like it GOD DIDN'T EXIST?  It would be a place run by sciene.  Miracles WOULDN'T exist.  Statistics and probabilities WOULD work.  The Earth would just be another planet in a massive universe of other planets.  Magic WOULDN'T exist.  Etc...  

Now, we don't need God to have anything to do with the question!  We don't need to see him to tell if he exists or not - ***we simply ask ourselves if we live in Universe A or Universe B***!  If we live in A, it's an absolute certainty that God exists.  If we live in B, it's an absolute certainty that God DOES NOT exist.

And, we most certainly live in Universe B.  Anyone that (honestly) looks at it (objectively) CAN ONLY come to the conclusion that we are living in Universe B.  

Therefore, even though we can't answer the question directly - we CAN answer it indirectly...

And, the clear answer is that God does not exist!...  Clearly and logically...","1285893242"

I just wanted to see what it looks like wen you take off, o well. 

But really I feel like I played trough so much of the game that I have taken in the entire overall experience and I have nothing more to glean from it.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","I'm a statistics major who will be graduating in the spring and I can sympathize with your plight. Based on my experiences, I have two pieces of advice.

1. The easiest way for you to get a job is to find out what you are specifically interested in and see if you can pair that with statistics. IMO, there are very few jobs that are looking for vanilla statistics majors.
(In my case, I found that I liked urban policy so I found an internship where I can use my statistical skills to analyze issues of importance to urban areas.)

2. To echo some others here, **LEARN PROGRAMMING**. Learn statistical computing (i.e. R or Stata) as well as basic object oriented programming (i.e. Python or Java). It will serve you extremely well.

Also, I just went to my school's career fair this week and I found that many companies were very interested in statistics majors who specifically had programming skills. These companies varied from tech to finance to nonprofits to think tanks. Good luck!","1285893306"

Don't give me that bullshit.  I worked in that area for several years, in several different industry jobs.  I've seen firsthand the scale of the destruction and the behavior of the oil industry.  No one is being responsible, they do the bare minimum that they must to satisfy the inspectors (who as often as not turn a blind eye to all sorts of abuses).  The entire oil sands area is a fucking wasteland, the reclamation process is a joke, they concentrate on a few areas they can show to the media and inspectors and do a half ass job everywhere else.

The rules for private companies are very different than for public.  There's no requirement to tell shareholders the names of all of the other shareholders.  And you don't have to have an annual meeting for shareholders.

And there's also a lot of options for exactly what you give the beta testers (common stock, non-voting stock, options, warrants, etc.).   Each has subtle and non-subtle differences in how they affect control of the company, taxes, etc.

If you really don't have money for a lawyer right now, I would skip making promises to the beta testers until you do.  If it takes off, you can create real problems for yourself down the road.

People often seem to have this belief that having kids is something you are supposed to do, and it gets drilled into us by parents, friends and media from childhood. But it's really okay if some people don't. Really.

"travel","t5_2qh41","I was on that loop a few weeks after 9/11 and am no expert but found not bringing ""stuff"", in general, has made all of my traveling easier. The only backpack I carry is a small daypack with a few days worth of clothes only and light toiletries. That's it. If it gets stolen, no big loss. I avoid sticking out as a tourist by not wearing that pack as much as possible. I carry very little currency only in my pocket. (In Brazil, I learned from an intrepid traveller, fold like denominations together (fives with fives, tens with tens) and stack them to hit the ground running with foreign currency. This is true in SEA because you'll need to figure it out in the various currencies while trying to avoid easy scams. Easy scams abound, btw. For instance, every cab driver bringing you in from any airport will get a kickback from the hotel that they try to foist upon you. I've been told as much by the hotel owners themselves.  Only carry copies of ID. As far as leaving things in your room, I never had any trouble that I know of. In Vietnam, being a backwards ass Communist country still (at least, in ceremony), the hotels will hold your passport whether you like it or not. However, the sketchier, cheaper you go, the more chance you will have of running into issues. If you can spend the extra few dollars - literally - you might just save yourself the pain and discomfort dealt out at a sleazier joint. Never did I find it necessary to even stay in a true hostile in SEA. It's so cheap. In Hanoi, for example, we had a palatial suite for $16 per night. We didn't usually spend that much but wanted to take a break after roughing it in the jungles of Thailand. ","1285893383"

Making a game tailored for one system when you can port to EVERY other mainstream home console and the PC for minimal cost just isn't worth it in many cases, given Nintendo's lackluster matchmaking systems and the current reputation that gameplay has to be scaled back a console generation to be ""adapted"" for the Wii.

Nate Silver said says that [while he doesn't trust Iranian elections, the supposed statistical ""evidence"" of fraud is lacking](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/06/statistical-evidence-does-not-prove.html)

Wikipedia says that [No credible  evidence published so far indicates that any fraud in fact happened.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_presidential_election,_2009#Analysis_of_the_results) , with all the additional info you can find there.  

I mean I'm just googling so I'm sure you can find more.  The fact is, that the burden of proof isn't on me to prove it wasn't rigged...It's on someone else to prove it was.  Despite our media's coverage, there was no conclusive proof that the elections were stolen.  We don't like Ahmadinejad, so we automatically assumed he must have stolen it because he's a ""dictator.""  But just because a lot of young people rioted and set shit on fire, doesn't mean he's still not massively popular elsewhere in the country to Iranians who see nuclear power as a matter of pride.","1285893434"

A lot of times, you are depressed and you think it's for a particular reason.  This is the thing that keeps people from getting help.  They think ""it's this thing that is bothering me"", but it's more the depression itself.  For me, I feel depressed for no reason, but then my mind struggles to put a face on the depression.  So I become convinced it's some circumstance that is making me so upset, when really it is my brain.  

I'm sorry your school is stressful.  It's hard to focus on doing your work when you feel like this.  The stress doesn't help.  

Trying medication is a good bet.  Nobody ever wants to do it.  It's not how I imagined, though.  I was afraid it would change my personality or make me a zombie.  I was afraid it would be something that would get me high, which I can't do because I would get addicted too easily.  I thought it was just useless, since I believed all my problems were external.  However, I tried it.  First I was on Wellbutrin, which worked great.  At first it made me stay up all night, and they give you sleeping pills to help with that.  I didn't take the sleeping pills and instead just waited it out.  The insomnia went away.  That was the only side effect I had.  But after some time, it quit working.  That was not pretty.  So I had to find something else, but everything I tried had side effects I couldn't deal with, even thought they were all things like headaches or making me sleep too much.  Nothing serious, just annoying.  I have friends from a support group that have taken a lot of other things, and when we all compare notes, what works for one person doesn't for another.  So if the first try doesn't work, don't give up.  

Will you fuck up your brain/thinking/learning capacity?  I doubt it.  Usually depression makes it harder to concentrate, but on meds that problem should go away.  You will still be able to think for yourself and the only thing that will change is that all of a sudden, you aren't crushed by the weight of being depressed.  Most people do not stay on these permanently.  They are kind of like braces for your brain.  Your brain should right itself because of them and when you stop taking them, you will hopefully be able to stay that way.  There are people like me, who have been on it awhile.  I didn't like that I had to be on it, but whenever I stop taking it, I am soon reminded of why I should just keep taking it.  Mine just won't go away, even though I have worked out most of my issues.  So I plan to stay on it as long as necessary, because I'd rather be taking pills than living the hell I was before.  It is really important, though (and this is where many people mess up), to be working on your issues in therapy, so they will not put you right back in depression when you go off the meds.  Over time (a few months will definitely tell you for sure), your therapist should be helping you in some way.  If you feel they aren't, don't be afraid to change.

What I would try is the freezer trick, it fixes siezed motors and such for a small amount of time.   Basically, get the drive, put it in an AIRTIGHT bag (or two, or three, you dont want any moisture getting into the drive) and leave it in the freezer overnight.

Then take it out of the freezer, put it in the PC and try and access it.  If it works, start copying off data STRAIGHT AWAY, most important to least important, as it usually only gives you a small window to recover data.  And dont let it spin down, start copying, dont stop till you have everything.
Its free, wont further damage the drive for other recovery methods (unless moisture gets in) and has a decent chance of success.","1285893485"

Your ex-wife is a sleazy cuntbag and it's a shame she sucked so many years out of you and burdened you with kids. That whole thing about not trusting anyone yet? Stick with that - as defeatist and cynical as this is going to sound, it's probably the best idea because the shit your wife did is only getting more and more common these days as women realise they **can** have their cake and eat it too.

Oh, and one other thing - she's going to make you out to be the one at fault here - to friends, family and **your kids**. That's what they do - and your ex sounds like a pretty evil, manipulative woman. Please, don't let her rot your childrens' minds. Remember that she wasn't fucking you because she was busy fucking some other guy. Remember that you held out for quite some time before you caved and had sex with someone else (which in retrospect you were completely entitled to).

There is a reason we don't allow a 10 year old to marry, and I think that most rational people would agree that there should be a minimum age for it. What number we pick will always be up for debate, but the law itself is beneficial. 

The reason we don't allow family members to marry is primarily to avoid incest, which is harmful to the children born into that. However, if two brothers want to get married, far be it from me to stop them. I think it's gross, but that should be no measure.

I still maintain that the onus is on those who wish to maintain a law to show that enforcing it costs less than the damage done if it were legal. Marriage is a bad example, since *enforcement* isn't an issue, it's more simply denying a government service to one group, but a law against sodomy, for example, works. 

If it isn't being enforced, it should come off the books. If it is being enforced, we should be asking ourselves how much it's costing society, and whether we could spend that money actually making a difference in education, or science.","1285893515"

If the restaurant is primarily a take-out restaurant (a la the little Thai place down the street), I do not leave a tip. At places like Outback Steakhouse or like an Applebee's (I've worked at both in college), there is a dedicated ""To-Go"" team, and they bring the food out to you when you pull into the parking lot. I tip these people, usually around 15%, which is probably too much. It's kind of on a case-by-case basis, but basically if I walk into a place and get handed a paper bag, I do not leave a tip. If there's any more effort, I will tip accordingly. I find this acceptable. As a side note, the line on the receipt for ""Tip"" isn't generally to guilt people into leaving more money; it's because it's a place that allows for tips and doesn't want to run two separate machines running two separate tapes, with a person guessing which to use based on your perceived proclivity to leaving a gratuity.","1285893543"

But i do agree with him on the fact that the raging liberals on reddit is as bad, if not worst than the raging conservative.  They closed their mind to facts from the other side and get on the offensive every time someone disagree with them.  I also agree with how there is a large amount of teenage emo-ness going on, but hey, everyone's got problems.  

both side seems to simplify everything down to ""..move to Europe and have half your damned paycheck taken away..."" or ""...they support illegals pouring over our borders..."".  Having not known your brother, lines like that passed him off as someone who repeats things that was fed to him, so i assume US special forces doesn't teach critical/multi-dimensional thinking.  He could be an intelligent individual who just do not think before writing something on the internet or didn't consider that there are many factors that goes into every issue.  Simplifying an issue down to one line and repeating it as gospel are for those who has no will or mind of their own.  

as for the advice of moving to Europe, i don't plan to move to Europe specifically, but i do plan to move to countries that are experiencing an economic boom and is on their way to becoming new first world countries such as, russia, china, indian, or brazil.  It's a fact that the US, no matter how great it is, cannot maintain its current standard of living for all its citizen in a globalized interdependent world without either heavy taxation or some overnight technological break through.  The way it is currently going, the bottom half of the population is only going to grow in order to fuel the standards of living of the upper half.  

tldr: your brother is a douche, but he was right about the raging liberals being just as bad and how emo teens are ruining the internet.  I do plan to emigrate out of the US but not to Europe where I'm probably less qualify for jobs than the majority of the population.","1285893561"

Figuratively spoken, Christianity has all the characteristics of a sleazy snake oil salesman: Absurd claims about a questionable product, manufactured by suspicious means and advertised by dishonest lies.

Whenever someone tells you that he is following a guy, who rose from the dead without being able to produce solid evidence for it beyond the testimony of some hysterical women, written down some ten years after the event took place, then you should have doubts.

I'd look into the parts of your old religion that don't make sense; there are good critical overviews of each of the major faiths - that's something we can help with.  Learning about the broken parts of your old belief system is the best start you can have because it will open your eyes to logical evaluation of everything.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; ... but digital computers, unlike our brains, are discrete machines: they can only operate under a set of yes/no rules. There is no true randomness, no true continuity.

This is quite false. There are any number of ways to get a computer to enter a gray area and produce soft, indefinite results. One simple way is to establish some probabilities or weights and select an outcome using a random or pseudorandom number:

* Give option A 20%, B 33% and C 47%: ""a = 0.2; b = 0.33;"".

 * Choose the outcome based on those weights.

* First, generate a pseudorandom number: ""q = rand()"".

* Next, use the number to choose the outcome:

      if(q &lt; a) { do action A }
      else if(q-a &lt; b) { do action B }
      else { do action C }

A simple example, but it makes the point that a computer's actions can be made to change direction based on weighted probabilities and on a simulation of chance (i.e. a pseudorandom number).

I hope you understood that the outcome for the above example is randomly selected every time it is run, but always with the same average weights.

By the way, the pseudorandom number can instead be from a truly random source, or even from a quantum-noise-derived source for those who care about such things.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I couldn't agree more.  I've studied Shakespeare from both sides.  One thing that always bothered me about the literary study of Shakespeare is the tendency to view the Elizabethan text through the lens of our post modern influenced contemporary perspective.  Hence, you get gender study and queer theory making claims that aren't entirely supported in the original context of the Elizabethan point of view.  (That point of view being, that despite everything in the play's world being out of natural order, all will be righted by the end.  The Taming of the Shrew is a good example of this.)  Just studying other plays of that time period will show that there are popular themes and devices that Shakespeare utilizes.  After all, he had seats to fill, so he had to do what was popular and in demand, much like today's writers of screen and television plays.  

On the other hand, the fact that Shakespeare can transcend these differing points of view, giving life and meaning to his plays for our times, is part of the beauty and charm of his work.  Kenneth Branagh's work comes to mind here.    ","1285893606"

There was a machine that had about 5 rows, and a chute that went back and forth. when you deposited a quarter, it went down the chute, landed on the upper tier, that tier then recedes, pushing the quarter off, then it displaced the quarters sitting on the second tier.

Any quarters that fell off the second tier gave a ""ticket value"" to dispense prize tickets. Only this machine was broken. It didn't dispense tickets. It dispensed the displaced quarters. Needless to say me and my brother spent about an hour working this machine till an employee noticed (guess nobody EVER spent that much time on that machine) and put a stop to it.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I only created an account to put this into perspective.

This article makes it sound like a good thing, let me tell you all about this (Hartz IV) is inhuman.

The author is talking about a decent life? Sorry, it could not be further from the truth. The money you do get each month is in reality the very minimum you need to survive. There is absolutely zero margin to for any form of entertainment (no holidays, no restaurant, no cinema, no presents for your kids for birthday or xmas,), just mindless TV.

I realize that for people not from europe it must sound crazy to say anything bad about it, you get free money, you can survive on this without ever doing any kind of work ever in your life.

But it is not, germany has always been a welfare state which made it possible that everyone has healthcare no matter how much you earn (even nothing), the possibility of a home (you dont need to be homeless), food, a basic quality of life, not just to survive.

However, in recent years this changed, this program was introduced (Hartz IV) and people struggle to survive, they get far less benefits, far less money to survive as they did before.

This leads to various problems for feature generations, parents can not afford that their kids reach a higher education, most childs of parents with Hartz IV stop going to school with 16 years so that they can get a job. The kids then struggle to find an apprenticeship, and after that will most likely be jobless too which leads to one thing : the new generation will also receive Hartz IV and their kids too and so on. These people also have mostly on average alot more kids than middle class citizen. This sounds harsh but the effect is that the average german will be less and less educated, the economical effect and quality of life to everyone should be obvious.

Finally think about how people (politicians) are able to judge how much money their citizen actually need, when they earn 20 to 30 times more each month just from their primary job alone (most have a contract with the industry so this easily goes to 100x). They lost reality, they wouldnt even survive 1 week if they would walk in the shoes they put other people in.

tldr: there is nothing good about this, this article is a disgrace made by a foreign ""journalist"" who has zero clue about the living conditions in germany, there is no ""decent life"" while being forced receiving Hartz IV","1285893676"

"self","t5_2qh96","Current JET here. Yes it's extremely competitive, but don't let that discourage you! I do believe that the application for next year's JETs should be out this month. If you want to do JET this year, start applying now! Before you even start filling out the application, contact two people you want as references who will be able write stellar letters of reference for you. Also start considering why you would be a good candidate and what makes you interested in Japan and the JET program. A strong statement of purpose and good references are very important. Also, any prior experiences teaching or to Japan are a plus.

Anyway..You apply now, but don't find out results for that until January, I believe. Then if you get an interview, you have that in February and don't get results for the interview until April. And then you have to wait to find out placement information...which can be as soon as May and up to July in some cases. So it's a very very looooong process with much waiting. So I hope you have a lot of patience!

Also, you don't get to choose where you get placed. You can make a request, but I really don't think the people choosing give a two shits about where you request. I know maybe 2 people who got where they requested. So when you apply, just be aware that you won't get Tokyo and you most likely won't get in a big city. Some lucky ones do, but the reality is you'll probably be somewhere more rural since JET is a grassroots effort at internationalization. You probably won't be as rural as me though. ;)

The Trinity while difficult to understand makes sense that all three forms of God agree with themselves and are united in purpose.  Perfect togetherness and unity of mission means God can exist forever without fighting itself.  The Christian theology makes a great deal of sense if you think about it.

Even if you don't know if Jesus is real or not, you can go,""Well if Jesus is real, he is an awesome guy, and I'd love to be friends with him for eternity.""  This is the right stance to be in contrasted with people who would hate Jesus.

There are many channels you can use to communicate with the IE team. Wait a few weeks and personal-message that account and you'll be the only person in their inbox.

&gt; Think they'll ever do this again? Not likely. Richard Stallman can shout down little kids for for not saying ""guh-noo linux"" and eat his fucking toe-jam, people still worship the ground he walks on here.

Some people. Others detest him. I fall closer to the latter camp than the former.

&gt; It doesn't matter how good of a product Microsoft releases, and people like you will still not be happy with it.

Who said I'm not happy with IE9? You keep making assumptions about who I am or what my interests are. I've told you multiple times that I actually don't give a shit about the whole debate one way or another. I just hate stupidity. When you say that people asked for X and they got Y and therefore they should be happy, I think: ""that's stupid."" And I have a bad habit of trying to correct stupidity.

It doesn't mean I care about the larger issue. I don't. I also don't mind that Facebook's API (which I work with every day) is god-awful. Like I said: barriers to entry are good. Let them delete documentation and change things in irrational ways. When others drop out of the game for lack of motivation to keep up, I profit.

Just a month ago I was accused of being a paid Microsoft shill on here, so I guess I'm either schizophrenic or unbiased or disinterested. I think it's the latter.

&gt; That being said, your argument still lacks any real substance. IE6, 7 and 8 are going away, along with it XP and it's inherent security disadvantages. 

Yes, in the long run.

""In the long run, we're all dead."" -- John Maynard Keynes

But Microsoft is demonstrably and obviously slowing the process of upgrades to IE9 by making it Windows 7-only. That's indisputable. 

&gt; Do you know how you make that happen? You stop supporting it so people will move on AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MS IS DOING.

There you go again with your non-sequiters.

Nobody in the web development community asked Microsoft to make XP go away. They asked Microsoft to make IE6, 7 and 8 go away.

So you remain incorrect in your original assertion that Microsoft has given the web development community what it asked for.

&gt;  And you, as a CTO, can simply tell people you don't support anything less than IE 9, and point to the many other options available on XP.

I'll presume you're being disingenuous rather than assume you're actually stupid. And therefore I won't waste my time describing why it is a bad plan for a CTO to try and shape the technology world by withholding his products from the customers running the most popular operating system in the world.

&gt; By the way, your little coding example was horrendous. I imagine you write dumb shit like that on your whiteboard at work and probably feel real clever doing it.

No, I work with a really good team and people do not go out of their way to misunderstand me because they are emotionally invested in misunderstanding. So I do not need to resort to formal languages to communicate extremely simple ideas. I just say things, and people use their common sense in interpreting what I say.

But I've found that in online discussions, using formalisms is a good way to force people to address the silliness of their position. ""4!=7"" is pretty easy to understand and I can see from the shift in your argument that it actually got through to you, which it did not what I used English.

The oil sands are an ecological disaster, one that will take hundreds of years to recover from.

The entire oil sands project (and most other oil industry activity) is irresponsibility on the grandest human scale;  the bottom line is all that matters to oil companies, and the government is complicit in allowing this behavior.

As for straight up constitutional rights, there are also instances where the discretion of private entities can be limited by the constitution.  Marsh v.

If we could fish within reason, use natural resources within reason, and handle our waste within reason, then we wouldn't
have to say that the earth itself is overpopulated, but I guess the way we operate illustrates that there may indeed be too many people on the planet, but then should we just accept that how we handle our resources is something that we can't change?","1285893756"

Mossadegh was not elected by majority vote of the population. He came to power through the murder of his predecessor, and refused to hold elections as mandated by the constitution.

Not having that absolute faith, still having doubts and questions. This guilt sometimes I think turns into hatred for the idea. Then you start looking for reasons to disown all the ideas. The guilt I think your more referring to is something of the evangelical kind and babtist (I live in baptist country now). Maybe I was lucky enough to have a priest that was pretty honest and straight forward. Kinda of a badass too. I remember asking him about how the bible was made. He actually told me it was during the Council of Nicaea and not some other bullshit. Most catholics, from what I have experienced, realize that a lot of it is symbolism.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","In cultures that never experienced the Enlightenment in their intellectual world, the order has never changed.  One of the biggest missteps Westerners make in examining other cultures is the lack of granting that the population actually BELIEVES the things they say they believe.  We say we ""believe in God"" but when we drop something, we know its actually gravity doing it.  No one actually believes it was the objects inherent sin that drew it closer to Hell, or anything like that.  All of our religious ideas have been abstracted away and split off from our beliefs about the real, physical, material world by imagining dualism - where the natural and supernatural are different worlds.  It was the basis for all cultural development for the past 300 years.  It is so completely ever-present that even realizing it is there takes a good bit of learning about history.

And in cultures where these ideas never were spread, or never took root, many of our approaches do not work.  You cannot appeal to them to be reasonable with members of different clan.  They do not understand the idea that we're all human beings, all dealing with a world ruled by physical laws and that reason can bring us understanding of it and help us develop.  They believe (and I mean believe in the way you believe in gravity) that the will of gods are the cause of everything in the world.  They believe the will of the gods will determine their lives.  They believe that they are not dealing with something as piddly and insignificant as having a more comfortable life, they are dealing with a battle between an eternity of torture or an eternity of paradise.  Until people accept that these aren't just ideas they toss around and that there is a facade of ""reasonableness"" under it all, they simply can't hope to perceive the world through their eyes.  The belief that government MUST be determined by the law of a single god, and that governance according to the reasoning of mankind is a singular, sinister evil is an idea so foreign to those 3 generations or more deep in a culture that accepted those ideas and built everything upon them that it is very hard to conceive of.

And what do they hear from the Western world for the most part?  Their most common experiences are with missionaries.  Or our military.  One group trying to seduce them away to another god with exactly the types of trinkets and promises they've learned since birth to resist, and another promising to break their nose if they don't behave a certain way.  Even the most well-meaning Westerners usually look upon their culture as different, but equal.  Out of a reasonable fear of repeating the errors of colonialism, and an unreasonable selfish desire to maintain some cultures for anthropologists to study, they've defaulted to an extremely condescending and cruel non-interventionist policy.  Instead of respecting the members of the culture, offering them the intellectual fruits of the Enlightenment, and trusting them to be capable of evaluating and making the choice themselves.","1285893810"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","First of all, feminist movement is not strong. The number of women who identify as feminists or advocate feminism has declined dramatically since the 60's and 70's. Young females especially believe that due to the gains women have made through feminism that discrimination, exploitation and oppression of women no longer exist and as such feel feminism is irrelevant.

The rest of your comment comes from a very privileged white bourgeois perspective of feminist movement (regardless of your actual race, class or gender). You already sound like the battle is over and that equality now exists between the genders; that discrimination, exploitation and oppression against women does not happen anymore. Not only is this not true for all women, it's most certainly not true for black women, who faced and continue to face this from both men (of both races) and white women due to the dominant, aggressive behavior propagated by white women in feminist movement. 

Now this is not to say that oppression can't or shouldn't be violently resisted. Quite the opposite; it should, but it should also compliment other tactics, such as challenging dominance, authority, and violence that is rampant in our society, which are the main traits that make up all forms of discrimination, exploitation and oppression. 

&gt; Sexist discrimination, exploitation, and oppression have created the war between the sexes. (...) Feminist movement can end the war between the sexes. It can transform relationships so that the alienation, competition, and dehumanization that characterize human interaction can be replaced with feelings of intimacy, mutuality, and camaraderie. - bell hooks, *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center*

It would take a lot longer to entirely break down each and every way that your comment is describes a fundamental problem with contemporary feminist movement, and because I don't have the time, nor am particularly the most sufficient in getting my point across, I will end here while recommending any book by bell hooks but most of all ""*Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics*"" and ""*Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center*"".

I know that when my boss goes home after a ~10 hr day his wife has made dinner, done the chores, washed his clothes, on and on.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Of course there are.  I can tell you exactly which ones they will be. Let me introduce you to one.
Meet Amy.  Amy is a 29 year old woman.  She's a bit shy, and no one really notices her ever.  She lives alone, when she goes to work no one talks to her, and she goes home and eats alone before going to bed.  She is desperately lonely and she sees no hope that there will be any change.  She believes that no one really cares about her, no one would notice if she just disappeared.

If you tell someone like that that there is a cosmic being who loves her very much and knows everything about her, she will likely at least want to believe you.  If you also tell her there is a community full of people who will take her in and love her and be friends with her, she is much more likely to believe.

Cults operate under the same principle.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I lived in Costa Rica for two years and recently moved to Medellin because, get this, it is much, much safer in Colombia than in Costa Rica.  I do not have a single friend in CR who has not been robbed.  One friend had three laptops stolen in a year.  An acquaintance of mine was [killed in an armed robbery](http://www.diarioextra.com/2008/setiembre/08/sucesos09.php) about two years ago, and another friend was stabbed in the throat in Parque Central by a thief who wanted his college ring.

The police are completely useless -- the one time I sought help from a cop down there, he wasn't wearing any identification so I asked his name.  His response:  Antonio Banderas.  They take pride in being completely *inutil*, useless.  

In all of the tourist areas, Americans and Europeans are despised, and you will be viewed solely as a mark, especially in tourist traps like Puerto Viejo, San Jose, Jaco, and Manuel Antonio.  I know for a fact that police turn a blind eye to drug use in Puerto Viejo because they are paid by the drug dealers to do so.  You may think that sounds cool, but what else can the police be paid to turn a blind eye to?

Also, if you insist on visiting CR, one of the latest crime fads down there is for taxi drivers to wait for you to step out of their cab and then drive off with all your luggage.  You can read the license number on the doors of the taxi, report it to the police, and absolutely nothing will be done.

Hi Blair,

I appreciate you taking the time to respond personally instead allowing me to get a form letter response.

I also appreciate that sometimes things go wrong with code and leave you with a difficult problem to solve.

But I believe my original criticisms are still valid, in that

1. I should not have to opt against an automatic change, I should be enticed to make a *choice* to change.
2. The links for changing have obvious tracking tokens. If you made a genuine error, send plain links from which to take action. It seems just a little disingenuous to me.

I also think text only is a sensible default to maintain. It is far more likely to be inoffensive to your subscribers, it will work with all email clients and is probably less likely to be trapped as spam. A small message and/or link at the bottom of the text only email messages about the option of the HTML email would serve your purpose in making people aware of the alternative.

If you don't think I have a valid point, I'd be very interested to hear your opinion.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, took office as the president of Ecuador in January 2007, becoming one of a growing number of Latin American leaders who came to power by running against the free-market policies backed by the United States and their countries' traditional elites. On April 26, 2009, preliminary results showed him winning re-election.

Mr. Correa in 2007 defeated Álvaro Noboa, the banana tycoon and Bible-quoting scion of a Guayaquil family who is Ecuador's richest man, who Mr. Correa portrayed as someone who would use the presidency to advance his economic interests. By contrast, Mr. Correa has governed on a platform that combines nationalistic control of the economy with broadly popular social welfare programs for the poor.

Mr. Correa, the country's 10th leader since 1996, won approval of a new Constitution in September 2007 that eroded checks on the presidency, and has emerged as Ecuador's most powerful president since military rule ended here in 1979.

Mr. Correa is also an urbane economist with postgraduate degrees from the University of Illinois and Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, where he met his Belgian wife, Anne Malherbe.

Since the global economy began to slow, Mr. Correa has had to shelve his ambitous plans in favor of economic survival. Low oil prices undermined Mr. Correa's hopes of sustaining social spending. Since Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt in December, hard currency reserves have fallen by about a third to $3 billion. Rising unemployment in Spain and the United States, countries with large numbers of Ecuadorean immigrants, is also pushing remittances lower.

Mr. Correa, 46, has responded to the sharp economic slowdown by seeking more than $1 billion in loans from China and imposing restrictions on hundreds of imported products in an attempt to prevent United States dollars, used here as the official currency, from flowing out of the country.

In the 2009 voting, Mr. Correa appeared headed for victory as the old political establishment was unable to muster a coherent alternative. According to preliminary results, Mr. Correa won 51 percent of the vote, with his closest challenger, Lucio Gutiérrez, a former army colonel ousted as president in 2005, getting 29 percent.

Chafing at ties between American intelligence agencies and Ecuadorean military officials, Mr. Correa is purging the armed forces of top commanders and pressing ahead with plans to cast out more than 100 members of the American military from an air base in his country. Some American officials believe that the air station is a critical component in the war on drugs in the Andes.

In 1999, American officials negotiated a 10-year agreement with President Jamil Mahuad to set up the elaborate airborne radar detection project at Manta, a port of 250,000. But Mr. Correa has voiced plans to not renew that agreement in 2009.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No, but I do know what my own experiences are. Every culture (distinct from race as a white person growing up in China would likely have the same traits) has some habits while walking and driving that are particular to them. Even the sexes have some general traits.

When you see a driver road raging and doing something to ""punish"" another driver for some perceived transgression, it's almost always a young white or Armenian male. Whenever you see someone do something indicative of being completely oblivious to who or what is around them it's usually a female. When you see someone do erratic things like turn right at an intersection, stop, back up into oncoming traffic to go straight, it's usually an Asian female. When you see someone driving like 30 mph on the freeway you know it's an old white person if it's a Buick and it's a Hispanic if it's a Nissan.

When Jared T at the FPR article begins talking about the removal of a BCC commenter's comment at MM, he means that BCC's commenter's comment to John's own article. Whenever John would write a post, he would moderate the comments to his posts exclusively.

I'm going to respectfully ignore accusations of being ""very dramatic"" (even though it really really really hurts me), because I don't think my words imply anything that was untrue. I think people are misinterpreting them. I have never implied that John censored *any other perma's post*.

All of these things, by their virtue of happening on Mormon Matters, have hurt the reputation of the entire cast of permabloggers. When someone says, ""Wow, Mormon Matters deleted Brad from BCC's comments,"" that blame doesn't rest squarely with John...rather, it gets pinned on the rest of the permas.

I would say I am passive for a couple of reasons:

* I don't take things as seriously as the women I know.  [We have fewer problems](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39384763/ns/health-behavior/) with things and maybe that makes us appear to be passive.
* Yes to some extent it is sex.  In my anecdotal evidence men enjoy sex more than women.  That means women can use sex as a weapon.  I don't want my girlfriend to withhold sex, so I do what I can to keep that from happening.  Women help create this situation when they insult a guy for masturbating.","1285894027"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","Studies on marijuana's ability to cause cancer, or kill brain cells is totally inconclusive.  You can go find one study that says it causes cancer, and another that says it doesn't.  I've even seen studies that say not only does MJ not kill brain cells, but can actually cause new cell growth.  Until the rhetoric and bullshit is set aside and actual unbiased studies are carried out, this will always be inconclusive to me on both counts.

As far as making people stupid, I really don't believe that.  I'm a long time every day user, and in no way do I think it has ever affected my intelligence.  I was a 4.0 student all through college, ON WEED!  What it does affect, and what you may be seeing and calling dumb, is MJ affects short term memory.  But as soon as you stop, that goes away.

And now I have a question, this stoner you refer to having known for more than two years.  Did you know this person before they ever smoked MJ?

And Xixii is right, Portugal decriminalized all drug possession (not just MJ, also Heroin, Coke, EVERYTHING AFAIK) and usage in the country has [dropped significantly](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html) over the last 9 years.

Basically, it sounds like you have totally bought into all the brainwashing.  Go read about why Marijuana was actually prohibited.  It really had nothing to do with it being a ""drug.""  It was all about corporate profit, Du Pont chemical didn't want competition, Hearst owned newspapers and was invested in timber interests and didn't want the competition.  

Why?  Because hemp is so incredibly and ridiculously useful.  Makes paper of finer quality than tree based paper, and without the need to cut down trees.  Makes one of the most durable natural cloths.  Henry Ford's first Model T was designed to run on hemp fuel.  The first engines Diesel ever built were designed to run on hemp fuel.  It can be made into plastics.  The seeds are a super healthy food source.  It is probably the most useful plant on the entire planet, and they've brainwashed us all into thinking it's bad because of it's psychoactive properties, when really the 1937 stamp tax act was all about corporate profit and non-competition.","1285894054"

For learning in some AI systems, you can combine your knowledge, and discrete algorithms, and chaos then feed the results back to your knowledge.  Your discrete algorithms are part of your knowledge and the feedback may be a modification of an old algorithm.

I don't think that follows logically from your premise.  A censure is not the same as censorship.  Not even close.  The very principle of free speech is that you have a right to say ""x"" and somebody else has an equal right to condemn it, attack it, or argue against it so long as they don't incite violence against your person or prohibit you from saying ""x"" (or ""y"" or ""z"").

Macleans wrote something which was not based on any dataset or acknowledged methodology and was, in my opinion, therefore flawed.  I have every right (as do MPs) to say that I don't support this article because of its aforementioned flaws and that isn't in any universe analogous to censorship.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","First of all, some of your assumptions about the present capabilities of computers are wrong. We do have well defined methods that are sort of like ""educated guessing"" (taking a sample from a posterior likelihood distribution, for example), and a computer is very capable of being at least as random as a human. A good source of randomness that a computer can use is thermal sensor noise: record from a digital video camera with its cap on, and you can get that greenish-grayish noise and use it for whatever randomness you want.

But, randomness is not really a prerequisite for intelligence. You could be more concise and say that repetitiveness could maybe be a problem for intelligence, in that a repeating set of actions could be redundant and unproductive in some (also repeating) circumstances. But you can get non-repetitiveness even more easily than true noise, by evaluating any irrational number for example.

Just so, a modern digital computer can in theory do anything in the domain of computation. That includes simulating a brain. Of course, the brain is (on some levels) analog and a computer is digital, but we could chop up the relevant dimensions finely enough for a discrete simulation to come as close as you might like to the performance of an actual brain. We don't have the power to accomplish that physically, yet, but it's proof in principle that we don't need any bizarre principles in addition to digital logic to accomplish AI.

That said, it's well known that the brain does not follow ""the best"" strategy in everything. It uses a lot of approximations and heuristics, to limit the computations it needs to perform. We will probably find that in order to practically run an AI, it will need to take a lot of similar shortcuts.","1285894095"

"redditdev","t5_2qizd","Pardon me while I step in here knowing nothing about coding, but what I think would be useful from a *user* standpoint would be to view the whole thing fractally.

It all starts with the submission - that's the root.  The next level beyond that are replies directly to the root.  Call these branches.  The ""thickness"" of the branch could be thought of as a function of the amount of votes (up and down) of every twig (a branch off a branch) and leaf (a branch with no additional comments) attached to that branch.

So.  Suppose we've got 4000 comments on a post.  Initially, the UI loads 100 comments (for the sake of argument) divided up into the top 10 branches (ranked by best), the top 40 twigs (ranked by best) and the top 50 leaves (ranked by best).  Again, arbitrary numbers picked for the sake of argument.  This allows the user to get a view of the gestalt of all conversations.  

The user then finds something interesting and wants to see more.  Rather than loading ""next 500"" or whatever like is done now, the ability to load *everything* on one (AND ONLY ONE) branch at a time would allow the user to participate in that conversation in an organic way without also crushing the resources of Reddit.  It'll take a few minutes to see what the user wants to see on that branch, particularly because *that branch* is what he wants to see.  If he wants to see something else, he loads another branch - so instead of going ""125"" ""500"" ""1000"" ""+200 replies(view)"" the user is going to see ""+massive discussion about how cops suck"" ""+massive pun thread"" ""+massive meme-fest"" ""+massive circlejerk about the evils of religion"" etc.  I believe this would have the advantage of only loading comments in chunks of a few hundred at a time without giving the user a bunch of stuff he has no intention of ever reading.  It might *also* have the advantage of saving those of us disinterested in wading through pun threads from wading through pun threads (granted, if there's deep, meaningful discussion at the bottom of an epic pun thread we'll miss it but that's what /r/bestof is for).

This kind of morbid stuff fascinates the shit out of me. For example, hypothetically, lets say there was a way to surgically slice you in half, from head to waist, and keep you alive. Then they create a robotic prosthesis that will function with your body and keep you alive while fulfilling your lost half's physical form and function, so you basically look like half a terminator. 

Let's imagine the operation was a success for both halves of you, and both halves of you are technically alive, but in two separate bodies. How fucking freaky would it be to look at another body that is technically *YOU*? Would both of you share the same name? If the other you was exactly like you, how would you decide which you got to keep the original name? How weird would it be playing a game of basketball or chess against yourself? What the hell would you call that, a clone? A post-birth twin? Would you be best friends and live together and do all the same shit, or would you go off and have different lives?

The only problem is that as far as headphones go they're not quiet. Your roommate will be able to hear you play even while you're wearing them, but it shouldn't be anything enough to annoy him.

"politics","t5_2cneq","First of all thanks for putting the effort into writing this. It is always great to hear it from someone who specialises in the area.

The main gist of what I was trying to say and what I am still trying to say is that much of what has happened is not because of Al Qaida's design but because of the US's inept handling of the situation. 

On the point of Saddam, one thing that everyone discounts and dares not mention is that Saddam was a client of the US. This is true in so far as the US facilitated his purchase of the weaponry he used against his citizens, including the chemical weapons. It is highly hypocritical to say that because of who he was the US should have intervened. In actuality the US is the main sponsor of some of the major despots in the Middle East, from Mubarak in Egypt (where torture is common place) to zero freedom Saudia. So the US has zero high ground to stand on. It all comes down to oil and oil.

As to the torture and the like, it is not the fact they were done by individuals, it is the fact the system was/is no longer capable of addressing these acts honestly and in a just way. All that Obama's administration has done is go out of its way to cover up Bush's misdeeds, Gauntanamo is still operational. These are not the actions of a mature democracy. It is something we would expect from a newly minted East European democracy.

On the idea of Muslims, it is not about the those that have trusted the US, it is however the fact the majority of Muslims do not trust the US (blanket statement .. but I think true). It is incomprehensible to view positively a nation that sponsors the despot that makes your life hell. If Muslims were a monolithic body then we can say this or that, however just because a great majority of the elite in nations with zero democracy that suckle on the tit of the US, trust it, does not mean that the US has any great support.

On Iran, the fact that the US has transformed itself into a polar opposite and is unable to establish diplomatic relations is not Al Qaida's doing. Iran is an enemy as far as Al Qaida is concerned (did you know that Osama's immediately family is currently being held in Tehran and have been for the last few years?). However the fact the US has been unable and unwilling to co-opt Iran has meant that another front could not be opened on Al Qaida.

The sad part is much of what has happened to the US since the events of 9/11 have been as a result of the US's doing.","1285894200"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Another tip:  I assume you know how to drive a stick shift car?     Take a few minutes to think about the mechanics:  pressing the clutch disconnects the engine from the transmission, allowing you to shift gears.  Taking your foot off of the clutch too fast (without giving it enough gas) causes the engine to stall because it can't overcome the weight of the car that quickly.       Giving it too much gas causes the car to surge ahead.   

A motorcycle is going to work in the same way, pulling in the left lever is the same as pressing the clutch pedal in a car.      It's getting the muscle memory that is the hardest part for beginners - when I say it's ""hard"" I mean it's frustrating - but you will pick up on it quickly.

The reason most beginners should start with slow/small bikes is because of lack of this muscle memory - especially giving it too much gas - as you can imagine, when a motorcycle surges ahead, your hand pulls back, which usually results in giving it MORE gas and that's where things go from bad to worse.

Understanding the mechanics has always been key for my own learnings.

It doesn't make sense as the creator of this dynamic planet to then populate it with species that would not be able to adapt to these changes over time. So He gives them a tool to roll with the ecological ""punches"": evolution.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's nice that Nintendo wants to decrease the concern, but the concern is there for a reason.

The simple fact of the matter is that no other company can consistently sell software at the rate Nintendo has for the past 25 years or so. If you look at a list of the best-selling games of all time (across all platforms) you'll see that Nintendo completely dominates. (If you look at a list of best-reviewed games of all time, you'll also see Nintendo's name show up more than any other company. But that's another discussion altogether.) At the end of the day, Nintendo is basically in a league of their own in many regards.

The reality of the situation is that third-parties have NEVER been able to compete with Nintendo. The NES pretty much had a monopoly on the industry and nearly every major third-party supported the console. Nevertheless, if you were to look at the 50 best-selling NES games of all time, you'd see that the majority (or at least a sizable plurality) of them were developed by Nintendo. And, again, the NES certainly wasn't exactly hurting in the area of third-party support.

Third-parties have never been able to sell the same volume as Nintendo, and I seriously doubt they ever will. Once in a while you'll have a mega-hit like Street Fighter II or Dragon Quest that sells at a level comparable to a major Nintendo release, but these titles are few and far between. Nintendo has always dominated the sales charts.","1285894306"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","To restate an argument of Dawkins'...

There's another round-about way we can look at this.  Again, we just imagine each side is true - then look around us and see which best matches what we see...

How are facts distributed around the world?...  Pretty uniform, right?  For instance, you don't have the Spanish claiming pi is 3.1 and the Chinese claiming it's 3.2, right?  Everyone agrees it's 3.1415...  The Icelanders don't use something other than E=MC2.  There's no international debate over whether we perceive the sky as blue.  Facts are universal.  They don't change in different places.  The Russians don't claim outer space is made up of aether, and the Americans something different.  Facts are facts.  A fact in Australia - is a fact in Iraq.

So, IF God were to exist - that would be a fact.  And, it would be universal.  Everywhere you looked, everyone would be worshipping the same God.  Facts are distributed globally, not locally.

IF God existed, you wouldn't expect to find a hundred different religions on Earth.  There would only be one.

So, if we want to know if God exists, we just ask if the information is distributed locally - or globally!...

We just have to look around us!  Does everywhere on Earth worship the same God - or is each area fighting over a completely different concept of God?

Again, the answer is ***BLATANTLY OBVIOUS***!...

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First question in the FAQ:
http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/atheism

&gt;What is atheism?

&gt;Atheism, from the Greek ἄθεος (atheos), literally means ""without gods,"" referring to those who rejected the existence of the Greek pantheon. In modern context, atheism can represent several different viewpoints, which are listed here in order of most consensus:

&gt;1. A lack of belief in gods. 2. A disbelief in gods. 3. A belief in no gods.

&gt;Notice that there is no inherent relationship between atheism and a religion. A person can be both atheist and religious, provided that he or she believes in a religion that does not have any deities, such as some forms of Buddhism.


Atheism has nothing to do with anything you just asked, Human61987.  Possibly you are looking for /r/philosophy?","1285894329"

I don't have junk food, eat more veggies, have complex carbs instead of refined etc. My reasons were purely for health as I was only about 5 pounds overweight. However, I lost 20 pounds overall in the process. I'm not used to hearing the word skinny and I hate it when my father kept pointing out how he can really tell how much I've lost. Regardless of size, pointing out one's weight makes them self conscious about it. 

As a side note, I severely need new clothes. Not being able to fit all of my clothes and look at my best in them...really makes me feel too skinny even though that's an absurd idea. ( I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds).  ","1285894332"

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","1. You can skip almost every cut scene, just play through slowly once and watch everything once. I mean you can skip them all the first time, but you should watch them at least once.

2. Fair enough. Every game gives a different approach to boss fights, and if you don't like this style, so be it.

3. The game is all about stealth. The controls are slow because if you turn around really fast you make a lot of noise and get caught by your enemies.

4. You're squatting/crouching too much. Just stand and lay down more often.

5. It loads between areas, every game does this. It's not like any loading screen takes more than 3 to 5 seconds.

6. Seriously? You're complaining about that? Name a single gun based game made in the last 5 years that doesn't have like a hundred guns, I mean come on! Besides, everyone I know prefers to use a different gun, I mean seriously everyone has their own preferences here.

7. Bland? What, did you want a few sex scenes or something? I'm saying that on the assumption that everything appears bland to you because you're desensitized by the lame ""action movies"" now a days that are all people having sex while everything blows up around them.

8. It's clearly explained that the transactions are handled through the Mark II (and later, the Mark III) robot that is being controlled by Otacon. The fact that it's instant is a bit magical, but would you really like to be constantly running from a boss' onslaught waiting for a little robot to drive through the snow with a few more clips to get to you?

I couldn't care less whether you vaccinate you child or not.  The choice, the risk, and the guilt are all yours to bear.  If your child's pediatrician is cool with it, then there shouldn't be any problem.

The reason vaccine makers get an (almost) free pass is because the liability is high and the profit is low, so many companies became reluctant to produce vaccines at all.  So the government (under Prez Bush and a Republican congress), gave them a gift of immunity from prosecution for complications their vaccines may cause.  

I did not support this when they did it, and I still don't support it.  I think they should be liable.  So your blanket statement that everyone wants to give them a free pass is BS.  I can assure you, everyone does not.

Yes, I have received all my vaccinations including some you've probably never heard of.  The only vaccines I have not gotten are Gardisil (too old) and Zostavax (too young).

It doesn't give you any ""free"" stats like other items when finished (such as how finished ghost marchers give you an extra 24 damage instead of the normal 18 it would add up to).  The attack speed you get from the gloves is pretty worthless early game (yes, it might let you get off an extra whiplash if you're playing as puppet or something), which is why most people opt to go for stat items to get some survivability.

You don't want to use alch bones in lane since it'll push unnecessarily (and on normal creeps it's not worth it, catapults are ok but not as good as what you can get from the jungle).  By the time the ""defense/turtle"" phase of the game begins for carries it's not worth it to buy alch bones since they take too long to pay off.  This leaves the ""optimal"" carrier for an alch bones being someone who starts off in the jungle and has terrible farming ability...and that's only if you rush it.

Maybe with carrycator making a comeback alch bones might see more play.  Since level 4 incantation has a zero second cooldown attack speed is pretty good on him.  Not to mention he's a terrible farmer (which is why vindicator always played a support role before...others can farm easier and carry harder).

That is irrelevant to the point. If all the evidence *did* point to the existence of God, and rottinguy *still* did not believe, that is not a failing of rottinguy's. 

God would have known before He created rottinguy (indeed, He would have known from before He created the universe, and this is the problem with omniscience) that nothing in the world would convince rottinguy to believe in Him. Yet God still created rottinguy, thus God created rottinguy in such a way that he was not able to worship God. 

God also knew before He created rottinguy, that the rules He would set up under His religion, would condemn rottinguy to burning in eternal hellfire (or whatever version of hell you subscribe to).

If you subscribe to the version of God that loves all of His creations (what I assume when you speak of the Christian god), why would He create a being, whom He loves unquestionably, and whose destiny was to spend eternity in hell?","1285894398"

It seems to me that the thrust of the challenge here is the position of the person asking, yes? dmmagic and others would suggest that it doesn't refer to everyone, but only those in need of necessities--the poor, or beggars. You and ixid, among others, would argue that there is no such distinction.

So, although there's a fair case to be made by looking at what the rest of the Bible says in order to put this in context (that is the core of systematic theology, as defined by Grudem), the key issue here is what Jesus meant in this instance.

I went back to the original Greek, and the word for ""ask"" here is *aiteo*. It seems there's a little bit of meaning that's lost in the English translation, as the word itself speaks to the position of the asker and the askee.

It's used a total of 71 times in the Bible (including the parallel account in Matthew 5:42), and in most cases there's an implied relationship between asker and askee.

Specifically, to quote Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words:

&gt; *Aiteo* more frequently suggests the attitude of a suppliant, the petition of one who is lesser in position than he to whom the petition is made; e.g., in the case of men in asking something from God, Mat 7:7; a child from a parent, Mat 7:9, 10; a subject from a king, Act 12:20; priests and people from Pilate, Luk 23:23 (RV, ""asking"" for AV, ""requiring""); a beggar from a passer by, Act 3:2.

So there's a shade of meaning here, where the person asking is typically a *suppliant*, a person in need, not just anybody.

The Amplified Bible (which honestly I'd never heard of), also has a footnote for this verse that suggests reading the definition for *aiteo* in Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon. Unfortunately don't have access to that, but perhaps you might if you'd like to continue pursuing this avenue.

That makes sense in the context of the rest of the passage, where Jesus is calling his followers to not merely conform to religious formalism, but live a life characterized by giving and forgiving.

Is it alright if we leave it at that? Let go of arguing this minutiae and a hypothetical situation where someone not in need asks for all of your money, and instead, Christians and atheists alike, actually do something for a real person who is less fortunate than  us, forgive a real person who's asked for forgiveness?

That's it for me now. Logging off to kiss the wife and walk the dog. Hope this helped clear things up.","1285894445"

But seriously, I'm a grad student now, so it's not like I'm making big bucks myself either. The two best tips I can offer for saving money are 1) cook most of your meals and 2) keep a manual tally of all your expenses. On the first point, cooking is a wonderful skill and you'll save a lot of money if you go to the store once a week or so to feed yourself over the next several days. Making a big pot of some sort of pasta sauce is a great way to have a ready food supply for a while. And for the second point, if you manually track your spending, you'll know exactly how much money you have left after all your monthly obligations. If you see that you have too much money, buy yourself a bit of security and set it aside for emergencies.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My house was broken into a couple of weeks ago, while I and my SO were asleep in it. She woke up when she heard noises and saw a flashlight in the living room. The man saw her come out and took off out the door. By the time I checked over the house for any other intruders and called the police, I noticed my neighbor outside with a bat. Apparently someone had been in his house also.

In all the confusion throughout the evening, my cat went missing and while waiting for the police we searched all over the inside and outside for her. She's pretty much an indoor cat, so we were afraid she had run off in the dark. Luckily she had seen the intruder and just hidden herself away in some room and refused to come out for a while.


They also broke into my car and stole a variety of items I kept there (some emergency stuff I kept handy 'just in case', a couple cds, some spare change).

Only a few items were taken, but all the more worrying for us is that they did it while we were there (we're often gone on weekends). Our security cameras were good enough to show three people were involved (and one had looked directly at the camera, so we have the feeling that it was a group of local kids that we've had issues with in the past; they're the reason we put up cameras and they know we have them).

We installed new locks, and put up magnetic alarms on the doors. The police, as you said, can't really do much. Even when I told them several obvious locations where the intruders' hand prints could be found, there wasn't much they'd do. I guess dusting for prints on a break in like this is pretty low priority.

I feel fortunate nothing worse happened for us than the scare of it (and the few missing items), and that's really too bad about your sentimental items. I think those might be the hardest to lose.
For me the worst part is knowing that somewhere, probably just a couple miles away, a couple kids broke into my house and got away with some of my things and they'll probably never have any consequences from it. That's the most angering part for both myself and my SO. 

We got a call from the local hospital's 'victim department', for got the exact name. If it's something you feel emotionally distraught over, you might call your police department or hospital and see if they have something similar. They will talk to you over the phone and have the knowledge and materials to help you deal with this.

For us the what helped the most was putting up the alarms and new locks. I know no one can get in now without my knowledge, and the noise from an alarm, we hope, is enough to scare off anyone trying this again.

I've been keeping my eyes open on craigslist for my items, but, like your PS3 / laptop / tvs, unless you have serial numbers, would be hard to tie back to your ownership. Your grandfather's knife might be another matter, though. You could place some calls around to pawn stores in the area. Most have arrangements with police departments that they'll report items that they think are stolen, so you might be able to alert them to be on the look out for something like that.

I hope sharing your experience and hearing from others with similar experiences can be of help to you. For us, that first night was the worst. Knowing that it's so unlikely that someone would come back, but worrying about every little noise outside or inside the house. But the next day or two that fear was replaced with the anger I mentioned before, the frustration that they got away free like that and there's nothing we can do except hope they come back for round 2. We're ready this time.","1285894500"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","In ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" Jonathan Haidt makes an argument that we don't actually do everything for pleasure (or even for avoidance of pain).  The idea is that sometimes we do things for more rarefied mental states that don't have such a direct sensor or emotional component such as gratification or a sense of accomplishment.  For example, when you're absorbed in a fascinating project and caught up in a state of 'flow,' you get so into the task that you forget about your emotions, and even about your 'self.'  In a sense you 'become' the task, and humans love this, but it doesn't seem pleasurable in the traditional sense.

I look forward to work everyday because of the exercise, it lets me focus on something else, and it proves in my head that I'm fine but its not always enough. Medication is always a necessity at this point. When I lack it the anxiety builds enough to trigger it, and thats when things get messy.

Heres a great example. Yesterday at work I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication. So about halfway through the night my chest basically feels like I'm on fire. Im at the point where I know enough about my condition that I knew I wasn't having a heart attack (i'm 21 years old, healthy everything) but it really FELT like one. Until I got home and took my medication, it absolutely would not go away until my anxiety did.

For me, its very severe if I don't keep my anxiety at bay. Its almost never right when I wake up but it happens most often during the day if I'm not keeping my mind and body busy. Any kind of stress builds it up. Its a constant threat and I have to use alot of self control to not go running to call 911 on the worst of days.

For me, the condition tends to run a course of about six months at a time altogether when it does flare up, and it only flares up when someone I know close to me that I love has died. The only thing I can do is seek therapy and anti-depressants to try to keep it under control, and anti-anxiety medication to allow me to function where I need to like at work. 

But the worst part is, once it starts, without medication, I can't stop it. I can control myself, and my fear, but I can't stop the feelings, and thats the worst torment of it all.","1285894539"

Besides, I don't think it's fair that some people should have to live in dire poverty forever just because they've made a few poor choices. You've had the resources to make it easier to make good choices, or recover from your bad choices. People without resources don't get second chances. And even if your parents didn't directly support you at all after graduation, they prepared you such that you could do the things you did, and there are many children whose parents don't do that.

Now, if you're suggesting that anybody who has ever made a mistake or who could have possibly made better choices should just be written off completely, then there's not going to be a whole lot of people left, mostly people with disabilities or who die as a result of their poverty before they have a chance to make any wise choices.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Well, without seeing the function, I can't imagine what problem you are having. There are a number of approaches:

* Solve for the inverse. Mathematica can do this for a large number of functions, and sometimes it helps to constrain the function specification -- for example, this function's argument can only be real (not complex):

m[h_Real] := (function definition)

This is just one example -- there are many ways to constrain the domain of the function and its behavior.

* For a truly ill-behaved function , use a root-finder approach to get the required data points for the inverse case.

* Or use NSolve[] instead of Solve[], which actually amounts to the same thing as a root-finder approach, but in a more formal way (it produces a synthetic function able to produce results for a specified argument domain).

If the only point is to draw a graph, not to produce an analytical result, the root finder (i.e. NSolve[]) approach will give you a reasonable result.

That's where you get better.  You do it - learn - then do it again - and are better for it.  Overall you're getting the shapes pretty nicely.  As your confidence continues to grow you will see this reflect in your work.  One thing to be mindful of - its common for artists (including myself sometimes) to draw the figure too straight.  If you compare the photograph with your figure carefully you'll notice that your drawing feels a little stiff.  This stems from the overall curve (LoA) being a little too straight  -  [see image](http://i.imgur.com/rYGss.jpg) .

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Is your wife on medication and being treated?  If yes, you need to get her to contact her doctor about meds.  If no, you need to get her to a psychiatrist ASAP.  

It sounds like you don't want to leave her.  If that is the case, you have to accept things like this are going to happen in your marriage.  When she's in manic mode, she is not in control.  She is very likely to do things that will damage your marriage and your lives together, such as spend all the money on a whim, have sex with other people, develop addictions.  You should also go to counseling yourself to talk to a therapist about how you should be handling her.  If you can live with all the things she might do in her manic states, and her suicidal depression in her depressive states, then stay with her.  But don't be thinking in your head this kind of stuff won't happen.  After all, it already has.

Have you talked to your wife?  I think you need to tell her you know what's up.  If she is sorry for what she did, try to use this to convince her to seek treatment.

Note that they don't eat nutrient-poor faeces, only the stuff that needs another go.

Most animals are foregut fermenters, so they absorb their nutrients within the stomach, and don't have the nutritional need to eat waste products again.

Generally, a foregut fermenting animal eating faeces is either behaviorally or nutritionally afflicted, and it's a sign for concern (save for dogs eating cat poo, which appears to be a canine delicacy).","1285894647"

"science","t5_mouw","Psychology is a relatively young science, which stemmed from a very unscientific background (phrenology, Lambroso's Positivist Criminology, even Freud's interpretations of dreams and behaviors). There is still a lot of pseudoscience being done under the guise of 'psychology', but I believe that it can be as close to a true science as is possible under the conditions. Peer-reviewed journals and the upcoming DSM-V show the scientific method in the truest possible form. When dealing in human behavior, you'll never have the accuracy of mathematics, a system we humans designed to work. But there are works done in psychology that attempt to take out any confounding variables and test for actual statistical significance. To me, the biggest threat to psychology as a 'science' are pop-culture icons that you may find on Oprah, spewing new-age garbage and MSM hand-picking results from a small-sample study and sensationalizing or exaggerating the implications. Even without a psych degree, I think the average redditor can see the difference.","1285894669"

My example doesn't really make great use of it, but I think we can agree that poetry is most often consumed on the page, therefore a device that changes the way a poem looks on a page is valid. It can be used to accentuate words, lines, even entire stanzas, similar to line breaks. It can change the flow of a poem. Of course, the actual words and how they work together are much more important. 

It's like a fine adjustment for the author, it might not make a big difference to the 'meaning' but it still makes one. Some don't use it, some do. Will Smith doesn't cuss in his rap, Eminem does and they both suck.","1285894677"

Please provide more information.""  There is no arrogance in asking for information instead of relying on just the words of brilliant people.

Yes the information is vast, and yes the people who study it are experts and rightfully so.  I am trying to drive the point that an Appeal to Authority fallacy is the belief that a fact should be believed on **just** the Authorities word.  This is never the case.  Especially in the scientific community.  Stephen Hawking might make an outstanding announcement tomorrow, but unless he actually has the work and the equations to back it up and show it, no one would pay attention.  Do you think if tomorrow Mr. Hawking claimed to have proved the Riemann Hypothesis that no one would ask for his work that would back this up?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","actually, the church i went to never handed out pink glasses.

the sacrifice of isaac is not reprehensible.  isaac didn't die.  the whole story is a set up.  when i read that story, the first question that comes to mind after abraham gets the command to sacrifice isaac is ""why doesn't abraham question the command?""  the simple answer is that it was an accepted practice to sacrifice your firstborn on an altar.  the story of the sacrifice of isaac is a great story because it shows us for the first time a God who is different from teh others.  a God who provides the sacrifice (the ram caught in the thicket) instead of asking more and more of us (like our firstborn).

and the story of job is not a true story (not that i think you thought it was).  it is a polemic against the black-and-white theology of 1st and 2nd kings, chronicles, and samuel.  in those books, it's always ""so-and-so does good, and God rewards him,"" or ""so-and-so sins, so God punishes them.""  job is simply a book that says ""shit happens.""  that's the big picture message from job.

so tell me how a message that has taught me to love others even when it hurts (i am a strict pacifist), to give when i have little (i am a firefighter who does not make much money but regularly donates money and time to charities, most of which have nothing to do with the church or religion), and to help when it is inconvenient (i am the guy that stops on the side of the road to help you when you've got a flat) is reprehensible.

don't tell me we can do much better without that book.  bad people do bad things for bad reasons.  a book that tells everyone to love their neighbor as themselves is not the problem.  people who read that book and decide that bombing abortion clinics is ok are the problem.  a book that specifically states ""they will know you follow Me by the way you love one another"" is not the problem.  people who read it and then decide that the beliefs in the book allow them to oppress and abuse are the problem.

don't blame the bible for bad people.  to think that the message of the bible is an overall negative one is to show a very small understanding of its message in relation to its time.","1285894682"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It really depends on what kind of Buddhism you're talking about. I'm pretty sure that one of the Bodhisattva vows is to refrain from eating meat. It's true that Theravada monks are not expected to refrain from meat, but like I mentioned before, Buddha's specific teaching in the Pali Cannon (the Theravada scriptures) was to not eat meat that was killed for you. However, Mahayana monks have further teachings from Shakyamuni Buddha (the historical Buddha) as well as additional Buddhas that have different teachings about eating meat.

Note: The goal of becoming a Bodhisattva is a bit different than the goal of becoming enlightened. To summarize it in a very crude manner, to become a Bodhisattva one must cultivate much more compassion than is required than for becoming an Arhat. There is also much more emphasis on purity, so not eating meat makes sense.","1285894684"

since deleting, i've only heard from 1/4 of the people i was connected to! that says a lot for the quality of friendship the service enables. it gives a false sense of community and makes you feel a lot more special than what the rest of the world actually thinks. in that way it is awfully reminiscent of the early myspace days when hordes of emo teenagers accrued massive amounts of friends in their quest to rid their lives of loneliness...","1285894719"

To make a long story short, after many depressing travels of this nature, I found the girl of my (literal) dreams, readying a ship to set sail across an icy sea.  Let us call her Elizabeth.  ""Elizabeth,"" I thought, ""in a lucid dream!  I can control this dream, if I so wish--we can be together!""  I stepped onto the deck with my arms outstretched...she turned towards me...smiled...but the smile was a sad one.  In her hands she held a mooring line which she was in the process of casting off.

""I'm afraid dreams don't work that way, Mori,"" she said (she didn't call me Mori, but a pet name of that sort).  ""Not even lucid dreams.  But you can sail with us if you wish.""  She handed me the line and I cast it off, and then I sailed into a deeper, dreamless sleep.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","This will evidently be lost in the wave of inane comments. I just want to give my two bits.

I am in university and do not have a facebook, nor have had one during my time here. I think people wanting to network and share using facebook are fine, and they can do what they want - facebook was created to provide a good service for people who wanted to remain very socially connected. However, I am just not into it. There are a few random reasons, mostly involving my lack of desire to be apart of the big, open, and loud community that facebook is, and my wish to remain private on the internet. 

I admit I miss out on a lot because I don't use facebook. That said, my social life is doing fine and I am satisfied with the outcome. People who don't wish to associate with me because I won't do networking don't have to. There are many great and kind individuals who understand and respect my decision, and I appreciate that.

Thus, I want to take a moment out to say to the people who are high-fiving each other for not having a facebook: stop being douchebags. It is low and unecessary. Let's have some respect for each other and our choices. ","1285894732"

"politics","t5_2cneq","That was my initial reaction too.  Having said that the article's title might have been better worded as 'a national private-debt moratorium'.    It's still just as much a nightmare scenario though.  Assuming the economic nuke button of freezing bonds is not pressed and that it's just *'no payments on your mortgage, your credit cards, your car loan'* then it's still going to flatline the economy; banks, manufacturing, industry.  Everything.

Okay so John Smith doesn't have to pay his car loan for the next 90 days.  Pete Jones however can't get a car loan either.  Even if the loan agency can survive a 90 day moratorium, and many won't, they're only going to jack up their premiums.  The car manufacturers will need another bailout!  And then what about the prime rate?  Damn, the banks are gonna crash again as their liquidity sucks up....

...*and then I noticed it.  None of this makes any sense when you're crawling by your nails out of depression dragging the economy behind you having already bailed it out to the tune of billions, trillions even.  Fair enough if major institutions are already failing and you're at the bottom of the barrel.  So I checked the submission again:*

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","Hey... not necessarily - there are two concers, though:

1) If you replace your current kernel you'll likely need to rebuild the radeon drivers like you're doing right now. This is something that's easy to forget, especially if you're running a stock kernel.

2) this radeon module might depend on other modules (such as fb), so if you're compiling your own kernel, building *everything* as a module will increase your odds of not running into this problem. Of course, the documentation for the driver should tell you what the requirements are; so, in an ideal world, following those instructions to the letter will increase happiness.

I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but, now that I look at your log (grep for ""EE"") that could be exactly what's happenning here. At line 110: ""[  1053.102] (EE) Failed to load module ""fbdev"" (module does not exist, 0)"". I could be misinterpreting that, but your radeon driver might be dependent on the fbdev driver.

Also, those warnings after the driver is loaded ""(WW) RADEON(0): Failed to read PCI ROM!"" might be part of the problem too... I'd google that if building the fbdev module doesn't fix it for ya.","1285894739"

Imagine that your TV emits 100 units of sound. Typically, in a TV show, these sound units are allocated across the sound spectrum. In a commercial, the sound units are concentrated under the human speaking range which our brains are wired to hear more loudly/clearly(?).

In my head, I'm imaging the sound emitted during a TV show to form a normal bell curve (x axis is sound frequency). During an ad, the curve has a higher curtosis and skewness over human vocal frequencies and is thus perceived as louder even though the total units of sound haven't changed.

As an ex wal-mart employee I am by no means a wal-mart sympathizer, however, I will point out that when you rip off wal-mart, you are in essence ripping off every employee of that store. Every hourly associate is given a quarterly bonus based on shrink and profit, and although because it is percentage based, your small rip off may not even change that number, but everyone with the mentality that is okay to rip off wal-mart does. I've seen bonuses as low as $0 (not in my store) and as high as $600+ (Directly depending on store performance) and although an extra $600 per quarter may not sound like much, to that single mom that is only working a shitty retail job because she can't find better work in this economy, it's huge. And to everyone that says ""wal-mart could give bonuses if they wanted"" I'm sure they could, but everyone knows how businesses work, they aren't going to give good bonuses to stores that perform shitty.

Also, the point of electives is to be able to pick and choose so you can gain some knowledge that is outside of the core curriculum.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Wow, I am simply shocked that this post comes from someone claiming to be an attorney because this is not only a total abuse of the attorney complaint system, it probably borders on libel and abuse of process.  Again, for someone claiming to be an attorney, the OP's letter lacks any foundation whatsoever in both law and fact.

First, most state bar organizations only accept complaints from clients of the lawyer being investigated.  I can guarantee that letters sent en masse, from people unrelated to a representation, especially from out of the state, will be summarily ignored.  

Second, let's look at the substance of a complaint, as provided by the Kansas State Bar:

&gt;You should write (preferably type) a detailed statement of the facts that cause you to believe a lawyer has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. Be sure to send copies of any documents that support your allegations. You may find it convenient to seek the assistance of a lawyer in gathering and analyzing your facts and deciding whether they merit the submission of a complaint. Please provide home addresses and phone numbers of persons who can support your allegations.

In the OP's letter, I see no facts whatsoever aside from a few completely unsubstantiated claims.  There are no specific names (naming everyone doesn't count), there are no specific dates or conduct mentioned.  And aside from naked allegations. I also don't see any reference to any supporting documents or evidence.  Nor do I see a list of addresses and phone numbers to anybody who can support the allegations.  Given the near total lack of substance, the complaint, even if it did come from a dissatisfied client, would be facially invalid.  In court, this type of thing wouldn't even constitute notice pleading.  At the discplinary stage, it will carry even less weight.

Now, let's look at what little substance there is.  There's a claim of a violation of the catch-all provision, Rule 8.4(a) and (g).  

&gt;It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: 
(a) Violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another; 
or 
(g) engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.

As for (a), the OP has provided zero evidence and zero explanation as to what other Rules any of the mentioned attorneys violated.  In fact, the OP's letter is written in terms of the firm counseling the client to do something.  The word ""another"" in part (a) simply cannot encompass a client's actions because a client is not bound by the Rules of Professional Responsibility, which only govern attorney actions.  

As for (g), again there is not even a shred of evidence or explanation beyond a bare allegation.  Nothing in Comment 2 to the Rule applies here.  Not surprisingly, it isn't a crime to go out and protest, or to counsel another to go out and protest, regardless of intent.

&gt;I just find attorneys who protest funerals in this manner as unfit to have a license. 

Which is wholly evident from the fact that, despite being an admitted attorney, you've let your personal emotions cloud your ability to read the actual Rules.  In fact, perhaps you should go back and read Rule 1.2:  ""(b) A lawyer's representation of a client, including representation by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client's political, economic, social or moral views or activities.""

The fact that you're counseling others to abuse the disciplinary process by flooding the professional responsibility office with baseless letters, possibly delaying real cases involving real Kansas clients with real problems, displays a much greater and flagrant disregard for the law and the system of professional responsibility than anything you allege in your letter.  In other words, you should be ashamed of yourself.  It's not this firm that disgraces attorneys names.  They're at least protecting First Amendment rights.  It's people like you who disgrace it with petty nonsense and frivolous claims like this.  If you weren't anonymous, a call to your bar would be in order much more than it is here.","1285894812"

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","The single most important thing is being consistent with your actions when you met her.  
PUA techniques teach you how to *appear* interesting, cool, sexually attractive, etc.  Once you get a girl hooked and you find yourself in a LTR you must retain that image.  She fell for you because of these things, after all.  That means you have to *be* interesting, cool, sexually attractive, etc.

Remaining interesting is, IMO, involves at least two things: doing cool shit *with* her and doing cool shit *without* her.  The former is good for obvious reasons, while the latter is good as it keeps conversation interesting, makes her wish she was there, etc.

Being confident in a LTR is a little trickier.  Some things I've found:

* You don't *need* her opinion on things, but you'll certainly consider it

* Don't be ashamed of your past.  Part of who you are is what you were, so be confident in yourself when those deep conversations come along.

* Don't be clingy.  Part of being confident in yourself is *knowing* that she's yours and letting her do her own thing too.  She'll be back because she likes *you*.

Lastly, remain social!  You probably met her because you were chatting up everyone in the bar.  You don't need to flirt with girls, but a friendly reminder to her that you are a prize possession is good for a couple reasons.  First, it makes her feel good.

   * ""Ideas came teeming out of the teenagers[]""

Could you point me to the exact point of the article where it ""makes it seem like she is a coder that made something"", or acts ""like she is an expert"", please? Of course, she *is* a coder because she is admittedly learning Python, but whether she coded a prototype of the GovSpark site (or anything related) during the hackfest is not relevant at all.

The article was about two things: a teenager's idea that the government saw fit enough to act on, and a general commentary about the nature of the compsci/maths/statistics and its perceived stigmas etc.

I would be flabbergasted if your bizarre reading would be supported by the ""majority"" of this thread's commenters, as you claim. When I last checked (and admittedly it was some hours ago), there were about three commenters who were spewing out this strange kind of misinterpretation and outright hate.

For some reason, you guys feel that your coder ego has been touched in a very special and improper way. Nobody asked you to prove anything - how is it relevant at all that some buddy of yours did some fancy HTML generation eight years ago, or that you personally made this big-time web site when you were 16, 17, 18, ...?

I would call your attitude towards your fellow coders as ""cannibalizing"": if anyone achieves anything that could be deemed as ""neat"""", you excite yourself into a fit of primitive rage and go on citing *non sequiturs* and spewing garbage about the person not meeting some imaginary criteria you've created.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","A couple quick points, though I think we're starting to agree with each other on multiple levels of this thing...

* Agreed, generalizing is bad.
* Agreed, this is debatable either way.
* I took issue with you calling it out as knee-jerk, while your OP wasn't much more than knee-jerk in and of itself; imho.

&gt;I'm frankly shocked that you've never seen anything between relationships that end with cheating and relationships that are completely open.

I didn't mean to insinuate I hadn't seen other types of relationships out in the wild (I have, though they aren't actually all that common now that I pause to think about it...), but more that the general advice given is to one extreme or the other. [Such as the first post in this thread ;) ]

That said, I think you read the first post a bit differently than I. I can see how you'd think that he was saying 'she will definitely cheat again' (and taken 100% literally that *is* what he said), but I chose to take it more as the 'common' advice given; and you can't necessarily fault someone for that. Like I said before (and you have), the circumstances are what differentiate good advice from general advice. Generally speaking, reddit tends to say 'Once a cheater always a cheater', or 'Forget monogamous, make it an open relationship'. I don't see that changing, we're only people after all. Well, some of us are monkeys but that's besides the point... ;)","1285894868"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Thank you. That was a very mature, intelligent and well thought out answer. That's the sort of thing we can work with. I appreciate the time and effort it must have taken.

Now then, let's look at where we agree and disagree. I have no problem with dressing your children in pretty cloths. I have no problem with doing your child's hair. I agree combing is a generally a bad idea, because it is often painful.

There are really two points where we disagree. 

The first, and most basic has to do with what we feel is inappropriate. Your posts suggest that you are against a child doing something if it is **sexy**. I am against a child doing something if it is **sexual**. 

Someone can do something **sexual** without being **sexy**. Your 700 pounder, by way of example, could do anything she likes, including **sexual** acts like dancing around nude, and there still wouldn't be very many guys that found it **sexy**. Being **sexy** is not a necessary condition for doing something **sexual**.

So, to the point, I think makeup and revealing clothing are **sexual** things. I believe they are inappropriate for children, regardless of who, if anyone, thinks it is **sexy**. Your posts indicate that you feel it is acceptable because it is not **sexy** even if it is **sexual**.

The second point of contention appears to be our perception of certain activities such as changing cloths, brushing teeth, brushing hair, and bathing. I do not consider them **sexual** activities. They may, secondarily, affect sexual attractiveness but they are primarily hygiene and health related. There is a very great difference between a clean and neatly groomed child, and those depicted in the relevant link.

One of my big rules is that I never talk about my story ideas to anyone, even myself.  For me, each story comes with a certain amount of energy and interest.  Talking about the story -- or writing it out -- uses up a certain amount of that energy and interest.  If I elaborate it too far, I feel as though the work is already done, and I have little motivation for moving forward.

If I'm not interested in my story, why should anyone else be?  I want to see what's going to happen next, just as much as the reader.  If I reach a point where I feel like the story has lost its energy, I backtrack and try to find a new way of looking at the situation, to surprise myself.

Okay, so there's a certain amount of bullshit in this.  Of course, on some level I know what's going to happen.  On some level I know who my characters are and where they're heading.  But bringing that knowledge to the top level of consciousness is all part of the fun.

Like everything else in her miserable life, the damn dishwasher hadn't shown up that morning, leaving her to pick up the slack again, and on a launch day.  She looked up from the crusted egg yolks and dried corned beef hash to see who had come in and her breath caught in her throat as she ducked behind the counter.

It was him!  David...  Something.  She hates the way he makes her feel as he slides into a booth each morning for breakfast.  The way he looks at her makes her feel like someone is dragging a cold, raw steak over he bare flesh, his cold eyes slide over her as he drags his tongue over his dry lips, pausing as they pass over her breasts.  He rarely speaks to anyone and the rumors about him have been circulating around the beach for quite some time.  Rumors about experiments the government performed on him under the guise of ""UFO Research""...

David let the door close behind him and stood just inside while his eyes adjusted.  Specks of dust floated in the late morning sun and the diner smelled of warm vinyl and slightly sour milk.  He caught the movement of Charal ducking down as he walked in and he knew he disgusted her, but he no longer cared because today things would start to change, they just didn't know it yet.

He slid onto one of the stools and took off his backpack, gently setting it on the floor.  The obese lunch waitress pointed at the coffee and he nodded, turning his cup over.  He had never been in the diner this late before, in this light it looked tired, and filmy.

Soon, the waitress heard the screams coming from the street and noticed the thin smoke in the air.

""Wonder what's going on out there?"", she asked, walking to the window.

""Must be a fire or something...""

Charal came out from the kitchen and joined her, forgetting about David for a moment.

""Where are the screams coming from?  I don't see anyone on the street.""

Her eyes widened as the little boy stumbled around the corner, his skin was blistered and blood ran freely from his eyes and nose.  He fell to the sidewalk and peeled back the skin on his arm staining the ground as it puddled.  They watched as he died, it was the last thing either of them saw.

David put the pistol back into his backpack and moved over to where Charal had fallen.  He listened to the screams die out as the gas dissipated.  The bullet had torn through her face, but she was still beautiful to him and he still loved her for what she had been.

His cold eyes slid down her slack body and his tongue dragged across his dry lips...","1285894911"

As for the crop factor, with the advent of crop bodies have come a whole slew of new lenses that counter for it. They recede farther back into the camera body (EF-S lenses), project a smaller image circle (for a smaller sensor) and have wider focal lengths. Often times, if there's a regular (non-crop) lens available, there's a matching or similar focal length equivalent available in a crop-oriented lens. Don't worry so much about it; some of the EF-S lenses that Canon makes are *close* to being on par with L lenses, but they can't call them ""L"" lenses if they're not a regular EF lens.","1285894913"

"hardware","t5_2qh18","Well a faulty power supply is the source for 90% of these issues, there is also the possibility, it could be related to a dead/dying CMOS battery.

If it is under-voltage, you get weird things happening to discreet components when it is not within the threshold of a high or low. Leaving your computer sit will seem to relieve these problems, and may get you to boot up. But once you restart you will have the same problems as before. Where as a dying power supply will not cause you problems while running. A dying power supply will also be a great risk to your good components, bricking them as it runs out of steam.

A tell tale sign would be if your clock has reset (If you don't use a time server, which you probably do). Regardless you should bench test the supply with a volt meter (If you are competent), or replace it and the battery out of caution.

Also he did pan toy story 3, the quote I used, was the one he used as a hook to make people read his review. He also essentially calls its fans idiots
&gt;The Toy Story franchise isn’t for children and adults, it’s for non-thinking children and adults.
something he tends to do with most movies he doesn't like.

Again maybe its a personal thing... but he really bugs me, yes I agree we should be critical but in all honesty you can find something wrong with every movie, and something good about it as well, and with Armond , again could be a personal thing, but it always appears he has his mind made up befor watching the film and will thus either focus on its negative or positive aspects.

Just from the steak.  Mash potatoes?  2 cans of coke?  Your now sporting something close to 60% of your daily intake, just from one meal.   

One of the biggest ""Gotchas"" in calories is dressing.    For example, regularly get big salad which is listed as 300 calories for the whole thing.  W/dressing it is 600.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I think the idea is that it's never too late to turn it around; Because through Jesus, every soul can find salvation. So, when you hit rock bottom and you have a path evil smoldering behind you, where conventional wisdom is that your beyond saving, Christianity says it's time to come home.

Maybe the 11th hour save as a legitimate option might be a bad loop hole. But, if my history is correct, the idea is more about the individual playing the central role in salvation. the general law of the land during Jesus' day was that these matters were left up to the religious establishment. You had to play ball with them to find a path to salvation. This is the way they wanted it, as it availed to them a shit ton of power over most everyone. They could literally dangle your everlasting soul over your head.

With Christianity, at least in principal, as long as you truly repent for your sins, you're golden. Of course, God gets to make the final judgement at the end of time (usually where it loses me too), and presumably it all either ends or starts again at the great creators whim. But yeah, it's all about not having to be validated by anyone. As long as you can come to terms with your creator, your soul is safe.

He is not naming himself. His name is in your control. It will be your fault if he is teased. You named him a name other 8 year old's will laugh at. Your boy will feel out of place. He will feel different than his peers. He will feel lower than his peers.

It is not the fault of the other kids or their parents. 8 year olds will be 8 year olds, no matter how well behaved they are or how New-Age and perfect a school you send him to. I mean sure, it could be Billy's fault that he is teasing your son. What are you going to do about it though, go talk to Billy on behalf of your son? Billy's parents? Are you kidding me? That's worse than naming your son Ashley. Now he's the kid that's named Ashley whose dad has to stand up for him because he can't do it himself.

Sure, you can tell your kid to stand up for himself. But what if he can't? You said you were small as a child. Do you think your child will also be small? What if he is? Then he's that small little runt named Ashley. Please don't do this to your son.

As a father you're supposed to set everything up for your son so that he can succeed. Setting him up for hardship is the opposite of what you should do. Raising a child is not an experiment, it's your god damn son. Give him the tools to succeed, not to fail.

Further, how do you think this will affect your relationship with your son? In his eyes, you gave him the name that's causing him so much strife. He'll be angry he's getting teased. He'll direct the anger. Either at you, or at the asshole Billy. But again, what if he's small or non-confrontational? That means you buddy. There will be a divide between you and your son, and it will start with naming him Ashley.

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","""We're pretty sure he suffers from borderline personality disorder, and if that is the case, the heroin is putting a stop to his growth and working on managing that because it is providing a temporary fix.""

1.  You aren't a psychologist.

2.  Don't try and ""fix"" your boyfriend... if you don't like him for who he *is*, you shouldn't be with him in the first place.  Don't make his changing a condition of your love.. because he is probably just fine with the way he is.

3.  It sounds like he has a relationship problem... not a drug problem.  

Unless he has lost his job, place to live, and is massively failing in most aspects of his life as a result of his addiction... he probably isn't a junky.  Most heroin users aren't horrible hell-bound people that fail at everything in life and end up sucking large amounts of cock to feed their addiction.  Though, I understand why you may have massive mis-conceptions regarding the drug.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","* Early game team fight bot is not only fun but can also be game changing.  Its important to know, however, when to not take part in it.  Make sure you get the first few hits on someone, try poking the bushes if you can, and don't go in there if one of your teammates is lagging behind.  Also, be careful if they all have ghost, they could be waiting in the bushes for you even if you are super quick.  When you get a kill, go back and spend the money on boots and a ward.

* Always have a ward at the lizard.  This will prevent ganks and allow someone to solo push bottom without fear of death.  This will also sometimes set up a great gank when you see someone traveling through mid alone.  Sometimes investing a little extra into an invisibility ward will allow you to take out any ward they place there.

* Warding just above the dragon is useful as well, but not as critical as warding lizard.  Especially useful if they have someone who frequently jungles.  Catching them trying to kill dragon early on can lead to an easy ace.

* Being able to survive a gank is critical.  This means that beefier/more mobile champions are nice.  This is why Mundo is god tier on TT even though he sucks on SR.

* Each person on a team must be able to do significant damage and survive a team fight.  Support characters and squishy DPS champs are not as useful.  Most mages are also less useful, unless you can end the game early enough.  Vlad is the exception.  Tanks that deal low damage can end up being useless, so off tanks are better.  Also, champions with skill shots are very useful, as they can check bushes and hit people through walls.

* You have to find a balance between moving together and farming.  Too much sticking around each other and you may find your team under leveled.  Too much farming and you may find yourself down a tower or ganked frequently.

* Having at least one ignite and exhaust on a team is necessary.  Ignite can shut down Mundo who, coming from someone who mains Mundo on TT, can be pretty unstoppable if not ignited during his ult.  Exhaust will shut down auto attackers like olaf, jax, and trynd, who are very common on TT.  I have found success with heal, as it can really change the outcome of the initial teamfight and all team fights there after.  Obviously ghost and flash are fantastic.

* If someone is getting owned top switch with them asap.  The team member from that lane should be the most capable of dealing damage and ganking.

* While TF is honestly not that great, he can be a great counter to shaco, who is effing annoying on TT and used to be in every freaking TT game I played :/

&gt;Unfiltered, pasteurized honey is widely believed to alleviate allergies, though neither commercially filtered nor raw honey was shown to be more effective than placebo in a controlled study of 36 participants with ocular allergies.[63] Nearly 1 in 3 of the volunteers dropped out of the study because they couldn’t tolerate eating one tablespoon of honey every day due to the overly sweet taste.[64] The official conclusion: ""This study does not confirm the widely held belief that honey relieves the symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis."" A more recent study has shown pollen collected by bees to exert an anti allergenic effect, mediated by an inhibition of IgE immunoglobulin binding to mast cells. This inhibited mast cell degranulation and thus reduced allergic reaction.[65] The risk of experiencing anaphylaxis as an immune system reaction may outweigh any potential allergy relief.[66]

To start off, you need to beat the men into submission, if you go after the women first it will backfire. 

Mathew 1:7 is a nice start, 
Judge not lest ye be judged.

they will probably quote: 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.'
(Leviticus 18:22)
or 
'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have
done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will
be on their own heads.' (Leviticus 20:13)
then probably something about Sodom and Gomorrah...

the simple answer for that is Romans 2:23
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God

problem is you have to fight them with love not hate. If you hate back they think their doing what the devil hate, and that's why you're so enraged. We must take on their other demonic moniker. The devil knows the bible so well it could persuade even the most pious of them with the words of their god.

Listen to 1000+ diamond players moan about how terrible they or their opponents are (oh and FYI they are 1000+ point diamond, did you know that?)

Also, you have major sampling bias. For example, sometimes I play great, sometimes I play terrible--it depends on my frame of mind and maybe I'm trying out a new strategy. If you catch me after a few beers, when I really should stop playing 1v1 ladder, you might wonder why the hell you were matched against me.","1285895220"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Ha! I just recently had this talk with my boyfriend (of almost 2 years). Basically, we both agreed that we don't want it to get less exciting. The thing of it is though, even once you're past that 'Mystery' stage, where you're still working out who exactly that other person is, there comes a different *kind* of excitement. Instead of that heart-in-your-throat, heady feeling of discovering someone you are crazy about, you get a sort of contented, warm feeling whenever you poke fun of that other person, or throw socks at them when you're both doing laundry, or just sitting around watching TV in your underwear. However, if you don't continue to try to progress the relationship to new heights - keep things varied and interesting - you will fall into that trap. Don't worry though, it's not the end of the world. 

Go on a road trip together, make a fire in the backyard and roast marshmallows, build a fort, go skydiving. Hell, even just a normal dinner-and-a-movie date can suffice, as many couples stop going out on true *dates* after a while, which is a bit absurd (just make sure it's a new, exciting place). After all, the point of a relationship is to share things and experiences with each other and grow together as lovers, confidantes, best friends... not sit around and mope and wish that the 'spark' was still there. It's still there, just more of a candle flame. 

Point is, if you two really love each other and want to be together, you can make things exciting. Relationships are dynamic. My man and I had a brief period of stagnation, but after we had a really nice talk about it, things have never been better... and I think it's safe to say that I've never loved him more. And our sex, which was always great, is even better. It makes me super excited for the future with him. 

TL;DR: Relationships change and move and evolve with time. Go with the flow, have fun, and create new experiences together. ","1285895230"

I have a feeling you work at a Chili's type restaurant. 

How do you feel about phoning in a to-go order at a sandwich shop?  Do you tip the sandwich guy?  I'm guessing as a waitress, you do.  But as a guy just buying a sandwich or picking up a pizza instead of having it delivered; why tip??  

There are special circumstances, but 98% of the time, it's a no tip (no offense).  I tip for service, not the time it makes to prepare and package food.  Any smart business owner should already have that overhead factored in to the price of the product.  It's not the consumers responsibility to ensure that you have a fair 'non tip' wage.

That being said, I don't know that many people just out of college that are doing very well on their own, but most don’t really do that awesome the first 5 years out of college... No matter the time period.  Fuck…. I took a pay CUT from bartending to my first ‘professional’ job.  

I was far from privileged and have spent a great deal of time in the real world.  Well, I guess I was privileged.  In the sense that I had a mother and extended family that cared about me, I was very privileged.  I was privileged that my mom decided to turn the kitchen into a makeshift bedroom so I would have one.  I was not spoiled or financially privileged, but plenty of people had it far worse.

Possibly, the exact opposite is true and it was you who was privileged and really don’t know what “need” vs. “want” is.  I have seen enough of the world to understand that having it rough for most Americans is ungodly wealthy to much of the world.

Somewhere in there I turned 18 and went into the real world.  I fucked up big time. I was desperately broke at one point and could not afford the basement apartment I shared with someone else.  Then, I realized what I was doing wrong and adapted, volunteered to go to a war zone, got my degree, took a pay CUT to get in the business I am in.  Then, I did anything legal to get a bit ahead.

From 2000-2008, I spent that time desperately paying off shit (prior to 2000 I was in financial hurtbag) and becoming one of the tightest mother fuckers I know.  Sure, I have some nice things, but I didn’t buy them with a Best Buy credit card… if I didn’t have the money I couldn’t afford it.  While the people around me buy nicer cars, boats, toys….. I was scavenging to get ahead.  Bought a home and got married to a gal that thinks similarly.  The home we bought (about 6 years ago) was on the very low end of what was available and we worked our asses off to pay that shit down.

Today, my bills, with food, are about $1500/month.  There is a pretty good chance that you make more than me, but there is a very small chance that your bills are less than mine.  I know that if I get fired (which could happen) or my wife does… we could go work at McDonalds or Walmart and make ends meet and not even dip into the emergency funds.

Today, they give me credit cards again except this time I only use them to take money from the man through special programs.  I will take out loans, but only if it is financially smart.

I understand that there are a lot of people out there suffering and hurting…. And I don’t mind paying taxes to fund the food stamps, unemployment etc.  No, I don't think any segment has a ""right"" to have thier lives funded, but we should do the right thing as a nation. To me, the day where we have the capability, but don’t take care of the our elderly, our handicapped, our children or anybody else who CANNOT take care of themselves… is the day America has failed.

Basically all you need to do is glue scraps together (face to face or side to side), then clamp them together with long bar clamps. After the block is glued together, cut it to size with whatever saw is available, then send it through an industrial planer to make the top and bottom faces uniform. 

Sand the board with progressively finer grades, then brush on a coat of mineral oil. Wipe off the excess mineral oil, let it dry and then you got yourself a cutting board. It will last forever and you can easily refinish it by a quick sanding and re-oiling.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I made my comment because several Acorn employees said that O'Keefe and Giles were really bad actors.  One Acorn employee was so put off by the bullshit O'Keefe was flinging, that she decided to fling her own BS in return.  She ""confessed"" to murdering her husband (who's still alive, of course).  O'Keefe twisted the context of her remarks, and FoxNews bought it.  

The media also bought O'Keefe's version of events in a California office in which an Acorn employee ""goes along"" with O'Keefe's illegal traffiking scheme.  In reality, the Acorn guy was just playing it cool; he called the police as soon as O'Keefe left his office.

I hadn't seen this Baltimore transcript before, it does read as if these particular Acorn workers were sucked in.  I actually feel bad for these employees.  O'Keefe is giving them Too Much Information (tm), blurting out the most self-incriminating things he can think of.  The Acorn women probably felt about the same way you'd feel if your best friend came to you and told you he'd murdered someone.  You know the Acorn women were hoping O'Keefe would just shut the hell up.  

If that Baltimore Acorn employee didn't report the suspected traffiking of underage girls, then she's morally wrong - *very* wrong - and she's a participant in a crime.  But the second woman - the tax preparer - was simply trying serve her clients in a professional manner.  That is, bring them into compliance with tax law while respecting their privacy.  (O'Keefe had implied prostitution but hadn't mentioned traffiking at that point, IIRC).

I still maintain that the media failed Acorn.  Despite what some employee in Baltimore may have done, Acorn was not a corrupt organization.  The media painted it as one.","1285895293"

"Wordpress","t5_2qhjq","My suggestion is to turn your exceprts.php into a page template by adding the template tag to the top followed by a query_posts() to fill the global query with what would normally be on the homepage:

    &lt;?php
    /**
     * Template Name: Home Excerpts
     */
    query_posts();
    //rest of your excerpt code

Then create a page though the admin called home and set the template to the Home Excerpts template.  Once you've done that, edit your permalink structure to have whatever you want to be the url to secondary homepage to be as the ""front"" of the structure.  IE, if you want the full standard blog loop to be at mysite.com/blog/ change your permalink structure to /blog/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/ or whatever structure you want beyond the /blog/.  Now you'll need to create a placeholder page called blog.  You don't need any content in it and it can leave the default page template, it won't be used.  The next step is to go into the reading settings in the admin.  Set the front page to display a static page and set the front page to the home excerpt page you made.  Then set the posts page to the /blog/ page you made.  That should do it.

It's typical for the opcode to be encoded in the first byte of an instruction, followed by either the arguments themselves, or by references to the registers to use to find the arguments. 

Since instruction bits are a relatively scarce resource, typically as many bits as possible are used to encode some meaning. So you'll often see that the opcode takes up a variable number of bits in the initial byte, and that the rest of the bits are used for something else.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Good post. I'm completely happy with XP Pro and have no desire to upgrade, though I know its inevitable. But I'm still getting great mileage out of XP, and until I'm convinced that I'll be significantly better off with a new OS, I'll probably keep using it. I'm lucky I was able to get a good laptop before they switched to Vista. XP simply works and I don't foresee tiring of the simple, uncluttered, surprisingly customizable UI and the wide selection of great software available (which makes up for the generally sub-par bundled software, like WMP as you mentioned).

I installed Ubuntu on a partition just to try it out - and to get that nice ""new"" computer feeling. There's a lot of things I love about Ubuntu but XP is just stable and versatile enough that I don't need it. Plus I do a fair amount of audio production/editing; Linux doesn't yet offer the type of pro-audio software I need and lacks support for the interfaces I use. Hopefully this changes soon because I do love the freedom, customization and the learning experience Linux provides. Plus it's damn fast. But after spending way too much time trying to change some simple UI stuff and find a music player I liked, I got pretty frustrated. (I'm no computer wiz and constantly had to search forums for advice on pretty basic stuff.) My dad, however, has used Linux almost exclusively for years and gets a lot of work done with it. But he's also much smarter and more patient than me.

Try Ubuntu, it's a fun intro to Linux and is really not difficult to get started. You can download and burn the .iso and boot from the CD try it out (it will run slow though since it's reading from the disc). You'll be able to browse the web and do most any basic task right out of the box, and the software repository/installation system is excellent. Plus, sometimes it's just nice to have a change.

Just writing this has me wanting to partition again... If I had a bigger hard drive I'd still have Ubuntu installed. It's useful to have a backup OS to access my data (this has saved my ass in the past.)

On a side note, if you're interested in trying a new music player besides winamp, check out atunes, it's my personal favorite for FLAC and Ogg, supports external music players, and is great for ripping and tagging. It runs on Java and doesn't hog much memory.

Then, the bomb was dropped and all sorts of crazy went everywhere. Even if I did have mental issues to start with though, other crazy girlfriends probably do too. I can just give you my perspective and hope that it helps...

I was really lucky and the guy I was/am with has the philosophy that you can't blame someone for something that isn't their fault. So, in the end, this really helped. He helped me realize that something wasn't right and that a change was necessary. We talked about my therapy a lot and he would tell me exactly when I did something, because the majority of the problem is that it is hard to realize what you are doing after you do it over and over again. With therapy, I had to write about my feelings and where they came from. This helped to get to the root of the problem, and conditions your mind to go through the steps to end up at a rational response.  

I find that my relationships are normally close friends, ones that you can tell them anything and they will talk to you honestly about it. So, yes relationships can and are strained at times. I think the key to my recovery was my support network. ","1285895326"

You would also find that a lot of individuals that are members of the corporate body known as ""the state"", particularly in the police and military, are in fact sociopathic if not psychopathic.","1285895408"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Psychologically, the problem of meaninglessness arises from depression. A brain that's working properly makes meaning.  

Philosophically, the problem of meaningless comes about as a result of the confused expectation that meaning should be something external to us, but I don't see how such a view can make sense when one really thinks it through.  We are organisms in an environment and our survival depends on our ability to represent that environment in a way that allows us to thrive in it.  When doing philosophy, we can (sometimes) tease apart fact from value, but this is a very fancy bit of cognition, because the two tend to come bundled.  If you are in the jungle and encounter a sabre-tooth tiger, and don't have an immediate fear response, that means your brain is not working as it was 'designed' to.  Constructing meanings is a crucial part of what brains do and it is only at a certain reflective distance that we can consider observation and meaning as separate 'things.'","1285895409"

To Cheral, it seemed like a very bad movie, the kind of movie that drags along with horrible acting- acting so horrible that it begins to cast a stress-inducing shadow of expectation on the ground. You begin to think that the main character is a serial killer and that any minute, he's going to do something so morally depraved that even John Wayne Gacy would shake his head, mutter, ""No thanks,"" and turn on his heel.

Sure it's not. But it **is** one of [many standard aspect ratios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29#Current_video_standards). That means that most 4:3 TVs would be able to scale the viewable area of the screen to best fit the width of the screen. There will still be some bars at the top and bottom of the screen because this is a full, wide-screen presentation. This differs from ""full screen"" format which adjusts to fit *only* the height of the video, chopping off the sides, which you probably know since you mentioned 35mm film.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I work in advertising (sorry Bill Hicks, it pays the bills), and my company occasionally makes websites which use facebook connect. Maybe we are the exception to the rule, but we have never used it to get demographics or personal information. 

We use facebook connect in certain instances when it is convenient. For example, we make a website which allows you to create an account and have content you create or upload tied to your username. Instead of worrying about creating our own database and login system, we can use facebook connect. It instantly verifies that you are most likely a real person (less spam). It is also possible to perform an age-check (which many of our clients require. I don't agree with age-gates on most sites, but it's all legal covering of the ass.) with facebook connect.

Other sites use facebook connect to serve client-side content from their own facebook profiles. ""Experience"" sites will take something like a movie trailer and put images of you or your friends in it. It might seem lame, but some people think it's pretty cool. None of the images or data is kept by the company, and it is against the facebook terms of use to do so.

The only info my company grabs from facebook is if a client has a facebook page, we look at how many fans they have.

Lastly, I do not use facebook myself and would rather not include it in websites, but it makes sense in a money-making kind of way. Most clients (corporations) want some kind of facebook presence, even if it is just a profile with the right message and attitude.

He says nothing about facts, but instead addresses *direct experience as reality*, and rather than say language *doesn't* describe anything, he instead implies that description is *the limit* of what language can do with regard to experience.  If language as a tool to describe experience has a limit, then I think it is difficult to deny the ""in-communicability"" of experience.

What is expressed mathematically about the movement of planetary bodies is not *actually* moving planetary bodies, but instead (to use his words) ""conceptual symbolism"" representing the movement of those bodies.  Mathematics, after all, is a language.  Similarly, what is expressed verbally about human experience is not *actually* human experience, but instead merely ""points to,"" *describes*, or approximates that experience.

You have mentioned a way that you think they could implement trading without providing the option for micro-transactions without illustrating why having micro-transactions is a bad thing. If you don't use microtransactions it doesn't set you behind, the items are craft-able side-grades.

As far as locking non-cosmetic stuff to an account, I imagine hats will go for more than weapons on e-bay, if people are willing to trade for an item then it has some value therefore depending on their income some people will be willing to pay money for it.

What I don't get is people acting like they own the thing because they happen to post on Reddit.  I don't get people acting like Jon Stewart has hijacked their idea for a rally and is doing it wrong because maybe the idea started on a bulletin board they read sometimes.  

It's also weird that you would vouch for this not being a PR campaign when your post was just tweaking the idea that somebody else had.  

I don't know, I've been poking around trying to figure this out one way or another, but the problem is on the Internet what's fact and what's fiction can get murky pretty fast.  I know that drumming up support for the rally online, and making people think it was their idea, would be great for getting attendance up.  I also know that it helped a hell of a lot that the Reddit admins were so involved in promoting this. (I unsubscribed from r/politics a while ago, so I wouldn't have even seen your post except that the admins put it on the blog.)

Some key stats:

- 1.3 Adult women are raped every minute.
- **The U.S. has the highest rate of sexual assault per capita of any industrialized country.** (so yeah, I'd say media and violence plays a role here)
- It is estimated that as few as 10 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police.
- Non-stranger rapists are rarely convicted of their crimes.
- Almost two-thirds of all rapes were committed by someone who is known to the victim.
- 67% of sexual assaults were perpetrated by a non-stranger,
- 47% of perpetrators were a friend or acquaintance of the victim,
- 17% were an intimate partner, and
- 3% were another relative

&gt; If you look at incidents of domestic violence I can cite many many studies that show us that women assault men as often as men assault women.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You didn't answer the question.  You specifically said that:

&gt;payment should technically be commensurate with the amount of time it takes, as well as the quality of the work.

Leaves of Grass is widely considered among the greatest literary works, and it took Whitman nearly 40 years to make his final version.  So under your theory, he should be remunerated immensely for it.  What he did in his spare time is meaningless.  Yet in my example, Stephanie Meyer, who cranked out one of the most popular yet banal books of this century, in one single night should be compensated very little in comparison. Right?

Your chair example bears no relation to the copyright discussion because the value calculations are different.  In this case, if I value sitting, then I am more than willing to pay more for a chair available immediately, regardless of the quality difference between the two.  So yes, a businessperson (in this case the craftsman), who knows what I value and can cater to it immediately, can completely and rationally expect to place a premium on the immediately available product.  In that case, someone who can crank a book out overnight, should be entitled to more return than someone who spends a lot of time on it, which again contradicts your earlier argument.  ","1285895590"

"business","t5_2qgzg","Geez, what a Negative Nancy.  Reddit is a community to some people.  A community of free thought.  The exact characteristics you describe, easy/quick/anonymous registration, no elaborate profile, etc. is what binds these people together.  I'd argue that there exists no other ""community"" in the world where you express your sincere opinions so openly with such a large audience. 

The Reddit community is not united over a geographical region, or favorite sports team, or one particular hobby/band/game.  While there are opportunities to narrow down your interests via subreddits, I think most Redditors' interests are broad, and that is what brings them together.  I'd even go so far as to say that Reddit's common bond is the universe.  And while this is true for everyone, Redditers seem to embrace this fact.  We don't feel a need to make the world smaller.  Almost any achievement in almost any field is of interest to Redditors.  And THIS, I'd argue, is the element of community here.  In no other real-world relationship have I been able to discuss *any* topic I choose with someone else who is knowledgeable on the subject.  

I also notice that among most of the members that seem to really identify with the ""Reddit Community"", the bond is with being a ""good"" person.  I'm not sure how exactly to define ""good"" but I think that rational, humble, enlightened, considerate, are some of the dominant characteristics.

Reddit, like the internet, is the collective mind of our species.  And when you want to do one particular activity, you can find the subreddit and find a person(s) to do that activity with.

*deep breath*



What a wuss. He was so mortally ashamed about something that is natural and feels good that he offed himself? That is likely the very acme of being a spineless turd. And are we really doing anyone in a similar situation any service by fawning over poor Tyler, and lavishing the affair with such media attention? In my uncomfortably vast experience dealing with suicidal people, the number one desired outcome is the attention they feel they've been denied in life. That ridiculous, childish fantasy of the parting shot; ""I'll show them!"". Would we perhaps be better off showing people that this isn't the way to handle your issues, maybe not take such a condescending tone, and maybe be more critical of his ultimate choice?



Whenever I talk to my homos about the challenges they face, one of the things that consistently comes up is the exhilarating liberation of coming out. That, somehow, the moment you say ""this is who and what I am"" publicly and proudly is the moment that the creeps of the world cease to have power over you. Are there yet severe problems in the system? Yes. Do we have a way to go? Yup. But, man, that finish line is fast coming into view. I think the yet-closeted gays have a better chance of being emboldened by a story emphasizing the great strength gained from coming out, rather than the suicidal shame of someone who allowed his sexuality to define his life and death. 



Here's the thing: it was a joke. A gag. From everything that I've read about the story, when you get past the histrionics, his isn't a case of someone harassing a homo to death, it's about a guy that was a little too high strung. I'm pretty sure his friends didn't mean to have this outcome. Have we really become so hysterically humorless that a kid would rather kill himself than take a joke? That we all are part of such a sphincter-clenching hyper-PC society that we can't just relax and not take ourselves so earth-shatteringly seriously? There might be a small handful of things in the world worth killing oneself over. I assure you this isn't one of them.

Despite the week-long congratulatory wank we're all having over that recent poll result, it really doesn't make a damn bit of difference who is more ""intelligent."" It would be an obvious logical fallacy if Stephen Hawking tried to insist that he was right and you were wrong exclusively on the basis that he's ""smart.""

This kind of self-deprecation just looks either cheap and fake or pathetic and brings nothing to the argument. Even in the case where you're up against an Einstein, we don't demand that you devalue your own intellect and rational faculty; only your god does that. (1 Corinthians)

The thing that burns us that might be mistaken for ""lack of intelligence"" is **intellectual dishonesty** and **willful ignorance.** You could be a drooling idiot, but if you're at least able to step through a rational argument without plugging your ears, or silently redefining words into something that nobody else would recognize, or refusing to concede any points for any reason, or flatly ignoring the bits of the argument you don't like, then we can have a productive discussion, and you might even ""win."" Not only that but your participation will be a breath of fresh air compared with most of the bible-thumpers we encounter.

It seems from your willingness to actually examine your faith and have discussions/debates with others that you're not (yet) guilty of the above two. So just drop that #3, it's unnecessary, irrelevant, and flat out wrong in many instances.

One other thing -- I find ""debates"" to be personally unproductive and prefer to engage in a ""dialog"" wherein each party tries their hardest to understand the other, and agree on first principles and common ground, before seeking the first point at which their ideas diverge. It's a collaborative attempt to learn which one of the parties has flawed reasoning rather than a persuasive-argument-competition to win an audience.

The programmer may _think_ that a specific test traces to a requirement when, in fact, the connection is spurious at best.  The key reason for this is that unit tests are at a different level of abstraction than requirements and are not ideally comparable.

As for the YakTrax -- admittedly, I didn't use them *every* day - if the snowplows and the salt had done their job, there was no need. We're a good deal further south than you, so while they lasted four winters for me, our winters are comparatively shorter and warmer. And when I did use them, it was mostly entirely on packed snow/ice in the park... so that might've had something to do with it? Four weeks seems like a very short time, but yeah, the combination of very cold weather and concrete would probably put enough stress on the material. 

For what it's worth, I think I'm going to do the screw shoes thing this winter instead of buying another pair. Shelling out that much money for some rubber and coil doesn't really appeal much to my student-esque sensibilities.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Thanks!  And while I don't want to make being transgender the whole focus of the discussion, I don't mind answering questions as respectfully phrased as your own - it's not the simplest thing to understand if you haven't experienced it.

First - I'm attracted to men, but not exclusively and I'm definitely more attracted to women.  (My fiancee is another woman, though she is cisgendered - meaning she was born with an identity matching the sex she was assigned at birth.)  I experimented with a ""gay"" relationship when living as a man, but the dynamic wasn't what I was looking for. Gender/sexual identity is a very elusive thing to define exactly, but a gay male relationship didn't hold an appeal for me.  Besides, the guys I tried dating wanted to date a guy... and I never felt like one.

As to feeling like a woman - yes and no.  Brain science regarding transgender behavior is murky, to say the least, but the latest research points to indicators that the brain has an innate sense of self-gender, and that sometimes that doesn't match other parts of the body.  Just as you can have a [fertile female person with XY chromosomes](http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/93/1/182) or a [male with female secondary sexual characteristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome), you can have a brain and a body that don't match up.  What I can tell you is that from the earliest ages I can remember, I just -knew- there was a mixup and I was really a little girl.  It wasn't a passing phase or a lark: it was a deep-seated gut feeling that I'd mistakenly been taken for a boy.  What was just confusion as a kid became profoundly traumatic as I moved into puberty: before I understood how exactly puberty worked, I saw other girls around me grow up and figured that whenever that change happened, my mixup would get fixed.  Instead, my body started moving in exactly the opposite direction.

By the same token, I couldn't have given a full and honest account of how being a woman ""feels"" before I started transition.  Feeling like a woman has a lot of factors, not the least of which is hormonal balance and the way one is treated in society.  Living with a male hormonal balance as compared to a female balance, my emotions felt muted... other than my sex drive and temper.  Now, a lot of times people interpret that to mean that I think men are raging sex-craved emotional husks, but that's not the case at all.  All I'm saying is that that hormonal balance did not jibe with MY brain chemistry - well before I noticed any physical changes, starting hormone therapy I had this deep sense of peace.  Something that had been out of alignment was now corrected, and my body wasn't actively rebelling against me anymore.  It was as drastic as watching a movie in black-and-white and having it suddenly switch to color - just as sure as I'd felt that something was wrong before, I knew now that it was getting better.  That sense of well-being has only strengthened as I've continued transitioning.

I'm sorry if that comes across as vague or wishy-washy... it's very hard to effectively communicate a lack of association with one's own body.  I'm sorry that you experience social anxiety, but you're right - it's probably a fairly apt comparison.  I hope that answers your question!","1285895846"

But the subway site errors are not produced exclusively by using editors. No way. This code has been hacked apart after the fact, the simple exclusion of the DOCTYPE at the beginning of the file is evidence of this, along with the lack of header information right up front. 

I may knock Microsoft, but they were never this unprofessional in their products. The layout must be a product of hacks that have been working on the site without proper understanding of HTML. This being Subway, I imagine they spent far far far more than what a site of this design would normally cost, with a more proper HTML markup. I have clients that would have fired me for less than this. You'd think the bottom line should be that it just seems to work, so why care? But this argument breaks down once it comes to maintenance and expansion.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I usually played about 10 or so clicks to the left of center.

One very important thing to remember is that monsters scale to your level.  But your level is only a reflection of what your primary skills are, not how effective you are at combat (what I call your effective level).

So for example, if you pick non-combat skills as your primary skills (the ones that make you level up) you may level up more quickly than your fighting skills level up, effectively making the monsters harder (a low effective level vs. your real level).  Likewise if you level up your combat skills more quickly than your real level your effective level may be higher than your real level, making monster easier.

Make sense?


The character build I always picked was a Male Breton Mage -- a full on mage, with all the magic.  Then I would play them as a thief/assassin.  This would mean that I would only level up IF I used magic.  If I did not I would not level up.  This allowed me to get very skilled with sword, sneaking, and marksmen without leveling up.  It would be bit difficult until about level 10 or so, but it worked for me several times.


My most recent character is a bit different.   I set him up to be able to reach the theoretical maximum of level 53.5.  The build is thus : 

* Breton Male, Sign of the Mage
* Specialization : Magic
* Favorite Attributes : Endurance Luck
* Major Skills : Speechcraft, Security, Sneak, Marksman, Light Armor, Blade, Armorer

I used a 5-5-1 level up method.  But had to manage my skill-ups very much.  He is currently a level 51 with all attributes, including luck at 100.  He's on track to reach level 53.

a) yes --&gt; Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers suggests poor children's grades will improve because they won't waste time in front of a tv due to financial reasons while rich kids are at camp being challenged

b) yes, but rich kids will also improve somewhat, because they don't retain 100% of their studies

c) longer school days are better. in china, an additional hour each day equals to ~2 years of additional schooling over 14 years

d) use volunteer after-school tutoring (not unlike the [Pirate Supply Store](http://www.826valencia.org)

e) have more external internships/extracurricular work/projects

f) get rid of summer breaks, as first 2 months of each semester are spent reteaching old material and last 2 
months will be forgotten very quickly

g) won't matter, we need to change the culture first to respect literacy, science, music, art, history, etc

h) better parenting

i) get rid of No Child Left Behind; the grade inflation helps individuals but not the system as a whole

j) increase teacher pay/number of teachers

k) increase expectations of children. they'll only go as far as their driven

l) remove teacher penalization for failing kids, and saturday school for kids with grades below a certain grade

m) metric system

n) hire more teachers, fire majority of crappy teachers and administration","1285895947"

"politics","t5_2cneq","DADT could be killed by simple executive order, under the same provisions that allowed the controversial ""stop-loss"" program. In addition, the manner and nature of the military's gay investigations are directed by the DoD, which answers to the President.

As Commander-in-Chief of all U.S. military forces, the President has authority over all members of the U.S. military, and is capable of ordering a withdrawal. The President sets military policy, and proposes the budget that appropriates funds for the wars.

It is Obama administration policy to send suspected ""enemy combatants"" who were captured outside of Afghanistan to the prison at Bagram Air Base. As the prison located in a war zone, the suspects have no right to habeas corpus. Imprisoning people there who were arrested *outside* war zones is an abuse of that policy, and is a deliberate attempt by the Obama administration to recreate the legal black hole that previously existed at Guantanamo Bay. A federal court ruled that unconstitutional last year; Obama's Justice Department immediately appealed, and the decision was overturned earlier this year, an appeals court ruling that the government has the right to kidnap you and your family and transfer you beyond the reach of the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions. Obama could have stopped the appeal at any time.","1285895972"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Not really.  They might do some frequency boosting in the speech range, but compression is an amplitude-dependent rather than a frequency-dependent effect.  It boosts the level of soft sounds (like the space between words) without changing the amplitude of loud sounds.  This makes the _overall_ volume louder.  It's called ""compression"" because it pushes everything up into the top of the dynamic range.  To explain better, if you have audio in a range of -1 to 1, most of the audio samples in a compressed signal will be towards -1 or 1.  In a less compressed signal, samples will better distributed throughout the range.  However, in both cases, the same _frequencies_ are present.

A good idea for a sign could be ""...and your little dog too."" which would work nicely when placed right next to a typical trolling Westboro sign.

Then me and my merry bunch of pranksters would dress just like them, take our colorful signs to their ""protest"" and happily mix with them.   

In my imagination, we all pretend as if we are welcoming the chance to hang out with them.  Constantly pretend to chat happily with them at all times just to piss them off.  Be just like that one cousin of yours that keeps on obliviously, happily talking about dumb stuff and won't shut up.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","All right...a couple things:

1. You're debating me as if I didn't say I'm 100% against censorship. I am 100% against censorship. I was merely pointing out that I don't think censorship of child porn is solely about protecting the viewers, which is what your comment implies, but has much to do with attempting to eliminate the main distribution method for the industry, and industry which hurts children for profit. (I don't want to argue about whether or not this method is/can be successful). An industry with a product that has a severely limited means of distribution will result in less products being made, hence less *children* will be victimized.

2. Much of your comment was dedicated to arguing a point that I didn't make, which is that viewing child porn corrupts otherwise innocent minds. I never said that.  

3. Your analogy to a murder video surfacing is a bad one. What % of murderers do you think kill in order to package the video/pictures to make a profit? The main, and most important difference between is that child pornography is a crime *and* is specifically made for profit and distribution. 

But whatever, don't address anything I say. I just read your original comment and thought it pretty ridiculous that you thought that the censorship was all about *you* and the pixels on your screen, and had nothing to do with trying to reduce the amount of child porn made by hurting its means of distribution.

My tipping credentials by way of contextual preamble:

- I live in a country where serving staff are paid a living wage.

- I consider myself a generous but ruthless tipper, e.g. if service is appalling, I tip 1% so that the server understands that the reason they didn't get a tip is definitely not because I'm a non-tipper. If service is amazing, I tip up to 50%.

- As a bartender, I never expected a tip for something standard like a draught beer and was never offended if I didn't get one.

- As a barfly, I do tip for something standard like a draught beer subject to the ruthlessness mentioned above.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","How that example carries out for an American citizen is either they get involved with politics and make the changes they want (but ittt'sss harrrdddd) or they move somewhere else. They're both perfectly valid responses to the situation. I think the point I'm trying to push here is that taxes aren't what you have a problem with, at least not insofar as the idea of taxation. I think we can both agree that taxation is necessary. Your argument seems to be that taxing a rich person more than a poor person is somehow an attack on the rich.

It's not. The poor person has less discretionary income, and the rich person is taxed the same as the poor person for that portion of their income that is the same as the poor person. The lovely thing about the brackets is that they aren't linear -- they try to take less from those who can less afford it. In fact, there is no case in which a person would not want to make more gross income, even if they entered a new tax bracket.

So I can see from what you've said thus far that you understand taxation. You seem to have a problem with how money is spent in the government -- I don't always agree with how it's spent either. As you said, though, politics is about compromising: morals are not. Morally you may be opposed to a use for the money collected through taxes, but politically you may agree with it. That's what separates them. It also makes the discussion a wee bit more complicated, and I really don't have time now to explore how it gets more complicated.

I hope we can continue the discussion, though. Would you like to take it to messages?","1285896116"

Sometimes I wish I had been exposed to all sorts of religions (like a class in world religion or something), as I'm having to play catch-up now (I have become very anti-theist in the last couple of years), but as a child I didn't have any idea about god or any of that rubbish. It was a totally alien concept to me, and unlike the US, no one ever talks about their faith Downunder, so you really are not exposed to it unless your parents want you to be. 

The first thing I can remember is (when I was around 9 or so) some kid at school mentioned god... and then having a conversation with my Dad about what we 'believed'. He was explaining the difference between agnostic and atheist (which I don't think he got right!)... 

I know I should be open-minded enough to say we can't know there is no god... but if you grow up this way, simply getting on with life, learning your ABC's, being good to people around you and doing your best to succeed in life, it's a very hard point to concede to.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","**TL;DR: Read [The Week.](http://theweek.com/home)**

*  *   *  

Reddit's self-selection bias leans heavily towards ephemeral memes which, aside from some Scary Movie/Epic Movie/Tedious Movie ripoff feature that will play in theaters approximately 2 months after the meme is dead, has very little real-world penetration.

Reddit also heavily favors atheism and agnosticism in its general community and a counterculture acceptance of marijuana that puts the 60s to shame.  

Note that I do not think these are bad things - but you're absolutely right, they're one side of the story.  For any given set of facts, any number of arguments can be made, some with more success than others.  And while I think that the arguments Reddit tends to favor more closely approximate the empirical, evidence-based assessments that a thoughtful overview would produce, only hearing one interpretation of any set of facts on the ground does not really prepare you for encountering those who predominantly hear the other.

...which is pretty much ""the rest of the world.""

The best way around this I've found is to read a subscription to The Week.  It's kind of the Anti-Reddit, in a way - it's a news aggregator, but it's in print.  It pulls from an eclectic blend of all media (print and online) but has a moderate-to-strong conservative bias.  It tends towards tidbits of information from all walks of life but favors the wealthy and retired rather than the young and poor.  Unlike Reddit, whose core competency is its comments, The Week suffers essentially no contributions from readers other than a lame contest on the back page.  And unlike Reddit, which will suck your life out your eyeballs without you even noticing, a copy of The Week can be handily dispatched during one good sweat in the sauna or while dispatching an overindulgence of Taco Bell.

Yet the topics discussed are almost virtually the same.  Reddit gives you a young, educated, computer-centric view of the world.  The Week gives you an old, educated, print-centric view of the world.  Somewhere in between, I believe, lies balance.","1285896174"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Not a Zerg-specific statement, but whenever you're up against units that do AoE damage, you can split up your units into a few different groups, hot-key each one, then make them converge on the battle area from different directions. Surround your opponent... The less units you have clumped together, the better. It also helps to focus fire as well. I normally focus on taking out the weakest attacking units first to cut down on the number of things shooting at me, but AoE units tend to be a higher priority.

Psionic Storm and Irradiate attacks in the original Starcraft used to make me angry, but that was mostly because I catered to that kind of attack by having all my units together. Sometimes there's a choke-point and it's unavoidable, so try to get your enemy out into the open.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Modding the game through emulators to try to improve the graphics can be very tricky.  Yes you will be able to apply filters to textures and HQ polygons, which sounds nice at first, but will take a long time to get the right settings.  


If you do go this route, I suggest playing it vanilla first, at least for a few minutes, to get a feel of how the original, classic game is supposed to look.  Then, go ahead and apply these settings to your graphical plugin (I'll assume you have Windows 7 since you indicate your rig is fairly new).
[SETTINGS](http://www.lordkane.co.uk/images/FF7-OGL2.png)

Oh yeah, those settings are for the graphics plugin Pete's OpenGL2 PSX GPU, which is basically known as the best one around for a good rig.  Find it at the top of the page [HERE](http://www.pbernert.com/html/gpu.htm)


Of course, these settings are only suggestions.  You can tweak it how you want to make the game look the way you want (make the polygons less sharp and stand out less, etc etc)...it just takes a bit of trial and error.


As for sound, the plugin included in the latest version of the ePSXE (1.7.0) emulator is currently regarded as the best.  Just stick with vanilla settings there.

Have fun playing a great game!!

I don't even want to use a throwaway account because after coming to terms with this experience I'm quite fond of this story. 

Anyways here it goes: 
It was the summer going into my junior year of college when I heard that a girl I used to have somewhat of a crush on would be starting at my college in the late summer term. Our conversations started as me just giving her advice about the school but swiftly became quite overtly flirtatious. When she finally moved into town we hung out a couple times but the encounters were on the whole uneventful until one night I received a text from her which read something like this, ""hhhhheyyyyyy I'm dwntwn and leaving a club. Youuu should come find me and show me your house."" I was bored, just drinking on my couch, so I obliged. I found her and walked her back to my house. On the walk over it became apparent she was quite drunk, but since I was too I didn't think much of it. 

Once inside one thing lead to another and we were making out in my bedroom when the clothes started coming off. She was naked and I was in just my boxers and she started grinding on me with the ferocity that only a drunk college freshman could possess. After a while it felt like my dick was suffering from third degree rug burns so I pushed her off and began fingering her to which she responded with highly theatrical moans of ecstasy. Even when I would stop touching her completely she would continue howling at an almost comedic volume. 
Then, being the gentleman I am, I decided to go down on her. The moans continued until after a couple minutes she let out what must have been the longest queef known to man. My cheeks were reminiscent of a dog with it's face out moving cars windows. 
But I'm a man goddamnit so I shook it off, threw her down and proceeded to have the most unpleasant couple minutes of drunken sex that I have ever experience. 
That morning I woke up really early to drive her to her 8:30 class, got dressed, took her onto campus, went back home, and took my pants off to go back to bed, when I looked down. There on the front of my clean white boxer briefs were multiple distinct shitty skidmarks running up and down the front. 
I have never seen her since. ","1285896186"

Which is most important? Food growers or Food servers? Food growers or plumbers? Plumbers or shippers?

How do you encourage people to be Food growers instead of food servers? Pay them more. But won't everyone want to be food growers then? So you have to choose the best people to be food growers, which means food growing school and grades. But then you need teachers. 

No one wants to be a plumber though, because plumbers work in poop. So you pay them more.

Not every one can be an architect or an electrician because they require training of other sorts and not everyone is smart enough to be one. So there's less of those, so they need to be paid more because they are harder to find.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I wonder how many women watched it online and how they knew about it.  I can't imagine most of the guys wanting to watch gay dudes go at it.  I can imagine many of them making jokes, but from what I have seen in HS and College the guys usually tease and beat up other guys for the attention of the female audience.

I also know that alot of women get off on gay porn.  I wonder if sororities were involved at all.  Frats get a bad name, and many deserve it, but sororities are just as bad if not worse in many aspects.  ive seen frat dudes get in fights, but I have known sorority girls and other girls(their victims) who socially ostracized people and gave some girls eating disorders as revenge for some social mistake/percieved insults.

I suspect this is largely motivated by male-male competition and female choice rearing it's ugly head in social interactions.

The female herd is hugely homophobic, especially towards men.  As a dude I don't care where gay dudes stick their dicks.  Why would I?  Women though, they are threatened and repulsed and in a weird way turned on by it.  Their attraction, I think, stems from the fact that women get off on seeing men be dominant, whether to women or other men.  Their threatened by it because they can't use their one main advantage, sex, to control and manipulate men.  I also know, because i've done it before, that men will be homophobic and attack other men socially to get female attention.  I bet that is what happened here.

Feminists and female educators always blame men and boys, some going as far as blaming 'hegemonic masculinity' and using boys suicides to appropriate and try to restructure maleness in schools through anti-bullying measure...but it will do nothing to help because the girls and the female herd are the biggest bullies around.  [Check out this case:](http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/local/east_central/teen-suicide-victim-hangs-himself-from-barn-rafters)

&gt;Billy had been suspended from school that day. Friends say he was fighting back with cuss words against the bullies. They say girls were harassing him in class when he stood up and let the words spew. He was suspended

"business","t5_2qgzg","I caught your point on the early days of the industrial revolution and stealing technology.  My point...didn't your parents teach you that two wrongs don't make a right.  Beyond the childhood morality lesson, consider the effect widespread intellectual property theft has on the global market (INCLUDING China).  Why would any company invest millions in new technology if their intellectual property is not protected from theft.  The answer...they wouldn't and market innovation will wither as a result.  It's only a matter of time before China develops intellectual property it will want to protect.  When that happens, guess who will respect THEIR intellectual rights?  The answer...No one.  What goes around, comes around.    

""...a LOT of countries ""manipulate"" their currency including America. All countries that are known for exporting such as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, China, all buy U.S. treasuries to keep their currencies relatively low to the dollar. China is just the best at capitalism.""

What you're holding up as capitalism is NOT capitalism...it's market manipulation which undermines ""capitalism"".  This behavior was once outlawed in the U.S. because of the detrimental market effects it creates, until the Republican party loosened the restrictions with deregulation (one of the main reasons the U.S. economy imploded).  If currency manipulation was not needed to maintain China's competitive advantage, then it wouldn't be doing it PERIOD.

You're right to question the accuracy of media reports these days as they're not reporting the truth or focusing on the economic issues that matter.  I'm as disgusted by it as you are, but propaganda only works for a short time.  Once that time is up, things turn ugly real fast and the people who get fooled by the propagandists, turn on them.  I can see why you believe many Americans are essentially meat puppets.  But, if history has taught me anything, it's not to underestimate the human spirit....even the meat puppets.

If the wage trend continues, it won't be the poor people who will have reason to fear.  It will be those who are responsible for it.  As for the economy recovering from wage decreases, highly doubtful.  Layoffs and falling wages are what CAUSED the country's economic collapse.  I know the Republicans have blamed it on the housing crisis, but in truth, people don't fall behind in housing payments and bills unless their income drops (i.e., lower wages) or their expenses skyrocket (e.g., high fuel prices).  If wages decrease further, we won't see an increase in employment, we'll see further decreases and, perhaps, a market meltdown/Depression.  Why?  Because it will destroy consumer confidence and spending which makes up over 70% of economic activity.

If you're an American, then DAMN, ease up on the self-hate.  Just so you know, most Americans didn't create the country's current economic circumstances.  As stupid as it's going to sound, this crap was planned.  The problem is that the morons who planned it, built their financial/business models with deeply flawed economic assumptions (e.g., housing prices which don't decline, rate increases which made underlying assets unaffordable, consumer spending which ""increased"" as incomes decreased, etc.).  For that, we only have a few over-educated, but incompetent, ""Americans"" on Wall Street and in D.C. to thank.","1285896208"

My father says he believes in god - but he's not religious.  We have a lot of conversations concerning the negative aspects of religion.  His mother went to church a bit, she believes in god, i suppose.  His father (my grandfather) is a staunch atheist (and my grandparents are still married).

I think for a time, as a child, i wanted to believe in a god.  I tried praying and stuff and it felt ridiculous and fake.  I didn't keep that up.  My prayers weren't answered, anyway.

I never had good experiences with religious people, either.  I remember being young and playing out in a friends' front yard one day.  His older friend comes by (he was a teenager, we were all pre-teens) and gets to talking.  For some reason the conversation swung to ""Do you believe in god?""  coming from the older kid, directed at me.  I say ""no"".  He tells me I'm going to hell.  I told him i don't believe in that, either.  He says it doesn't matter, i'm still going there.

I can recall a few other interactions with people going this same route.  These encounters inspired my change from passive to active opposition of organized religion.

Overall, I'd say I was in the same boat.  Maybe not a total atheist from day 1, but more or less.  I may have waffled between atheism and agnosticism.  Over the years I've become a bit more bitter toward religion, though.","1285896249"

This might not be the best advice, but usually how I do it is to go out one tonight and just have a blast. Drink a ton, get with girls, things of that nature. 

If you just tell yourself ""alright - I've had enough of sitting around, I'm going to go out and have a blast tonight"" usually it works. The key is to make PLANS so your committed to it. Call up your friends. But make sure you do it in an environment your comfortable in. I mean, if your a casual guy who likes a laid back place - don't go out clubbing or something, because that could be a disaster and reinforce your addiction. Go have a blast at a place your comfortable with, and go harder than you ever have (or at least normally do). 

I'd even advocate drugs if they help. I mean, being a casual drug user is better than being trapped inside your house any day.

Something else that helps - is to cut off your internet. I'll unplug my modem and bring it to my parents house and leave it there when I have a lot of work to do. This way even if I have to use the computer - I'm forced to go out and do it. This way i'll eventually have to get off the computer (to eat, because I feel like an asshole sitting in the library for so long, etc.). Doing this alone might help bury your addiction by pairing it with things that have high payoffs (ie getting out of your house). And this will play a trick on your mind. Even though you might still be on the computer all the time - because your leaving the house you will feel better about yourself which will give you FAR more control over your addiction in the long run. 

After a week if these things don't work. See a shrink.

Statistics and data analytics are in huge demand in the medical, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries too.  You can work doing clinical trial analytics (mainly regression/ANOVA/survival analyses) for novel or generic drug development.  You can work in health insurance, not just as an actuary, but also in population health and outcomes modeling (evaluating efficacies of certain interventions over others, ROI modeling, etc).  You could get a job at a university doing analytics for professors doing grant-based studies.  The closer you stick to academia, the more stable your job, yet the less money you'll make.  The more you head into big business either as an analyst or statistical programmer, the more digits behind the dollar sign of your paycheck.","1285896314"

1. Bad news, and they haven't gotten around to contacting you
1. Bad news, and they won't contact you (because some HR departments are terrible)
1. They have a better candidate and are waiting to see if (s)he accepts. If the top pick doesn't accept, they may then go down their list of suitable choices. You could be on that list somewhere.
1. They are really busy (disorganised) and haven't gotten around to contacting you yet. I have waited nearly two weeks before I got an offer. Asking later, I was told I was the best candidate, it just genuinely took them that long to get back to me. If the job market isn't red hot they can get away with this (on the other side of the coin, I lost a candidate that I made a same day offer to because someone else beat me by 2 hours).
1. Something changed within the company (e.g. re-organisation, sudden hiring freeze) and now the position you would have filled is in limbo.

I have seen all of these, from both sides.

As life goes on you WILL find that you don't have much in common with some friends you were close to because lives drift apart. DON'T let that stop you from getting new friends as you drift into new peoples lives.

I am referring to the actual academic discourse that takes place through their related journals.  I don't know how aware of these you may be but apparently you think they are something like opinion pages, carrying the political punditry of contemporary American politics on their backs.  This is not the case at all, especially in the maths and sciences; of which engineering journals are a part of.  Mathematical engineering principles do not favour conservatism or liberalism.  Think about it. 

And I'm still blown away by the ineptitude of your analogy to the Reichstag fire.  I could see if after the events of Sept 11, the Military captured and killed/jailed all of the democrats and left-leaning people in the Government; created a police-state; declared a new president, and purged the Senate and the House, **THEN** I could see an analogous similarity.  You can't compare the US to 1930's Germany.  It just doesn't make sense.  

You claim that the official story is being questioned?  By whom??  By the same people that say the government has ALIEN Technology lol and other ridiculously simple-minded claims.  WHY are there no papers being written about it at the academic level?????  Academia THRIVES on displacing current theories and views in all disciplines.  For every theorist, there are like a million grad students who would like nothing more than to make a name for themselves by proving somebodies theory wrong, or uncovering a new theory for this or for that.  The PROBLEM is that you have to back up your claims with FACTS and SCIENCE lol. And this is why those conspiracy-loving bloggers are not taken serious by ANYBODY other than people like you apparently.  I'm sorry but proving that the attacks were orchestrated by the government takes a little more effort than surfing the web for a few hours/days going to websites which claim this and that about this event and that event.  If the so-called ""experts"" that you nutjobs reference are actually experts, why do they not submit their theories and proofs to academic journals?  Think about it.  Why not?

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","My beater Subaru needs a new exhaust system...","1285896413"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Wow, some big damn questions in there.. Here goes.

 FiberChannel 101--let's use Ethernet as a comparison..In Ethernet, devices communicate with eachother using MAC addresses. Communication is also handled on a per interrupt basis--only one device can ""pick up the line"" and talk on it at any given time, else you have packet collisions. In FiberChannel, devices talk to eachother in something called a ""fabric""...sort of like a chat room. Each device is connected via a closed loop between the device and the fabric, and communicate with one another using something called a WWN, or World Wide Name---basically, a really big MAC address. WWNs come in two flavors. WWPNs, and WWNNs. World wide port names, and world wide node names. A SAN device is usually addressed using one or the other--you talk to a port address, or you talk to a node on that port. Switch zoning is usually done on a WWPN basis, since visibility to individual LUNs is handled by the appliance. In other words, Billy the LUN has a WWNN. If you want to see if Billy can come out and play, you can either stand out on the street and yell at his house to get the attention of everyone inside (addressing via WWPN) or go up to Billy's window and ask him personally. (WWNN addressing.)

Devices in FiberChannel environments usually communicate in SCSI terms, but nothing stops them from doing any form of protocol...just like Ethernet can be used to handle IPX/SPX or TCP/IP traffic simultaneously, FiberChannel can handle SCSI or FCIP or bizarro shit like FCAL and NDMP, the bastard children of FiberChannel. 

Topology design is much the same as Ethernet, many of the same concerns are present.. However, since you're usually working with light versus voltage, you dont really need to worry about distances between infrastructure points. 

FC drives differ from SATA drives in that SATA is a serial addressing scheme, and FC drives are parallel addressed, read: fast versus really fucking fast. A typical SATA drive can handle about 80 IOPS, where FC drives can usually sustain about 180 IOPS. The bus type makes a big difference. 

Almost without exception, you cannot mix FC and SATA drives on the same bus. They're electrically different, not just bus-different. This also usually means you can't have a mix of both in the same RAID. Your RAID will either be all FC spindles or all SATA spindles. 

Also, you're not as ignorant as you think--you have it down pretty damn well.  ","1285896413"

&gt; **Are the Chicken McNuggets really 100% chicken?**  
The only meat used in McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets is chicken breast meat. The white meat is minced before being shaped into nuggets, and then coated with a specially seasoned batter at our trusted suppliers, such as Keystone Foods. You may also like to try the Chicken Selects Premium Breast Strips which are made from white meat chicken which has not been minced.

Photon pressure from the sun will change the velocity of it by about 2cm/s which is more than enough to avoid an earthly collision.

Honestly, there is so much bullshit talked about planet killing asteroids, it's just not funny.

If you are stupid enough to not identify a planet killer within that time frame, then a series of missions to take about 2000 high-yield Nukes to it  are required. But no drilling is needed (Armageddon was one of the worst bullshit movies ever made).

You just plonk one on the surface  and let it off. Then you put another one in the same place and do it again. Repeat until you have a crater, and then just keep going. Newton says that this works quite nicely n a small time frame. You just need a lot of nukes. And it doesn'tmatter whether it's solid metal, or nothing but a rubble pile, either.","1285896423"

Anyway, this was back in the late '90s - the dorm cafeterias on campus allowed you to charge food to your meal plan account by scanning the bar code on the back of your student card. A guy in my freshman class who hadn't even paid for a meal plan had somehow photocopied someone else's card, and had pasted that photocopied bar code onto his own card. 

He then proceeded to eat for free for the semester and buy large quantities of relatively pricey stuff like soft drinks and pastries for himself and his friends using the card.

The problem is, a good novel or short story may not necessarily translate into a good series/movie. There's been fairly few of those that have. They are two different mediums, and what makes a written work good may not work for a graphic presentation.

A better competition? Have people produce short webisodes. Maybe entire series, like how Sanctuary was started, if I recall. The problem with that is the cost and the SFX one needs for F&amp;SF, however.

If it was simple to come up with good ideas, TV and movies would be filled with quality. SGU got 1.2 million viewers for their premiere. Ghost Hunters got 2 mil. If the latter pays the bills so they can produce more of the former, so be it (not that I've been watching either of late).","1285896471"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The German unemployment rate has dropped from 5 million to 3 million (7.2%)

no it has not, that is just sugar-coating statistics

- unemployed people who must do extension studies  or occupational re-training are not counted
-  people who attain a ""1 euro job"" (a job that will get you exactly 1 euro for each hour you work) next to receiving Hartz IV, the job is just for people to get a little extra on hartz IV, its not a real job, its a disgrace, people take it because they cant get a real job because they dont want to sit around and do nothing
- older people who have not yet reached 65 years (the time you retire in germany, or 67 in 20 years and receive a monthly income based partly on the amount of money you earned in the last 40 years) but are old (like 50-55) that they would never have a chance to get a job again in their field because enough 20/30 whatever year olds are available also searching for a job
- people who have been unemployed for very long 10+ years, they are regarded as ""impossible to arrange any kind of job"" thus they are not unemployed because they will never get a job anyway anymore
- (this is shocking but real) people who fail extension studies  or occupational re-training a few times, are branded as speaking loosely ""mildly retarded"" , they are also not regarded as unemployed

these are SOME examples, the unemployment rate is at LEAST 2x times higher than the official statistics would make you believe

If the area you live in is not doing well with work situations find an area that has more opportunities. A friend of mine told me to find him a homeless shelter so that he could move closer to me because he knows I am a good friend that would be able to help him out. So that is an idea.

Wherever you go make sure you can have a place to stay. I hear some people living in a car. That is a possibility for a while at least. You can eat simple things and find a place that has a shower. Some gyms have that. A gym membership and your car is cheaper than your car and a place to rent. You need to make sure your doing ok. You can do it buddy. I promise. Life kicks your ass but once you learn to adapt at the lowest levels... you are stronger than those that are rich in terms of ability to live life.

So...

* Find a homeless shelter or live in your car. 

* Make sure you can shower and eat.

* Find subsidized living or an efficiency apt.

* Make sure someone can help you with your kid until your back on your game.

* Get a post office box so that you have a place to recieve mail as you have to have this to recieve important documents crucial to living life.

* Stay in an area that has actual opportunities. Larger cities than a small rural city will be good for you to try. There are tons of small jobs you can find.

 In general, it's just too damn expensive in the US to offer health insurance when the turnover rate is so high and the profit margin so slim. In other countries people can work in restaurants as lifelong career, raise a family, all without higher education, because healthcare is provided by the government and is not a burden on individual business.

A yobo is but one of the usb peripherals they disabled in an attempt to stop hackers from using the usb port to hack the system.  The thing is, hackers can use ps3 controllers themselves to accomplish the hack, so wasting people's money by disabling their purchased legitimate usb peripherals is ridiculous.

If hacking disables PSN and this makes it useless to hack the system, then what is Sony's motivation for fucking over their paying customers?

They should increase the usability of the PS3, implement new features in their firmware, rather than make the ps3 even more useless.

However, not everyone will do this. Some people actually *buy the stuff* being sold! How do I know this? Because telemarketing wouldn't be viable otherwise.

By hanging up, all we do is enable the telemarketer to find one of those people that much faster. We increase the profitability of the business and we increase the prevalence of telemarketing.

Simultaneously, those people who fund telemarketers by buying their stuff are often not mentally competent or at least weak-willed. While not legally considered such, morally it can be considered wrong to take their money under those conditions. By hanging up, we are enabling this scam.

Hang up? No thanks. I'd rather fight telemarketing and help in some small way to protect the victims of telemarketers than protect someone who willingly took an immoral job.","1285896635"

I don't have a problem with second hand sales, things like [bookcrossing](http://www.bookcrossing.com/), and so on. I'll often buy second hand also. I collect certain kinds of novels, and there is no way to buy first editions or something except second hand. 

Yeah, we don't make anything from these sales, but they are keeping the joy of reading alive - and you'd go mad if you expected a return from every single 'reading instance' of your work that occurs. Plus it's a great lower cost way of sampling different authors - and perhaps you will then go on to buy their work also.

The parallels here with digital distribution are germane, I think.

I see emerging a two-tiered market. I think the paper version of books may well go the way of vinyl in that they will be little objects d'art that we collect precicely for their delightful physicality. This might put more emphasis on the physical object of the book itself, if they switch to becoming collectible little works of art. I know there are certain authors I will always want to own in print, but it makes complete sense to me to have disposable or time-critical books (like non-fiction, travel, or books you only intend to read once) digitally. 

Remainder stores I don't shop at. When a book is remaindered, the publisher and author both lose. These are essentially new books that are being sold. Anyway, this is a complex aside that speaks to the way books are sold (ie: on consignment to the bookstores - so unsold copies can be returned that must then be pulped because they can't be treated as new again). It is wasteful and the hidden costs of this are rolled into the books we do buy.","1285896654"

They also function as a sort of ""fixed"" cost, unless spending is cut.

It also doesn't make sense that the projected gap would widen when the overall revenue decreased.

Contrary to popular belief, men are much likely to be victims of domestic violence than women are. (Or, put another way, women are much more likely to be the perpetrators of domestic violence.)

With that in mind, I believe that double standards often exist for a reason. The simple fact of the matter is that men are naturally stronger than women are. For example, in the clip provided we see the woman strike a man in the face several times and there doesn't appear to be any serious damage. The results might be very different if the tables were turned, and this is precisely why we have the double standard in the first place. Men and women are not the same. If a six year old kid walks up to a grown man and hits him, the adult most certainly doesn't have recourse to hit him back. There's a clear double standard there too and, again, it's a double standard that exists for a reason.

What I am trying to say there is that the concept of ""center"" is the most useful for making predictions within the solar system.  Just as it is overly complicated to work from the Earth at the center, it is overly complicated to work from the center of the galaxy as the center when analyzing the solar system's internal dynamics, or to use a heliocentric model to analyze an aircraft design.  You can do it, but it is overly complicated, and that makes it a lot easier to make mistakes in your predictions.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I did one better, I just don't use it.  The problem isn't that they sell information, it's that they're not clear to the end user that they're doing it.  The best violations of privacy are like the best (computer) crackers in the world - you have no idea it ever happened.  And when you start getting increased telemarketing calls, or more junk mail, or someone steals your identity and commits fraud, you can't tell that it was facebook that fucked you over.

If they came out and said ""sign up, use our stuff, we will sell your information to corporations and anyone with a fat enough wallet as compensation - here is the stuff about you we sell. &lt;insert list&gt;"" then it really wouldn't be an issue - you'd know exactly what you were giving up.  However, I doubt most people would have signed up at all if they really understood the truth.

The problem is that the layman thinks facebook is solely funded by the ads on the site.  They don't understand how their privacy is being violated.","1285896757"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Yup. THIS.

I agree wholeheartedly with ALL of this.

To the OP: Unless this is a medical issue, her lack-of-a-sex-drive issue really can't be ""fixed."" Sex drives vary from person to person. Some people just naturally have very low sex drives or view sex as a ""chore"" and not something special or enjoyable.

What it comes down to is this: you need to seriously consider whether or not you really want to be in a long-term relationship with someone who has virtually no interest in sex. I mean, do you *truly* see a future with this girl, knowing that you may go months, even years without sex? Do you really think you can be happy like that? Sexless relationships inevitably lead to resentment, and resentment leads to break-ups. It seems like you're already starting to resent her for this (which is definitely understandable -- I'd start to resent my partner too if I went months without seeing any action). You shouldn't ""feel like an ass"" for being sexually frustrated. Sex is important. It should be a normal part of any happy, healthy, loving long-term relationship. 

The bottom line is that if you're unhappy in this relationship because you constantly feel sexually frustrated, then you need to tell her that you're unhappy and leave. Just tell her that you feel you'd be much better off as friends (since the sexual/romantic elements of your relationship seem to be gone, anyway). A relationship without sex and romance isn't really a relationship. It's a friendship.

Find someone that enjoys sex as much as you do. There are plenty of wonderful girls out there with healthy sexual appetites. You'll be much happier, trust me.","1285896762"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think the odds are about 1 in 90 times stealing a shoplifter gets caught, but it really depends on the store and their level of security, some stores have little to none, some have extremely efficient security teams. The best way to spot a shoplifter is looking for things out of the ordinary, the more you watch regular shoppers and see their habits, the more you spot things that are not normal shoppers habits. Of course, there are also common signs: looking around suspiciously, grabbing lots of merchandise quickly, selecting multiple of same item (same dvd for example), having an open backpack, unzipping a backpack while looking at merchandise, paying attention to associates, looking at the cameras, selecting expensive merchandise and taking weird paths through the store (like up the back wall to the deserted corner), the list goes on but you get the point.","1285896766"

I call up my electric company to report yet another outage. It's around midnight and I call up. I hear the stress in the voice of the lady who picks up. I realize it's not HER fault my power is off and it's getting hot as hell. So I try to be as polite as possible. She tells me that the people down at the energy reliability department are working on it, and I joke that I hope some heads will roll down there. She laughs and goes, ""Me too."" I wish her a good night and hang up.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm sure I won't get all of the reasons, but here are a few:

* Their domain is [godhatesfags.com](http://godhatesfags.com), fags of course being an offensive term for gay people. They're extremely homophobic, which alone is enough for them to be hated.

* When they're not busy insulting the dead servicemen at their funerals, they're preaching an extremely homophobic agenda that is completely wrong: http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/phelpswestchurch.jpg 

* They **make** money by being so offensive that people get violent towards them. They then sue them and win ton's of $$ which they use to protest more and make more money. They basically troll people for a living.

* They show up at the **funerals** for servicemen and say that the reason they died was because God hates America and god hates them, and ruin the funeral for dead servicemen's family. It's really tragic.

TL;DR they are extremely homophobic, and troll people IRL in the worst ways and make money from it. ","1285896815"

So, the result of which, is that I did not have a religious upbringing at all. I never read the bible, or went to church, or did prayers. I think for a while I thought there was a god (by virtue of being a naive child and having religious class at school) but I mustn't have really believed it very strongly because as soon as I was old enough and sensible enough to think about it I saw quite easily that it wasn't true.

If the entire top is that thick it's going to way a ton and cost a fortune in wood probably.

Here's how I'd approach it....

* Do some sketches and decide on some measurements.
* Shop around at some wood shops and lumber mill type places.  You're not going to find the wood you need at the home centre.
* Talk to the people there and get their opinions on the woods to use and the various cuts they have available.
* Come up with a ball park price and decide if you still want to build it.
* If you still want to go ahead, as someone else mentioned, I'd start making a few cutting boards with your wood of choice.   Get a feel for the wood and work out the kinks in the gluing and laminating process.  Figure out the type of glue to use, the joining, gluing and sanding process. 
* Work your way up in size.  Maybe do an end table or something.
* If all is still good and you're still interested... pull out the credit card, buy a truckload of wood and go to town!

To be honest, I don't come to this section very often, but I don't mind the advertisement. I think it might be a bit obnoxious if this ""catches on"" but for the time being, my feeling is ""who cares?""

I'm sure you know more than anyone that most of us just mentally block out the hundreds of advertisements we see each day. I saw this, this method works, and I think it can be non intrusive when done right.  I believe you would have seen a tremendously better response in user reaction by not altering the bullets and the background. These tend to ""invade"" our reading space to the extent that we are forced to see them. An alternative may have been to put some additional information at the bottom of the webpage rather than use a background.

I say you should put information specifically. Give us a great price on something relevant to us in exchange for coming into our reading space. Tell us why you chose to sponsor this reddit. There are many ways to advertise by adding information; and ultimately, value. 

I guess that's about it. Honestly, I didn't think it was a big deal, and could have done without the background.  Thank you for taking a personal approach towards marketing. I visit office depot regularly. It's a good store, feels just like a staples. Your employees aren't always the happiest people in the world, but it's an office store and it gets the job done. I've yet to see you guys have good prices on anything though. Stores are so big and so frequent now that you don't carry anything that can't be bought elsewhere cheaper.

Two things worked for me to get a bit better. The first is to squint at the image or person  - (I'm terrible at drawing from real life, which is an awful thing but i'm not aiming for professional anyways) - squinting helps seperate the light from the details. Second is, if you're drawing from a computer picture, is to take it into photoshop and raise the levels up and down over and over while you watch the image. The light rises and falls in the highlights and darks, and you can get a very good idea where the source is and how it's falling and also it can help you accent the anatomy. 

That last one is a bit of a cheat. Like I said, I'm not a professional fine-artist nor do I ever pose as one. I *do* some graphics design work, but I'm more into 3d and animation, and beyond that i'm still in school. So take everything I said with a mine of salt. ","1285896874"

"chemistry","t5_2qhf9","One thing they usually fail to drive home is how useful dimensions are to both getting clues as to how to find a solution and in checking to see if your solution makes any sense.  

Through all my experience with science and engineering my teachers seemed to focus on just encouraging us to build the habit of including dimensions in all calculations without really doing a good job of driving home the importance of it.

The thing that they almost never mentioned is how useful they can be when you have no clue at all about how to solve a problem.  For instance if you know you are looking for speed (m/s) and you have energy(J), mass(kg), temperature(C), time(s) or what ever else but you have no idea really how to solve the problem one of the first steps you can do is just see which quantities you have that have relevant dimensions.  In this case you can immediately see that you will have to use energy because it is the only possible source of m.  Temperature can be ignored because C doesn't show up anywhere else and mass and time may be needed to cancel out the extra mass and time components in J = kg\*m/s^2.  So without any real understanding of the problem you have a clue that your solution might look something like energy * time / mass = (kg\*m/s^2)*s/kg = m/s.

Now, IIRC, they only let you donate a maximum of once every three days (giving time for the swimmers to reassert themselves), so you would have had to take 9,084 days to reach that level.

-Funding has been absolutely proven to be completely unrelated to performance.
citation: http://kansas.watchdog.org/1224/catos-chart-of-the-day-federal-education-spending/

The biggest problem in the U.S. is the teachers unions from first grade to graduate school.  Technology should have drastically lowered the cost of a university education.  In fact, because of the delivery method of many university courses video on demand, video conferencing and distance learning should have EXPONENTIALLY lowered the cost by any reasonable measure. The reality is that the number of teachers and professors has skyrocketed over 10 times that of enrollment.

Reducing the poverty level cannot be an answer.  The Chinese score markedly better on math and science and the average income is about ten percent of that in the United States, so that is also a non starter.

In the fifties and sixties the youth movement made a concerted effort to change the education system culminating with the dept. of education under Carter.  
But what did your ""liberal"" professors do once they had control of the system? They turned in to union things across the entire education spectrum. They focused all of their intention on ""getting theirs"" meaning big money, big benefits and security to rival the Soviet Politburo.  Then they added courses of study like cultural studies, environmental studies, multi-media degrees, and social issues programs that created jobs for teachers, professors and administrators.

The end result? A large portion of the current generation with enormous debt from student loans and little or no marketable skills.

The problem isn't lack of money, it is too much money and the power that comes with that money is used to line the education class pockets. Students are simply the numbers run through the system to justify the never ending demand for more funding.

Over the past forty years, public school employment has risen 10 times faster than enrollment

But to pay money for a weekend-long camp and die in the 1st 5 minutes and have to spend the weekend at a base would really, really lame.

I'm really not a very vain person but I obviously like to think that there wouldn't have been an Internet explosion without my post.

I think I'm in a safe place to say it wasn't a PR campaign because I believe that if it weren't for my post it wouldn't have left reddit. I gained nothing from it in the physical world. I just makes me happy to think that I made a lot of people get behind something and, holy shit, it then became a reality.



And about the reddit admin conspiracy?? I know that reddit got some PR out of it. But other than a couple of blog posts it was all community driven. And it was the community that supported those posts anyway. Shit, I just checked and there were 3 blog posts pertaining to the Colbert Rally.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Good for you for your self-advocacy.  An informed consumer is a better consumer. I myself have two low deductible insurance plans, so my out of pocket expense is, essentially, zero.  And yet, I always ask for the generic meds unless there is a good reason for the name brand (or no generic at all). 

The Nexium example is a special case. The same drug, highly advertised so patients demand it, so docs prescribe it. 

But these examples are not the big costs of health care, though they may seem like a lot to you and me.  The big costs are the cutting edge diagnostics, therapies, medications, and procedures. People want all these, even when they are told they are not likely to improve their outcome. 

Lets look at your first example.  An MRI for a kidney stone.  That could have been diagnosed with clinical exam, radiographs, and ultrasound, or the preferred treatment, helical tomography scan.  MRIs are the most expensive scan and usually used if you're pregnant, since they involve no radiation. Alas, they are not as good at imaging small blockages. So you saved money on the EKG, a relatively small cost, and bought yourself an MRI, a very expensive imaging procedure.  This isn't your fault.  How are you supposed to know this?  See the problem?

We save some money on the nickel and dime stuff, and get beat up on the high dollar stuff.

I don't have an answer for this, but, ultimately, I don't think high deductible medical plans are the answer.  Time will tell.

Some things to help this drawing be better - as you are flowing through the figure, be mindful of the overall angles. Notice how the overall angle of the back causes your figure to feel like she his tilting to the right too much - [see image](http://i.imgur.com/dk2sZ.jpg).

It kills me to see some headline on CNN that says ""People Who Like Chocolate Ice Cream More Likely To Commit Arson, Researchers Say"". The researchers said no such thing, but may have found that coincidentally, two participants in a study who both favored chocolate ice cream admitted playing with matches as children. It's not statistically significant by any measure (p 0.05 or even close), but it sure makes an eye-grabbing headline. The same thing is done to other fields of study, but those fields are much more established. It's easier to believe some whacked-out psychological claim than it is to believe the local nightly news headline ""Bananas: The New Killer?"".

Yes, but most of my views developed from passive observations.

"California","t5_2qhsz","I think your making a critical flaw in your analysis, Marijuana when legalized will turn someone a profit, it is inevitable.  I don't want small sales from local drug dealers or local production of marijuana, I also don't want people below the age of 21 to smoke marijuana.  Kids can't drink alcohol and I don't find it crazy to use the same restrictions to minors that use.  

My comparison isn't to be taken that literal, my message was about compounding victories.  Is this law perfect to your liking?  No, but if this vote is seen as a legitimizing agent of marijuana then you could lobby the SA to pass the precise laws you want.  This is much easier when the public has shown support for marijuana then when Prop 19 loses and it is widely seen as a defeat of pot.  

I think you need to stop thinking idealistically and put on a pragmatic political cap.  I read Joedub's post and I think what he wants is politically unfeasible primarily because he is advocating to allow young adults access to pot, to purchase from current dealers, for everyone to grow their own weed, etc.  People should not be able to grow it everywhere the mercury bulbs are a hazard and it flaunts zoning laws to turn residential property into farm land.  Point being is get this success then change the law to be more small business friendly.  Eevn if it is illegal for small growers to operate without a license very few ""Of the more than a thousand dispensaries operating in California until a recent L.A. crackdown, only a handful were licensed.""  People who are breaking the law will still be criminals, but the consumer will get cheap easily available weed and other states would be able to build on its success.

"needadvice","t5_2r367","The then girlfriend was in the car with me when we got hit, but nothing happened to either of us --- mostly just shaken up.  The car was a complete write off.  He managed to hit the main wiring harness near the battery, which pretty much would have required a whole electrical work out - the insurance adjuster looked at it and just said, ""yeah, it's done"".  5 minutes of him checking it out.  

Luckily (???) I was leaning in the other driver's truck cab waiting for him to produce the license/insurance, and on the phone with the police when he took off, so I just screamed the plate info at the poor officer on the other end.  

So, it's the middle of October, starting to get chilly (a few degrees above 0C), and we got some great witnesses --- a transit bus driver gave us his card, and another couple who saw what happened.  That same couple (who were on their way to bible study) went to Wendy's and picked us up some cheeseburgers and hot chocolates while we waited for the police to show up...best thing that could have happened to us at that point.  

Fast forward to a few weeks later, and I get a check for $8500 for the car.  It was a no fault claim, so no rate increase.  I had the 'touring' option, so I had a free rental covered by insurance for the 3 weeks I was without .  A little later, a call from the police indicating that they know who hit me, they have a warrant for his arrest, however, he's left the province.  That was the end of that.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; 1) God is an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, loving deity that transcends the limitations of time and space. From whom all things find their cause. 

Most importantly, it transcends the limitations of logic and reason as omnipotence is self-contradictory (can god give himself a task, he is not able to solve?). Without reason and logic however we are not able to make any sense of god, which would made your whole debate senseless.

&gt; 2) I believe you should believe in him for the same reason I believe you should hold to a heliocentric view of the solar system or the big bang. I believe that truth is something that one should inherently strive to understand.

I hold a heliocentric view of the solar system because I can actually ""see"" it to exist this way. I have some more trouble seeing the existence of god. The first step in understanding ""truth"", btw, would be to understand that it is not an empty phrase that can be tagged to your god because it sounds so nicely and important.

&gt; 3) I believe that the Christian God is the right God because of key problems I see with other religions. These contentions include contradictions (I'll gladly answer contradictions you see in the Bible), historical issues, theological problems, etc.

Those other religions have the same problem with you. From a neutral point of view (which atheism is in this case), theists of different religions, arguing about who has the right god is about as amusing as watching a brain rot. All their arguments against each other are equally silly. 

As for contradictions in the bible: yes, we all know they are just contradictions in words, not in ""truths"". Though, I always wondered why god forbade adultery in the ten commandments, had Jesus confirm several times how bad it is to fuck another man's wife, yet, somehow saw it fit to sneak Joseph a little bastard.
Another thing, I just can't get my head around is the fact that god cursed the snake in the most poetic way in Genesis, emphasizing that mankind and serpents would forever be mortal enemies. Yet, when it was time to sent Moses to pharao, he taught the man this little sticks to snakes parlor trick. The same trick, pharaos priests were also so adept at performing. Did god borrow Amun Ra's 101 spellbook at that weekend or could it actually be that Moses was following a completely different deity there?","1285897135"

The landing was kept secret while the governments planned a PR campaign to slowly adjust society to their presence.

The first step, if I remember rightly, was the announcement of the discovery of an Earth-like planet. Then it was announced that they had discovered life on this planet. Then they discovered the planet was technologically advanced, etc, etc. You can see where this is going.

The PR department then contacted a TV network and developed a puppet show featuring some lizard-like aliens. It became a huge sensation with the population. Then, it turns out, that creatures from the extra-solar planet landed on earth and, gasp, were just like the lizard creatures from the puppet show and everyone adored them.

Of course politicians don't control much of anything, especially in a heavily capitalist country with copious amounts of freedom - the people control things. If you lose your job, it's not a politician or a lizard man, but another human with stresses, worries, failings, virtues just like you. It is when we decide that certain people *can* be in control of us, when we let ourselves be guided blindly and unquestioningly, when we start to be treated not like humans, but like cells - suited for a purpose, but ultimately disposable and replaceable.

There was a quote by Alan Moore somewhere around these parts some time ago, and it's approximated by this:

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; First I must explain all that I know of God

Again, you cannot know anything about God without knowing his works, if you refute the Bible and all organized religion, then you have no basis for a God at all. You weren't born into this world knowing God, nobody is and I am fairly sure I can find a way to prove that rather easily given some time. You were born in wondering how you came to be, and since you have no proof of a prime mover it could just as easily be thousands of Gods, or an impersonal force, eg. Brahman yet you are insistent that this singular God exists. It just occurred to me that the idea of many Gods (that still obviously persists in many religions) would at least be able to account for what Monotheism cannot, the duality of this God. Angry Gods, or Happy-Pot-Smoking-Gods, or Child-Raping Gods, theists then would be able to explain things a little bit better.

&gt; You are keeping the relationship between man and God too close to a relationship that a human would have with another human.

Correction, **you** are keeping the relationship that way. You are suggesting that the God you know cares one iota about a petri dish worshiping him. If indeed there is a God I would put forth the idea that he created us and went on his way, leaving us to our own devices and not really caring if we lived/died or worship him in any way. You have only circumstantial evidence that such a God even exists, assuming he cares is simple arrogance when put into your terms. The idea that you were created by someone who is indifferent I think scares people more than not knowing how they were created in the first place. Just the idea that any of us even matter in the grand scheme of things is arrogant; Sagan said it best so I shall quote him, ""Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe..."" This same arrogance is what hurts us when left unchecked, it is a required feature of humanity, but it can also quickly lead to our undoing when it is fully within our means to eradicate all life as we know it on this planet.

&gt; Do you get on your hands and knees to show a herd its time for them to eat grass?

Have you ever raised animals? When you want them to be healthy you feed them, when they don't eat you put the food to their mouths, if they continue to not eat you try something else... It is in your best interest that they survive and flourish.

&gt; Yet here we are coming to the same conclusion that man cannot know God.

Exactly, but you still assume he exists and requires worship. Whereas I simply believe something could indeed have created us, billions of years ago, but it need not be explained as a God by any stretch of the imagination, it could just as easily be Spongebob.

My point concerning the Bibles' original text is that if you are going to know Gods word then you would need to read his word at least in the language it was written down, assuming of course there wasn't errors in translation then. Most theists argue that His word cannot be changed, that then creates the hypocrisy of an english version; however, you seem to take a different tack, one less subjective which I applaud, but equally filled with holes since you don't think the Bible is even true, which would serve only to disprove your entire theory in the process.","1285897184"
"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;You have to admit that if god is real than he does a very good job of hiding himself for no apparent reason.

Both to TheAughtSpectrum &amp; GJENZY, I don't see any of your questions or further probing of the answers given to be rude at all. My hope is that you are not finding our answers to be rude, evasive, or antagonistic. Having faith in the unseen is a powerful theme in Christianity, so no matter how much we talk about this, there is going to be a level of ambiguity that is unpleasant and possibly unacceptable for people who rely upon the scientific method to understand the universe, or what we would call, ""Creation.""

You ever play the map game? You know the one where you have a map of a region of your state, you find a word on it &amp; challenge your partner to find that word. The ones that seem to be most elusive are the ones that hide in plain sight. Sure, you can probably find the name of a small township, but are you going to be able to find the name of a county that is in much larger letters in a lighter shade spread across the map?

Sometimes the bigger and more obvious something is, the harder it is to see. How much more so would an Infinite God be to ""quantify""?

We all have the same data. We all see fossils and atoms and stars, yet when we put the pieces together, we see different things. When you see a bunch of fossils, you see a progression of mutations that leads you to believe in evolution. I'm a former evolutionist, but as I started looking more closely at the same fossils, there were gaps and jumps that evolution simply did not adequately explain well enough to me.

When I look at the species of the world, they are perfectly adapted to their surroundings. If something happens where their environment changes or they are no longer well adapted to their life, that species becomes extinct. I do not see California Condors adapting to the dams that have been built in their environment. I DO see falcons that have adapted to the relatively new presence of skyscrapers, but that falcon is the same as the falcon from 2000 years ago. I understand different theories that talk of evolutionary ""leaps"" as the climate drastically changes, yet humanity has drastically changed the climate, and I'm not seeing any species that are different from their pre-civilization counterparts. Either the species find new ways to live in a different setting like elk shifting from a plains animal to a mountain animal, or the species simply dies.

When I look at this, I see species that were created. I could go on and on about things we observe and conclusions reached on the molecular level and the intergalactic level. I could talk of the Fibonacci Sequence being in all of creation from snail shells to ratios of bones in the human body to flowers to galaxies and ask how you could NOT see a Divine Pattern in...everything.

&gt;If god would simply show himself

Please understand that I am not mocking you with this statement, but He DID show Himself as Jesus Christ. The Bible says that Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. Not only are you having difficulty believing this was ""God's Grand Appearance,"" His very chosen people had difficulty accepting it because He didn't show in the way they WANTED Him to show.

We rely upon the eyewitness account of the Apostles through the text of Scripture and other historic documents, yet even Jesus' disciple, Thomas, refused to believe the words of his own best friends and said that he had to touch the holes in His hands and His side before he would believe. Christ gave him that opportunity, and then He said, ""You believe because you have seen; Blessed are those who haven't seen yet still believe.""

I could continue to give you personal testimony as to the encounters I've had with Christ and the miracles that I have seen, but would you believe me? Even if you believed that I believed what I was experiencing, would you simply put it in the category of the ""Texas Sharpshooter"" fallacy?

Accepting Christ is about letting go...letting go of previously conceived notions, letting go of religious indoctrination that was given to you when you were growing up, letting go of your right to look intelligent.

Please understand that my comments mean no disrespect to you...in fact if I didn't respect your presentation of your questions and probing of the answers you are given, I wouldn't have even wasted my time responding to you. I would sincerely hope that you would come to see and experience and even love the Christ who I love, but that's not up to me. I will settle for us respecting one another and agreeing to disagree. Blessings to you.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Yes, the ""software rendering"" uses the DirectX warp DLLs. Use ProcessExplorer to verify this fact.

IE9 when running ""Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering"" *unchecked* has these DLLs loaded:

* ...
* d2d1.dll
* d3d10.dll
* d2d10_1.dll
* d3d10_1core.dll
* drd10core.dll
* DEVRTL.dll
* ...

With it checked, it has:

* ...
* d2d1.dll
* d3d10.dll
* d2d10_1.dll
* d3d10_1core.dll
* drd10core.dll
* D3D10Warp.dll
* DEVRTL.dll
* ...

When you turn off hardware acceleration, it takes advantage of the Vista SP2 and Windows 7 feature of D3D10Warp. You can think of it sort of like CUDA or OpenCL. Basically, they ported a subset of DirectX to rasterize using an x86 CPU. Could they have ported the entire new rendering stack, with DirectX 10 and 11 to Windows XP? And ported over the DWM? And the new driver API? Yes, ostensibly, the answer to that will always be yes.

But if it's so easy, why don't *you* do it. Eh? Come on.

And if they should port that to XP, why not any other arbitrary feature? Why not every feature? The answer to that is simple, you paid for XP and the maintenance on it and you knew what you were buying, or would have had you known. And Microsoft, once an OS is released, has the policy that at best you should expect maintenance: bug fixes and security fixes. If a service pack or other update adds a *feature*, then it's coincidence, or it was easy to code for, or the development team requested time to do it, or whatever. But *features* are rare in service packs. For example, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 are receiving two large virtualization features, but they're doing that because testing for those features would have delayed the main OS release, which they felt was solid and the features were incomplete.","1285897261"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","People actually spend relatively little of their reading time seeking out unfamiliar authors. People tend to buy because they like the author's previous work, or have heard good things from someone they trust.

It's a shame that good critique of books is a dying art. Proper reviewers (and being a good critic is completely a sophisticated art in itself) are getting less and less page space in the popular press. So we see sensations like Twilight or the Da Vinci code or whatever boom in a way like we have never seen. These aren't causally related, but parts of a shifting discourse around books and reading.

Word of mouth sans communal hubs, be they the London Review of Books or a spec fic enthusiast's web site, degenerates into a popularity contest where the loudest noises drown out the gentler ones. It all becomes very meme driven.

A more powerful word of mouth approach, for me, is stuff like 'if you have enjoyed X you might also enjoy Y' but in a more sophisticated way than Amazon etc do it, which is correlation via sales patterns rather than aesthetics. Some of the algorithms being developed around this are fascinating - much along the lines of what we see in predictive music sites, where the software learns you like female folksy tunes around 60bpm or whatever and works outward from that.

You're right that in an information-rich and busy world, trusted filters become important. At the moment, a publishing house serves that function, but there will be other more fluid and inclusive ways soon too.

EDIT: I don't mean to diss Twilight. It offers its own satisfactions to its readers, and it's not like there is only one true aesthetic we need to strive towards. It's not my personal cup of tea, but I don't resent it in any way.","1285897307"

What do you average in gross pay per week? If there is no room for advancement, why haven't you gone elsewhere where there could be advancement? 

If you make $120 for two nights, you made $15/hour that night. Getting home early and making $20 sucks, but for how many hours? What is the average hourly rate across a week? across a month? How many hours per week are you working? If its less than 40, why don't you have another job? 

Why do you (seem to) feel like its wrong that you have to claim tips as income? (perhaps you mention this because I mentioned my ex got hers tax-free, if so feel free to disregard, I know many do have to pay tax on their tips and I think they should, but I wasn't going to rat out my girlfriend to the IRS.)

I didn't say you make too much money. I said I understand the point the guy is making, that if I went to Oregon I wouldn't tip, and that I know several waitstaff that make fairly good money doing it with no initial investment and no special skills.

I'm sorry for all the questions, but I'm trying to understand your point of view and I need some context for your experiences.  If you're only working 3 days a week (fri/sat/mon), I can't say you've convinced me of anything. If you're working 40 hours a week or more and STILL haven't made over $8/hour to the point where switching from tips to minimum wage would be beneficial, well then I certainly would be forced to re-examine things.

Of course, there is the possibility that additional non-weekend time might end up pushing the average hourly rate down due to less people eating out during the week and thats why you only work 3 days a week, but then the question is, why do you not have another job. 

I won't hypothesize further though, I'll wait for you to get back to me.","1285897327"

No, it wasn't. All that's been determined is that it's of an Earth-like size and in the so-called ""habitable zone"", which means it's in a place in orbit of its star that is neither too hot nor too cold for life to exist there.

That doesn't mean that humans or even life in general *can* live there, it just means it's passed a critical test that means it's *possible* for life to exist there.

Having said that, I'll say the same thing I said to the ""would you help colonize Mars"" question: Probably not. I'm no pioneer. I'm far too attached to my creature comforts and high technology to want to go on some far-flung adventure to another world.

Also, a thousand people is not enough for a viable population. The genetic base would be far too small.

And in specific reference to *Songs of Distant Earth*, that novel also didn't involve any actual human beings colonizing other worlds; the worlds were terraformed by machines which used preserved embryos to create a human population there.","1285897358"

&gt;in our finite minds /
&gt;of laws behind /
&gt;the things we find /
&gt;with science

&gt;And on the internet i saw /
&gt;a billion people, maybe more /
&gt;People clinging to old delusions /
&gt;People jumping to conclusions /
&gt;People holding superstitions that are obviously quite absurd /
&gt;Who'd never heard /
&gt;a single word /
&gt;of science /

&gt;How do you think a doctor knows /
&gt;How a disease like cancer grows? /
&gt;How did we learn how me might treat it? /
&gt;How do you think one day we might beat it? /
&gt;It won't be by taking sugar pills /
&gt;or standing on one leg for hours /
&gt;while eating flowers /
&gt;But through the power /
&gt;of science /

&gt;If you have answers and you're sure /
&gt;They're better than what came before /
&gt;Make your hypothesis and test it /
&gt;Take the results you've collected /
&gt;Then you write them in a paper /
&gt;and submit it for peer review /
&gt;That's what we do /
&gt;To check it's truly science /

&gt;And the people stood and prayed /
&gt;They said ""our faith cannot be swayed"" /
&gt;They have their views and they won't move them /
&gt;They have their truths and they won't prove them /

I prefer sharrows to full bike lanes because lanes build the mentality that bikes don't belong in the road, but off to the side out of the way of cars. And once a new rider gets comfortable in the traffic lane on the sharrows it's not as big a leap to an unmarked roadway with no bicycle markings at all.

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","**Current:** I haven't found anything worth driving in quite a while.  Not only that, but as a freelancer who is just *barely* managing to make rent, I'm gonna have to keep rawkin' the '95 Ticket Me Red Dodge Stealth I've been driving since 2002.  It has new heads, a new radiator, a new water pump, and decent rims and, oddly enough, still turns heads.  Not bad for a car with an NADA value under $3000.

**Lifetime:**  I'll [build me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnuRNu-FV4) or [buy me](http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Replica-Kit-Makes-GTM-SUPERCAR-2010-FACTORY-FIVE-GTM-LS6-CORVETTE-G-50-50-_W0QQcmdZViewItemQQhashZitem2a0a35caebQQitemZ180559923947QQptZUSQ5fCarsQ5fTrucks) a Factory Five GTM one of these days.  Considering it appears to cost about $70k to build one to order but they can be bought driving off eBay for $30-45k, I'm thinkin' ""buy.""  I used to really want a Lotus Esprit, until I discovered I was simply too tall to sit in one.  And I'd love an Acura NSX, but if I were going that way I'd love a NEW Acura NSX and should Honda decide to revive the brand it appears they're going front engine, rear drive and that's bullshit.

**Impossible:**  There is something about a Duesenberg.  Time stops when you're near them.  When you see one driving by, they exude a temporal fugue straight out of Dungeons and Dragons.  I've also been fond of the [McLaren F1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXqSedWSu2k) since it was announced, but having been in a room with two Veyrons at once, I found the experience underwhelming.  I used to fixate on the Diablo until I sat in one and felt like a Jersey Shore douchebag.  I used to fixate on the Stratos until I sat in one and it reminded me of my dad's Saab Sonnet IV.  So I think maybe ""impossible"" things should always be ""impossible"" lest reality interfere with one's dreams.  

Except Duesenbergs are still pretty damn magical.

I've seen RS200s go for under $100k, by the way.  I'm still not sure why you'd ever want one - they're ugly as home-made sin and the Group Cs they're running these days are actually faster - but they aren't unattainable.  I once saw a non-kit Stratos go for $35k.  The weirder a car, the more volatile its value.  Keep hope alive.","1285897411"

Men, when in power took care of men and women and children.  Women in power laugh and humiliate men, take away our rights, and then try to colonize and appropriate our maleness towards their ends.

I hate female nature and since feminism is the same as female nature, well then, I hate feminism.  Do you know where the word comes from?

Way back in the day, feminism meant the nature and behaviors and characteristics associated with the feminine, or women.  It was originally observations made by mean, and was referred to as feminine-isms.  Then the suffragetes appropriated the word in the 19th century.

Because the great thing about teamfortress 2 was not just game itself but the fact is you pay 20 dollars like everyone else and you are entitled to a host of additional maps, weapons and a chance to win a hat. Now to have a chance tp enjoy some of this stuff you have to pay an additional amount of money which is kinda lame.","1285897433"

That if a church mixes politics with their preaching, the IRS may revoke their tax-exempt status for a year or more at its discretion.

I wonder if this could somehow be applied to the WBC. Are they a tax-exempt non-for-profit? Can their status be revoked, on the grounds that the content of their protests and the venues where they choose to hold them venture awfully close to political speech?

I know it's a stretch, but maybe there's an angle there somewhere. Lawyers and accountants of Reddit -- any chance the WBC could get audited?","1285897491"

re: austerity measures - 

The state is not monolithic. Many people are dependent on it. This is a method by which the state propagates itself, but the removal of austerity measures has a direct impact on many people's lives.

While I can see an argument that austerity movements may be positive in sparking resistance and popular uprisings (hey, look at Spain!) I'm not about to say that's anything like good. Can't we have austerity measures applied to the military and cops?

(Of course, that's what we just saw in Ecuador. The answer is that the military defends itself, and since they're the ones who are trained and issued arms, it's difficult to say no to them.)","1285897495"

My point is that piracy is a reality.  And the facts of the internet (ease of access and difference in copyright law from country to country) indicate that stopping all piracy (or enough to make content distributors happy) is unlikely to happen.

I love how you put in your blog that Rush has revealed his agenda to bring down this country. WoW talk about paranoia and delusions!!! As always you on the liberal left are so full of hatred YOU are the HIPPOCRATES!!! You talk about freedom of speech yet you want to run this fine American tax contributing alpha male out of our country why because his/our point of view clashes with yours? That’s censorship and against the First Amendment.  All you did in your rant was do a lot of name calling and spewed a bunch of unfounded, baseless, fictional allegations, hell they are just outright LIES! This is always the typical reaction of those of you thinking you are so high and mighty but when things don’t go your way, you stoop to name calling. I don’t care for fags or lezbos but that doesn’t mean I’m a homophobe. I had friends who were gay, now they are all dead (AIDS), oh well. I don’t hate them I just don’t care for them or their way of life. So can’t I have the freedom of choice of how I live and whom I call as my friends? I do unto others as I would like them to do unto me. I like how you call Rush a “NAZI WANNABE” and immediately after that you state how you want to run him out of the country… I bet you feel like that about any of us who think and feel just like he does. I bet you would probably even prefer to round us up and stick us in an oven… Yeah who’s the Nazi-Wannabe NOW?!

im a really reserved person and I'm bad at talking in front of groups, i get noticeably shaky and sometimes my voice starts to become noticeably effected. i got up there shaking like a motherfucker because i was about to tell them all (as directed by the assignment) that they should vote for the hypothetical ""Cannabis Party"" and as the assignment directed, go all out, attacking opposition, not exposing any weakness, and sensationalizing where possible.

I let loose a relentless stream of facts, tangible to the un-interested 7th period government class, they stopped murmuring about other topics as soon as i started off with the word ""cancer"" followed by a host of other relevant and recognizable medical ailments. I had their attention. I went on to say that it could make society a better place by actually combating harmful substance abuse and asserting it as a counter to the gateway drug theory.

I cited its use historically in Greece and ancient middle eastern civilizations and ended on a strong note of saving money and government resources.

against 5 other parties (kind of single issue parties) we got 60% of the vote and it made my day

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Thanks for coming to debate.  In any case, let's begin,  I'm separating this reply into two sections for ease, leading with counterargument and then using my argument, there may be some overlap but I'll try to keep it low.

**Counter Argument**

You said your best arguments were as such:

1) Philosophical. 

Needs extrapolation.

2) Historical. 

Most corroboration for the events of the bible is incredibly poor.  Josephus was obviously altered because he was a pharisee and would never have claimed the divinity of Christ and Tacitus didn't actually confirm any divinity and probably used unofficial sources because he screwed up Pontius Pilate's title, which would have been readily available.  In the end, you can just compare it to any other religion/god and see the ridiculousness of it.  How many written documents would I need to convince you of the existence of Isis or Thor?  It's all just faulty appeals to authority and hearsay.  This suffices for a lot of history, but one of the requisites for determining if a document has historical value is if its contents are fairly normal or borderline preposterous.  The bible has stories about angels, dragons, talking donkeys, etc. that make it no better a historical document than the odyssey.  In this sense, I accept no written documents as proof of the supernatural.

3) Experiential. 

All gods/religions have adherents making this claim for very different ideologies and gods.  That they are all mutually exclusive shows that this is not a good argument.  Of course if you could furnish some evidence as to why your god is true and not a hindu's despite the same evidence, I'd be glad to hear it.

4) Personal Experience 

Isn't this the same as 3?  Or is this specifically you?  In any case, I don't see how your testimony is any more legitimate than that of you, some other christian, or a hindu.

Argument:

There's roughly 3 arguments that cover 90% of why to be an atheist.

- Don't believe in the extraordinary without evidence:

Before we figure out if any Gods exist, let's figure out what's in my pocket.

There's a basic scale of things which must exist, should exist, can exist, shouldn't exist and can't exist.

If I ask you to figure out what's in my pocket, you can say air must exist in there, a wallet should, a bottle opener can, a hand grenade shouldn't, and the planet saturn can't.

I'd say that even with no evidence, God is so extraordinary and beyond normal thinking that you're somewhere between shouldn't and can't. The notion of god has paradoxes such as the omnipotence paradox, euthyphro dilemma, and the statistical inefficacy of prayer.
 which make things difficult to say that he can exist, and that he would be so out of the ordinary (like a hand grenade, or a Fabergé egg), it's at the very least in the 'shouldn't' category.

You could have faith, a strong personal conviction or a deep feeling, but none of that would have any bearing on if there actually is anything in my pocket.

Given that you seem to understand skepticism as the default position, I'd imagine that you have no problem with this.
 
- Once you understand why you don't believe in any other Gods or religions, you'll understand why I don't believe in yours.

All religions have holy books, people claiming personal experience, written accounts of miracles etc. In the same way that you would never be able to accept that Quetzalcoatl exists based on that standard of evidence, you shouldn't believe that your God exists.

- If an argument for God is extremely vague, then it's probably tacking on assumptions or needless layers of complexity.

If we must ask where everything came from, then we should be dilgent and ask where God came from. If we're to conclude that the question is unanswerable, then we can save a step and conclude that the origins of the universe are unanswerable. If we're going to conclude that God is eternal, we can easily save a step and conclude that the laws of nature that spawned the universe are eternal.

Beyond that, if you're at a point where you don't know something, the default answer isn't God. When the greeks first looked up at the sun, they had no idea why it moved across the sky, so they defaulted the answer to Helios dragging the sun across the sky with his chariot. You can see where the reasoning is flawed in that.","1285897685"
"trees","t5_2r9vp","In fairness, it really doesn't compare to alcohol's type of regulation, at least in regards to how openly it will be sold and quantities of possession. Local governments will be the ones to dish out licenses to sell, grow and distribute, how much can be grown/transported, if at all, and how much can be legally possessed beyond the 1 ounce limit set by the bill. It does compare to alcohol in the way that it restricts access to minors though. 

That said, I'm excited to see the energy behind the bill. It's not perfect, but I think it will give momentum towards the cause of de-scheduling of cannabis, and end this ridiculous prohibition once and for all. That's all farther down the line, but it can begin in California. ","1285897685"

They vary, but the typical one being discussed has stop signs for all four incoming directions.  Whoever reaches the intersection first and has come to a full stop gets to proceed through the intersection first.  It gets slightly more complicated than that if people arrive at the same time and/or some are turning while others are going straight through, but not much (those going straight have right of way, those widdershins to the other have the right of way).  The other main thing is when there is a line of cars filing in from every direction, right of way generally alternates from one cross street to the other.

I guess this isn't a great explanation, and I don't know if I answered your concern.  The rules become so internalized that it's not easy to recodify them explicitly, kind of like grammar.

Their stuff is mostly for wool. Whether it would work for cotton, I don't know. It's also fairly expensive (thousands, but not hundreds of thousands). Even so, that only gets you yarn.

You'd still want some kind of loom and knitting machine. No idea where to look for those.

Anyway, my own goal is for about 800 pounds of cotton per year, consistently. With all the trash and seeds ginned out, figure that's halved for good cotton, and you'd still have more than you could ever use. I'm figuring I'd only need an acre or two of land.

"biblestudy","t5_2rfdk","Not terribly meaningful from a theological perspective, but it's interesting that they went in at night. Night raids like this were really dangerous because there were essentially no uniforms, just armor, and in the low light of various campfires it was too easy for one force to get confused and for the entire operation to be a total poochscrew. In order to pull something like that off, they'd have to really know what they were doing.

So, when Genesis mentions 318 fighting men, I'd say these were more like elite commandos, meaning either everyone in Abraham's group was the best warrior of their day, or they had upwards of 3,000 people in their camp, and these were the best of the best.","1285897708"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","OUCH!

Mine was at a mall a few weeks ago. I was standing at one of those rotating clothes racks and mine wasn't turning very smoothly and people were occasionally applying full force to get it to turn.

I remembered that the last time I was here, an employee fixed it by tightening/adjusting the big rod in the middle of the rack. Wanting be a 'hero' I put my hand through the clothes to what I assumed was the rod (I couldn't see, there were big hoodies on the rack), I was holding it in a weird position, with my thumb pointing down, and gave it a rigorous shaking, and finally i felt it snap back into its 'proper place'.

Relieved, I had a big smile on my face and kept holding onto the rod like an idiot. Now there were three people at the rack, one dude opposite me, and a mom and child to my left. Before I could take my hand out, the dude across from me, assuming the rack was still broken, turned it clockwise with full force propelling me cheek-first into the mother.

I was then involved in the most awkward collision I've ever been in, not only did I slam cheek first into the mother, but the momentum caused my free arm to wrap around her, making it look like I was trying something very naughty. When I looked at the man, I knew instantly that he knew what had happened because he was trying desperately to  hide a smile.

After many apologies, I exited the store without the deodorant that I had come to buy in the first place.","1285897711"

once I did those things, I started getting complimented on them, which in turn gave me confidence; since other people reaffirmed that my actions had worked, I started to believe in myself.

alcohol helps a lot, in social situations where it's appropriate. 

sometimes I still feel like shit about myself, but that's where being able to fake it like a champ comes in. eventually, fake it for long enough, you start to believe it again.

make a list of shit about yourself that makes you less confident; then try to change those things, little by little. building my confidence has been a product of two years of college, maybe a a little bit of high school and I'm still not all the way there.","1285897764"

And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term ""visiting hours"" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much.

There are lots of things that will probably help you sleep at this point.  The most mild of which is melatonin.  You can also find quite a few herbs that will help.

If you aren't prone to abusing benzodiazapines ... you could go to your doctor for a sleep aid.  He can also proscribe trazadone, which will knock you out and has little potential for habituation.  

These anxiolytics will also help immensely for the post acute withdrawal symptoms that you are experiencing during the day.  Another medication you can get for the anxiety and mental symptoms is called lyrica (pregabalin).  It's an interesting anxiolytic in that it is active on the GABA neurotransmitters, but has almost no potential for abuse.  This will very likely help with both your issues during the day, and help you sleep at night.  Though, I'm not sure it's approved for use in the US.  You should be able to get a related medication called nuerontin.

It might be good to see a psychiatrist even if you aren't sure what you want/need... just be honest and upfront about what/why you need help.

I think a lot of us are self-medicating... and when we come off the illegal drugs, we have to deal with both the cessation syndromes... and the fact that we have brain problems to begin with.

Also, if you want to go to group meetings ... check out the Alcoholics Anonymous...  They are much more mature usually than the NarcAnon groups... and generally are there because they want to be, rather than a court order or mom and dad.  They will definitely help you get through this... it's like all the kind-ness and empathy you've received from strangers on the internet, only in person with hugs and shit.","1285897771"

Well, now that there is a track record of promises vs “in office”: there being more than one Democratic president elected in the last 20 years, maybe Liberals can see a trend. And that it would be counter productive to be so disappointed to sit out midterm elections. 

It doesn’t make sense to me to see Democrats being so ultra disappointed with their elected leaders for reasons *x*, and then in the next breath be excited contrasting Clinton surpluses, taxation levels, economic performance compared to Dubya’s deficits and economic performance.

Secondly, I think that religious traditions have a HUGE advantage in this area, especially because they have been around for so much longer.  Their music is much more developed, has a great deal more variety, and speaks to a much broader spectrum of the human experience than secular humanist / atheist music.

That said, there is a lot of good stuff out there both Christian and otherwise, that is positive and enlightening. I think you can enjoy it all (which is probably not equally true for a Christian).

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Sorry - I'll try to explain as best as I can. 

Both are classes of anti-depressants.

NRIs work to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. In brief, this class may act as a stimulant to give you the energy and drive to get you up and out and moving. It seems as though you've been isolating yourself, so this may be the key to at least getting out of the house. Bupropion (aka Wellbutrin in the US) is a popular NRI. The effect of this medication is nearly instantaneous; there may be odd side-effects but you could experience stimulation/excitement within hours of your first dose.

SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of seratonin which will help stabilize your mood and increase your feelings of well-being and ability to feel pleasure. Basically, seratonin (a neurotransmitter) makes us happy - and typically - with people like you and I - our neurons will grab up the seratonin and send it ""down the line,"" without bothering to let it linger long enough for us to feel good. SSRI's inhibit this reuptake, leaving the neurotransmitter in the synaptic gap for a bit longer so we can start to feel its advantages. That's a very brief neurogenic synopsis, there of course is more involved, but that's the general gist. Fluoxetine (prozac) is an example of an SSRI. These take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to reach their full potential in benefits.

Not sure if/what the equivalents are in the UK, but definitely something to TRY before you throw in the towel.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I play one in my group, went with harrier build, because teleportation amuses me.  We've only played a bit so far (started at level 1), so I'm not terribly experienced with the class yet.  I think that it would be difficult to build an effective battlemind without having the Psionic Powers book, which has *not* been integrated with the character builder.  You'll have to build them by hand.  There just aren't enough sticky features.  Even now, they're still less sticky than most other defenders.

But so far:  
* They're pretty resilient, which is partially build-dependent - since my goal is to draw attention ASAP while the rest of the party is out of support range, resilience is necessary.  
* They're more mobile than other defenders, except for swordmages.  My DM likes to use kobolds a lot, and it's amusing to punish shifting.  
* They play really quick, because of the relatively limited range of actions - you have two or three at-wills, and a daily.  Augments just make your dailies do more of whatever they do (maybe expand the range, or allow you to use the ability against multiple foes) - there's fewer types of things I can do (can't fill in my coverage gaps with encounter powers).  This will no-doubt change in paragon and epic.  
* Most of my battle deliberation comes from deciding on movement choice, rather than power choice.  

They're not great at *preventing* damage, and they're not great at area denial, so far.  I tend to make up for the lack of denial by staying in front of the party (except for the rogue, who pretty much always gets sneak attacks from me), and playing aggressively enough that the foes can't ignore me.  That works for my group, but wouldn't work for many party compositions.  I'm definitely higher damage and more mobile than the Warden build our last defender used, though.

The way I've built/play is focused on getting to and occupying strikers and controllers quickly (Paired with the rogue, we're high enough damage to straight up kill many controllers and strikers in one round), or getting in the middle of enemy formations before they have a chance to get set up.  In closer-quarters situations, I'm pretty effective at getting to chokepoints fast, or getting into fortified areas.  Our wizard is pretty good about filling in my lack of stickiness in open situations.

Thunder (knockdown) or frost (slow) builds seem like viable ways to increase denial and stickiness, and synergize well with our wizard.  I'll probably play with the two and see how they work in battle.

Thematically, the Outer Planes stuff associated with psionics in general can be fun, and the persistent harrier ability is incredibly amusing, RP-wise.  The idea that the battlemind doesn't just teleport or shift for its abilities, but that it *warps time* has great RP potential.

If you want to do something nice for writers, go buy a book by an obscure, first time novelist. It's actually really important that people do that to keep new voices in print. Plus, a lot of really wonderful gems get lost in the Darwinian struggle that's the supply chain :)

If all that is fine it's probably the CPU or mobo. Take out the CPU and try it in another machine, or try another CPU in this machine (If either of those are available).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're absolutely right that I shouldn't make blanket states about all people and everyone, but it's hard to find any shred of support for people who don't want to walk in step with what the government and vaccine companies want.

I come across as anti-vaccine because all I see when I come on reddit is vitriol spewed at anyone who dares question vaccines (which have, in fact, caused some rather serious reactions and even deaths although that is incredibly rare). Vaccines do not cause autism. They can, however, result in high fevers and even seizures in rare cases.

Why vaccinate my child for a disease that is most deadly to infants younger than the age at which the vaccine is effective? I'm all for promoting herd immunity by vaccinating older children and keeping vaccines up for adults, but the benefit to clustering vaccines and delivering 33 of them in the first year of a baby's life is efficiency and convenience, not the thought of the reaction in the child's system (and you know what? I'd rather my daughter not deal with reactions mild or not to a vaccine as an infant)

Japan has a fully voluntary vaccination program which often sees their children being vaccinated later and they still have great (&gt;97% in most cases) coverage for their children. Unlike here where vaccines are legally required barring a *religious* exemption.

It's bad enough that I was vilified by the choice that my wife and I made to breastfeed our daughter (she's not putting on weight fast enough! formula is highly fortified these days and gives your child everything she need! don't worry about immunity conferred by breastfeeding, vaccines take care of that for you!). Nurses, pediatricians - we've caught flak from everyone except the nurses in the NICU where our daughter spent the first 72 hours of her life. We also didn't get the ""*it's all your fault when your daughter dies!*"" speech from them when we refused the HepB vaccine.

I'm just angry that everywhere I turn my liberty and self-determination and right to think for myself is being challenged by today's society. I have to admit that I don't believe in the paternalistic approach to medicine either, and so whether my daughter's pediatrician is ""cool"" with delayed or alternative vaccination schedules doesn't matter much if there's no opportunity to have a real dialog about it other than ""I'm the doctor and I'll tell you what's best"".

consider the following.

Time:  raise your hand if you use the metric system for measuring time.  no? how about advocating dividing the day into 10 parts and dividing those into 10 parts and so forth.  weeks having 10 days and shit.  sounds great doesn't it.  now i know what most of you are thinking, time is different and there isn't even a metric system for time well maybe time is different but on the second point you're dead fucking wrong, it was tried for about a month in france in the 1800s and you know what they discovered in that month?  the metric system fucking sucks.

Length:  so the base unit is a meter right.  what is a meter? nothing nothing from everyday life is a meter. not a single fucking thing. nothing is 2 meters things are 1.1 meters and 1.2 meters and .8 meters but there is absolutely nothing that is a meter.  what genius thought that up?

temperature:  ok so water freezes at 0 and boils at 100, who cares? raise your hand if you get out a thermometer to boil water. no you just set the burner to max.  and if the figures are only correct at sea level then what's your point for everyone living in colorado.  you know what, the significance of 100f its far more important, its the temperature of your baby at which you call the doctor.  can every person in the metric world agree and memorize the official temperature of a fever?

mass.  so the way the metric system works is that there is a base unit and that the powers of ten of that unit get prefixes right?  except that the base unit of mass in the metric system is a kilogram,  locked away in an underground vault in france there is a cube of rhodium about the size of a golfball that is THE KILOGRAM.  so kilokilograms and millikilograms and mega kilograms would actually be correct.  the metric system doesn't even get it's base units right.","1285897919"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","My advice: break up with him and find someone with a healthy sexual appetite. You'll be much happier and much better off.

You're clearly *not* happy in this relationship anymore. That is easy to see. If you were truly happy, you wouldn't be considering cheating.

Sex is a normal, healthy part of any loving long-term relationship. If you're not getting any, then you should really just leave and find someone else. Sexual dissatisfaction/lack of sex is one of the leading causes of divorce in the U.S. A lack of sexual activity in a relationship inevitably leads to resentment, and resentment leads to break-ups. 

The bottom line is that if you're unhappy in this relationship because you constantly feel sexually frustrated, then you need to tell your boyfriend that you're unhappy and leave. Just tell him that you feel that you two would be much better off as friends (since the sexual/romantic elements of your relationship seem to be pretty much gone at this point, anyway). A relationship without sex/romance isn't really a relationship. It's a friendship.

Break up with him and find someone that enjoys sex as much as you do. There are plenty of great guys out there with healthy, normal sexual appetites. You'll be much happier, trust me.","1285897929"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Where did I mention sex? In Islamic society, husbands also do not coerce wives for sex. That's kind of the point behind the Islamic rulings saying that a wife should not deny her husband sex without necessary cause (seeing as how he'll have no other outlets, not even masturbation... it goes both ways, but particular mention was made of women). God steps in and tells the wives they should voluntarily behave a certain way out of a sense of morality... He doesn't tell the husbands they can force themselves on their wives when they say 'no'.

If a husband could coerce his wife into sex, what would be the point of such a ruling? Why would God or the Prophet (saw) feel the need to address women at all? There wouldn't be one, and such hadiths would never have been uttered or recorded, because it would make no sense to have them in the first place since the woman would be entirely circumvented.

Secondly, the coercion I'm talking about is of two types. That done when socializing the next generation, your children. And that done by law enforcement (described in your post, the quote from the Turkish institute).","1285897929"

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","This suggestion is kinda boring, but I think it's so useful that it needs to be something more folks just do whenever they need a quick breakfast. Plug in your GF grill and let it get heating up a bit. Break an egg into a glass bowl, add just a tad of water, whip with a fork, add chopped onions, bell peppers, bits of last night's leftovers or whatever you have on hand (in very small quantities), or not as the mood suits and put in microwave, covered, for 30 seconds. While that's happening slice some swiss or cheddar cheese and get out a burrito wrap. Put the cheese on the wrap and when the eggs are done, dump them out onto the burrito and fold it up and put in the GF until it's toasted and you hear the cheese start to sizzle out. Remove, let cool while you pour coffee and enjoy what I call the 5 minute breakfast burrito.

I make burritos out of all sorts of stuff in the GF. Got some left over slices of London Broil and a burrito wrapper? You know what to do. Last night's leftover pizza slice and a burrito wrapper? Scrape the pizza toppings off in the burrito, roll it and you know where it's going. Another of my favs involves homemade goat mozerella, fresh basil and homemade tomato slices in the wrapper in the GF. You get the idea. Carry on. 

And, then of course there's paninis, grilled reubens, grilled cheese. Oddly, the one thing I don't do in mine is hamburger, or steak, cuz it dries out the uber lean stuff too much. ","1285897934"

It can also save your ass at possibly severe psychological and legal cost.  It seems from this story that this was probably one of the former situations.  Out of intuition, I believe that pizza delivery drivers would be safer as a whole unarmed than armed, but that's just my intuition.  I mean, it's not like he's an armored car driver, all he has is pizza and maybe $50 for you to steal, neither of which are worth pulling a piece over.

There are many reasons a victum would not want to report it. If she was in a relationship with the perpetrator (which happens more often than you'd think) she may have mixed feelings because she still cares for him. Maybe she is worried about developing a reputation, maybe she doesn't have a way to get to the hospital, or is scared of the rape kit (which can make many victims relive the rape)

===========================
I hated salads, my ex wife made this starter salad for me and I never looked back...
===========================
Get a big tub of baby spinach (ideally organic), it is small and nice and wont make you gag like some other leaves.
Put one big handful in a big bowl.
Add one teaspoon of Balsamic Vinaigrette and toss so every leaf is covered. 
Add 4 slices of picked beetroot (make sure the pickle vinegar doesnt contain Corn Syrup). 
Shake in some bacon bits (soy - no bacon). 
Add Half an avocado (see below). 
Add 8 Cherry Raisins. 
Add baby tomatoes if you like them. 
MANGE!

In time you can vary the contents and you can start enjoying salads when you dine out!

Avocado - to buy, squeeze it, it must not be hard or soft, but must just give ""a little""
To prep, cut it in half - note - there is a big round seed in the middle. Remove the seed, using a dull knife slice into the flesh five times verticaly and five times horizontally (cut into the flesh not through the skin) then scoop out with a large spoon and add to salad bowl.

Balsamic Vinaigrette - get organic or make it yourself - 5 ingredients
1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, tspoon local honey, 1 clove garlic (crushed -ikea garlic crusher), salt - put it all in a sealable tub and shake - keep it in th fridge
adjust the levels to your own taste
use the best balsamic vinegar you can afford, it makes a huge difference.","1285897961"

"itookapicture","t5_2r1tc","Hookers Point Power Plant, a 220-megawatt coal-burning facility located in Tampa, Florida, was retired in 2002. Yet today it remains on most lists of facilities in Florida and around the country where employees have been exposed to high levels of asbestos and are at risk for several asbestos diseases, including asbestosis and mesothelioma. This is because the use of asbestos as an insulator in coal-fired power plants and many other commercial installations was extremely common until the late 1960s. In fact, any area where extreme temperatures could be found, including hospital and school heating plants, are places where asbestos insulation was commonly used. Workers there have also been known to be at risk. However, older coal-fired power plants are among the most visible and most common at-risk sites.

If you had asked me 2 years ago, I would have been able to answer that no problem but since then I've run across some seriously potent and exotic strains (thank you college) However, if I had to narrow it down then it would still end a tie between these two:

Bruce Lee: The first real heady shit I ever smoked. I picked it up from a friend in Houston back in my freshman year of high school and brought that shit home like a trophy, showing all of my stoner friends. The 3 dense, half-purple half-green, perfect-gram-size nuggets were like nothing any of us had ever seen or smelled before. So my best friend and I immediately loaded a bowl in a homemade can pipe (oh yeeeeahhhh) and hit 2 bowls. That was truly the highest I've ever been. After about 30 minutes of just trying to comprehend how fucking high I was, I realized that I just absolutely couldn't handle it anymore and had to go to sleep.

Shoreline: The second one that comes to mind is the Shoreline another friend got from Houston a couple years ago. I bought a g off of him and brought it home wrapped up tightly in the plastic off the bottom of a cig pack and threw it in a drawer. Fast forward 1 hour, my entire house REEKS of dank. Faced with this serious predicament, there was only one thing to do. Bought a cyclone, packed that shit and smoked it with a few friends and hit a [10] no problem.","1285898024"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","God is not ""hiding Himself"" per se. Rather, we are so hardened and blinded by our sin that we do not see Him.

By the way, I'd like to clarify. By ""proof,"" I actually meant ""evidence."" Sorry for that.

**Logical Evidence**
A lot of the logical evidence for me is theological and philosophical. Christianity manages to sufficiently answer many philosophical issues, including theodicy (the problem of evil). And then there are issues like *ex nihilo* existence: something cannot come from nothing. Is our universe eternal? How can something physical be timeless? To clarify, I am not claiming that there is a single logical formula that *proves* Christianity, but many logical arguments exist that point to a god, even if it's not the Christian God.

**Historical Evidence**
If logical arguments can be made for *a god*, then historical evidence would differentiate Christianity from the rest, particularly when looking at the historicity of Christ. I admit that I do not have all the answers, nor could I articulate any answers as well as many others have in the past (for example, I understand Calculus but I could never teach it well). I'd recommend *More Than a Carpenter* by Josh McDowell and *Jesus Without Religion* by Rick James if you're really interested.

**Experiential Evidence**
But even without logical and historical evidence, I have experiential evidence. I've heard the gospel and I've experienced the grace of Christ. Scripture's claims against me -- that I am a rotten sinner, that I have rebelled against God, that I am evil, that I am not innocent -- are true. I know in my heart that God displayed the greatest love possible in His Son when He bore my sins. I know in my heart that Jesus is alive and I know that I could not deny Him even if I wanted to.

Without logical or historical evidence, the gospel would be enough for me. I am a very logical, rational person (problem solver, computer science degree, etc.) and when it comes to Christ, I find nothing illogical or irrational. For an outsider, this reasoning probably seems quite faulty, and I know that. But I'm fine with that, too.

I hope one day you might experience the grace of Christ as well. It blows everything else out of the water. :)","1285898033"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Bought a home and got married to a gal that thinks similarly. The home we bought (about 6 years ago) was on the very low end of what was available and we worked our asses off to pay that shit down.

Nice!  It's good to hear people are succeeding in a tough environment.  Spending wisely is one of the most important skills to have.  I should say that I'm actually doing OK.  I make good money, own a home (with a mortgage), drive a nice car, etc.  However, I both *worked my ass off* **in addition** to hitting the socio-economic and genetic lottery jackpot.  My parents were upper middle class, I scored high on my assessment tests, I was able to live at home after eighteen rent free for a while, etc.  I was very lucky and blessed. 

I'm not saying this to toot my own horn, but rather to say that damn, if I'm doing ""well but not spectacular"", what about all the othe people in their mid to late twenties who didn't come from great homes, or the C+ students, or the ones who got kicked out at eighteen, or the hard working but not quite as sharp kids who all still deserve a decent life.  I'm worried that the only the luckiest one percent of the population gets to do anything but struggle to make ends meet.

I totally support your preaching of ""live within your means"".  But that isn't always easy to do.  When a one bedroom apartment is about 1200 bucks around here, you don't have a lot of options.  Smart, hardworking young adults who have college degrees are barely  making rent all over the place, or flocking to law school and going further in debt in hopes of a better future.

It just sucks when your paycheck has a couple hundred bucks going to subsidize some older folk's golf game.  
I know that's not always how it goes, and I don't think anyone should end up homeless, starving, or without good medicine in our country.  I just don't know if Social Security is the 'right solution'.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","Just a couple of points in addition to all the stuff people have already listed:


-  One part of you that often gets neglected re winter clothing is your legs, so be conscious of them.  Do not be afraid to wear long underwear -- it can make an amazing difference, especially under jeans (denim is a terrible insulator).  

- On the same part of the body: if possible, buy a winter coat that is designed to cover at least part of your thighs rather than one that stops at the waist.  A coat like this will also cover at least part of your ass, which doesn't suffer so much from the cold while you're moving around, but having it covered is great if you have to actually sit down outside for some reason.  Anything you might sit on is guaranteed to be unspeakably cold.


- Re driving:  one thing you must do is go more slowly than usual.  When braking you need a measurably greater distance over which to stop.  It doesn't matter how great a driver you are; it's physics.  Some people will get pissed at you for driving slower than they'd like, but ignore them.  Avoiding their indignant wrath is not as important as protecting your life (and your vehicle).  Even native Torontonians forget this from one year to the next, which often makes for a spate of accidents after the first snowfall.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The problem with the Wii is it is a flash in the pan system. People like Nintendo software. People like slick marketing campaigns. We got both with the Wii. 

It was stylish because you could pretend to play tennis by shaking the remote and the balance board exercise game gave house wives something to do in between watching The View and Oprah (both of which endorsed the Wii, again marketing).

Problem? What do you do with horribly inaccurate motion controls and non-eye catching graphics? Nintendo couldn't figure that out apparently. A lot of Nintendo's first party titles use the wiimote on its side like an NES controller. You may shake the controller, but that's the extent of the ""motion"" controlling. For all the fanfare surrounding Super Mario Galaxy it did piss poor job of introducing people into a new paradigm of gaming. Pointing at the screen to pick up star bits and shaking the controller are very uninspired and forgettable gameplay mechanics. You could play the game on a Gamecube controller and side step the tedious nature of pointing and shaking.

If the ""masters of motion controls"" can't master their own vision, where are 3rd parties going to fit in? Third parties have no vested interest in anything other than making a profit. They couldn't care less about Nintendo's motion control gaming vision for the future, and rightly so. Nintendo's job is to sell 3rd parties on the idea that the Wii is a viable platform to sell games and make money. A job they are failing at, hence this article and Nintendo's comments.

Underneath the marketing and the hype, the Wii was really a poorly conceived idea. Compared to the amount of effort Microsoft and Sony have put into adding value to their consoles over the years (in many cases free of charge), the Wii looks inadequate from a gamer perspective and a 3rd party developer perspective.","1285898058"

Your frame of mind shouldn't be whether or not she decides the fate of your marriage, or whether she still loves you that keeps you together - couples in LTRs fall in and out of love on a regular basis, it's a cycle and that's what makes relationships hard work, you have maintain a higher ratio of being ""in-love"" versus being ""out-of-love"".  

What matters is whether or not *you* still want to be married, not being okay with it either way.  

If you want to stay married with your wife, then say it. Do *not* leave it up to her. Take a stand. Fight hard to remain married. You stay home, you do not leave. You change immediately and do whatever it takes to keep your marriage together - get that job, get back in shape, be the best version of yourself, be better than the man she fell in love with 5 years ago and married.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","[2] Many kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law, such as offenses involving fraud and the offense of willful failure to file an income tax return. However, some kinds of offenses carry no such implication. Traditionally, the distinction was drawn in terms of offenses involving ""moral turpitude."" That concept can be construed to include offenses concerning some matters of personal morality, such as adultery and comparable offenses, that have no specific connection to fitness for the practice of law. Although a lawyer is personally answerable to the entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for offenses that indicate lack of those characteristics relevant to law practice. Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, breach of trust, or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category. A pattern of repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligation.

You say that you CAN achieve orgasm while masturbating... would you enjoy sex if you could have the same kind of orgasm with your partner? Or is the orgasm itself insufficient to make sex worth it? Do you enjoy the emotional intimacy of sex with your guy or just kinda put up with it? Are you physically attracted to him?

I see that that could happen as one option.  Or the other option, it'll make him stronger.  Will he have to compensate for it?  Sure, I clock in at 5'7"" and 127 pounds (as of this morning), but I consider myself an alpha-male.  I run my mouth; I use my head to get what I want; I have a red personality (if you're familiar with the red/blue/yellow/white personality matrix).

It'll either be a stumbling block or a stepping stone; it'll make him or break him.  It's do or die.  Sure, he can have a lame name like Billy and blend into the background, unquestioned, in a pointless existence.  Like my name, which I won't reveal, but you can't find me on Google, there's over 25 million results.  Over 500 pages of results if you search my name on Facebook.  Ergo, he's getting a name like Ashley, or Raphael, or Wolfgang, or another name on that list.

I happen to live in the la la land of Utah.  Over 85% of the population of my town is Mormon.  I've never seen anybody get beat up in school.  Teasing, sure, but I'm certain it's a far cry from what you'd expect elsewhere.

I was using Mozilla. You know, [the Mozilla Application Suite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite).

Oh wait, you're a MS apologist (and by extension, a fool), so of course you care neither for truth or justice.

&gt; As for the EU lawsuit. That was way after firefox caught on. And people always had a choice. Having IE installed by default does not mean people did not have a choice.

Most people used the browser that came with their machine. They didn't know that there were other choices. When ordered to stop doing this, MS claimed that IE was bound too deep into windows to remove it.  Recall too that the US also sued MS for this in the late nineties, before Firefox, and found them guilty.

After words we tipped his friend a bowl and dipped. All high as fuck we decide to walk on some train tracks. Get about a mile into wilderness all look @ each other and wonder where we are going. Every one is super high and they offer me another lung hit. I cannot decline, take a massive hit, reach about a 10 and start walking back. Get dropped off to my car sit in the car with my friend. We dont say a word for an undocumented amount of time. Honestly could have been 10min could have been an hour, time just didnt apply at the time. Dont remember where we went after that but definitely my most memorable high","1285898142"

I never get dialogues. I think thats cause I am kinda low EQ in some measures, but whatever the cause, a non-fiction with dialogues is just too much work for my small mind. 

_Neutral review_

The point at which you segue from Pascal's wager to the rest of the article is kinda too abrupt for me. As a reader I was not expecting the writer to drop the point they so clearly made like a stone and move on! I was kinda lost there. 


Edit2: redacted. I understood this wrong.

The credited founder (although egyptians and cave painters were doing it BC) [Rodolphe Töpffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolphe_T%C3%B6pffer) was building the foundations for modern comics in the 19th century. There is a lot more room in the world of comics than three panel web comics. 

Experimentation breeds new and exciting work. [This](http://www.benett-o-matic.blogger.com.br/CharlesBookTres%5B1%5D.jpg) is a comic by R. Crumb's brother Charles. It developed from his typical early comics. He drew normal comics with progressively more and more words until the words pushed out the comics and the squiggles pushed out the words. The guy was insane and suffered from [graphomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphomania) and while it's hard to call this a comic you can't deny that it was born of them.

OP is copying other styles and while this isn't necessarily creating anything new for him at the moment copying the masters (and I would consider dinosaur comics one of the master works) is how you develop your own voice.

I searched for the quote via Google and was also unable to find it there. 

Had she said what is in the link title and there were documentation of it, I am sure that it would be a bigger story than lying about being in a university.

For these reasons, I conclude that the OP has fabricated the quote, especially in regard to the video linked.

I found it hard to follow so I have posted it here for everybody else as well.

&gt;**Counsel:** What is your name?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Chrysler. Arnold Chrysler.

&gt;**Counsel:** Is that your own name?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Whose name do you think it is?

&gt;**Counsel:** I am just asking if it is your name.

&gt;**Chrysler:** And I have just told you it is. Why do you doubt it?

&gt;**Counsel:** It is not unknown for people to give a false name in court.

&gt;**Chrysler:** Which court?

&gt;**Counsel:** This court.

&gt;**Chrysler:** What is the name of this court?

&gt;**Counsel:** This is No 5 Court.

&gt;**Chrysler:** No, that is the number of this court. What is the name of this court?

&gt;**Counsel:** It is quite immaterial what the name of this court is!

&gt;**Chrysler:** Then perhaps it is immaterial if Chrysler is really my name.

&gt;**Counsel:** No, not really, you see because!

&gt;**Judge:** Mr Lovelace?

&gt;**Counsel:** Yes, m'lud?

&gt;**Judge:** I think Mr Chrysler is running rings round you already. I would try a new line of attack if I were you.

&gt;**Counsel:** Thank you, m'lud.

&gt;**Chrysler:** And thank you from ME, m'lud. It's nice to be appreciated.

&gt;**Judge:** Shut up, witness.

&gt;**Chrysler:** Willingly, m'lud. It is a pleasure to be told to shut up by you. For you, I would!

&gt;**Judge:** Shut up, witness. Carry on, Mr Lovelace.

&gt;**Counsel:** Now, Mr Chrysler - for let us assume that that is your name - you are accused of purloining in excess of 40,000 hotel coat hangers.

&gt;**Chrysler:** I am.

&gt;**Counsel:** Can you explain how this came about?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Yes. I had 40,000 coats which I needed to hang up.

&gt;**Counsel:** Is that true?

&gt;**Chrysler:** No.

&gt;**Counsel:** Then why did you say it?

&gt;**Chrysler:** To attempt to throw you off balance.

&gt;**Counsel:** Off balance?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Certainly. As you know, all barristers seek to undermine the confidence of any hostile witness, or defendant. Therefore it must be equally open to the witness, or defendant, to try to shake the confidence of a hostile barrister.

&gt;**Counsel:** On the contrary, you are not here to indulge in cut and thrust with me. You are only here to answer my questions.

&gt;**Chrysler:** Was that a question?

&gt;**Counsel:** No.

&gt;**Chrysler:** Then I can't answer it.

&gt;**Judge:** Come on, Mr Lovelace! I think you are still being given the run-around here. You can do better than that. At least, for the sake of the English bar, I hope you can.

&gt;**Counsel:** Yes, m'lud. Now, Mr Chrysler, perhaps you will describe what reason you had to steal 40,000 coat hangers?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Is that a question?

&gt;**Counsel:** Yes.

&gt;**Chrysler:** It doesn't sound like one. It sounds like a proposition which doesn't believe in itself. You know - ""Perhaps I will describe the reason I had to steal 40,000 coat hangers! Perhaps I won't! Perhaps I'll sing a little song instead!""

&gt;**Judge:** In fairness to Mr Lovelace, Mr Chrysler, I should remind you that barristers have an innate reluctance to frame a question as a question. Where you and I would say, ""Where were you on Tuesday?"", they are more likely to say, ""Perhaps you could now inform the court of your precise whereabouts on the day after that Monday?"". It isn't, strictly, a question, and it is not graceful English but you must pretend that it is a question and then answer it, otherwise we will be here for ever. Do you understand?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Yes, m'lud.

&gt;**Judge:** Carry on, Mr Lovelace.

&gt;**Counsel:** Mr Chrysler, why did you steal 40,000 hotel coat hangers, knowing as you must have that hotel coat hangers are designed to be useless outside hotel wardrobes?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Because I build and sell wardrobes which are specially designed to take nothing but hotel coat hangers.

It then continues...

&gt;**Counsel:** Now, Mr Chrysler, am I right in saying that hotel clothes hangers do not have hooks on top but little studs that will only work on special racks?

&gt;**Chrysler:** That is correct.

&gt;**Counsel:** This design arose because so many hotel hangers were stolen.

&gt;**Chrysler:** That is correct.

&gt;**Counsel:** And they had no option but to change the design to stop them being stolen?

&gt;**Chrysler:** That is not correct.

&gt;**Counsel:** That is not correct?

&gt;**Chrysler:** No. The world of hotels had not one, but two options. They could change the design of the way they were hung, yes, but they could also cheapen the hangers. They could very easily have given guests inexpensive plastic or metal hangers they would never have missed when they were stolen. But that would have lowered the tone of the hotel. Hotels, even hotels in a chain, like to have a touch of class. They like giving guests high-class solid wood hangers. It makes them feel good about themselves. It also makes them worth stealing.

&gt;**Counsel:** And people come to you, do they, asking you to make special wardrobes so that they can use stolen clothes hangers?

&gt;**Chrysler:** It isn't so much the fact that they are stolen that makes them attractive. You have to remember that many top businessmen spend more of their time in hotels than in their own home. They become used to hotel life. They think of hotels as home. Therefore they become used to hotel hangers and think of them as normal, and on the rare occasions when they spend some time at home they can't stand these fiddly things with hooks which you and I may think of as normal but which the business traveller thinks of as loose-fitting and badly designed. So they come to me and get me to make a hotel-style wardrobe.

&gt;**Counsel:** Are you seriously suggesting that there are people who prefer hotel life to home life?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Certainly. A lot of businessmen would never go home if they had the chance. So when they get home they like to recreate the hotel experience in their own house. Many of my clients have their own mini-bars in their bedrooms. They have TV sets at the end of the bed on a raised shelf, often with an adult sex channel on it. All their bathroom products come in wrappers and are thrown away each day. I have even known people in their own home put out ""Do Not Disturb"" notices on the door of their own bedroom.

&gt;**Counsel:** Stolen, presumably, from some hapless hotel.

&gt;**Chrysler:** Never call a hotel hapless. They know what they are doing. No hotel loses money willingly. They may have things taken from them, but the stuff that guests leave behind is just as valuable.

&gt;**Counsel:** Are you serious when you say that clients of yours drink from their own minibars in their own bedrooms in their own homes?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Certainly. And just as in a hotel, they grumble about the price and size of the bottles, and the absence of ice.

&gt;**Counsel:** So why don't they get a proper fridge in their bedroom?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Because then it wouldn't be like a hotel.

&gt;**Judge:** Tell me, Mr Chrysler, do these businessmen of yours also have Gideon Bibles by their bedside at home?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Many of them, sir.

&gt;**Judge:** And where do you get the Gideon Bibles from?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Alas, they, too, have to be taken from hotels.

&gt;**Judge:** Then why are you not also up on a charge of Bible-stealing?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Because the Bibles do not belong to the hotels. They belong to the Gideon Society. And the Gideon Society has decided not to prosecute me, but to forgive me and tell me to go and sin no more.

&gt;**Judge:** And have you sinned no more?

&gt;**Chrysler:** Alas, no.

If I were to become a lunatic, I'd become Mr. Chrysler.","1285898267"

My mother collects nativity scenes, so during the holidays they wrap around the dining room. I grew up in a small predominantly southern baptist town in north Texas, and we still had a morning prayer through my fifth grade year (mid-90s), and our football team had a team prayer after every practice, and three times a game all the way through school. Despite all this, I was pretty well always an atheist. There were times I tried really hard for the sake of my social existence. I even got baptized in eighth grade, but I was just going through the motions. It never seemed real to me. Pretty quickly after my baptism I had a Gob Bluth moment, and from that point forward I stopped pretending.","1285898274"

As a Taoist, I can tell you that it doesn't. I know you asked about Buddhism, but the philosophies are similar, and are joined in Zen Buddhism. Nothing in Taoism (or Buddhism) says you *have* to be compassionate or altruistic. And nothing about Libertarianism says you *can't.* Actually, I don't even know why you're asking, the question doesn't make any sense to me.

[This New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/world/europe/30europe.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world) covers the broader European anti-austerity protests.  [This article from The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/17155786?story_id=17155786&amp;fsrc=rss) discusses why Spain will inevitably undergo some sort of austerity and addresses the strikes.  [The Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100929-712277.html) also offers its perspective on the strikes.

Something obviously has to be done in Spain.  They face enormous deficits, huge amounts of debt, international financial markets hesitant to continue financing future debt, and tremendously high unemployment resulting from a two-tier labor market (brought about by tight labor laws).  The Spanish can protest all they want, but their country faces two options: sovereign default and utter collapse both of their own economy and also of the broader euro zone, or some degree of fiscal austerity to return the government to solvency.  Protesting against attempts to fix the dire economic situation the country faces amounts to idiotic self-flagellation.  ","1285898279"

I don't know what the best approach is, but one thing is glaringly obvious to me. An economy that is founded on continual growth runs into problems on a finite planet with finite resources.

As a high school student in AP/honors classes I have to say that I'm greatly disturbed by how easy some of my classes are. Even more disturbing to me are the kids that clearly lack the nessacery skills to succed in high level classes being put into them ultimately leading to the class being dumbed down because it's ""too hard"". It's absurd; in my honors english class the kid that sits next to me can barely read. This, together with the kind of thing you just posted infuriates me to no end and frankly, makes me feel mocked and insulted.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Let me give you a little anecdote.  Last time I took acid I scarfed 2 hits from the get-go and it was some real powerful stuff, much more than I've ever tried (I had done it 3 times before that).  I reached this void, and I know, because I was tapping into one of my friend's mind.  I was able to see his abusive past with his family.  Before that I could tell clearly soemthign was wrong by his gestures, facial expression, and the energy he was sending out to us consciously or subconsciously.

Then I hit the void.  I saw it all, and when I brought it up (It turns out my visions of his past were correct.  I saw him being cornered, beating by his mom's abusive boyfriend, and raped.  He would never talk about it, and noone knew why he was always so sad through life, often breaking down crying while drunk.  He would never say why, he'd just say ""You wouldn't understand....you don't know.""  Any advice people give him he says ""I know this but I can't apply it.  I know what I have to do but I can't do it."")

Well, after I peaked and was on a sort of decline, I hit the void.  Suddenly I started getting a HUGE mindfuck.  that's when I was tapping into his mind and realizing the whole truth behind it all.  We had to have him leave because he was becoming aggressive, and projecting his past onto us.  We all (it was 4 of us total) experienced it at some points, and although he was pretending to be talking about other stuff, we could clearly see right through him and know he was bugging out...stuck in a terrible loop.

We tried everything we could, and he would just deny everything, saying he was fine but his back hurt a little.  He was clearly losing it, ocmpletely.  He suddenly RAN home crying like a 6 year old (i've heard him cry before when he was drunk many times he never cried like that).  He was seriously re-living his past, and all of this started when he stopped home for somethign and saw his mom while he was tripping.  It must have triggered the memories.

Anyway, even after he left, the energy he created in my friend's room and backyard was so thick and negative that it was affecting all of us.  We were most affected in those 2 locations, and I was still having visions where everyone's face I was looking at turned to that kid's mom's boyfriend's face, and I was reliving the experiences I saw of him earlier, only it was being projected on my other friends' faces.

At one point, I was convinced I WAS the kid and not myself, then I started to think that my whole life was an illusion and that I was actually completely mentally insane and imagined my whole life, and that my friends that were with me were links to the real world, sort of like in shutter island.  My one friend was actually a psychiatrist and the other was my brother.  Both of them were talking to me regularly, but their eyes looked like they were conveying the message of ""YOU HAVE TO SNAP BACK TO REALITY...YOUR LIFE IS NOT REALITY...YOU HAVE TO REALLY TRY.""

I was suddenly stuck in loops of thinking i was someone else.  I was feeling into everybody, and came to the realization that I transcended my ego and connected with higher consciousness that links us all.  By reaching that consciousness that's past the ego, I was able to tap into my friends' minds (specially the traumatized one).  I had my identity completely confused because I no longer had an ego, I was pure consciousness.

This is why people tell you to avoid the void...it can really be a mindfuck because naturally we have egos, when you take it away, your whole reality comes crashing down and there can be SCARY side effects.","1285898285"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Your CPU and GPU are probably both choke points for your system. That said, I have heard of an Athlon XP 2800+ and ATI Radeon 9800XT playing 1080p h.264/x.264 files in Ubuntu and I've heard of single core Semprons (clocked much higher) doing just fine with it.  So you may be able to use it as such with a decent GPU.  Assuming your CPU is enough, you *should* (not saying you will be able to) be able to do a PCI card like [this 4350](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131325), [this 3650](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131173), or [this 3650](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102814) or an AGP card like [this 4650](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102851) or [this 4650](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125281).  There is no guarantee those will do smooth 1080p, but they're your best bet.

That said, if you want an HTPC, you're much better off building a cheap HTPC or buying a cheap nettop than trying to upgrade your old system into an HTPC.  I've heard great things about the [Intel dual core Atom and Ion GPU mobos](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007623%20600035114%20600035172&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;name=NVIDIA%20ION) for HTPCs.  You could also build a cheap Sempron (that should unlock to a dual core Regor), Regor, or Celeron system for an HTPC.  If you want to do anything with it besides trash it or donate it, the only thing I can think of doing with it is turning it into a home server.","1285898294"

But they do often point to a unique hostname like mx1. or mail. etc, and if they don't get both A and AAAA records then they'll never get mail from naitive IPv6 users. Well, they will probably because the user will use an ISP SMTP server which would almost certainly be dual-stacked.

Google is not the best example, they strictly do not answer AAAA queries except from prefixes on their whitelist. IPv6 transit was pretty poor for a long time, so they didn't want to just allow IPv6 until they verified that the particular connection has an adaquate peering or transit infrastructure. So unless you come from a validated ISP you'll not get very far with Google's IPv6 yet, they know what they are doing though don't worry about them.

So far only **four** of the **root name servers** are now on IPv6:

I'm sure reddit could help somehow. Write them a letter. Explain to them that you just moved here from two blocks away, and don't understand what the issue is, but you want to have a good relationship with your neighbours.

I'm only trying to offer a different approach. The underlying issue of being comfortable in your neighbourhood is important.

Edit: Have to clarify - you didn't do anything wrong at all. Do you feel that it is worth the effort to try to change THEIR behavior? Or do you think you can live with this?","1285898320"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Here is my question (I know it will take you a while to get to it, there's 338 comments right now): Is it really a debate if one of the answers used as a 'reasonable' response is, ""we can't know gods will.""  Your first point of your beliefs is that you can't prove the existence of god.  So in my opinion there isn't much to debate, since everything hinges on being able to prove that, otherwise it's just a ""you need to have faith"" kind of discussion, which isn't a debate where a conclusion can ever be reached.  The argument for a Christian god is no better - to me - than any of the other gods.  My argument is, it just all sounds pretty made up to me.","1285898322"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Bullshit. In this hypothetical the Christian God is proven to exist. There is a moral code in the Bible by this deity. I think I'm going to trust an all knowing mind to tell me what is right or wrong over my flawed human mind.

There's little practical difference between an ""all knowing mind"" and ""a mind that knows a really really really lot more than you do.""  Let's assume you don't trust your flawed human mind very much, as you seem to do.  Now, here comes someone... another human, yes, but you're utterly convinced that he knows SO much more than you, so very much, that his moral code must be right and yours must be incorrect.  Are you going to follow him blindly now?  Surrender your judgement to his?  His judgement doesn't have to be perfect; just so perfect that he'll never be wrong about anything in his lifetime.

This is the mentality that allowed people to surrender their wills to those of Hitler, Stalin, Kim Jong Il, and so on.  ""But those are men!"" you cry.  But to some of their followers they are gods incarnate.

&gt; I'm not sure what you're trying to prove by saying someone is immoral because they are afraid of eternal suffering.

I'm not proving anything; I'm just stating a fact.

&gt; You and I can't even begin to comprehend the amount of suffering that we would suffering in one instant let alone eternity.

You can't even begin to comprehend the amount of suffering that you would be suffering by surrendering your conscience to someone else.

&gt; I'm not sure what sort of martyrdom you're trying to get at. There hasn't even been a mythological figure who has endured that amount of suffering for any reason. Even the amount of suffering Jesus would have went through is astronomically small compared to eternal damnation.

The IRA fought for a united Ireland free from UK rule.  Al Qaeda fights for the right to impose a theocracy on supposed ""muslim nations"".  The IRA primarily attacked military/police targets.  Al Qaeda seems to focus more on amassing civilian casualties.  The IRA never hid behind schools, children and women...Al Qaeda seems perfectly happy using human shields.

In ""The Long Walk to Freedom"", Nelson Mandela espouses the view that nonviolence is simply a tactic.  He explained how those in power dictate which tactics are used; when they use violence against the nonviolent, they open themselves up to violent reprisals.  If you protest peacefully and they shoot at you, nonviolence must be cast aside.  To put it bluntly: pacifism in the face of brutality is just cowardice.

There, you finally admit the details. Of course, these institutions would simply collapse into their own footprint, having no ripple effects (or tidal waves). Suuuuure. The business goes under and we all just go on. For just one example... AIG goes under. The next day thousands of companies are uninsured and have lost any premiums paid for insurance. They are out money. They now have to quickly find another commercial/industrial insurer and pay higher premiums to get coverage from the myriad things that happen every day. Those lost billions rip through the economy. Every group that invested in AIG CDO's as hedges, which included major retirement funds see those vehicles evaporate. Texas and California see their public employee retirement funds take on healthy losses, plus the AIG collapse likely exacerbates the problems the CDO's were designed to hedge against. etc. etc. etc. AIG was a rat's nest. Filled to the gills with dubious dealings. Yet, it was one of many houses that, if allowed to crash and burn worse than it did, would have likely caused far more collateral damage than you imagine.

The ripple effects of Wall St investment houses collapsing would have taken out many more depositor institutions. Many regional and locals were sitting on poor reserves as well chasing profits. Thanks deregulation.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let me preface my comment by saying that I detest the Westboro Baptists Church and everything it stands for. Its members are loathsome cretins who deserve nothing short of our total contempt. Never should a positive word be said of the church or its members with a negative following it.

Having said all that, I find your proposal horrid. Not on the same level as the fellow who seriously proposed assaulting a member, nor the mass of redditors who egged him on rather than trying to calm his passions, but still horrid. It may well be that lawsuits are how they fund their activities, and they rely on the ability to sue after being physically attacked to keep them financially afloat. But why is it that they're being assaulted? It is because they are protesting in the most offensive terms at funerals. Now, I can understand being offended and outraged. And I can understand wanting to beat those bastards to a bloody pulp. At the end of the day however, they do not resort to violence nor do they threaten to use it. They constitute no real world physical threat to anybody. And for as long as the remains the case, then however vile their words of protest are, the use of force against them is illegitimate. By extension then, any financial compensation they obtain by way of the resulting lawsuits is well-earned, provided that it comes from their aggressors. 

Truth be told, the best solution isn't one that involves violence, or trying to get them disbarred, but one which mitigates their effectiveness. The Patriot Guard Riders -- join them, donate to them, what have you. Help to organize an anti-WBC response wherever they intend on being. Make them uncomfortable, but respect their right not to be physically harmed, and educate people to that fact that such actions are how they fund their sickening activities. Education and a display of solidarity is both the best and most just recourse we have.","1285898370"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","i agree- my dad always used to say this when i was being harassed in school, and for a long time i believed him- mostly because i was always changing schools, so it was always someone new harassing me, and my dad insisted that it took a long time for it to work.

at the beginning of 7th grade i got tired of that shit.  a kid that had been giving me shit constantly through 6th grade- never violent, but just teasing me relentlessly- he seemed to relish the fact that he couldn't get a rise out of me, he knew he was pissing me off, but was doing everything i could not to show it, and wanted to see how far he could push me before i snapped.  so snap i did.  i waited for him outside one day, and as he came out of the building, i called his name, he turned around, and i hit him in the face.  it wasn't even a good hit, i wasn't exactly practiced in fighting, i barely grazed his chin, but none the less, he cowered against a parked car crying.  i actually felt a little bad for him at the moment.  some passing yuppie said, ""hey, you can't do that!""  i said, ""i just did"" and hopped on my bike and took off.

so of course the headmaster called home- my mom later told me when he said i hit the kid, she said ""yes!  it's about time"" and his reaction was ""um... that's not the response i would expect...""  so my mom (who had met the kid, he was in my theater group, and my mom had helped out with some costumes, so she knew what a prick he was first-hand) explained how he had been asking for it for a long time, and this needed to happen.  she took me out for ice cream.

my dad on the other hand felt that i had ambushed him, and that it wasn't a fair fight, that i should never be the one to escalate to violence, and all sorts of other things... that was when i started to realize that my dad didn't know everything, and was probably not the best source of information in social situations...

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Yeah actually usually when you do it more, you want it more. How often do you see your boyfriend? Maybe you can use your vibrator every day during the week and hold off on anything penetrative until the weekend so that you'll really be craving his dick.

Are you more horny close to or on your period, or at any certain point during your cycle? I get really horny the week before my period and I usually still want it during my period, but when I start a new pack of pills I become a lot less interested, to the point that it's not enjoyable or it might possibly hurt.

Maybe you and your boyfriend can send each other sexy texts before you do it next time so that you anticipate it more. And maybe you guys can physically tease each other a lot more before oral and/or penetrative sex.

Have you ever tried having sex while using your vibrator? If it's something that's fairly small you can talk to your boyfriend into incorporating it every once in a while, during/after oral and during penvag intercourse. If it's really big, think about getting another one that's easy to handle during sex. Are you two pretty adventurous when it comes to positions? One of my boyfriend's favorite positions (and I'm sure every guy likes it) is reverse cowgirl, which happens to be really convenient for using just about any kind of vibrator. You control what goes on down there so you can change things up easier when it starts hurting. Also if you have a smallish vibrator that you feel comfortable laying on, try using it in that position where you lie face down with your legs closed and your bf penetrates you basically through your buttcheeks. This is the main position I use to masturbate so with my boyfriend there it feels really amazing.

Do you guys incorporate dirty talk? Spanking? Tying each other up? The assumption is that women want slow, sensual sex (which, granted, I totally love) but I think a lot of girls get off from feeling extra dirty. Try bringing out the sex goddess inside of you and see if the feeling that something is just taboo enough will make sex more enjoyable for you. 

Are you on birth control? A lot of women lose their sex drive from the hormones. Maybe talk to your doctor and see if there's something else you can try.

The only time I get takeout from a proper restaurant is when I go to my local pizza place. They have a drive-thru window, and I can see into the kitchen from the window. The cooks make the pizza and put it on the shelf just inside of the drive-thru booth.

When I go to pick it up there is usually a couple of waiters/waitresses standing around nearby. One of them will ask me my name, grab the pizza and ring it up. This usually takes less than a minute. If I decided to tip at $10hr/hr for their service that would equal ~$0.17.

I guess I should start giving them a quarter for their trouble.

The new Australian ambassador moves to Ottawa (during the winter) and is given a celebratory 2-4 (case of beer). Which he takes home and puts in the garage. So the beer freezes and explodes. The first official letter that he writes to the Australian government relates this story and concludes ""I realize that you have sent me to a country that puts it's beer in the fridge to keep it warm.""

All of which goes to show that winter is great fun! You just need to look at it from a certain angle. How? You MUST MUST MUST go outside and take up a winter sport. It doesn't need to be hockey, although I would recommend trying ice skating a few times. Try tobogganing, skiing, snowshoeing (if we get snow this year. Here's hoping!) Learn to snow shovel (consider it a way to practice lifting weights). Try walking in the winter through the park. See the differences. Go outside during a snowfall. You'll be astounded at the silence.

The characters are isolated and trying to hold onto whatever they have left so why would they be interested in significant change? This has obviously become a long arc character story, and as such you need more than one introductory season to develop characters and allow them to develop. Because it is also episodic you have to have the localized troubles to provide the medium for the characters to face their trials, otherwise there will be lots of episodes of people eating mush and sitting in the dark doing nothing.

Question two: It's definitely possible that there's life on this planet and since I believe God created everything I would also of course believe God is responsible for said life on this far off planet.

Question 3: I'd like to say observation first then hypothesis. I mean that I would of course hope that the intelligent life of this planet has an understanding of peace, love, and kindness but if they didn't then it might make me question my own beliefs. I have no idea what the lifeforms on this planet would be like. Maybe they have had a Jesus like figure who came to spread them the good news of God, or maybe they just sit around killing each other. It all also depends on the level of intelligence that the aliens have. Maybe they are only as smart as chimps in which case Christianity applies to them as much as it does to animals on earth. Perhaps they are far more intelligent and advanced than us in which case it would be very interesting to hear about their history, religions (or lack thereof), and ideas as these may have profound implications on our human understanding of God.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","As you said, no key signatures for anything. This reduces readability greatly by crowding music which is, for the most part, diatonic, with unnecessary accidentals. This suggests that instead of dictating the music within a key, as any experienced musician would do, he sat there with Finale open and dictated it all note for note. On the upside, this suggests he has a pretty good ear (unless he cheated and opened up the ROM), but on the downside, it says that he has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of even the most basic music theory.

As someone else said, rests inside beams is a particularly atrocious engraving mistake that should be used sparingly. It, again, reduces readability by confusing the player with loads of unnecessary notes.

As far as beaming goes, the general rule is to never beam across a beat, and to not beam where beaming is not necessary. Both of these rules are broken on every single piece.

Many rhythms are flat out wrong or are written in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Proportional polyrhythms are something that should only be used in a case where a normal tuplet can not accurately convey the rhythm, usually in the case of an odd numbered tuplet (as in a 5:6 or a 9:7). A 6:4 is simply a sextuplet, and the fact that this guy chose to write it as a proportion shows how inexperienced he really is.

The fact that he chose to transcribe the overworld theme with halved note values and a doubled tempo (compared to what you usually see in sheet music for that theme) also shows that he fails to grasp basic concepts relating to how a performer reads music and how a composer writes music. I'm sure he has some snarky snobby defense about how he just 'felt' the piece at double the tempo that most people do, but if you listen to the beat patterns and pacing of the original piece, you really can't defend the tempo and note values that he chose to go with.

I don't mean to sound like a snob, and under normal circumstances I would leave the guy alone, but the fact that he made a website to showcase his transcriptions and wrote up a page long essay on why every other transcription sucks and his are the best tells me that he is extraordinarily full of himself when in reality he has the musical comprehension of a high school freshman.

*Are you a freak?*  No, but you are missing out on a substantial portion of the human experience.  This is something you owe it to yourself to resolve; not everyone is big into sex but fuckin' A, you're doing no one any favors by dating somebody who *is.*

*Are there others out there like you?*  Yes, there are.  Very few of them are well-adjusted and happy in my experience, if that tells you something.

*Is there something seriously wrong with you?*  Not the right way to look at it.  Is there something missing from your life?  Obviously or else you wouldn't be asking.

What you really want to know is ""Is it okay for me to not like sex?""  That's an answer between you and you alone.  However, the reason you're asking this is because you're dating a guy who may very well end up psychologically destroyed because you want to make this ""not your problem.""  So if you love him, work through it.  If he loves you he'll be there to help.  If he doesn't he'll move on and you can find somebody who does.  It may be challenging, though - ""not enough sex"" is ""irreconcilable differences"" in many states and grounds for divorce.  

Healthy couples have sex.  That's what they're for.  If the amount of sex is agreeable to both parties, it doesn't matter what that level is.  If it's not, the relationship is doomed.

Good luck, whatever you decide to do.","1285898473"

NO, the problem with this subreddit is feminists and female feminist apologists that want to constantly come in and tell us uppity slaves to calm down a little bit, cause they are a NAWALT.  

One of the biggest difference between mras and feminists is that mras still put up with female trolls telling us we are wrong and should be grateful for what mommy guvment allows us to have.  While feminists mock and ridicule honest debate and arguments with shaming language.

The real problem is that females are becoming aware of the damage they have either passively or actively done to men as a class and they are worried that their meal ticket will run out soon.  For every male slave that wakes up and realizes that marriage is retirement for women and that men as a class are forced to labor and create resources that are stolen from men and given to women as a class, there are three females that stand up and either shame him, try to calm and distract him(with posts like these) or figures out a way to fuck him over and silence him...usually through leveraging male-male competition against him through the police state and feminist anti-male system.","1285898477"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No, they don't have to be attached to a publishing house. More and more, as the houses' margins diminish, editorial is something that is getting outsourced. There are some very, very good editors at the top of their game who are now editing for several houses freelance. They don't quite have the same pull within the house as an in-house commissioning editor does, but that is changing. 

One of my friends, who was an editor at my publisher for many years (though not my own editor) was recently offered an entire new imprint from Random House to do what she wants with. So she is setting up her publishing list from scratch, according to her own taste. She gets to work from her home too, as she is in a different city to HQ and didn't want to move. That's a really, really good thing to see happening - and it bodes well for the future.

We've seen a massive consolidation in the publishing industry in recent decades, with a handful of big players buying out smaller but profitable publishers. I'm absolutely with you in considering homogeneity and lowest-common-denominator sales-driven approaches the enemy.

Doctorow is an amazing guy. I really agree with much of what he has to say. I disagree on some points around DRM and so on, and I think his 'moral case' is shaky and glib. Being teated like a felon is no excuse to behave as one. That said, what we need are lots of different voices exploring the issue. He might be right and I might be wrong. The important thing is we all keep talking and listening about it. I count among my friends a number of creative 'heads' of houses like Harper Collins or Random or whatever. All of them know they need to be worried about this. None of them really know what to do. We all have to work it out together - and readers need to be part of that conversation.

when you enter this line of thinking, you concede there is no such thing as proof, for anything. even logic can't be trusted, b/c you can't prove logic with logic, thats begging the question, it's self refuting.

If you can't trust perception or logic, our only methods of ascertaining any sort of truth, then this means everything is on the same level of feasibility such as a god(s),gravity ,leprechauns, Vincent Price, etc. Meaning one cannot discern between contradicting concepts. Your argument is meaningless in terms of ascertaining any truth.

For any meaningful ascertains one must assume a correctly percieved reality exists, where logic can be trusted, in which case science is able to meaningfully assert models which describe how things seem to operate, such as chemistry and mechanics. Anything that is purported 
without observation or any sort of logical deduction(like 2+2=4), cannot be meaningfully asserted, as there is nothing supporting it's existence or non-existence, and usually falls to occam's razor.

This was going on when Halo ODST came out and I had 3 guys over for a couple days playing that, so it's not like I just completely neglected everyone else in my life, I just didn't try nearly as hard to hang out with my friends. 

I'm positive that there weren't any hard feelings because of the lack of time spent with my friends, but did it impact my social life? Absolutely. That's just a sacrifice I had to make at the time to have what I had and I don't regret it; they were great times. I know what you mean about people who forget about their friends when they are ""with"" someone, I've had friends of mine that just refused to do anything besides be with their girl and practically turned into different people when they were around. I'm pretty sure, though, that isn't what happened.

Secular family, mostly atheist even if they don't like to admit it. My mother is a deist, though she doesn't know it (""I believe in *something* out there."") and she'll never subscribe to a religion. My father I'm suddenly not too sure about - I found out one or two things recently that make me wonder, though I've only known him to go into a church twice (both weddings).
The vast majority of my family simply ignore religion.

My early school life was in north London so I was in class with Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and atheists (as much as kids *can* be those things) and as such the songs in assembly were multi-faith : ""He"" and ""Him"" rather than ""God"" etc. (doesn't work for the Hindus eh?).

As I had no faith or anything at home, I suppose having a lack of one particular religion thrown at me meant I wasn't in any way indoctrinated. That and being very scientific in my mindset (and now career) meant that I was never short of correct, natural answers for situations/questions that some find rather difficult to comprehend without a god in the picture.

From the earliest age I can remember, I've seen (modern) religion as the clung to, prolonged and 'evolved' (heh) primitive stories that asked ""how/why are we here?""
 
I've always drawn parallels between 'cavemen' looking up at the stars and wondering, and making up stories, to the heavenly 'father' looking down on us.

And I never believed in Father Christmas or the Toothfairy either ;)

On a side note - the only person in my family who was a Christian (though he was actually a close family friend who'd been my grandmother's companion for 30 years) died two days ago at the age of 95. He had a stroke 2 and a half years ago and hadn't been properly well ever since. He'd been suffering for pretty much all the time since then. The last time I saw him, a couple of weeks ago, he spent most of the time when he was conscious in pain and distress, regularly begging his god to have mercy. I find that terribly upsetting. He wanted his god to take him, but his god refused for so long. At least he's no longer suffering.

&gt; Do you believe in the fire and brimstone version of Hell?

I don't think it matters. I mean, there might be fire or there might not be, but either way, torment by fire is not what makes hell, hell.

On earth, everyone -- the good and the bad -- experiences God's common grace. As it says in Scripture, He allows the rain to fall on the righteous and the unrighteous. But when you get to hell, it is complete separation from the grace and mercy of God. There's none of it.

You'll be in complete control to do whatever you want for all eternity, but just like on earth, you'll always want more and more and more of *something*. In hell, completely cut off from His grace, you'll be tormented by the insatiable desire within you and it will drive you insane. This is why Scripture says that Christ is the living water, the only One who can satisfy.

&gt; Also non Christians go to hell regardless of behavior, assuming they know about Christ.

Yes, non-Christians will go to hell.

&gt; So it would be reasonable to assume Gandhi would be in Hell assuming these sets of rules (I know you can't say for sure)?

Like you said, I cannot judge the state of another person's soul... but according to the life he lived and the things he has said regarding his own views on Christ, I don't think he will be in heaven.","1285898578"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The short answer is that yes, a computer could have a program that would allow it to do things like that. As I mentioned before, a computer can in theory simulate a brain to any degree of precision you like. Practically, this isn't possible, but it's possible in theory.

&gt; If our brains simply go constantly through all of our ideas, one by one, searching for the two or three that best fit together, and this is how we think, then my quibble about digital intelligence is pointless.

&gt;Because wouldn't a computer programmed to be creative have to do more or less just that?

If a computer could go one by one through all of the ideas to combine them together, that would actually be ideal. And I will point out that we combine a lot of ideas that are just useless; very rarely does it turn out well. However, a computer need not do the ideal thing. It can use heuristics, just like we do, looking for inspiration by imagining the combinations of ideas according to certain rules, shared contexts, etc., whatever you like.

Again, the theoretical answer is that a computer can do anything a brain can do. If you're asking about the difficulties of implementation, yes, they would be immense. Even emulating a small portion of the heuristics used by a human would be a huge undertaking. And in that sense it may very well be more practical to combine animal and artificial intelligence to achieve something greater. But, a computer is capable of doing anything a human can do, given the right programming.

The several gods are easily shown to be myths, and the One True God has no power to do anything in this world, by definition. So you're left with a God who only does things in the spiritual world, which also has no effect, and can have no effect on the material world.

What's the point of that? I guess it's okay if you want to believe that way. Problems come when people forget that the spiritual part is the only part that matters, when they try to trample on people's rights, when they try to teach lies in the classroom, when they equate politics with religion, that's when you get problems.","1285898584"

Metric is undoubtedly better when it comes to anything requiring precision. But for layman's usage Imperial can be much easier. Meters are too big and centimeters too small to be visualised or estimated easily. Feet and inches are convenient to work with, for a layman.

If I asked you to visualise 170cm, or 1.7m, could you do it easily, or confidently? What if I asked you to visualise 5 and a half feet? Imperial units are more intuitive to understand, which is most likely why they were conceived the way they were in the first place. Unless you have a ruler with you, metric is difficult to use accurately.

Which is why even now in metric using countries, such as Australia, imperial units still persist on a colloquial level. ","1285898610"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Why?  I don't see the harm in certain DLC requiring payment.  New games require a purchase, expansion packs require a purchase.  Both of these are a source of new content.  There is a definite list of scumball DLC, such as ""Day 0"" DLC, content that segregates players, or something that properly concludes the storyline.  Being able or forced to buy your power level on a multiplayer game is a definite ass move.  

For example, Dragon Age: Origins has several DLC options, but the base game still goes from start to finish without requiring I make a purchase.  The additional content is either completely extraneous or expands upon a single point of the story (Leilana's backstory, the aftermath of Ostargar, a what-if scenario where you play as the demons).  There is the latest pack, which is designed to be an epilogue relating to a single story point.  That's a bit of a scumbag move, but it's not as bad as paywalling the climax of the story.

Were you to take a game like Portal that has the ability to create your own maps and still release a single player ""puzzle map pack"", I would consider it.  In a scenario like this, you're paying for a quality addition that goes above and beyond what someone with a mod toolkit has produced.

They gave me half price on the extended basic portion only for six months. 

That's like $32 instead of $64 for that part, but the full bill was still well over $100 (including the internet connection).

I called several times over the next year, after the six months was up, but they said it was in their records that I had already had the deal and that I could go suck a raw egg.

Since I mostly had extended basic for SGU and some of the TBS, TNT, USA movies and the daily show I dropped that portion and just kept basic cable and the digital encore movie channels. It still costs just under $100 with the internet connection.

I find their prices highly inflated.

They also like to keep changing their packages so that you can't get the channels that you used to have without buying another package.

They claim it's to offer more choices to the consumer. 

I've asked them to let me choose which channels that I want. Sort of a pick your own package. 

They said no because it would make it much more expensive.

What does that even mean? He attempts to source this claim by claiming that a deep understanding of Mormon thought it needed to understand Salt Lake City (due to its large concentration of Mormons) but I don't believe that qualifies the Book of Mormon as one of the most influential books first published by an American.

&gt; In this sense it is easier to be an agnostic or atheist. You have rejected the mainstream of American history, which means you don't have to take responsibility for its failures, though you can appropriate its successes.

What the hell? To this I say: Mu. I see no justification to believe that an atheist is somehow more or less responsible for America's history than an immigrant or someone born after the 19th century. Atheism itself doesn't make any claims about American history. US citizens, irrespective of religion or ethnic background, both benefit from and are responsible for (in part) America's behaviors as such that they are part of them.

The album that came out after it, *Octahedron*, is something that they referred to as their ""acoustic album"" when they were making it. It's somewhat poppy and more spaced out. They have five albums, and all five are significantly different.

There are plenty of people who are drawn to their first album, *Deloused in the Comatorium*. There's a good chance that you might like it even if you don't like *The Bedlam in Goliath*; they're very different works. The composer of the music (Omar Rodriguez-Lopez) is known to scrap entire albums because they sound too much like something he has done before, so if you like somewhat weird guitar work / typically complex music, there's probably at least one Mars Volta or solo album popped out which appeals to you.

One of my most loved activities from my days in World of Warcraft had been open world PvP (Although, admittedly, it was certainly *not one its strong points*), and having to use Eye of Kilrogg to scout for enemy players when I ran into freshly killed mobs. 

The thrill of ambushing enemy players and slowly growing a conflict as more players joined in once we starting calling friends and companions over was what really got my adrenaline going back then. Although this form of situation rarely happened, but they were certainly something I looked forward to when visiting hot spots like Hillsbrad.

The problem with his solution is how we define species, surprisingly it's not a precise science. It comes down to the fact that species aren't actual real tangible things, but human constructs of a more fluid, but highly structured, worldwide genetic distribution. They are there to help us make sense of the organisms around us, and they usually are representative to reality(mainly for most large organisms), but you can't talk about them that way and say anything meaningful

Come on it's ridiculous. Two organisms genetically similar to chicken but not chicken give birth to a chicken, which is the know the first and sole member of it's species? THE CHICKEN WOULD STILL HAVE TO REPRODUCE WITH A 'GENETICALLY SIMILAR TO CHICKEN BUT NOT CHICKEN ORGANISM', THEY ARE INTERBREEDING, MAKING THEM THE SAME SPECIES BY MOST POPULAR DEFINITIONS OF SPECIES

This model works on the cardholder-not-present model, which is exactly the same as purchasing something over the web. The credit card data is skimmed off the mag strip and (as correctly pointed out elsewhere in this thread) can then be stored instead of transacted against.

This device can not do chip-and-pin transactions, nor can it do contact payment... so in Australia for example you will not be able to use this for anything other than a paperweight. If you as a merchant accept credit card payment using this device, Visa can come down on you like a tonne of bricks and fine you to within an inch of your life.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Sorry, no. You're thinking of a hot pile where the aerobic decomposition creates heart.  This is a different kind of composting, where red worms actually consume the by-products of the smaller organisms that deteriorate the garbage.  The red wigglers will actually freeze to death if you leave the bins outside (They can't dive way down like earthworms to escape the cold.) unless they have some other heat source, which kind of defeats the purpose of a secondary composting system.  

You COULD try building a cold frame and warming it with a deep layer of manure--chicken bedding comes to mind because it heats so fast--and a lining of filled gallon water jugs to store the day's heat just to see whether that would keep the little buggers warm enough.  But then you have a new set of problems having to do with knowing when to raise the lid to keep them from getting too hot when the sun strikes the glass.  

No, it's best to think of this as a second kind of composting that isn't the same as simple rotting--which is, after all, what your compost pile is about.","1285898861"

I remember kids telling me I was going to go to hell since my family didn't go to church and it upset me but I didn't understand what that even meant then. 

I never thought of myself as an atheist until high school since I really didn't even give religion a thought except in a historical and cultural sense. I learned most of what I know about Christianity from my art history classes and research I did on my own to understand a Christian (or any religion, for that matter) mindset since it was so foreign to me.

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","&gt;The technology of today is more than adequate to begin tackling the task of modernizing our energy sources.

I disagree.

&gt;We should utilize the gamut of technologies from renewables to nuclear to start reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. 

I agree, but the task is monumental.  Just the oil consumed in the U.S. would need 750 nuclear plants to replace it (there are currently fewer than 110 in the world).  The amount of alternatives in use today is 1/2000th of what is needed to replace just oil, much less coal and natural gas.

&gt;We can also immediately begin investing in infrastructure...

I agree.

&gt;I'm not going to waste my time doing your research for you. Start with the IPCC AR4, Working Group I, and then use Google Scholar to look up its references and the literature that's been built on top of them in the past 4 years.

Please.  Would you like a stepladder so you can climb down from your high horse.  I'm very well acquainted with the issues, thank you.  Next time a simple ""I don't know the answer"" will suffice.

&gt;I'm going to stop with your ""if one assumes,"" because it's not an assumption at this point. It's the prevailing, established notion.

Hardly.  There have been three periods of major warming over the last 150 years, all of similar intensity and duration.  Two are attributed to solar changes, one to anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  These attributions are from the most alarmist of climate scientists.

&gt;You don't even get the 'thermal inertia' argument right; it's not that we're committed to hundreds of years of warming, it's that there's an inertia to the system which results in us being committed to a nominal amount of warming over the originally expected timeframe.

Only one as arrogant as you seem to be would assume that someone else is saying one thing, then refute the assumed thing.  I was referencing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which allegedly sticks around for hundreds of years.","1285898978"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not sure you understand how the Senate works.  Objecting to a motion to pass something by unanimous consent is not ""an arcane Senate rule.""  There are procedures in place to pass legislation.  Unanimous consent is generally used for unanimous consent agreements (which establish a binding schedule of votes in the Senate, since there is no formal calendar system) or for completely non-political votes, such as naming a post office or declaring April national hawk awareness month.  

If you want to get rid of filibusters and cloture votes, I suppose that isn't as ignorant a position as the rest of your post.  The lack of a previous question motion, however, is basically the only thing that grants Senators individual power and allows the minority to have some influence in government.  If you get rid of that, you end up with two legislative bodies elected at basically the same time by the same methods by overlapping groups of voters.  Bicameralism took a big hit with the 17th Amendment and would essentially die with were the Senate to become a second majoritarian legislative body like the House, where individuals don't matter and the majority party can pass whatever legislation it wants.  

And you can't kick people out of the Senate because you disagree with them.  That's not the way a Democratic Republic works.  ","1285898983"

Actually yes it is. Suspiciously so. Usually when discussions in threads go into their second day, it's only the people discussing/debating who are left so there's usually no more than 1 upvote or downvote per post. But suddenly 48 hours later all of your posts were getting several upvotes and all the Muslim responses were getting downvoted. In /r/**islam**/. That means whether through link or otherwise, you invited other people in here. You can go ahead and deny that the upvotes/downvotes factored into that decision.

&gt; It is Muslims who are threatening the freedom of speech right now and not say Christians.

0_o

Have you been following what's happening in Western countries at all? The places which had freedom of speech to begin with are rolling it back completely on their own.

&gt; Mind you, people themselves won't be the ones to fall. They will enjoy having an improved mindset and better life. If they want, they can still believe in God and do many, if not most of the things that Muslims and Christians do today.

Which of the things that Muslims do or as you called it ""specific views"" of Islam raise your ire? Apostasy laws? Laws forcing women to cover their hair? Keeping in mind the Muslim world, under the leadership of a Sunni theocracy (the vaunted Islamic caliphate that all extremists are allegedly so zealous about bringing back), the Ottoman Empire, actually implemented reforms on these grounds over 100 years ago. Apostasy laws were repealed and no longer enforced and while women still covered up, there weren't police running around enforcing it (although to be sure, it was much easier as there wasn't a cultural war going on with an opponent beaming an opposing message into everyone's homes, so women were already in the culture of covering up for quite some time), etc.

Left to its own devices, Islam would have likely taken the course you would have wanted. But it was not left to its own devices. The Allies seized and split up what remained of the Ottoman Empire as colonies (sorry, ""mandates"") to the point where secular Turks had to fight the secular Allies to get just Turkey back and kick Greece out. Then you had the sponsorship of the Wahhabi state in Arabia, the Balfour Declaration, and the groundwork was laid for the events of the latter half of the 20th century.

Most English speakers just don't understand it in quite the way that an Athenian in 500 BC would; I doubt *I* can. God, I wish I had my books here. It's just been too long. I don't remember enough of this to draw solid example of my meaning, which is frustrating in that I know one can be made here.

&gt;Anyway, I'm not sure I'd be willing to go with ""part of damned near everything""... Would it be dense to say ""not part of well over 99.99999% of the universe""?

The village just built a new library (within the past 6 years) and they have a 1st floor kids section (which is really cool) and a teen floor ( a bit small, and the rest is for adults.  It's a great library.  

I believe cook county has an added 10% sales tax (someone correct me if I'm wrong).  In my suburb prices are high, but not crazy downtown Chicago high. 

In my specific location in Oak Park we have a local grocer and a few major grocery stores.  Not sure if you're familiar with Jewel. We also have a Trader Joes, Dominicks, Jewel Osco, and they're building Costco nearby.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Yeah, except I have no options to tune. I don't build the RAID groups and what a Compellent does to carve out a new LUN is not like an EMC SAN. Which was my point in the first place. A Compellent is nothing like an EMC. They're designed specifically to limit the amount of maintenance one has to do and they do it very well. One LUN can be in multiple ""RAID groups"" (they're not actually RAID... a bit to hard to explain in a short post) and even in multiple disk enclosures on different types of drives (FC and SATA). And it will move the most accessed data to the fastest drives and the least accessed data to the slowest drives on the fly with no input from me. My only option to improve performance is to add more hardware. 

One could probably get better performance from a more manual setup, but the amount of improvement is not worth the cost for a company our size.

Update on my situation:

My friend just brought the car over and picked me up in it. We drove to the shop I work at and one of the whiz kid technicians looked at it and said I could drive the car easily for two+ years without having to repair anything as long as I took good care of it. He said I would need to replace one of the main hoses since the car had been sitting for a while inactive but other than that he said everything looked really good. I asked if it was green for go to buy it and he said it looked like a really good deal!

The seller told me exactly what happened as far as how they got it and why it wasn't used much - his grandparents own an apartment complex and the original owner of the vehicle left it there for whatever reason. He said it has a clean title and they have the pink slip for it. I wasn't exactly sure what else to ask but I think everything looks like I should buy it.

Also, one last thing, it's actually a Mercury Tracer! All of the tires are fairly new, I didn't check the tread depth, though. There's a little bit of paint deterioration on the rear bumper and a small dent above the driver front tire.

I will need to put a deck in the car as well as some new speakers and a sub, so I can drive around looking stupid but sounding okay :D","1285899063"

Those that were not invested in this crap would have then bought up mortgages dirt cheap significantly lowering the price of housing. Likely due to the sheer amount of houses on the markets these companies would cut deals with people about to foreclose to keep them in the house.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","This was covered pretty well at Oaksterdam. It's basically a way to get usable product out of the disposable parts of a cannabis plant, after buds are removed.

Roots are cut away when first harvested and whole plant is hung upside down to dry cure. When ready, buds are removed and trimmed. All remaining leaves &amp; branches are then processed for kief.

Easiest method is build a tumbler with #30 mesh screen sieve. Give it a crank whenever you walk by it. After a couple days the catch basin will be covered in kief.

Quicker, more thorough method is ice water agitation. Either buy a purpose-built machine or use a clean, retired clothes washer. Fill it with cannabis trimmings, water &amp; ice. Agitate for 10 minutes or so. Ice water solidifies resin and allows it to go into suspension. After done agitating discard plant debris and ice. While sill cold, put resulting water through a series of finer and finer mesh bags. Scrape and dry filtered solids, and there's your kief.","1285899067"

Haha, I hear ya mate. I really should get back to my thesis :P

I honestly did understand what you were saying and the context of your comment. I am actually doing post-grad astrophysics here at UNSW.

Just FYI, Saturn is in the centre of the first image because of the perspective it was taken from. Had the image been taken from a different angle, as the other three were, Saturn would be in a different location or not visible at all.

In the same way your two eyes allow you to construct depth, we can use multiple images of the solar system taken at different times and different angles to show very clearly that the sun is at the centre.

For example, imagine taking a series of photos of a city skyline from different places outside the city. Different buildings would appear to be in the centre in each photo. However, if we take them as a set, we can construct a representation with depth. This can be done intuitively, or with high school trigonometry.

Now, if that's still unconvincing, it's important to note that the first image was actually taken from outside the plane of the solar system, so we are actually looking ""down"" on the solar system, if only by a few degrees. In that sense, it would be similar to you taking pictures of a city from a plane or helicopter.

&gt; the evidence tends to say yes they [Neanderthals] are our ancestors. 

The evidence that Europeans (and ONLY Europeans) are descended from Neanderthals is a single study in stark contradiction of a number of other studies, and it's based on very sketchy data, and it said 1-3% contribution, at most.  We are NOT descended from Neanderthals, they're an extinct branch on the family tree.

&gt; What worldwide trends are you comparing Eskimo and Masai diets to? 

All other hunter-gatherer groups.  Masai aren't even hunter-gatherers, they're very recent cattle-herders - completely irrelevant to your point.  Those groups get discussed so much precisely because they're unique.

&gt; 'Our system is not designed to handle meat' is vegetarian propaganda and brainwashing.

I didn't say that at all, but nice misdirection.  But we are absolutely not primarily carnivorous.  Cats are obligate carnivores, their teeth, bowels, and metabolism are very different from ours.  Bears are primary carnivores, and even there, very different system.

&gt;  In fact our digestive system - from teeth to bowels - is a perfectly designed carnivorous systems. 

That is 100% false, and there is no way you have ever read a single book or paid attention in a single lecture on comparative biology if you believe that. 

We're omnivorous, we and our ancestors are absolutely evolved to eat a lot of plants.  While our digestive tract is shorter than it used to be, this probably has more to do with the advent of fire (cooking makes digestion much easier) both due to the timing and because it didn't occur in concert with the other changes typical of a more meat-based diet.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I disagree. You've confused signalling with communication. Communication is reciprocal. A signal - human or non-human - is not reciprocal (Think about traffic lights). If a rattlesnake and a cobra meet each other, both will signal to the other that they feel threatened but it's not quite the same degree of communication in the same way two human beings are sitting down and having a chat over a cup of coffee.
A victim doesn't need to ""communicate"" her situation in order for other people to infer what has happened to her. If she has a black eye and clearly suffering from trauma, these might be signs of rape/abuse/violation. I highly doubt the victim wants to communicate to others about anything, especially after being raped. In fact, in my experience with rape victims, they don't want to talk to anyone at all and you need to spend a lot of time with them just sitting there and being with them. Maybe you want to call her initial circumstances a form of ""communication"" but I would prefer to call them signals and until she engages in a form of dialogue, it is not communication at all.
That said, the rape victim will eventually communicate what happened to her to other people but this process does not require a pre-existing definition of rape in order for her to make sense of her experiences. Moreover, she doesn't need a philosophically robust definition of the word ""rape"" in order to communicate the experience to others. I don't think rape victims spend time thinking about the philosophical complexities in the word ""rape"" before they tell someone and I don't think anyone would care whether it is more accurate to define her experiences as ""rape"" or ""sexual assault"". If she doesn't have a working verbal lexicon to describe her experiences, she can still point, scream and cry enough for most reasonable people to guess what has happened to her.

Great question.  Drawing from your imagination stems from drawing from reference.  Drawing from life and reference acts as the foundation or leaping off point for you to create your own works.

We can't draw things that we don't know.  And when we create or draw things that don't exist, it is simply combinations of things that we do know.

To draw well from your imagination, you first need to learn how to see and to understand what you see.  Using reference and drawing from life can bring this understanding.   

The tools in this course are about simplifying and understanding what we see. 

Once you know (for example) the ins and outs of the human figure (using these tools), you can then begin to abstract it, simplify it, and move it around without need for reference.  


**Some simple advice for drawing a character from your imagination (its all about shapes)**

1.  Find reference (inspiration) for your character
2.  Simplify what you see using simple shapes
3.  Look for interesting shapes and combination shapes
4.  Build your character's structure from shapes using a foundation knowledge of anatomy
5.  Use reference poses (take pictures of yourself) and the Line of Action to come up with interesting poses for your character
6.  Using your character's structure (shapes) integrate it overtop the Line of Action.

Essentially, this is what I did for my character I showed in the video.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Let me be crystal clear, I am in no way endorsing the notion that the tax cuts should have been signed into law under the Bush administration (just in case there was any doubt :) ). I completely agree with you, and let me restate again that from an economic standpoint there was absolutely no reason the cuts should have been allowed to pass. What I'm talking about is using the illogical tax cuts as a framework to transform them into something that could actually help the current economic climate. I completely agree with you.

However, from the opposite side of the spectrum, the trade cycle was in full upswing during those years which explains all of the Clinton-era economic growth and stabilization. The thing about the trade cycle is, no one can accurately predict when its going to suddenly upswing/downswing. The government took risks, stupid ones with the tax cuts, and they lost out. As stated in my first post, the MPC of the wealthy is too low to actually have a significant (i mean very significant) impact on the economy. Why they enacted the tax cuts is a mystery to everyone. However, the economic climate was also very different at the time. Domestic industries were performing better back then, and half of the economic issues we have today didn't exist.","1285899156"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; They used mostly JPEG encoded source images, and 'web optimized' ones at that. So results are only valid if you don't have source/better quality versions.

On the contrary, I'd say that is a very relevant measure, but for a different problem than you seem to be thinking of. Their numbers show that WebP is an *improvement over the old formats*, which means people have a reason to switch, which is probably what they're aiming at.

They don't say what the compression ratio is over uncompressed files, but in the cases they're dealing with, people have already decided to put images on the web, and the question is which format they will use. So comparisons are more relevant than absolute compression ratios.

Edit: saw your post further down. Yeah, they're compressing images that already have JPEG-lossiness in them, so things might change when they start with uncompressed images, but I think the fact that they can compress JPEGs more still shows what I said above. Anyway, if you really want to, you can use a two-step encoding process to get their results with any image: Original -&gt; JPEG -&gt; WebP (although I realize that's insane :) ).","1285899157"

Snatch any creature your opponent casts.

For those who aren't aware of the combo, Bazaar Trader can be used to give yourself *permanent* control of any creature you snatch with Act of Treason or Mark of Mutiny.  Just use it to give target creature you control (the one that's only on your side for a single turn) to target player (yourself).  Voila!  Cheap red Mind Control, except without an enchantment to target.

The Leyline is surprisingly awesome in this deck.  It lets you cast the Acts of Treason and Marks of Mutinies off turn.  I've snatched Gideon Jura that way (after he became a 6/6 creature).  The best use is to cast Acts or Marks when your opponent is swinging in with two creatures, expecting no resistance.  Even without a Bazaar Trader on the board, their attacking creature comes over to your side, untaps, and is available as a blocker.  Usually you can get rid of one creature.  A lot of the time, you can get rid of both, and for a single card.

Obviously fails against anything that doesn't rely on creatures.  It's great fun in casual play, though.","1285899199"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Do you have many pre-college friends?  I was in a similar situation when I went to school.  There were plenty of girls that I thought were nice and friendly, but no one that I really fit in with.  I tried a sorority and ended up with one close friend from that, but we don't keep in touch with each other much since graduation.  Truthfully, I am extremely close to my girlfriends from high school.  I spent four years in college feeling very similar to the way you feel now, only to come back to the friends who helped shape my personality over 10 years ago.  Now that we are a little older and out of college, we are busy with careers, relationships, grad-school, etc.  We are generally within an hour or so drive from each other, and most of us are even closer; however, we don't see each other as much as we all would like.  I have some friends at work who I see everyday, but although we have a lot in common, I can't imagine ever being as close with them as I am with ""my girls.""  We are all in very different careers, some of us are still living at home saving money; others are married with houses; and some are going back to school for a career change.  We have very different interests and personalities, but they are the only ones (aside from maybe my boyfriend...also a friend from high school) with whom I can be completely myself.  I know a lot of comments have mentioned talking to people in your classes--and I think that is a good idea--but don't overlook old friends you may have lost touch with.  They may be the ones who are there for you when your college friends disperse.

TL;DR:  How about reconnecting with high school/childhood friends?","1285899210"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I have to tell you that I have known of AE911 truth for a long time. I won't get in to it too much, I'll just ask these questions:

- There are over 5,000 licenced structural/civil engineers living in New York. How many have signed their petition? 5.

- Authority accounts for very little... it doesn't matter if you are an architect or engineer unless you can produce a peer-reviewed paper to support your findings.

I believe only 5 of the people on their petition have actually written a paper putting forward their beliefs; none of which have appeared in a peer reviewed journal for engineering, physics or architecture. 

Pay to play publications and those without proper peer review do not count.



- When they started their petition it was ""we will get 1,000 licensed AND degreed architects and engineers"", Then a little later they changed it to licensed OR degreed architects and engineers.

Now it is ""engineering or architectural professionals."" Of course professionals includes draftsmen, pretty much anyone who works in an architects office, computer modellers, managers, construction workers.... 

- Furthermore, you have to actually have a relevant field. If you are a sanitation engineer chances are you aren't properly qualified to write a paper on building materials. You find very few licensed structural engineers in the list and if you google those that you do find, you'll find little evidence that any have worked on large buildings.

- Where are these engineers at the 9/11 truth rallies? Seriously, the vast majority are high school / college students... and there aren't even many of them.

- There are 5000 engineers living in New York state, many of them have been deeply affected by 9/11. Of those 5000, how many have signed the petition? 5.

- If I were to start a group called ""Sharpshooters for JFK truth"" and got 4000 sharpshooters to say it DEFINITELY could not have happened that way... it wouldn't be enough. They would need to write some sort of paper and provide evidence.

&gt;All you need is scientific evidence that overwhelmingly suggests the original theory is dogshit or at least contains unusually significant amounts of dogshit.

Present me with their scientific evidence please, I'd like to see what peer reviewed papers you can dig up.

&gt;Perp-first science-2nd is how people get wrongly convicted of crimes and how entire countries get into unnecessary wars.

And if I say that all European women are stuck up and frigid so I'm only going to date Latin women, it doesn't mean the only reason I want to date them is because they have lower standards. It simply means I'm an asshole for making sweeping generalizations about a group of people.

What about the guy that has experienced relationships with certain types of women and has had bad experiences with all of them. If he starts dating women from a different country (or even religion) and finds that they don't possess the qualities that gave him those earlier bad experiences, is he really only dating them because 'They're the only ones who will put up with him'?

"toronto","t5_2qi63","- Get a warm coat or jacket. Layers are preferable to just one super-warm item. I like to go with a sweater, then a scarf that covers my chest for extra padding, and a jacket over that on the coldest of days.

- It will be *windy*, especially downtown where the tall buildings make a wind-tunnel effect. Windchill factor can make a -10 degree day feel like it's -30. It's a good idea for your jacket to be something that does a decent job of cutting some wind. Also, that scarf I mentioned will be a godsend when you can cover your face with it in these conditions

- A toque is mandatory. Get one that will cover your ears.

- Wear warm boots or, at the very least, thick socks. Expect your footwear to be in rough shape by spring. You're better off with something that has good treads, as you will be walking on ice.

- Unless you go to the park, or outside of Toronto, don't expect a white winter wonderland. The city is mostly ice and slush all winter.

- Be ready for it to be dark for more than you might be used to. At its worst it will only get light well past 7am, and will get dark just after 4pm.

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","I was pulling the population out of the air, but the point is still the same.  A small group of people hold a disproportionate amount of representation.  And... the Connecticut compromise is a result of the fragmentation of our citizens' loyalties at the inception of our constitution.  The fear was that another colony would monopolize the government and smaller states would be trampled.  This is a moot point in today's society.  We don't identify as North Dakotans or Ohioans.  We identify as US citizens and then our respective party.  There is no longer a need for individual states to be represented in this way.  Hell, I would even concede the two senator system if our congressional representation was appropriate.  As it stands, each state is guaranteed at least one representative ( this also means that each state gets a minimum of three electoral votes in the presidential election too) while the total number of representatives is capped at 435 thanks to public law 62-5.  This means that states with larger populations receive a proportionally lower amount of representation than smaller states.  So, basically both chambers of congress are skewed to overrepresent smaller states.  This works out very well for Republicans and conservatives.  ","1285899275"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilario_Pantano#April_15th_incident

&gt; As the platoon approached the compound, they saw a vehicle with two Iraqis in it. Pantano ordered his men to stop the vehicle and to have the occupants of the vehicle handcuffed. The vehicle was searched for weapons. Lieutenant Pantano remained with the captives, while the rest of his platoon secured the compound. The compound was deserted, but his men found a cache of arms, including ""several mortar aiming stakes, a flare gun, three AK47 rifles, 10 AK magazines with assault vests and IED making material.""[6]

&gt; When Pantano learned that the compound contained weapons, he ordered Sergeant Daniel Coburn and Corpsman George Gobles to watch for enemies. He then released the captives from their bonds so they could search the vehicle again more thoroughly. According to a statement Lieutenant Pantano made to military investigators in June 2004, he then used hand signals to order the captives to search the vehicle again.[7] According to Pantano, during the search of the vehicle he felt the Iraqis posed a threat to him. They were talking, and Pantano believed they were conspiring together. When they both turned to face each other, he shouted ""Stop!"" in both Arabic and English, and when they did not stop, he shot them. After emptying his magazine, he continued to fire. He later stated: ""I then changed magazines and continued to fire until the second magazine was empty...I had made a decision that when I was firing I was going to send a message to these Iraqis and others that when we say, 'No better friend, No worse enemy,' we mean it. I had fired both magazines into the men, hitting them with about 80 percent of my rounds.""[7]

"snowboarding","t5_2qi0t","This will be my 4th or 5th season snowboarding, I got a couple tips I guess:

1. I taught myself so I didn't need lessons, but that really depends on your natural abilities. I'd probably say (at least if you are getting a season pass) to try it on your own like 3 or 4 times. If you are having trouble with basic riding, then maybe think about lessons. At the same time though, try and think about how you are riding when you aren't on the hill. Carving and linking turns clicked in my head one day while I was walking to class, it was awesome.

2. For layering, just go buy an Airblaster Ninja Suit. They are awesome, very warm, with an insulated jacket you won't need anything else. Maybe a light sweatshirt for a shell jacket. I don't wear anything else for bottoms other than the suit and my snow pants.
3. First season will mostly be learning to ride, you will be VERY tired after each day, but hopefully you will progress quickly and start riding more difficult runs or starting to hit some easy features in the park. It will still be fun though!

4. My biggest piece of advice is to really try hard to learn to ride switch early on. I still can't ride very well switch, and I wish I had put more time into it earlier, because now I don't want to spend the time on it when I could be doing something more fun, yet my progress is suffering because of it. Try and get it down while you learn to ride at first, it'll help out a lot later!

Also, when you fall, JUST FALL. Do NOT put out your hands to try and catch yourself, it might be ok for easy falls, but if you get in the habit of doing that and try it on a harder fall, you will fuck your wrists up, and it is not fun. Did it to each wrist from skateboarding, I don't recommend it. Try and take it on your shoulders or your back, snow is usually pretty soft so it doesn't hurt very often at all.","1285899352"

* The politically correct notion of being a silent gentleman and ""supporting her decision"" whatever it may be is *bullshit*. A man should voice his concerns about pregnancy and the woman should seriously weigh the opinion of her partner when the time comes to make her own decision.
* That said, the decision is ultimately hers. It's transparently obviously that we shouldn't ever physically force someone to do something against their will. Moreover, once she has made up her mind, I believe the father should mute his objections and now make an effort to be at least emotionally supportive. I think this is an implicit obligation that emerges from the basic risks of having sex.
* **However**, if the father in question makes it absolutely clear that he does not want the child, and he makes this apparent within the appropriate time for an abortion, he should have the right to withdraw from any legal bindings to the child.

Here is something that doesn't make much sense to me. He literally has to BEG me to allow him to go down on me.

Literally, like ""Please, please baby, just for like 5 minutes, PLEASE!"" He really won't stop until I let him! Doesn't it seem like that's more about him getting what he wants then pleasuring me? If I don't want it, I don't want it?

Thank you for your personal ratio. While I realize that there isn't a ""normal ratio"", I was just wondering if it's COMMON for something more like a  5/95 ratio.

"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","Although interesting, that's not the right paper. It's a different one by the same author that instead tests university students with a specific subset of cognitive tasks. However, it did lead me to finding the [correct one](http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/pdf/1744-9081-6-55.pdf).

Unfortunately, my question remains unanswered. Apparently children were rated for attentiveness by their teachers with one of the tests used in [this crazy longitudinal study](http://www.oru.se/English/Research/Research-projects/project/School-of-Law-Psycology-and-Social-work/IDA-Individual-Development-and-Adaptation/). There isn't any more detail than that I'm afraid, except that none of the children were diagnosed ADHD.

On a more positive note, the study is fascinating - way better than the blurb describing it that has been linked to above. I'd highly recommend reading the whole thing, but if you have even a passing interest then check out this section:

&gt; The novel aspect of the proposed framework is that the SR [Stochastic Resonance: Noise-improved signaling] phenomena differs between individuals and these differences are linked to attention ability and neurotransmission in the brain in such way that inattentive persons need more external noise for a proper cognitive functioning.  In the model dopamine is the crucial neurotransmitter. This is because it modulates the neural cell’s responses to the environment and determines the probability that it will fire following the presentation of a stimulus. Alterations in dopamine function are related to individual differences in attention, cognition and motivated behavior. Dopamine release has both tonic (background levels) and phasic (response to specific environmental events) components regulated by different brain regions. Tonic dopamine levels are suggested to modulate the phasic reactivity; a low tonic level increases stimulus dependent phasic release, and the opposite, a high tonic level suppresses phasic release. Low tonic levels cause neural instability associated with cognitive symptoms such as failure to sustain attention. The hypodopaminergic state in ADHD is distinguished by low tonic dopamine levels leading to excessive reactivity to environmental stimulation.  If the firing probability or gain parameter is low, neurons will fire at random yielding poor cognitive performance. If the gain parameter is high there will be cognitive stability and thus high performance. This responsiveness of neurons is modulated via dopamine that enhances the differentiation between efferent firing and afferent external stimulation. It has been shown recently that neural noise related to dopamine tone is an integral part of inter-neuronal communication and that a sufficient level of noise may be necessary for normal function in the nervous system, through the process of SR. That is, there exists both external noise – outside of the nervous system – and neural noise (related to dopamine tone) inside the system.


&gt; The moderate brain arousal model (MBA), upon which the current study is based, is a neurocomputational model that relies on classic conditions for stochastic resonance and the modulating properties of dopamine-related gain and neural noise in determining neural responsivity. It suggests that the hypodopaminergic brain need higher input noise to function to its full potential. Thus the model suggests that external white noise could compensate for behavioral dysfunction connected to conditions caused by impaired dopamine transmission. Accordingly, ADHD children or low attentive children more generally have a low gain parameter owing to low levels of baseline dopamine neuron firing. Neurocomputationally the MBA model shows that more external environmental noise is required for optimal performance in cognitive tasks for such low gain “individuals” compared to high gain “individuals”. Accordingly, external noise, it is 
predicted by the model” will compensate for reduced neural background activity in ADHD. That is to say that increased levels of external auditive noise can activate    internal noise and restore the activity level. Further, given the inverted U function that operates in relation to noise and performance in SR, the MBA model also predicts that levels of background noise that might be beneficial for ADHD children would be detrimental for those with normal attention. Crucially, the beneficial effects are not specific to ADHD.","1285899383"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","True, there can be unknown triggers. With a dog that is just waking up, as with a person just waking up, you'd probably be a little more likely to see some erratic behavior. But in terms of aggression, dogs don't do anything as severe as viciously attacking people unless they are very unbalanced. My corgi has been stepped on a few times and she's nipped at people as an instinctive reaction, but she's never bitten anyone and has never shown any aggressive behavior towards people (some towards our golden retriever, but that's a different story and is the result of a somewhat unstable pack environment -- it's really hard to keep six people treating their dogs the same way). I can know, because she is a fairly well-balanced dog, that she would never attack a person.

Even if you have a seemingly stable dog who does something unexpected, an owner who behaves like a pack leader will have no trouble getting the dog under control and correcting the behavior. There is always that chance of something unexpected triggering the dog, but it should never be severe and it is always controllable with the right attitude and discipline.","1285899426"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;There is an idea of Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an identity, something illusory, and though I hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, *I simply am not there*.

&gt;It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused, and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed.

&gt;I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this - and I have, countless times, in just about every act I've committed - and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing...

 - Brett Easton Ellis, *American Psycho,* pp. 377

I used to quote that [every time somebody freaked out about the movie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/7kwq9/my_god_it_even_has_a_watermark/)  I stopped because I got sick of people downvoting a *direct fucking quote from the book.*

You have *no idea* what Patrick Bateman sounds like.


EDIT:  I'm sorry, that came off as harsh.  You've hit on one of my least-favorite aspects of Reddit, the slavish adulation of catch-phrases and memes with absolutely no regard as to their overall meaning or context.  I'm not really sure if you meant that as insult or flattery.  Probably you meant it as ""hey, hivemind, upvote me for paying lip service to one of your memes.""  What you may not realize, however, is that you just compared me to a heartless and astoundingly vapid serial killer whose primary claim to fame is [acts so unspeakably vile that Simon and Schuster opted not to publish them.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_psycho#Controversy)  There's no way I can take that as flattery, and as insult it's well beyond anything I've earned here.

Brett Easton Ellis is a damaged man.  Every book he's ever written is about damaged, unlikeable people and in that pantheon, Patrick Bateman is far and away the most damaged, unlikeable person he's ever written.  When a man who only sees humans for their shallowness and tendency to hurt each other sets out to write a story about someone so immune to human love and joy that he must murder and defile prostitutes to feel emotion, he ends up writing a literarily execrable profile of something so shallow as to be monstrous.  And you chose to compare me to this person for knowing something about fame.  But you probably didn't even know that.

Which, I'm sure, would either amuse or infuriate Ellis to no end.  After all, his whole point in creating Patrick Bateman was to satirize a society so self-involved with keeping up with the Joneses and impressing your friends and neighbors that you don't even notice what's inside, no matter how monstrous.  Yet somehow or other, The Internet has taken to American Psycho the way gay men have taken to Showgirls and now every mention of watermarks, business cards or Genesis is an invitation to wallow in a self-reinforcing quotefest that would put nerds at a Monty Python convention to shame.  And really, that makes the cruel irony so meta that it makes my stomach sour.

So.  Thanks, I guess.  Or fuck you, I guess.  Take your pick.  Either way, I really wish you knew what the fuck you were talking about when you said it.  Because you probably wouldn't have.  But then, if the rest of your audience knew what you were talking about, you wouldn't have been tempted to say anything at all.","1285899441"

Your hackneyed explanation of his psyche which you somehow attribute to Christian Socialism, ""Blue-Collar Politics"" and a pro-tolerance stance is just completely uninformed and pedestrian.  It seems you are responding in a shallow, and simplistic way to your gut feelings about him.  Really. You demonize him a vastly disproportionate amount.  I mean, I was anti-Moore when Capitolism:A Love Story came out, but the way you fanatically caricature him really is unwarranted, considering how many other shallow, naive, and uneducated people there are, say, posting on reddit or doing countless other things.  In fact, your whole hate of Michael Moore reeks of cognitive dissonance, where you claim to not like most of his politics, yet on every concrete issue listed, you agree with his views, only to a more moderate degree.  In the end, your comments about Michael Moore end up being very naive.

FFA's battle were the least monotonous battles of any tactics game I've ever played. I almost chose to deliberately ignore the schedule just for the sheer joy of not knowing what was going to happen in advance, though in the later game that became a bit dangerous.

Forcing the player to remember the rules themselves was blindingly stupid, and I find it a pity the brilliant mechanics have disappeared behind the overwhelming awfulness of that move. It should simply have been impossible to break the rules at all, rather than beating the player up. Very sad.","1285899489"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","tl;dr version:  The code contains the word ""Myrtus"", the Latin biological term for the myrtle tree. The Hebrew word for myrtle, Hadassah, was the birth name of Esther, the Jewish queen of Persia.  In the bible, Esther advocates a preemptive attack on enemies.

That's pretty convoluted, if you ask me.


**[This explanation](http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/272/Myrtus_and_Guava_Episode_3) makes more sense:**

&gt; “Myrtus (myrtle) is a genus of one or two species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae,” and “The Myrtaceae or Myrtle family are a family of dicotyledon plants, placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, clove, guava, feijoa, allspice, and eucalyptus belong here.”

&gt; Why the sudden foray into botany? Because the rootkit driver code contains the following string:

&gt; b:\myrtus\src\objfre_w2k_x86\i386\guava.pdb

&gt; Project “Myrtus”. Module “Guava”.

Parties at DTD would go until 3 or 4 in the morning and one day, i heard that delt raised the poo alarm. Someone had pinched off a stink pickle on a coffee table at some point in the evening. We at SAE noted it during our chapter meeting and nothing more was said. The next wednesday, phi delt got hit, this time in a sock drawer. Pictures were taken and passed out to the various fraternities as a cautionary warning. We thought it was independant guys living in a coop. There was a two week pause in poo. Then our quarterback met the poo bandit face to face . Rather, face to foot. As he was wont to do, he picked up a drunk chick, fucked her and hung out for a bit before passing out. He was sitting on a couch and she was sitting on his feet against his legs. They passed out. He awoke to a foul smell and a warm sensation on his feet. Poo. He looked around the room and found the chick spattering diarrhea inside of a wicker magazine holder three feet away in a way that was described as ""south park wow episode-esque"". Some got on his face. He raised the alarm, startled the poo bandit, and chased her out of the house. She was naked and covered in shit. He was naked, covered in shit and still had the condom on. As she made her escape, each step down the hall and down the stairs left a small puddle of fear diarrhea. It was 12:30 am and the party was still going strong. 14 people vomited from the sight and smell. One poor soul slipped in one puddle and fell face first into another puddle.

Being able to handle any kind of jpeg2000 meant you had to work with and understand a large complex spec. The open source implementation was baroque and slow. The closed source commercial was better, but we had issues wrtlicensing costs. 

Libjpeg's API is a walk in the park relatively speaking. I never worked with what became jpeg XP, but if webp is simple to work with it'll go a long way towards eventual adoption. 

*Edit*: Quickscan: looks pretty easy to use.  That's the advantage of not being designed by committee to include a kitchen sink (I'm looking at you JPEG2000).

I don't take personal offense at the posts you write about me, so please don't take it personally when I come out in disagreement with the narrative you're trying to spin about someone else.  As far as I'm concerned, that previous post you wrote about me is textbook ""drama"":

http://irresistibledisgrace.wordpress.com/2010/08/14/aggressive-advertising/

Did I get upset?  No, I had a good chuckle and moved on.  But you do have a track record of spinning narratives that are quite loosely tethered to reality for no other apparent purpose than producing a little drama.

Regarding your second graf and specifically your complaint that if John deletes comments under his own post that it somehow ""gets pinned on the rest of the permas"":  Sorry, buddy, but that is just crazy talk.  Can you point to a single comment anywhere on the interwebz where anyone ever even hinted at such a thing?  Everybody knows John's M.O.  He is the grandmaster of SELF-censorship.  This is common knowledge.  Nobody anywhere blames anyone but John Dehlin for deleting comments under his own post.    

At this point, I would suggest tempering your rants about John.  Now that you've already announced your decision to set up a new blog, to keep pounding on John gives the impression that you're trying to ""poison the well"" before moving on to greener pastures.

Also, John has publicly posted his version of events.  Considering that you're not mentioned in that chronology, how did you become tasked with offering the alternative version?  It sure seems like Cheryl (Bored in Vernal) ought to be the one stepping up and providing that.  But so far, all I've heard from her is that she's now a guest blogger at FPR (the bloggernacle blog that hosted the initial unethical discussion about John Dehlin and MM's internal issues).

(That is to say, a man could identify as straight while raping young boys, and another man could identify as gay while raping young girls.)

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm being honest - there were times that O'Reilly strayed from the usual partisan narrative, effectively saying ""I know what you're hearing, but it's bogus and here's why."" One example was his support for decriminalization of pot, or his claim that if they didn't find the WMD's Bush was harping his presidency would be ruined (of course he was right, though Bill himself stepped away from condemnatory comments once it was clear they weren't finding any weapons). O'Reilly *was* a step up from the Coulter/Hannity stuff I was really into at the time, and his rhetoric had a semblance of moral and pragmatic underpinning to it rather than the snarky, distant purely Dem-bashing diarrhea of Ingraham or Drudge's radio (I listened to a *lot* of these guys at the time, bleh). O'Reilly effectively moved me beyond the need for O'Reilly, if that makes sense. The mere repetition of ""I don't care what party it comes from if it's true,"" even if O'Reilly rarely lived up to that mantra, came at an important time for me.

I should clarify that coming out of an extreme partisan viewpoint, where the rightness or wrongness of an opinion was tied into effectively who was giving it rather than what was being said, hearing that a few times made a BIG difference. I doubt that most people will have this effect from O'Reilly's show, and to be fair he was never as big of an ass on the radio (it was less structured and didn't have ""talking points"" among other things).

There are generally believed to have been two possible routes through AK, a coastal route and inland mountain passes.  

As to that older group that may have been related to the Australian Aboriginal.... it is still generally held that their last contact with the people who would have ended up in Australia would have been ~10000 years before either got to their ultimate destination (which puts it in the 30-40K years back time frame to us), and they would have split off somewhere in lands we now call either India or China. With ~1/2 the group going north to Alaska and then into the new world and the other ~1/2 going South and ending up in Australia.  

In short, Aboriginals didn't set sail to L.A. from Sydney.  ","1285899604"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Have you tried cutting calories massively for a short time or intermittent fasting?  I haven't tried IFF myself but when I first started I had the same problem you do.  I went from 4-5k/day of calories to 900-1200 calories/day for about two weeks and then upped my calories to 1500 then 1800 and now keep it in the 1800-2300 range.  So long as I avoid super calorie dense food (like the peanut butter you mention, i find it horrible for hunger satisfaction) and aim for high fiber/protein foods I have trouble hitting 2k+/day if I eat just when I'm hungry.  If I try eating a 200-400 calorie meal every 3 hours I'm pretty much forcing myself to eat it.  When you choose the *right* foods that work for *your* body you can get very satisfied without a huge caloric expenditure.  Sounds like all the low carb advice won't work for you but maybe you just need to aim for different carbs?  Add a crapton of fiber if you can.  I've become a huge fan of high fiber bread (oroweat/arnold double fiber bread, 70 cals per each huge slice), add some lean meat and cheeses and provides high satisfaction at fairly low calories and satisfies my grain addiction.  Eat a sandwich slowly, chew it, savor it.  Don't just inhale it like your pride is measured on cleaning your plate before anyone else even starts eating.  Be the *last* to finish your meal when your out with friends.  Put your food in small containers.  It's not so much about portion size, its about getting your brain into eating less but still giving it that ""Yes I finished my meal, my plate it clean!"" mental checkmark it wants.

Before I use to look at the most $ for the most calories because I was poor and only had a couple bucks to spend on food per month, rent/bills ate everything, minimum wage sucked.  Now I'm not hunting down pennies for food and I look for the largest bulk items with the lowest caloric density.  Same thought process but $'s aren't the biggest concern now, my health is.  Keep hunting for different foods until you find which work for you to get rid of that craving.  ""Diet"" does not mean starvation, if you feel hungry all the time, your doing it wrong.

I own a Captivate, and my GPS locates 0 satellites and has never locked on once. YMMV; for some people, the GPS is amazing. 

As to UI responsiveness:

The phone is snappy, no other way to put it (And the UI looks nice on the SAMOLED :) ) . Put a launcher other than TWiz and it'll fly. Put a custom ROM on it, and it becomes even faster. 

The real issue, IMO, is the lack of transparency and support with Samsung; They said there would be a GPS fix ""in september"", released an OTA patch, which they then state / don't state has the GPS fix, and leave everybody whose GPS is still borked in limbo. ","1285899632"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","The current season is 20 games -- 4 preseason games and 16 regular season. (Plus an optional 4 weeks of playoffs) An 18 game regular season would remove 2 of these preseason games, meaning that some of the injuries sustained in those preseason games would actually mean something for the team (and actually be attending by fans who cared). 

Adding 10 more players to the roster with 4 only for special teams? Get ready to see an addition of some basketball players for the kick blocking squad, but no real difference in the number of downs your average linesman plays. 

6 more weeks of offseason? Maybe this is more time to spend with their families while they still have their mental faculties, but it's not going to mean any fewer hits or injuries. It will mean that free agents have less time to learn new systems, and players in general are less prepared.

An 18 game season is a win for everyone. Fewer pointless games which the fans will enjoy. More tickets in a season for good games means ticket prices will go down on secondary markets, but more tickets will be sold overall, which pleases fans and ownership. As revenue rises owners can afford to pay players more which helps them as well.

If you disagree, what makes 16 games the right number? Should we go to 12 (like college) to reduce some chance of injury?","1285899682"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It is interesting that people refer to the facial covering as being an ""Islamic"" veil. To my knowledge, it is not mandated or encouraged in the *Qur'an*. I have never even heard of any *hadith* that mandate it. 

My understanding is that it is a non-Islamic (""non"", not ""anti"") cultural phenomenon that, in some areas, became intertwined with the idea of a faithful, believing woman being modest. 

Karen Armstrong, in *Muhammed: A Biography of the Prophet*, suggests that is was result of (step 1) Muhammed's wives wearing a portable curtain as the *Qur'an* commanded them, (step 2) post-death-of-Mohammed Arab exposure to Persian elites who covered their faces to prevent the lower classes from seeing them, and (step 3a) Muslim women wanting to imitate Muhammed's wives and (step 3b) the perception that, within the Islamic community, members were meant to all be equal, so the wearing of a facial veil by Mohammed's wives came to be seen as quasi-elitist, and the other women wanted to re-equalize the community.

Of course, at any point where it became mandated by culture, the symbol changed because someone could mandate it. As an example for clarification: Do peasants get to tell a king that he must wear a crown on his head? Or, does the king get to tell the peasants that they cannot wear crowns on their head? If you are forced to do something, even take on something that was a symbol of goodness and equality, the act of being forced to do it changes the symbol into a symbol of being coerced by others.","1285899714"

"politics","t5_2cneq","They have 20% unemployment, deficits of 12% of GDP, massive government debt, and suffered a property bubble.  International financial markets are reluctant to lend them more money for fear of sovereign default.  Members of the Euro-zone agreed to keep within some fiscal guidelines, which Spain is no longer anywhere near staying within.  The government is going to adopt austerity measures (raising taxes, drastically cutting spending) in order to balance the budget sometime in the foreseeable future.  People hate having to pay higher taxes or enjoy less generous benefits.  

An additional problem stems from the two-tier labor market in Spain.  They have generous labor protection regulations that make it very difficult to fire regular workers and mandate generous benefits for these workers.  Firms are thus reluctant to hire such workers since they won't be able to get rid of them in a downturn.  Because of this, most young people are either unemployed or work on temporary contracts, which offer few if any of the protections of permanent jobs.  With unemployment at 20%, those with protected jobs don't want to face reforms that would make them easier to fire (they don't care about the 20% of people who can't get jobs as a result of their protections).  

tl;dr Spain's economy is doing terribly, the government is trying to adopt austerity measures and reforms to fix it, the Spanish people don't want to bear the cost because of short-sightedness (and selfishness, in my opinion).","1285899776"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Perhaps I should have used the word ""popularity"" rather than ""quality"". Whitman's work is superlative, sure; but, has it sold as many copies as the more popular fiction works of today?

My point was this: while labor involved and quality of work are worthy considerations, there has to be a reasonable upper limit beyond which it no longer matters. Five years to wait for a chair is too long; forty years to wait for a poetry collection--again, no matter how grand--is too long. Why did Whitman get away with it? ***Because nobody was waiting for it.*** When a modern publisher commissions a book or is told about it by his favorite author, there is an understanding that there will be a reasonable amount of time between initiation and final delivery. However, if someone is approached by a publisher out of the blue, the publisher isn't going to say, ""I don't know you, Fred Author Bloggs, but if you say it took you forty years to pen this, I believe you and *I care*; here are a billion dollars.""

Not to belittle Walt Whitman's achievement (I am a big fan of poetry), but, while he was obviously a significant poet, he didn't spend the entire forty years doing nothing in a professional capacity except for composing poetry for *Leaves of Grass*. The very fact that he had a day job means that, at best, he spent a few hours every evening and time on the weekends on it. This *is* different from someone who earns his living entirely by writing; Whitman might have finished sooner if he'd not had to teach, grade papers, etc. Stephen King does *not* lay brickwork on the side to make ends meet while he writes; *writing* is what occupies his time professionally.

EDIT: Screw it, I don't care.

I'll just leave this here:

*Pretax Income*

1979     12,200 (lowest quintile)   40,700 (middle quintile) 

2005     12,400 (lowest quintile)   49,500 (middle quintile)

Yes, wages have gone up.  However, even using inflation to normalize dollar values, this is still a very reductive view of how people are paid with respect to the state of the economy.  It is completely ignorant of cost of living.  If you want a proper picture of how inflation, tax rates, and wages affect people in various economic levels, you need to look at data adjusted based on CPI.  Interestingly, data adjusted by CPI (which I admittedly have been trying to find a good source for since we've been talking about this), shows exactly what I've been saying all along: decline and/or stagnation.

An example, not made by a professional, but sourced from Census data: http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n204/mikekoss/CPIAdjustedIncome.jpg

My experience in the industry ranged from bad to horrible and had I had any other option, I would have quit in an instant. It's bad enough that your employer treats you like shit. Like they're doing you a favor for having you around. Having the worst possible people in management positions. People who could not care less if you're feeling like shit so long as you show up in an uniform. In a retail setting you're not an employee, you're a _resource_ in every sense of the word and they make damn sure you feel that way as well. That would be bad enough, but no, then you have really shitty, rude, asinine customers treating you even worse with the unspoken threat that ""I'm gonna bitch to your boss unless you please my every capricious whim.""

* Who do you pay your hydro bill to?  toronto hydro or someone else?  i heard 18% or something is likely on distribution charges. blaming the province is fair in the macro history... but toronto needs major infrastructure repairs.

HST = province and the feds.  i agree.  i suspect you are more knowledgeable about tax and the general debt issue verses the layman.  the layman doesn't drive to deep into politics,,, he's concerned about his livelihood and family.  however, the financial impact is not about street, neighborhood or city.  the effect effects us all... and blaming the feds doesn't take away from the loss of buying power we face.

Technically flawed answer. Two organisms genetically similar to chicken but not chicken give birth to a chicken, which is the know the first and sole member of it's species.

Their algorithm was completely random (or as random as a computer can be, or so they said), but people thought it wasn't random enough, so they added a slider in the prefs to make it more or less random...more random actually being less random since it would actively avoid similar songs and stuff.  I don't see it in the current prefs so maybe they got rid of it.  It might have been removed when they added Genius since it makes more sense to use that.  I do remember using shuffle back when I got my first Mac in '03 and having that death spiral you speak of, it was kind of annoying, but at the same time, I kind of liked that shuffle always seemed to magically have good songs.  Even if they were songs I played much, since it was a fresh import, it seemed to land on the singles off albums somehow.

Lists help.  Every Sunday night I make a list of what I need to get done each day of the week, and I try to make it so that I just do a little bit of schoolwork each day.  Its really satisfying to cross stuff off, too.  It helps you visualize all the work you've gotten done and makes you feel better about yourself.

Hang out with motivated people.  I find its contagious.  If everyone around you is getting their shit done it'll make you want to do the same.  Maybe joining a club could help.

Don't think about and dread homework for hours, just do it without thinking about it.  Soon it will become a habit and the fact that you are in the habit of staying on top of things will act as motivation to keep it up.","1285899905"

"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","ADHD is a disorder of executive function. Executive function, in a nutshell, is a blanket term for the processes involved in allocating cognitive resources to tasks. Those with ADHD are more prone to improperly allocate resources for a given task than a person without. This can manifest as an inability to perform a task, but the converse is also true, a single task may become the center of attention without regard for anything else. 

It's taken me 21 years and taking medication for half of that to finally get to a point where I A) can tell if I am under/overallocating cognitive resources and B) not have total control, but can at least point the overallocation in a general direction.

It's still difficult to get done what I need to get done, but at least I'll end up doing something else productive (see: struggling in CS courses but getting my non-class-work accepted to SIGGRAPH)","1285899906"

"PipeTobacco","t5_2rbzz","I'll reply to this one as it is easier...

There is definitely a coating on mine.  It may be too many coatings of varnish or it may be something else that has made it's own body but it isn't something that has soaked into the wood and become part of the external body of the pipe.  On the side that isn't bubbling it has a great finish which feels like the more expensive pipes I felt as testers and I guess I was too optimistic that it would last.

I think I should add that £30 for a pipe in my town isn't the cheapest but it is on the pretty low end.  £20 is the cheapest I could find and I do plan to head to my brother's town to get a new pipe as the guys who worked there were younger than me yet had enough experience that they could advise me better on tobacco than any other tobbaconist I've ever met: They are both 21 and full time pipe smokers.  They spoke to me as a 24 new time pipe smoker and assumed I meant I was smoking rollies for half the conversation as they so rarely meet ""young"" pipe smokers but when they realised they were so helpful.  I should be able to get a good pipe from them.  

EDIT: I didn't expect to rant on this long.  TL;DR My current pipe isn't great, externally anyway; I know some kids who should be able to hook me up with a good one.","1285899907"

I also think I cried considerably more than I do these days, and I think my skin was baby soft.  I was also pretty quiet/shy.

These days, I'm an assertive no-bullshit kinda woman. If people around me in my life now knew about my past, they'd probably say, “So *that's* why she's so strong willed…”, which sounds plausible, unless you had actually met that earlier version-1.0 me.

Taxation: I know salary below 94k is not taxed but beyond that you pay tax at the gross salary rate. How does one minimize the tax exposure when housing is paid for too?

Coming back to the US: Having an Arab sounding name with my last experience in the middle east, I am fearful of being discriminated again upon return or having a viable opportunity to return. I have a friend who just returned from a 5 years stint that echoed similar concerns.

Bass just does what I prefer about guitar playing.  I can focus more on melodies and small chords while still having a full sound.  I like the string size and the feeling of playing it.","1285899946"

"programming","t5_2fwo","(before I start, have an upvote for asking a sincere question instead of flaming me for having made a different choice than you)

serious answer:

In my previous role, I worked for one of the largest banks in the US. Businesses like that definitely frown on letting someone else host their code.


In my current role I am the lead architect of a small team of engineers at a small startup. We definitely have the in-house know-how if we wanted to do it ourselves - but we chose not to.


Since you seem genuinely interested I'll list some points that factored into our decision making.


First, ""Most businesses"" is pretty broad. I'd be willing to bet that you'd be surprised by how many businesses use services to host their code off-site.


One of the reasons companies often list for keeping the repository in house, is that they don't want to ""depend"" on some other company. ""What if they go out of business? Where will our code go?"" and questions like that pop up all the time. The reality though is that distributed VCS like Hg and Git have made this concern obsolete. If Bitbucket goes out of business I have a complete repository with all relevant history sitting on my computer right here. To top that off, I keep my Hg repo inside of a Dropbox folder (see dropbox.com) so all of my personal machines always have a synchronized copy of the repo. If Bitbucket dissapears I can easily initialize a new central repository for my team, or if we were in a real pinch, I could even serve as the central repository from my laptop.


Another objection companies have is that they are worried about their precious source code being ""stolen"" perhaps by a competitor. I can understand this concern, but in my experience most companies I have worked with who felt this way, didn't actually have anything that was special enough to steal. If your repository contains the key algorithm that makes your entire organization defensible, keep it in house. Otherwise you are likely being overprotective.


For us the final decision came down to the reality that we have a small team. Yes, we CAN do it ourselves, but what does that mean to us? It means we're going to have to run a server to host the central repo. No big deal I can get a small instance at Amazon EC2 for around 60 bucks a month. Next, it's going to be someones job (everyones job?) to keep on top of security updates for that server and the software on it, to make sure it's maintained, that it doesn't run out of disk space, etc. This isn't really a TON of work, but it is the kind of thing that can make an otherwise productive engineer lose focus for a few hours to a day once a month or so. No big deal, until you start to add up all of the small things that you are doing yourself in your organization. Just in server management alone I already have to worry about app servers, message queues, data servers, caches, streaming media servers, etc. The last thing I want to have to worry about on any given day is whether or not I am going to lose a guy for a few hours because of the VCS server.


Bitbucket does one thing well. They host source code, and the do it for less money than if I did it myself. I have a lot of concerns that come up every iteration, but thanks to Bitbucket my VCS isn't one of them.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","A lot of other people here are warning you about the 'bad' side of winter, so I'm going to let you know about the positives.  Winter sports.

1.) Hockey

Hockey season is just about to start and it is pretty much a religion here, even though our team has been terrible for several years.  Think of it as Rugby on ice played at a faster pace where everyone carries a stick.  There are many places in the city where you can go skating and if you get comfortable enough on skates it's not hard to find a game of pickup hockey that you can join.

2.)Skiing/snowboarding.  

There's nothing like flying down a hill whether standing on one board or two.  There are a few small hills close to the city which are good for learning but once you've picked it up you've got to travel for a couple hours to get to a decent hill.  A trip of several hours, either into Quebec or the North Eastern U.S., will get you to some mountains where you can find some great skiing.  If you want something a little more tame you can try tobogganing or tubing, which are a lot more passive.   

Days are fairly short during the winter so it's important to get as much sun as you can, especially if you are working indoors all day.  Its possible that you will be getting to work before the sun comes up and leaving after its gone down.  If you're stuck in this situation I would suggest taking some vitamin D supplements.","1285899960"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Tell them how it looks to you from the outside. Listen. Hold them. Treat them with respect and dignity for no other reason than all people deserve respect and dignity. Offer to help one of them find a therapist, and hold her hand in the waiting room before she goes into the office to talk. Be prepared to find out how the dregs of your gender, who make all of you look bad, behave and rationalize it. You will be angry if you know more. You wouldn't be a bad friend, per se, for just washing your hands of their situations. You may be pulled in to the issue, and I can't fault anyone for not wanting to get into the drama. If you really want to help them, though, you might have to get involved if it's truly unconscionable.

Before I began taking care of myself, I had to be told how my friends, these people I loved and saw a lot less of because of my abusive boyfriends, saw the relationship(s). I had a lot of awkward conversations in which friends held me close and told me ""You're good for more than sex! My god, why would you think that? Who touched you!? Who hurt you so badly!?"" I had to be FORCED to accept I had worth and my friends made me tag along to events and hobbies just to get me away from my ex. When I stopped feeling afraid, shaky, and panicked all the times I wasn't around him, I realized what these guys had done all this time. 

I thought I was stupid, ugly, worthless, shiftless, lazy, and LUCKY those guys even stuck their dick in me, much less treated me nicely sometimes. I saw my abuse as a crucible, a gauntlet I could come through transformed if only I could withstand it long enough, like a good girl. My family wondered about my safety but didn't say much because I hid it from them. I don't blame them--they were normal, kind parents. They never instilled in me anything but a feminist, assertive, education-oriented worldview. It was a string of awful, abusive male friends and lovers who slowly chipped away what was ""me"" until only ""crying cumdumster"" was left.

My own internalized misogyny, homophobia, and plain, abject fear is what kept me in those abusive relationships. I didn't want to be a lesbian, though I felt it was terrible and inevitable, and I was too afraid of getting an ego (geeky men always complain about ""vapid cunts"" and I'd totally internalized that), so I took humility too far. I just wanted to be looked at as a good, submissive, commendable woman. I thought saying ""FUCK YOU!"" to those guys would turn my male friends on me, saying I was every kind of awful feminist stereotype and a dyke and evil. I was afraid of my female friends saying I was a slut for wanting to be with someone else. The societal pressure kept me there, not to mention the mindgames of ""Other men will just rape you and beat you. I'm safe. Only I can keep you safe."" 

TL;DR: Low self-esteem is how they got there. Society is why they stayed. Abusive mindgames are why they can't leave without help. You can help, but you'll need fortitude to do it.","1285899961"

So my 9th grade English teacher had a ridiculous way of penalizing you for missing assignments: homework alerts. These little slips of paper were a real bitch, as you had to take them home and get them signed by your parents (which would cause my stress filled mother to blow). Naturally, I devised a solution to this dilemma, and created my own signature. After months of forging, I was calmly reading in class when my teacher called me over to her desk. She asked me if I had been forging my homework alerts. Of course, I said no. But then she pulls out a fucking cabinet full of all the alerts she's accumulated during the year. At this point I was nearly shitting my pants, but kept a calm expression. Then she pulled out two homework alerts. I looked at the papers, and nearly panicked: I had mistakenly placed mine along with theirs on the ""student signature"" line. I worried she would pull out a third alert that contained my signature forging theirs. She asked whose signature that was. I told her it was mine. She asked why I placed my signature on it. I pointed at the words ""student signature."" 2 seconds of silence. And then: ""Oh ok, sorry about that!"" And with that she smiled and placed them back in her cabinet.","1285899964"

Here in Mass. anyone can yield the right of way. This is necessary at some intersections where there is constant traffic at certain times of the day so that people who don't have the right of way can proceed.

In fact they had to start putting up these stupid four way stop signs so that people would yield the right of way.

Talk about impeding the flow of traffic.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My family was middle class. One day my dad decides to start taking morphine pills he snagged off an employee and it was downhill from there. This led to harder and harder drugs until crack and heroin were a daily routine. 

I started smoking pot at twelve just to be edgy and hopefully make more friends. This did in fact get me some ""friends"" but not the type I would have preferred in hindsight. It eventually led to me being kicked out of school and continuing on a downward spiral. I began to sell LSD and take it every other day. This was mostly stupid kid shit until my dad and I crossed paths in our drug use.

I was generally curious about drugs and would try most anything once. At 16 I found my dads crack stash, and not knowing what it was I put it into my bong. This was the start of a long addiction fueled by the scraps of my dads habit. I would stay awake all night waiting for him to leave or fall asleep so I could go into his bathroom and pick at his carpet or hopefully find something substantial. 

This went on for awhile until my mom came home from work early and saw me picking at the carpet. She just broke down crying and I left the room feeling like total shit. About a week later a friend and me were tripping and decided to drive about 800 miles to Florida. Even in my sate of mind I knew why I was doing this. I needed to get away from the source. 

I returned home after about a week only to find that my mother had started using. She couldn't live without my dad and would have rather joined him than left him. This was devastating to me. I called the cops on my parents at one point when they were checked out on heroin partly because I wanted them to get help and partly because I wanted them to suffer in jail. The cops came over and saw their bedroom with needles and vomit all over the place. They did nothing. They told me I was better here than in foster care and left. 

After this I decided to take another journey and traveled to the northeast where I was basically homeless for much of the time. The good part was that I only had access to grass and acid. this lasted for six months and I returned home, but this time I wasn't going to live with my parents just to start the cycle over. I put them out of my life and proceeded to find a job.

Luckily years later my parents got out of their addiction and returned to the middle class as best they could. I have since gone to college and have had many great adventures around the world. ","1285900030"

Teams make these kind of acquisitions all the time  and when you put 3 apparent superstars on one team invariably someone's stats will take a hit.  They're no more stacked than the Magic or the Celtics and nowhere *near* as stacked as the year the Lakers signed Payton and Malone.  Yet the Lakers did not win that year.

BASIC is (usually) an interpreted language, so nothing gets compiled.  VB.NET is compiled to bytecode, which gets interpreted by the .NET runtime.  That also means you can't do any of the PEEK and POKE antics that were common in BASIC's heyday.

Dropbox is used to sync certain apps, so it is nice to have around.     
Calcbot, if you need a calculator     
Remote (from Apple) for controlling iTunes     
Plex and/or KLEXi if you are a Plex user

Check your state's laws about secret taping. If it's a one-party consent state, record everything that you can.

Pursue them criminally and civilly to the full extent of the law.

- the further away you get from the people the smaller they appear.  
- the moon however is /already/ far away - stepping abck a few hundred yards doesn't make it look any smaller.

solution: find a very long beach (a hundred-ish yards deep), get your models to stand near the water.  pizow!  tiny people in front of a very large moon.

I generally enjoy being the submissive one, but if EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. we have sex he's dom, it gets kind of boring. I mean, having sex almost every day for almost 4 years with someone and being submissive over 95% of the time gets BORING. 
I do think sex ""should"", or I don't believe in a ""should"", but I would PREFER if sex was more mutual in control. Not only that, but I like the idea of surprising my man with a blow job, and him just sitting back and enjoying it. But he won't even LET me do that.

He did say that he ""felt guilty"", but it seemed really insincere, like that's something that he's heard someone else and he thought it would work in this situation. He doesn't feel guilty when he pressures me into having sex with him when I'm **SUPER OBVIOUSLY** not into it. Ex: I was watching a movie, and he decided he was in the mood. He told me he wanted to have sex, I told him I wasn't interested and I wanted to concentrate on the movie I was watching, BUT HE STILL fucked me anyway. He's NEVER, NEVER been violent with me in ANY way, but if he decides to fuck me without my consent ... it kind of feels a little rape-y. But I'd never use that word to describe the situation because he's just an inconsiderate dick sometimes, not a RAPIST.","1285900134"

If you want to do it free just swipe some sand from somewhere, and bust it up with a claw hammer and your hands and mix it good.","1285900166"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Thanks so much for your interesting and insightful reply. What you wrote for what you would change is especially poignant! I've been witness, first hand, to females (some young, others older) using the ol' ""you can't hit girls"" to their advantage around boys/guys.

It starts off with childish taunting and if it goes unchecked it can go into straight-up bullying of a spouse. On MTV's *Teen Mom* you can see the transformation first hand, the latest episode shows a 17 year old mother punching her ex-fiance in the face. Shocking and saddening stuff. I hope that it will produce equal amounts of controversy and attention as the SnookiePunch did. ","1285900173"
