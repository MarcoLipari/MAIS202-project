"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt;TwoX recently had a spate of this where some woman dared state that she was happy. They did not like that. 

Oh they totally flipped their fucking lids over it. But TwoX is going through a troublesome time at the moment. It has always been a Tumblr-esque sub here on Reddit, then it was defaulted and suddenly the whole site became aware of what a fucking joke the sub is.

Then their members flipped over it being a default, reg'd a load of alt accounts, sent themselves threats of violence/rape (the same shit feminists on Twitter have been shown to do), brigaded their own sub, posted shit/abuse on every thread, reported shit en mass etc. 

Now the admins have come out and said ""calm the fuck down please, we can see blatantly that most of the abuse TwoX is encountering currently is from its own members under alt accounts"" and the precious snowflakes involved in this shit turn around and cry ""misogyny!""

I mean it's similar to the following:

Person A: ""B, you're a fucking psychopath, you should get some help!""

Person B: ""I'm not a fucking psychopath, watch me prove it to you, you oppressor!""

Person B: *Behaves as mentally sound as GG Allin*

Not a good word to be seen
It's a kingdom of 'just a joke, guys'
And it looks like your the king
The apology is howling like the shitty jokes inside
You didn't keep it in, and you didn't try

don't want you in here, don't you see?

It's funny how le STEMlords make big deals seem small. Mom's so-called politeness can't get to them at all!! It's time for their shit to show through; to be all edge and all poo. No right, all wrong, all shit beliefs; THEY'RE FREE;

They let it go!! Let it go!!! No 'fellow man' anymore. Let it go!! Let it goo!! Turn away from that 'good human' bore. They don't care what about the words they say. Their shit rages on

Their shitposts flurry through the site into the ground. Their bad opinions in TOO LONG text posts all around. And one thought in my mind, like an icy blast. These people are fucking real, their shit ain't in the past!!!

won't let it go! Let it go! Ill do this till I die! Won't let it goo! Let it goo! Oh, and RULE X BYEEEEE!!

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I'm a Packer fan and I think most UK NFL folk wouldn't change their first team (swapping teams just isn't something you do in any sport). But there are plenty of neutrals who would follow the team; plenty of people who start following them cause a franchise is launched in their city; and a lot of fans who they would suddenly become their second team.

Watching the London games is always a slightly strange experience because you have 80,000 people there who love the sport (despite what the article says) but relatively small contingents of the teams playing, so you don't get that really strong home and away team atmosphere swinging with offence and defence.

I think a London franchise would certainly do well initially. It would be a huge event even here for a London franchise in the sport and the attention would bring fans. The London games have always sold out quickly and I don't think that would necessarily change hugely with a jump from 3 to 8.

However I think a few years down the road if the team is struggling, the initial hype has died down, etc. Attendance may drop and I don't know if it comes back up.

I personally think there are a bunch of things that could be done to grow the game in this part of the world that aren't the drastic step of launching a franchise here. ","1401580803"

&gt;In [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball), a __save__ (abbreviated __SV__ or __S__ or ""SVO"" for a save opportunity) is credited to a [pitcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher) who [finishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_leaders_in_games_finished) a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances, described below. The number of saves, or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted, is an oft-cited statistic of [relief pitchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher), particularly those in the [closer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball\)) role. It became an official [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) (MLB) statistic in [1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_in_baseball).  [Mariano Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Rivera) is MLB's all-time leader in regular season saves with 652.

That said, what she did is called an ad hominem attack so she does not have to deal with the current issues of the argument. It's irrational and makes no sense, but there it is...

Question is, do you want a lifetime of this or do you want to move on to a more mature women you can start fresh with, next time *not* violating OPSEC, because she will bring it up every time she is feeling defeated in an argument in order to alter that argument to her favor in her batshit crazy mind.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","OK, so in Path of Exile, rare items can roll up to 6 modifiers each of which will boost a given stat.
  
You have probably seen a stat on an item called ""Spell Damage"" (just for an example). You may have also noticed that sometimes you get only 10% spell damage, and other times it can roll as high as 74%. The difference between these rolls are called Tiers (abbreviated T1, T2, T3, etc). 
  
The above linked dagger has 5 T1 rolls, 2 of which are Prefixes, 3 of which are suffixes.  
  

* Tyrannical (% physical damage, range 150 to 169)
* Flaring (+ flat physical damage, ranges (15 to 25) to (38 to 45))
* Of Celebration (Attack speed, ranges 26 to 27)
* Of Incision (Crit chance, range 35 to 38)
* Of Destruction (Crit Multiplier, range 35 to 38)
  
All of the rolls are T1, which is very very very rare. Even a ""good/usuable"" item might only have a single T1 roll at endgame. This is probably one of the best daggers in the game, plus it has one open prefix slot which you can further craft. ","1401580811"

I'm a male from an almost exclusively male household (except for my very Catholic mother), so I'm only recently becoming aware of gender issues. Not sure if I'd call myself a feminist or not yet. I'm still very new to the whole thing, which is why I make such a shitty spokesperson for it.

Really, what kept me from warming up to feminism for so long was the stupid misconceptions that are out there about it. I didn't know what it really meant until I met people who can explain it far better than I can. But even when I was a little kid, my mom would tell me stuff like ""white males are the most oppressed group in America today"" and... that just always never seemed right to me. So I would have come over to the ""dark side"" a lot sooner if it weren't for those stupid strawmen about feminism. That's why I think it's important to debunk this shit.

And, you know, I think it's part of a broader process of putting yourself in other peoples shoes. Really, all you have to do is *talk to an actual woman* about her experiences and the reality of sexism reveals itself.","1401580811"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Ah sheesh, that's something I picked up in an undergrad classics course, let me see if I can find the textbook still. Might be somewhere, assuming I didn't get that as an anecdote from the professor (which usually stick with me since they're so interesting). I'll update in a few if I manage to find it. 

Edit: Found it in ""Classical Myth,"" by Barry B. Powell:

(Pg.2)- ""Another element of my is setting. The setting is the time and place in which the action of the story unfolds. Myths are never set in the present or the recent past, the action always takes place in the distant past or in a shadowy time altogether outside human chronology. The setting of myths may be in an actual city, such as Athens or Thebes, or some other location familiar to the audience. In other myths, the setting is an obscure place: the underworld, which no one in the real world every visited; Mount Olympus, which really exists but in myth is the home of the gods; or Crete of a very long time ago."" 

So the Greeks therefore viewed a separation there, that of myth and physical presence. 

There's a section, part of the answer. Just thought I'd update sooner and scan through, editing in if I find more. I'll keep digging. 

Page 5-6, same book:

""The events of divine myth usually take place in a world before or outside the present order where time and space often have different meanings from those familiar to human beings."" 

Edit #3: To clarify, I'm not saying that the world of the gods was entirely separate to the ancient Greeks, they were absolutely connected, but their dwelling itself was as physical as it was mythical. It may be the same kind of logic in that the Christian ""heaven"" is up, yet not up, per say. 

Edit #4: Concerning the taboo, Mount Olympus was also ""far away an unapproachable,"" (Page 5, same book) so it was incredibly unlikely, in fact essentially impossible, for an ancient Greek to climb the mountain. 

Edit#5: In continuing to answer whether they would have climbed Olympus, and the general impossibility of that feat, I'm consulting other works, this time searching through JSTOR, and found this in Langdon's article ""Mountains in Greek Religion,"" Vol. 93, No. 5. in the journal ""The Classical World:""  

""It is easy to understand why Greeks believed that their gods lived atop this mountain. It is the highest in mainland Greece, with a cluster of peaks reaching nearly 3,000 meters into the sky. These peaks are often obscured by clouds and seem more unapproachable than other heights. For practitioners of a sky-based religion, Olympos was seen quite naturally as  a divine residence.""



Edit #6: That's about what I have to say on the topic. And since nothing in ancient history can really be completely understood, one can either argue for two different aspects. Either that the ancient Greeks envisioned Mount Olympus physically and mythically, yet they intertwined in ways that we have trouble understanding in our modern context. Or you could say that the mountain itself, being unreachable by ancient standards, was the perfect place to have a mountain that no ancient would really question because it would always be a place of mystery, remaining essentially divine for all intents and purposes. Personally I'd like to think that it's both. 

For all those still interested in the topic, Sale's article ""Homeric Olympus and Its Formulae,"" found in Vol. 105, No. 1 of ""The American Journal of Philology"" has an absolutely exhaustive look at the mountain and its varying aspects and pantheon. It's quite confusing at times, but it's still a standard in the field I believe.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Two handed is best bet honestly. Dual wield is good for dark elves who are focused on PvE single target and group clear. 



I run nord AD DK 2 handed sword for maximum Dps. Igneous Weapons, momentum, inferno, dragon breath, and dragon strike. 


Morphs: *molten armaments*; 28% crit to you and group for first 7 seconds of activating igneous weapons

*rally*; heals you at the end of Momentums duration 

*flames of oblivion*; gives 11% crit chance (spell and melee)  against any enemy in infernos range 

*searing strike*; the morph that makes it so dragon strike does more damage the longer it lasts 

*engulfing flames*; morph that increases all flame damage by 7% against targets effected by your flame breath

I run medium armor for the 5%IAS (scales to 10 at48)  from dexterity at level 42 and crit chance passive from each piece of med armor equipt. 


Take fire enchants and get passive that increases all fire Damage by a flat %,  also get arcane fighter as it grants you 100% chance to cause burning each time you swing. 


This is a heavy magicka build that focuses on high single target and aoe clear speeds. 


I run a 2h sword with 10% IAS on top of 10% from dexterity and I swing super fast while retaining a 33% crit chance with flames on. It works well in PvP too as you replace igneous weapons and dragon breath with flame pull and critical charge.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Thanks for the kind words and feedback.

This is just my first concept art for the game so there's a lot of revisions ahead. I agree with what you said about the ground. I'm still trying to draw more plants and boulders and things to fill the space and figure out how it will fit on the game screen.

I tried to pick unusual colors for everything but still make it look recognizable as a jungle (which it doesn't yet, for lack of dense plants). Hopefully it'll have developed more by the next Screenshot Saturday.","1401580820"

""I can't let our partnership as meister and weapon be thrown down the drain over a silly matter as that.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","I'm not doing anything about it, at all. I'm only fulfilling the ""more obligatory"" mandates, i.e., *work, support yourself*, and only barely since I still live with my parents and I can't negotiate a salary for my life. Like I said, the embarrassment and shock of finding out how much fun the rest is and was having (for instance, just thinking about the possibility of all the girls I fancied having had sex depresses me; not because they are ""mine"" or anything like that, but because it sounds like missed chances, whether I had I chance with them or not. That is, ""look what you missed!"") would be unbearable. It is unbearable. 

But now, it's a private embarrassment, with a bit of willing ignorance about the whole thing (""well, maybe they didn't have so much fun every weekend..."", ""maybe they all had long dry-spells..."", ""maybe it's because their parents supported them fully economically and pay part of their rent...""). I'd rather keep it like that.","1401580820"

So I wonder how practical that could ever be to do.

Something like that could also be a sort of cosmic virus, too =)

But I think Geronimo brought up the most important part.  On a sub-light time scale, the amount of time since the universe began for probes like you describe to propagate even within just our own galaxy is much smaller than you might think.  Let alone to propagate between galaxies.","1401580823"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","My theory is that the perceived lack of humanity has a disproportionate psychological impact. 

If you want to kill someone and want to do it in the most honorable way possible, you challenge them one on one when they can defend themselves. A step down the honor ladder is to kill them when you have an advantage (technological, strategically, etc), another step step down is to kill them when you have an advantage and they are defenseless, the bottom rung would be sending someone else to kill them while they are defenseless and the assassin has an advantage. 

Drones seem unfair and dishonorable because it represents a large, powerful force killing an enemy remotely. There is little defense against a drone and even shooting it down doesn't kill a pilot. If a drone comes after you, surviving is all you can hope for. It's not a fight, it's an execution. 

To me, that's the major distinction between drone bombing and conventional bombing, and to me it's a minor one. ","1401580824"

63% are Christian and 24% are Muslim. It isn't all that surprising when you look at where Arab Americans are coming from. 

&gt; The largest subgroup is by far the Lebanese Americans, with 501,907,[1] followed by; Egyptian American with 190,078, Syrian American with 148,214, Iraqi American with 105,981, Palestinian American with 93,438

The above wiki quote shows which countries Arab Americans are coming from. The top 5 countries have decently large Christian populations and have all experienced certain amounts of conflict that would drive Christians out of their homeland. 

And as for your experiences, I suspect its most likely just a bias of your circle or possibly your area. I am also an Arab and meet way more Christians than Muslims. You might also not notice most Christian Arabs especially when a large amount of them from Syria and Lebanon have either French or Saint first names and relatively lighter skin. ","1401580824"

Look at the section *""Inside the Spacecraft"" &gt; Crew*, or just generally all over that page, and you can see how there's collaboration with NASA.

In case you weren't aware, after the shuttle retirement, the US no longer has the capability to put people into space. They (NASA, the US Gov't, etc...) are banking on SpaceX to develop this capability. Hence the Dragon development (the spacecraft that is pictured in this post).

Happy reading.

"rpg_gamers","t5_2su0w","Most serious is inability to use mods that grant the game serious replayability factor (like NPC mods and more important Sword Coast Stratagems which makes combat more tactically nuanced and less cheesy).

Also BG EE added content (especially new NPCs and some out of the place items) really falls behind the original one in terms of writing and voice acting. And the writing was never the strong part of BG 1.

As I mentioned before I believe there is no way to increase the FPS in EE, which makes the game more of a walking simulator than an RPG game. Modifying the .ini file did not work for me.

Basically you are paying more for a product that adds nothing that couldn't be gained by some easy to install mods and all it adds is content (items, annoying NPC's with bad dubbing, cringeworthy 'romances' that were absent in the original) of questionable quality.","1401580825"

- Allison come out as clone to Donnie. They reunite.
- Cosima alive, but critical, as a cliffhanger for next season.  Lots of cophine feels.
- Helena kicking major fishcult ass in fierce ""mother bear"" mode.
- Paul dies while redeeming himself.  With lumberjack in the picture we don't need him as a romantic partner for Sarah, but I still want him to be good.

I guess it really comes down to what *you* want to do. Letting yourself feel and go through the emotions is scary and could bring up more than you want it to, but it most likely healthier in the long run. 

Pushing stuff down the way that it sounds like you've down in the past might get you through the next little bit, but long term it can be unhealthy and cause issues. 

What you do is entirely up to you, and no one can tell you what choice is right for you except for you. Sometimes there is no easy answer unfortunately. I wish I could make it easier or do something other than just talk to you...

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Your father is a financial adviser. Do you feel embarrassed asking him to help you learn some of these things? He might be proud to know you are trying to take the reins. It does sound like you should work with him especially in terms of learning what your options are for receiving either student aid or student loans for graduate school. 

Before you sit down with your dad on that topic, though, you may want to do some reading to improve your grasp of basics of personal finance. There are some books written specifically for younger people just out of school. I've listed the book numbers to help you search for them.

*Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties*, by Beth Kobliner. ISBN 978-0-743-26436-5.

*Life After School. Explained*, by Cap &amp; Compass. ISBN 978-0-971-73660-3.

*The Wealthy Barber: Everyone's Commonsense Guide to Becoming Financially Independent*, by David Chilton. ISBN 978-0-761-51311-7.

*Your Money: The Missing Manual*, by J.D. Roth. ISBN 978-0-596-80940-9.

You may eventually want to do more directed learning related to investing, and when you do, people here can easily recommend the best books.

I find that reading a few commonsense introductory books helps make things feel a little less overwhelming. At the very least, they may point out some things to think about that you might have ignored. Not everything may apply to your situation, but having some exposure to the ideas will pay off down the road.

But definitely talk with your father, especially during the upcoming time when you're looking at financing further education. It may also be a time of establishing yourself on your own, which brings with it budgeting, housing, and other issues.","1401580832"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Yeah. I've stayed out of the conversations for the most part, but I've seen a few pretty heated debates on my Facebook wall about the NotAllMen meme, and that's pretty much the point that non-feminists are making. Saying ""Black people like to rob liquor stores"" would be pretty damn racist, and what these feminists are doing is no different. And from what I've seen, the NotAllMen issue is supported by pretty much every feminist that I've seen talk about it, the only people opposing it have been non-feminists.","1401580833"

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","I like El-P, but I feel like a lot of his beats sound very very similar. Run the Jewels could be 1 big song, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It's just way too repetitive. He's not a bad producer, but honestly it's like DJ Mustard and his signature beat, except at least DJ Mustard's beat is easier to listen to for a long period of time and is a lot more accessible.

As a rapper, I actually like El-P a lot. He and Mike have really really great chemistry on Run the Jewels and they both go pretty goddamn hard during the whole thing. El-P's got some hidden gems of lines on RtJ, too. He's not a bad rapper at all.

My only issue with El-P is his beats. It's not a bad beat, it's just too much. And yes, I've listened to Cancer 4 Cure and shit, I still think he's repetitive.

Obviously not ALL of his beats are like that, but a lot of them are.","1401580833"

If they could move calderon though, Bledsoe/Ellis combo would be a lot of fun, plus the kick outs to dirk.

 They will probably try to spend their cash on a 3, dependent on what marion wants to do. possibly deng? I have heard Pauly P but he's not the defender he used to be. A starting roster of calderon/ellis/pierce/nowitzki would be disastrous defensively.  They will also try to get a defensive big.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Prison is no reformation tool.  The system is a revolving door.  Once you're in, especially if you have a felony, your life is going to be a lot worse off.  Nobody is going to want to hire you.  So good luck getting a job.  No job?  No money.  But like snoop says you gotta have paper in this world.  So what do the criminals do?  More crime to make money.  I bet the good majority of them after coming out of hell (i.e. prison) would love to straighten up and get a job and work hard to earn their way.  But most people don't give them a chance.  So they hussle.  I really hate the way it's setup.  Once upon a time there was enough funding to have a lot of mental hospitals around, which is where a good majority of the prisoners belong.  The majority of prisoners suffer from some sort of mental illness.  And now that there isn't a bed for them at Bellevue they find themselves in a bed in the state pen.  But the ironic (and sad thing) is that it comes full circle.  These people live amongst us.  They're that miserable SOB that cut you off on your way home.  They're the sour puss at Walmart screaming at their kids.  They're the guy who goes on a violent rampage and kills your significant other, sibling, mom or dad or whatever.  Society is turning into a real toilet because it's getting harder and harder to make your way.  The 1%ers better start setting up gated communities because as things get worse over time they'll want to segregate themselves from the dangers of society.  It's a very complicated problem.  And it's so transparent that I don't think a lot of people realize this is happening.  But a lot do.  Without looking, just think to yourself how many school shootings you can remember before Columbine.  I can't remember any.  And now it's unreal how many times people are getting shot at school, work or the gym (yes the gym in Pittsburgh a few years back which is where I'm near).  ","1401580836"

The point is that the lore is really weak, and the story is really weak, but the game tries to make up for it by simply having many references to the first game.

&gt; Debate's over folks.

&gt; The FT asked good questions. Their mistake was to presume there were no good answers. Piketty showed there were. There's no smoke, no gun.

&gt; Fave bit: Piketty says FT's #s ""would mean that Britain is currently one  the most egalitarian countries in history..more equal than Sweden""

&gt; Importantly the FT no longer insists that wealth inequality data disagree w/ Piketty's narrative. We're down to quibbles about documentation

The cost of a degree here is still much less than the cost of one in the US (even though it has gone up astronomically in the past few years). For example, tuition for a Master's in International Relations costs around 4000 euros if you complete everything in one year. 

As to whether it's respected outside of Spain--I would imagine so in Latin America--otherwise I don't really know… Anyone in Spain would certainly understand the difficulty involved for a foreigner to earn a degree at one of its universities. It certainly opens doors here. ","1401580838"

Usually, but not always, a couple of them are from the beginning of the game, and then a couple more from throughout the game. It's sadly going to annoy you, because these ""retirees"" (for lack of a better term) are in all of the games.

However, Awakening has an awful lot of characters who only retire on classic mode death, instead of actually dying. The opening four characters don't die, all of the 1st-gen mothers don't die (because of time paradoxes or something like that otherwise), and a couple of others. No other game really rivals these numbers, but FE7 (Titled ""Fire Emblem"" in English), is most likely the next, due to it being a prequel and thus not being able to kill some characters due to time-paradox creation.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt; Yep. And you saying that there's loads of data suggesting bans do work to reduce crime with whatever the banned item is is equally you just saying that.

&gt;The final report concluded the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with banned guns was “mixed.” Gun crimes involving assault weapons declined. However, that decline was “offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with [large-capacity magazines].”

http://www.factcheck.org/2013/02/did-the-1994-assault-weapons-ban-work/

this is specifically related to assault weapons bans, and shows that the ban was effective at reducing crime committed with assault weapons.  But was largely replaced with gun crime with other firearms.  As a measure of cutting down on crime, it's debatable whether or not the ban was successful, as for cutting down on a specific type of crime, ie. assault weapon crimes, the ban was extremely successful.  It would appear that even though they were going to commit murder anyway, those criminals really did respect the ban and used something different.

I'm not saying this thing couldn't be used for self defense, but it could only be useful in certain situations where there was a long drawn out escalation, ie. you had time to fish through your purse, find this thing, slot your fingers in it and then fight the person in hand to hand combat.  It's not the same as having a spring loaded knife on your belt, or a holstered open carry gun.  Furthermore, there is no latent ability for this thing to deter crime, since it would be hidden in your purse or pocket until you pull it out, and at that point the crime is presumably already underway.","1401580839"

Apparently, from what I haver read, those who reside on or very near the beaches will still have access even on launch days.

But as years passed he started selling more hardcore drugs like pills,meth, all that junk that ruins your life I probably haven't seen him for about 4 years after high school I have a full time job, house, car and I got invited to a old high school party from a friend so I accepted and went I still had work in the morning but I wasn't going to stay long when I got there what do you know I saw the drug dealer (I'm just going to call him drug dealer). He greeted me asked how I been I told him and I asked him the same thing he told me he has no job but he has a house and 2 cars! He had a Cadillac and bought a Toyota celica at the dealership I asked how he afforded all this? He pulled me to the other room opened his back pack and what I saw was the most money I have ever seen just stacks of rolled rubber band stacked money 10 grand worth!

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","But it exists on the same number line. We can even take it a step further. Between 2 and 3 there are an infinite amount of numbers. If you start at 2.1 or even 2.9, there's still an infinite amount. You don't need to include every possibility to have infinity.

We're also talking about whole universes here (which can be represented by whole numbers). Unlike a number line, there aren't infinite components of universes within a single universe (represented by decimals). I suppose you could say whole numbers (universes) represents one set of infinity, while decimals (a single universe) represents another set of infinity. But we're assuming that each single universe is infinite, which we don't know. Also, if we remove one of these infinite universes from the infinite line of universes, there's still an infinite amount of universes. Again, it's not necessary for a ""world"" of infinite universes to contain every possibility. 

Also, this requires a philosophical discussion about identity. What does it mean to be 'you'? A philosophy professor from Yale did a four part lecture about identity if you're interested. The first part can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KDsArsQ3A&amp;list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&amp;index=11). If there's another universe with another 'you', is it really you? I personally don't think so. Although you may be arranged in the same way, and you have the same personality, etc - you're not made with the same exact material and the other you lacks your phenomenological experiences. Only one you exists - all others are replicas. If you subscribe to that belief then there are already an infinite number of hypothetical universes of which you're involved that do not exist.

She isn't acting out for no reason, there's always something, whether we or they see it or known it or not. The problem is, it could be anything. 

I would guess, since she is so hell bent on permissions, that you carry on and have a life outside your house - and perhaps she doesn't? She's feeling left out for some reason and sucks at communication. Even if it's something else, like she has something else on we mind, it's still expressing this way because of shit communication.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I tend to agree more with the people who say that all these extraneous conditions are but simply a part of the fantasy experience and should be things to consider just like in any other type of fantasy sports. Game duration should be something that you, as the knowledgeable fan, should think about when you make a trade, pick of a free agent, or draft a player. 

For example, in football, it's important to note how a team distributes the amount of runs each of its running backs receives throughout the game. A team might give a 50/50 split to its RBs, causing a limitation of play time that one of its RBs may have in a game compared to another team that splits the runs of 60/40 or 70/30. Yet yards per carry isn't included in the scoring of any leagues.

So, in LoL, it's important to know the tendencies of teams as a whole. Does a team tend to have drawn out games that extend their fantasy scores? Then you should consider drafting players from that team even if the players aren't top tier. Does a team have a phenomenal mid-laner, but doesn't get the time to shine and rack up those fantasy points? Then maybe you should consider leaving that player to another team.


I think the best way to go is to add more things to score by. Points for vision-related stats. Tweak the KDA point values to something that rewards Kills and Assists more and penalizes deaths more. Hell, I think that incorporating Red and Blue buff kills should be incorporated into scoring somehow.","1401580842"

"swtor","t5_2qxih","Ok…Welp if you want an honest opinion…

Game boosters are complete shit, they do everything you can control in systems control on windows OS and still require (although often very limited memory usage) memory during gaming operations. 

The operations of a program like RAPTR/Razor are really doing are just a very simple version of memory management. 

This can very easily be fixed by CNTRL-ALT-Deleting and essentially deallocating (closing) programs such as your anti virus, firefox and other high memory programs that the operating system is allocating memory in the stack or queue (forgetting which Windows uses) and are running background operations.

All things like priority (i.e. setting it to high) tells the operating system that this is the 2nd most important thing running except for the operating system, in all actuality it provides little to none in the performance boost section. Overall it should just effect running stability

What you really should be examining is the specs of your computer. 
32 bit OS is limited to 4gb of memory, especially older laptops and desktops (2007-2009) are still running 32 bit. This severely limits the performance and execution of background programs due to windows requiring a portion of that 4gb. This leaves about 3.5 (or less) GB to run SWTOR and your background applications. 

SWTOR is extremely cpu intensive, and requires a half decent processor to get stable and decent FPS. This is partially due to the HERO engine and the fact that the attacks you see on screen all rely heavily on the CPU to track calculations and manage data(health/etc).

**TL;DR
Stop using the after market products, turn down your graphics.
If their on very low, it's time to look for an upgrade**

But copying tables into excel is easy if you use Internet Explorer (crappy, I know; but it works better than firefox and chrome for this specific issue -- there may be plugins that facilitate this on FF or Ch but I haven't looked for one).

* You won't find conversion rates for USD-Euro for 1975. Try british pounds (pound sterling).

"intj","t5_2qowo","You couldn't be further from the truth in all aspects. I will speak as a resident of Arizona about the specifics of our gun laws here....or lack of them.  
Gun regulation does absolutely nothing because 99% people who choose to do crimes with their guns are people who have obtained them illegally and will not register them. It is stupid to purposefully commit a crime with something that is linked specifically to you. Think about it logically, if you were to shoot someone would you do it with a firearm that was registered with the government under your name or would you illegally purchase one that had no records then get rid of the firearm after the crime was committed?  
The government doesn't tell people what guns to use for home protection. There is absolutely no regulation on what an individual may use, be it a .22lr pistol or a .50BMG rifle. Common sense is what dictates this, most people use a shotgun or small caliber pistol such as a 9mm for home defense because if you shoot something like a rifle and the bullet travels through a wall and hits someone else you are now guilty of murder at worst and manslaughter at best.  
As I have stated on here multiple times, the process to get a fully automatic rifle takes at least 6 months, involves federal gov't (BATFE) and local law enforcement approval and costs a substantial amount of money. Steps only a responsible, law abiding citizen would go through and pass. People who own these kinds of rifles are typically the most responsible gun owners in the nation, many of them are federally licensed and own gun shops. As a gun owner and avid Second Amendment supporter, I agree that a select fire AR15 is too much power for home defense. I would like to think that a vast majority of gun owners would agree with that. That being said, the Second Amendment isn't for self defense or hunting...it exists to protect citizens from an over-reaching tyrannical government.   
In Arizona, there is virtually no regulation of firearms. To purchase at a store takes about 20 minutes, faster if you are a Concealed Carry permit holder. You do the paperwork, the run a NICS background check with the FBI, if you pass you pay for your firearm and leave the store with it. Private trades/buying/selling is completely unregulated. As long as you meet the federal requirements and can legally own a gun you have free reign to buy and sell whatever you want as though it were nothing more than a television. We the people of this great state regulate everything. The vast majority are law-abiding citizens, many are police officers and military. We follow every single law in place, and many go above and beyond to do background checks on people even though it isn't mandatory. If we see any suspicious behavior, it immediately gets called out and reported to the police. We as gun owners respect firearms and our right to own them. It is not something we take lightly, and we don't need the government to tell us how to regulate them. We do it on our own. We also have an extremely low crime rate throughout the majority of the state. The only exception is in downtown Phoenix because of the gangs, but that is how every major city is. Taking guns from law-abiding citizens isn't going to change the gang problem there and will only serve to create more victims of gang related violence. That being said, Phoenix is the 6th largest city in the nation yet has one of the lowest violent crime rates out of all the major cities. Most every major city in America alone has a higher gun violence rate than the entire state of Arizona even when combined with a number of other Pro-gun states.  
   
&gt;I've never fired a gun myself, and even so, I dont understand the obsession with them. But a bolt action, a shotgun, and a pistol are all you'd ever need for even the most unlikely of circumstances by my understanding.  
   
Lets use hurricane Katrina as an example. Society completely broke down, there was looting, robbery, violence and mass hysteria everywhere. Lets say you and your family live in ground zero of the anarchy. Your home is virtually destroyed, you are holed up in the corner of what is remaining, your children are hungry as you only have minimal supplies and the world is crashing down on top of you. Next thing you know a mob of 10-15 people start walking around the rubble of your home. You know they are violent because you just saw them violently attack, rape then murder your neighbor.  
You are anti-gun so you never thought to buy one....how do you plan to defend your children who will most likely be attacked and possibly murdered in cold blood by violent criminals?   
Or  
You are OK with guns to a point, so you have a little .38spl revolver. It has decent firepower for close range self defense situations, but only holds 5 rounds. In your adrenaline stricken panic, you fire off all five rounds but miss every attacker, only 4 run away...now you still have a large number of them who know you have no other means of self defense because they can see you trying to reload. They come into your home, brutally attack you and take all of your supplies/belongings...maybe they kill you and your kids, maybe they don't  
Or  
You are a firearm advocate and understand the risks that exist in every day life and that emergencies can happen so you purchased an AR15 and trained with it regularly. You have a few 30 round magazines handy so you know you have more than enough ammo to ride out the storm until the national guard shows up. The attackers come towards you but see your rifle, it is substantially more intimidating than a little pistol so a few run away....the remaining try their luck and advance towards you so you shoot a few rounds. Two of them hit the chest of one of the attackers because you knew how to handle your firearm properly. His buddies all scatter because they have seen that you are capable of defending yourself and it isn't worth their lives to attack you.  
Your family lives to see another day because you were prepared for anything.  
  
Emergencies happen, life is chaotic. Gun owners don't want violence, the last thing any of us want to do is to have to shoot someone and possibly take another life.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy, so no. The idea of bodily autonomy and being held liable for child support are massively different. You have to think of this in terms of equity not equality. No one can be stripped of bodily autonomy. If I came to you and said ""give me your kidney, we're a match"" you would have the option to consent to being an organ donor, or to reject that idea altogether. No one is going to strap you down and rip your kidney out because I said so, because bodily autonomy trumps that. I don't have the right to continue my life by using your body.  Even dead people still have bodily autonomy to that extent if they choose not to donate their organs. 

In regards to men giving consent to the risk of an accidental pregnancy, I think that's fair only because ejaculation is a voluntary act, ovulating is involuntary. A woman has no control over whether or not she is ovulating, but a man does have control over ejaculation. Obviously situations can be argued on an individual basis, but at brass tacks it makes sense that a man would be held liable.

A lot of the casters talk about Dig in the previous two splits was focussed on their play style and deficiencies, but recently the casters (and others, including Monte) have given respect to Imaqtpie and Crumbz for being very good players. By bringing in Zion and Shiptur Dig hugely strengthened their line-up, and while strategy has always been Digs weak point they have been improving over time. Either way, I definitely am expecting big things from them, their wins seem more sustainable than those of last split (which largely came from over-investing in Imaqtpie as their sole carry).","1401580853"

"IsleofMan","t5_2qyvt","I'm not all that familiar with Douglas during TT season however Ramsey has some good stuff to offer if you decide to go there. If you're using buses then the number 3 bus can get you there and takes around 50 minutes each way. I believe the last one is at about midnight but during the day there is usually one every half hour. 

BarLogo in Ramsey generally has a nice biker vibe to it at this time of year with live rock bands playing on Fridays/ Saturdays, you can find it in parliament street. However it has a relatively small amount of space inside and can fill up quite quickly.

You can generally find the pubs and bars quite easily in Ramsey simply by walking from one end of parliament street to the other, I'd suggest that you go where you like the look of.

The outback, Tahiko and the courthouse in Douglas are clubs if you're looking to dance and they generally have a good amount of bikers/ tourists/ locals in them during the TT, however you may have trouble having a chat from the music volume.

I'm not entirely sure of nightlife in Peel, however if you're there for the day you can always visit Peel castle or the House of Mannanan, these give a good insight into Manx history and folklore if you're interested in that. 

That's all I can think of right now, hope it helps! Have a good TT and don't be afraid to ask questions if you have any.","1401580854"

It really was a love it or hate it expansion, and while I'm in the latter category I definitely see why some people loved it, suddenly they got to do a whole lot of stuff that wasn't possible for them before. It kind of hit us people who were already doing that stuff though, aside from Ulduar hardmodes the only challenge I ever found was HC Putricide, HC Sindragosa and HC LK, so in general I only really enjoyed Ulduar, while EoE at least had one great battle too.

The theme also seemed to go well with the general audience, especially since The Lich King is such a recognizable figure. I was personally very dissapointed in the lore, but once again I can see why it was just cool for some people to simply battle this high profile character that they had waited so many years to face.

Because of this I wouldn't call Wrath the peak of WoW, because it was very divided, and a lot of controversy and complaints were present in the community in its days because of this, and the community is obviously a big part of the game. But of course that's just my take on it.","1401580858"

Put yourself in his shoes for a second. You're a 24 year old from the slums of India and you're approached and offered a job that pays more than you would likely ever see in your lifetime otherwise. Its easy for us to say we wouldn't poach a rhino but for this boy the payday he'd get would change his life forever. For that reason it doesn't matter how many poachers are killed because for every poacher like him killed there are thousands to millions of other people who will take his place.

The poachers are not the problem, its the buyers. In my opinion the trade of rhino horns should be legalized. A rhino horn is like a fingernail, it constantly grows throughout their lifetime and can easily be harvested. A legalized trade would eliminate all the problems with poachers because the price of a horn would plummet as the stockpiles of legally dehorned rhino horns hit the market. Thus there would be no need to kill a rhino for its horn and the entire problem would be solved.

Even if it's a short sample, if it's looped and everything is clearly built around it the creator can still be forced to pay citation fees. However, even if the sample is long and obvious, if it highly altered it can skip over most claims. A good example of this is SebastiAn's Kindercut. Most of the sounds in that song come from Sneaky Sound System's UFO, but, to my understanding, he did not have to pay anything to them because they denied him the right to call it a remix.

You can be convinced of something, but you can no more control your beliefs than you can control what food you like. Sure it CAN change, but it's because you are convinced, not because you made a choice to change your beliefs. Don't believe me? Choose to stop believing in God. You can't, because no matter how hard you try, believing in God is just something you personally do at this stage of your life.

&gt;  in fact, they are compliments, working together to produce a good world.

My point is that with each individual you must make a choice between being merciful or just. Sure God can choose to be merciful with one person and choose to be just with another, but the moment you start granting someone mercy, you are forgoing the justice that they ""deserve."" I am okay with this concept, but mercy should be equally granted for the same acts and not based upon a belief you don't choose.","1401580860"
"MillerPlanetside","t5_2wi6w","It has absolutely nothing to do with MBTs, but with the whopping 7 minutes timer that locks the central lane. 

Miller vs Mattherson, equal numbers, Mattherson attacks Freyr, Miller attacks Eisa, in the end Mattherson has both. What went wrong? Oh for sure not those 7 minutes that let you take another base then redeploy back to clean up. Rinse and repeat, once base at a time. It's really not complicated once you give up that strange idea to push all 3 lanes at once with evenly split forces.","1401580860"

"COPYRIGHT","t5_2qp5r","Yeah, I know. Wasn't that the pretty woman case? 

At any rate, copyright law is an option per the US Constitution; it's obviously therefore not an inalienable right, as it can be revoked on the whim of Congress, or rather their constituents. 

I like to look at it as if the public's rights and freedoms were something tangible, like a bed for example, off the top of my head. Copyright law would be the blanket that covers the bed that was added after the fact. Fair use would be that space down at the end of the bed where the blanket doesn't quite reach, and so your toes poke out. It doesn't cover it, and the basic principles remain even with the existence of the blanket/law. Fair use is the right to use content regardless of copyright law, and fair use will exist even if copyright was repealed tomorrow. The reverse however is not true. 

I understand what you're saying all the same, however. Such is the problem with a precedential legal system. One bad decision, followed by another and another all based off of the first, can skew things into something unrecognizable. ","1401580863"

The solution is to delete ALL spawn points when it happens, usually at the BEGINNING of the creation. Under the menu ""Placement"" choose the ""Delete Options"" submenu and then ""Delete all spawn points"". I cant remember the exact wording but something like that.

This deletes the broken ones (aswell as your own already placed). It is sadly the only way to delete the broken ones since you cant physically see them. You should then be able to place new ones after that without this bug happening again in THIS creation.

&gt; How do you switch modes by the way? Is there a dedicated button or do you set one of the button or hat presses to do it in CH CM?

like this:

That's the default though. CH being CH you can map mode switch to any button you want, on any CH device. So if you have the throttle you can use a button on the throttle instead.

Whats important is how we learn from those experiences and how we utilize them to do better in the future.

I think leaving him would be a grave mistake, people share different views of life but in the end we want to be accepted by the people we love.

Forgive me for not knowing that the Sheffield FC are known as the blades. But once again, in Ukraine there is no Sheffield FC, therefore no ""blades"". The thing about blades in these chants is about putting a moskal on a blade or sometimes hang the moskals on a rope. Maybe you also know of a football team know as ""the ropes""? That would explain all the videos about hanging Russians.

And as I told you before, there are a lot of nationalistic chants followed by the moskal chants. This has nothing to do with sports, and these are not your usual football ultras. These are regular teenagers in Western Ukraine on a normal day signing hang the moskals. 

Instead of writing 2 paragraphs on my mistake about a 3rd tier English league team, try to focus on the subject.

&gt; Much like you, regardless of being a teenager, they lack the intellectual capacity to act like an adult. The distinction is irrelevant.

Howells, only you are able to accept a big xenophobic demonstration by justifying it with a lack of intellectual capacity of the teenagers. These are big boys and girls, they know it's wrong. And it's relevant, because above you are saying they don't know what they are saying because they are children. It's a really lame excuse.

&gt; No one taught this to the kids, they learnt it. 

Like the egg and chicken? Or the chicken and egg?

&gt; If you are offended by this chat, go to a Celtic v Rangers match, or hell since you claim to be in Ukraine CSKA v Spartak in Russia and see how lovely the chants are.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I spent the last week playing **Demon's Souls**, and I finally beat it yesterday and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. To put this into context, Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all times and I was fairly hyped for Dark Souls II. However when playing Dark Souls II I felt conflicted during the entire play through. It played better, but the entire experience felt hollow (no pun intended). I found Dark Souls II to be a game where you fought a lot of bosses and that's pretty much it, the areas themselves were small, linear, and not particularly difficult. Honestly I can only remember 1 area in the whole game that I had to retry multiple times because I couldn't beat the area and not because I had to run back to the boss, and that was Shrine of Amana which I was then disappointed by when I realized I had missed the 2nd bonfire.

Throughout my whole playthrough of Dark Souls II I could not tell if the game design was just a lot worse or if the Souls series relied on you being a beginner. I felt like I breezed through Dark Souls II even though it did take me over 35 hours to beat, but that is compared to over 60 hours for Dark Souls, which felt much shorted, but much more fulfilling. 

Then I played Demon's Souls. It kicked my ass. It was wonderful. I felt like the same magic I felt the first time playing Dark Souls that I *completely* missed in Dark Souls II. Yes, the combat system felt clunky compared to the newer games, but I realized that the combat, while good, it just a method of presenting the world. And the world of Demon's Souls is brutal. No bonfires inside a level before the boss, instead there are shortcuts (in some levels). The level design is superb, the levels are also small, but getting through them is laborious and you really have to be on your guard because 1 mistake costs a few minutes of progress. 

Then there's the bosses, which have me feeling conflicted. They are brilliantly designed. Where Dark Souls II feels like it had twice as many bosses, and all of them were so *boring*. The ones that weren't boring (like the Demon of Song or the Covetous Demons) were so easy they became boring. There were probably a handful of Dark Souls II bosses that were both interesting and challenging. In Demon's Souls, every single boss is interestingly designed, some times it failed to be anything, but you can tell they honestly tried to make each and every boss stand out. Even the one generic knight boss in the game is made more interesting by having an NPC you rescued be there for the fight, shouting things that make the story more fleshed out. However, Demon's Souls bosses are *really* easy. Out of the 18 bosses, I beat 9 on my first try and another 4 on my second try. At least with the bosses, many of them had large open areas that made you see what made the bosses cool before you went in and killed them with just a couple uninterrupted combo chains.

In the end, I am really glad I played Demon's Souls, it was a blast to play and get destroyed. And although it only took me 19 hours to beat Demon's Souls, that 19 hours was more fulfilling than the 35 hours I played of Dark Souls II. And while I still think that Dark Souls 1 is the best in the series by a fair amount, I appreciate Demon's Souls as a precursor to what made that game great, sharing all the same things that made Dark Souls good. The few things it does do worse make sense since it was the first game to try and do this style of game play.","1401580874"

Well its a bit of an edge case, but I suppose you got me there. I would have to narrow my statement down to whoever kills the most net people(if you stop a war which kills thousands, you have saved thousands of lives, even if you kill a few innocents to get there) on purpose, is generally more evil than whoever kills less net people.

&gt;Wars are State vs State conflicts. No one wants war, it's just that some people see it as the only way that they can remain 'safe'. It's unfortunate, but let's not deliberately force people to suffer because the leaders of Washington sent them into war.

If they werent drafted into the military, they fought of their own accord. They have every bit of responsibility. The nuremberg defence(just following orders) doesnt count if you had the choice to pull out.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Honestly, I'm ashamed of most people in this thread. Redditors, the Dota community and the Twitch users are what makes up the Dota 2 subreddit, that is a combination of circle-jerking, toxicity, anti-circle-jerking and immaturity, with no equal in terms in any of these. This subreddit has seen some shit, and not necessarily all of it has been bad, but most of it hasn't been positive either. The silent majority of the Dota 2 community is to prefer over a lot of these loud-headed trouble-making, do-nothing, ungrateful and utterly toxic people. I've been mostly silent on this subreddit for the most part, because I've felt like this (anti-)circle-jerking has been to much. While some of you are genuinely awesome, some of you are also a bunch of fucking bastards. But even if the bastards are in the minute minority, they are still the people we remember, not all of the positive and awesome people.

I think this thread is a great example of why it's hard to be ""indie"" (loose term); no one gives a shit if you can't do your publicly available free alpha smoothly. It's supposed to be unfinished, that's why it's labelled alpha. It wouldn't be labelled alpha if it was finished, that it would be called release version, but it isn't. It's work in progress, and the poor team doesn't have the server capacity of Valve, which we'll have to cope with. We didn't cry when we didn't get closed alpha for Dota 2 either, we played through Garena's client or just through WC3, but we lived. 

What I'm really just trying to say is, that if I were to ask just one thing of this subreddit, it would be this: ""get out of you can't say something constructive.""

TomaTozzz, I'm sorry for dumping this at your post, but this is where it fit the best. Cheers mate, for a better Dota subreddit.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt; The best way to spend your 15$ is to spend it on something you know is good and has guarantees since you aren't making money off of it.

Not entirely true.  And if everybody thought this way, it would shrink the amount of resources indie game developers have to make games, which would hurt the quality of the games in general.  

&gt; You have no idea how well that 15$ will be used unless you are really close to the project which most people are not.

""No idea"" is definitely an exaggeration.  There's plenty to go on when judging how competent a developer is.  

&gt; What makes you think idiots throwing money at a game are any better game developers than the average investor?

I didn't say they were better game developers.  I said they were better validation than the opinion of a single investor.  Because, collectively, those ""idiots"" are the market and the market validates products.  Econ 101.  

&gt; And you know what, what makes you think the developer is always right? Sometimes developers are actually wrong you know.

So you, as a consumer, should make that judgment call when deciding which games to spend money on... whether or not they're early access or even games.  It's on the consumer to make a judgment call whenever they spend their money on anything.  [edit: sometimes people selling products can be intentionally misleading or trying to scam consumers and that's a valid criticism but a separate issue from early access]

&gt; But no you live in the magical world where the developer would be fine without all those evil greedy investors (and don't pretend you haven't been implying this).

I didn't characterize investors as greedy -- I characterized them as not being game designers.  I don't think it's too unreasonable to say *developers* typically know best when it comes to game *development*.  

&gt; If you have to beg people for money to make your game happen, maybe it just wasn't that good in the first place.

So if you don't happen to already have the cash to fund an entire game budget laying around, your game idea isn't good?  I'm sure even you can figure out what's wrong with that logic.  

&gt; I'm sorry but as a consumer I do not want to pay to beta test people's products or fund their game for no return. 

By giving the developers more resources, you'll typically get a better game in return.  That's yet another point in the main post that you don't seem to comprehend.  

But even if that weren't the case -- even if you were really getting nothing in return -- if you don't want to pay to beta test people's products then **DON'T**!  Wait for them to get out of early access and buy it, if you want to, when it's ""finished.""  

&gt; Yes I know I don't have to but unlike you I'm not blind to the fact that industry trends affect all consumers in it not just those taking part in them.

Oh, you get that.  So what the hell is the problem then?  What damage is this ""trend"" causing?  Developers get more resources to make their games, which means better games by the time they leave early access and people like you are comfortable enough to buy them.  You're benefiting from early access even if you don't buy into early access.  So what the hell are you crying about?  ","1401580878"

"wow","t5_2qio8","It's not that daggers are super bad, but a few of your abilities (namely sinister strike and main gauche) scale off of your main hand's damage, and slow weapons will always have higher damage than a dagger at the same ilvl. If the only slow weapon you have is significantly lower than your dagger, it's probably best that you hold off on switching until you get a better one.

As for the low DPS, I really wouldn't be able to help you unless I saw some logs. Were you keeping slice and dice up as much as possible? Using revealing strike right before the debuff falls off your enemy? Poisons on? Are shadow blades and adrenaline rush macro-ed together?

A few minor things can make a pretty significant difference, too. Like delaying using AR+SB for a bit if you can get off a killing spree before it, effectively giving you a whole extra cast of that ability. If possible, I'd love to look at a combat log of you on dummies or in a flex/lfr or something.","1401580881"

Here are a couple suggestions in case anyone reading this wants them.
Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay and The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult are fairly recent books, both really good.  I like them because they have a ""different"" take on the events and both have a modern twist as well, showing how the events still affect people today.

As for good or bad outfits, I think we should make sure we always have a core of ""elite"" outfits, e.g. INI and MCY building our backbone with half the numbers and more than 1 squad where possible. The rest of the forces can be filled up with any other outfit the way we already do it. That way we don't run into a situation where most of our forces are mid-tier while the enemy only brings high-tier outfits, we always have the strong core to rely on.

However, as to how to decide who is ""high tier"" and who is below that... well, I don't want to be the one deciding that ^(FRMD is MLG tier)

"spikes","t5_2utkz","My personal criticisms of your bant list:

4x Scavenging Ooze is too high, especially maindecked. The card is awful in multiples and isn't a great turn-2 play anyway.

Fleecemane Lion isn't a great card for your deck. You don't have any auras and you aren't aggressive enough (you're playing 6 high-mana planeswalkers).

Kiora isn't a great card, especially in the current meta game. Its starting loyalty is just too low, especially in a meta game where Burn is one of the best, most-played decks. The Exploration ability isn't that great, and her +1 ability is only good against Midrange decks and gives you no advantage to your board state if it doesn't pay off. Jace, Architect of Thought just does the exact same things as Kiora but better, so you're better off playing him instead.

I would play at least one maindeck Sphinx's Revelation. The card is a blowout against control decks, and can win you random games against any deck in the format with a timely draw. It's just one of the single best cards in all of Standard.

I would tailor more of my game towards Archangel of Thune, and, in turn, play two more of her and adjust your low-end cards on your curve towards being more controlling. Getting Detention Sphere and Banishing Light are the main reason to play this version of GWx Midrange, so use and abuse them as much as possible.

A friend of mine is playing this deck right now and is loving it. He plays [Horizon Chimera](http://magiccards.info/ths/en/194.html) and says it's been a total beast for him, so you might want to try it out.

I think Bant Midrange can be totally viable with the right build, so best of luck with your playtesting and if you choose it I hope it does well for you!","1401580889"

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/512HUjD.png) my mint.com net worth (black line) assets (green bar) debt (red bar) over time and there's quite a few strange jumps in there. It forgot our old mortgages after we refinanced in June of last year and I'm not sure where it's getting its numbers at the beginning from (though to it's credit it's fairly accurate for the current time). 

I imagine it's possible to manually do entries and stuff try and correct everything by hand, but then I'd be just back to a spreadsheet again. Tracking my stuff is perhaps unusually complex, though, so you may be much better off if you are pretty simple. I have 2 mortgages, 2 houses, 6 cash accounts, 9 credit cards (I'm a churner), and 5 investment accounts for example, and things are regularly changing.","1401580889"

this is a bill in congress. the fact that congress is debating chemtrails does not make them possible.

&gt;http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf

weather modification is real, but its also not chem trails. This is also little known, but fairly mainstream. The Russians use this to keep excessive snow away from moscow, and the chineese used this to keep rain away from the olympics.

MKULTRA and COINTELPRO were not merely *mentioned* by the government, the gory details came out in a document leak after some activists broke into  an FBI office, and congress ordered a full invesitigation. Later, most of the documents were made available by the FOIA act, and we have the full gory details on COINTELPRO as it happened in the cold war.

https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/investigations/pdf/ChurchCommittee_fullcitations.pdf

Now, some of the claims might be bullshit, but its been well established and apologized that

1. COINTELPRO was a counter intellegence program by the FBI that illegally spied on activist leaders, and in some cases disrupted their activities.

2. MKULTRA - the government ran medical and biological warfare tests on unwitting and unwilling. US and Canadian citizens to include the use of LSD. Treachery, deciete, and child rape was used to blackmail politicians into supporting it. Most of the documentation was destroyed by the CIA, so what we do know is fairly damming.

Basically those limited time effects are the Battle point booster and custom tp/blink/fountain healing effects which you only get from high level compendiums, it's no biggie, they look nice but that's it.

Battle point booster basically boosts you battlepoints which you earn at the end of a match depending on the length of the match, every time you fill up your battlepoint bar (level up), you get an item.

And as for permanent stuff, you can get a squawkins courier at level 4, (can be achieved without buying compendium points), a TI4 HUD which you get at level 1 and a mini pudge courier which is yet to be delivered.

You will also get a box containing a random immortal: http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/26xcly/all_immortals_closeup_animation/ 

And if you want even more of the immortals you can either buy points to level up your compendium and earn more boxes or simply buy the immortals off the market which is was cheaper (like a dollar per immortal)

We used to, but it's really nonstandard and we dumped it. Our Mac users numbers have been increasing exponentially so we're not getting rid of Macs by any means (reaching over 60% of our workstations soon), but OD is stupid.

You could probably write a tool that does this with perl and makes LDAP calls.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Kamikaze attacks did not begin until October 1944, well after Japan had lost any ability to effectively combat the American navy and air forces on an even playing field.  Having fallen far behind in production capability Japanese leadership realized they had no hopes of winning the war. They were basically a last ditch effort to stop the American advance and be able to broker a peace in favorable terms to Japan.  It also allowed for the use of far less experienced pilots with Japan having run low on experienced combat pilots.  So they came as a surprise as they hadn't been used in the first years of the war, although things like bonsai charges that were more or less suicide charges were common so it wasn't an unprecedented tactic, it just used a new tool.

&gt;__Search engine optimization__ (__SEO__) is the process of affecting the visibility of a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) or a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) in a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine)'s ""natural"" or un-paid (""[organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_search)"") [search results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page). In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including [image search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_search), [local search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(Internet\)), [video search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_search), [academic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_databases_and_search_engines),  news search and industry-specific [vertical search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_search) engines.

If she fears him at all, she should not be around him, and she should make excuses to avoid contact with him if her friends want her to come along and he is included. If the group goes out and he's included, refuse to go. Once she drops off his radar and he can't get contact with her, he'll move on to someone else. She doesn't have to tell her friends why she's refusing to go out with them if he's included, but she needs to protect herself even if that means lying.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt; because it often involves discussing men and women as collectives within a two gender system, it can be difficult to avoid the kind of sweeping generalizations you mention. And I have not had many productive conversations with people who get their hackles up when we get to the role of power and authority in this equation. That's the perspective from the ""other side"" of such exchanges, for what it's worth.

Of course I understand the other side, but when it seems you continue to have problems discussing such issues with people who get their ""hackles up"", perhaps the problem is with the way you're framing the issues and not in the way people are reacting to that framing. At least that has been my experience discussing such things.

&gt;The inverse of Paglia would not be what some feminists have said about men, but what some anti-feminists have said about men.

That seems suspect, given how Paglia is considered an anti-feminist by most feminist writers (you even state we wouldn't be having much of a ""debate""). And besides, I wasn't offering what other famous feminists have said about men as the ""inverse."" I was merely pointing out that the quote itself is fairly tame towards women compared to some negative quotes about men from more famous feminists.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Please be careful whenever you get a letter like the one in the original post because it could be a scam which is common in the United States.  When you obtain a mortgage, that mortgage is filed at the recorder of deeds office and becomes public records.  Anyone with an internet connection can see that you received a new mortgage and from whom you received it.  Scams have been run where they notify recent mortgagees of a transfer to a bogus company only to make away with the payment.  

There have been a few questions about why loans are transferred.  The reason for this practice is because most mortgage companies do not have sufficient cash flow to operate their business and service loans.  The value &amp; income from a new loan for the originator is derived from two sources: Yield Spread Premium (YSP) and a Servicing Release Premium (SRP).  

When is new loan is funded by an originator that loan is packaged and sold to an entity like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, USDA, or FHA.  These entities pay a premium for loans with rates of interest higher than the going rate for the bonds they issue.  The income from these sales generally range between 100-200 bps or 1% to 2% of the loan amount.  These entities do not typically service loans, that job is done by a mortgage servicer who collects your payments, distributes some of the payment to the entity (like Fannie Mae) distributes payments for taxes and insurance if they are escrowed into your loan, and keeps a portion for their operating costs and profits.  These servicing companies pay to service the loan because it has an income stream over the life of the loan, or at least as long as the borrower pays the mortgage.  This payment for the right to service a loan is known as the servicing release premium and is again about 1-2% of the loan balance.  The servicing company is making a bet that the profit they make from each payment will over time exceed the premium they paid to service the loan.

Mortgage originators (not the loan officer but the company) try and make a net profit of 1% of their loan volume.  So if you have followed along and done the math, if you service your own loans, you are likely operating at a negative cash flow because 1-2% of the total income you earn is from the servicing release premium which equals or exceeds your net profit goal.  You need a lot of cash to be a mortgage servicer because you have to pay 1-2% to service the asset, and it typically takes you 7 years of servicing to earn a profit.  It is easier for a company to sell the loan to Fannie Mae and at the same time sell the servicing, so you can earn 3-5% of the amount up front rather than wait 7 years to make a profit.

"dailyprogrammer","t5_2tj45","I wanted to try out ocaml, so here are some of the tasks, from the Ocaml REPL. Jumping in a little late but I figure something is better than nothing and I couldn't get to it earlier.

Task 1

        # ""Hello, World."";;
        - : string = ""Hello, World.""

Task 2

So for task 2 I was looking for evaluating a lazy stream, ala Haskell's ""take"". Ocaml has something similar, streams, but it seems overly complex, basically you can create an infinite ""stream"" and request a certain number of items from it. I had to cobble together some sample code from the Ocaml website to get this working (the stream_filter and count_stream functions). There might be an easier way.

    # let count_stream = Stream.from (fun j -&gt; Some(j));;
    val count_stream : int Stream.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
    # let stream_filter p stream = 
  	let rec next i =
  		try
  			let value = Stream.next stream in
  			if p value then Some value else next i
  		with Stream.Failure -&gt; None in
  	Stream.from next;;
    val stream_filter : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a Stream.t -&gt; 'a Stream.t = &lt;fun&gt;
    # let is_div_3and5 x =
  	x mod 3 = 0 &amp;&amp; x mod 5 = 0;;
    val is_div_3and5 : int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
    # let list_div_3and5 = stream_filter is_div_3and5 count_stream;;
    val list_div_3and5 : int Stream.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
    # Stream.npeek 100 list_div_3and5;;
    - : int list =
    [0; 15; 30; 45; 60; 75; 90; 105; 120; 135; 150; 165; 180; 195; 210; 225; 240;
     255; 270; 285; 300; 315; 330; 345; 360; 375; 390; 405; 420; 435; 450; 465;
     480; 495; 510; 525; 540; 555; 570; 585; 600; 615; 630; 645; 660; 675; 690;
     705; 720; 735; 750; 765; 780; 795; 810; 825; 840; 855; 870; 885; 900; 915;

Task 3

I'll come back to this one, need to read up on ocaml string handling

Task 4

I'll come back to this one, need to read up on ocaml string handling

Task 5

Ocaml is strictly typed and I can't figure out how to make a more generic function. This one only adds an ""int list"", for a ""float list"" I'd have to use the float addition operator ""(+.)"" and a float zero ""0."". I'll dig around for a way to make the function generic.

For now, listSum is a partial function, it expects a list and when it gets one it will sum it up.

    # let listSum x =
      	List.fold_left (+) 0 x;;
    val listSum : int list -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
    # listSum [1;2;3;4;5];;
    - : int = 15

initially, the bully was apologetic, but immediately began bombarding my wife with subsequent messages calling her a ""pussy"" and saying things like ""good thing you left, you really would have been bullied!"" and even ""you deserved it."" what a riot. the messages continued all day even though they weren't getting any response. ultimately, the situation culminated in a fantastic denouement wherein the bully attempted to ridicule my wife for going to college and moving out of her hometown. so. freaking. hilarious.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Here is a good quote from the article:

&gt;As Anderson explained, the things each science studies cannot be fully reduced to the lower levels, but they also cannot violate the lower levels. Our actions cannot break the laws of physics, but they can be influenced by things beyond gravity, friction, and electromagnetic charges. No number of facts about a carbon atom can explain life, let alone the meaning of your life. These causes operate at different levels of organization. Even if you could write a history of the Civil War purely in terms of muscle movements or nerve cell firings, that (very long and dull) book would completely miss the point of the war. Free will cannot violate the laws of physics or even neuroscience, but it invokes causes that go beyond them.

The question that is addressed during any free will debate is ""What, if anything, causes my actions?"" We must go deeper and ask ""What, if anything, do we mean by cause?"" A naive response is to say ""The laws of physics cause my actions."" The laws of physics do not cause anything, it is simply held that no action can violate the laws of physics. Saying then that molecular interactions 'cause everything' only works as an answer if one is already committed to some kind of material reductionism, which is a position problematic for a number of reasons.

So I avoid blood tests unless absolutely necessary. So against medical advice I got some iron supplements, and took them for a month or so until I started to feel better, after which I reduced the frequency with which I took them and transitioned to having especially iron-rich foods throughout my diet (lots of beef, spinach and beans with oranges, etc.

What you really should do OP is get blood tests and find out what your levels are, especially if you don't menstruate or lack history of confirmed iron deficiency.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I had a similar experience with a cat that had a botched surgery. Totally healthy cat, but the vet did something wrong when they went in to remove some thread he had swallowed. Since the cause of death was listed as pancreatic failure (took him to another vet when he went downhill), I'm guessing she nicked the pancreas or something.

It was awful. We chased him around the house for a couple of days, trying to administer fluids via IV, while he tried to find a place to curl up and die. When he wasn't getting better at all, the vet we took him too undid the stitches, tried to fix what the other vet had done, and basically told us that his internal organs were liquefying. She strongly suggested putting him down, so we had too. He died on the operating table.

That vet was a sweetheart, and didn't charge us a penny for what we thought would be surgery, but wound up being the last time we'd see him. The other vet refused to admit any wrong doing until we threatened to take her to small claims court, and then she ""magically"" waved all the unpaid part of our vet bills.

Still, we wound up paying some butcher $300 to slowly kill a perfectly healthy cat on a routine object extraction. I can't even look at pictures of him anymore without feeling a profound sense of guilt, like I was responsible for his days of suffering.

Yeah, there's no solid science behind it, but it gas worked for a lot of people with anxiety and low confidence. It's quite widely accepted that just indulging yourself with mindless tv watching or gaming or Reddit several hours every day will make other stuff seem more boring. You desentesize your brain. Dopamine receptors. Just try it. Everyday boring stuff won't be as painful to do when you haven't used porn for two weeks. Also if you're addicted (addicted = can't stop even though you'd like to stop), your brain will be thinking of sex all the time. Painfully much. You end up being empty for words or opinions in social settings. You then end up becoming more anxious and miserable and then just want to feel good again so you go to porn and continue the circle. Anyone that's ever tried abstaining can tell you It's the hardest thing to quit, so why people don't get that people can be addicted to it, just baffles me. It's like saying, well, for most people, alcohol doesn't do any damage, so therefore no one can be addicted to it. Most people don't experience what I've experienced with porn (thought about killing myself, even though I had a perfect girlfriend and a family that loved me), but for us that do, noFap is a lifesaver. And I can't stand when people slag it off.

&gt;

&gt;The word __twat__ has various functions. It is a [vulgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgarism) [synonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym) for the human [vulva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva),  but is more widely used as a derogatory [epithet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet), especially in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English). The word may originate from [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse) *þveit* meaning cut, slit, or forest clearing.

It doesn't excuse any of the shit they might do to someone innocent of course. But people often use it as an excuse to act shitty towards cops, it only gives them more leeway to use it as an excuse to act shitty towards you.

I think you're looking at this topic like it's black and white. I wouldn't say you're stronger or weaker in any state of grievance. Strength is not something that comes from your environment, it's something that comes from within you. An individual who is emotionally strong is emotionally strong is emotionally strong, vice versa for someone who is emotionally weak. Expressing your emotions does not make you weak, the process of grievance, does not create strong and weak individuals. That type of thinking is very black and white, and is very flawed.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt; They've been shit for the better part of their existence

But the have existed for 40 years. Perhaps storied is the wrong word, but long-ish and stable history is worth a shit ton. 

&gt;LA is probably bigger as a secondary market for the Raiders than it is for the Chargers. Chargers wouldn't be losing much if a team moved there. Not moving a team to LA because of the Chargers would be a complete joke. The NFL would almost certainly make way more money from the LA market if a team was actually there than what they currently do from the Raiders, Chargers, and Rams.

LA is the official secondary market for the Chargers. Raiders have somewhere else, but it's not LA. [This article](http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/story/_/id/7005271/nfl-air-full-game-la-cutting-away) explains the LA market pretty well. The NFL might gain more money from ticket sales, probably create some money from merchandising, but their TV numbers and profits are outrageous already. Moving a team to LA likely won't improve that, unless their is some sort LA NFL boycott I am unaware of, and the NFL contracts do not expire until 2021, so they can't negotiate for more until then. Maybe moving then would make sense then as a ""give me more money"" gimmick, but I also think it could equally cause problems because it looks unstable.","1401580929"

Once you get the headset strapped in run one through the rear wheel to hold the back down. If you have a rack you can use two to tie the rear end down.

I would be fine if they completely did away with pvp (when it comes to advancing your character, it's pointless), but probably 20% of players literally only play WoW for the pvp so they wouldn't want to lose they revenue stream.

PvP was only good when you could use PVE gear to do it. In BC I was using my raiding tank gear to kick ass in battlegrounds. Now you have to have a specific PvP set that can only be acquired through PvP in the first place. Stupid waste of time if you ask me.

This is probably my most unpopular opinion about WoW, but it's one I've always had.","1401580936"

Can I ask why you get upset when someone says a Muslim man says he should not marry a non-Muslim woman? There's nothing inaccurate in that whatsoever. Yes, it is allowed; however, that does not mean its encouraged. Not only that but there are guidelines for marrying a non-Muslim woman. She HAS to be a practicing Jew or Christian, not that holiday only stuff. She also has to be chaste. You're upset about hijab, it is an obligation. It already isn't compulsory, there is a difference between the two. It's bad enough women are being forced to uncover, is that what feminism is?

However, there really isn't much (if any) difference beyond that. There is no difference *not* to get a Z97 motherboard, however since they're still new, they're more expensive than Z87 motherboards (as far as I know).

2) No, it just means that it has more VRAM. However, the 280X is already a bit more powerful than the 770 for the most part. [You can compare them here.](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1041?vs=1037)

3) CPU coolers are required if you want to overclock your system. The H100i cooler is a liquid-based one, making it more difficult to set up, so if that scares you, then you can get something like the 212 EVO or the NH-U12S instead. And if you don't want to overclock, then get the i5-4690 rather than the 4670K (-K processors are unlocked, meaning that they are designed to be easily overclocked, however are more expensive), drop the CPU cooler (unless you want your system to be ultra-quiet and run very cool), and replace the Z87/Z97 motherboard with an H87/H97 one.","1401580941"

What you have to understand is that you are living your life and she is living hers. Don't be with someone, because you don't want to hurt them. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. 

This happens. Either you stay or you leave. Sadly that's the truth of this situation. Waiting for change will only hurt. Just don't sit around with it on your mind. Whatever happens life always goes on. Do what you want, take control and never stop living life how you want to. There can be 2 solutions to this: You wait for you to change your mind, or you leave her. Whatever happens the people around will always care. They will help you through it. 

This is your life, your choices and sometimes things happen and you hate it. You can get someone you want, someone you feel comfortable with. You have to do what you want. This might all be a big mess, but whatever. If you need anyone, I will be here. I can help you through this if you need it. Follow your feelings. I wish you all the best. ","1401580943"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I work a 9-5 office job and I'd rather not be more specific than that.  I had a nervous breakdown when I was in my late 20s.  Because I'd been at my job for many years I had a lot of support and compassion from the management which was a blessing many people who have anxiety disorder don't benefit from.  I took the time off, even though it was a bad time for it, no questions asked, and I was able to see a psychiatrist and begin therapy and meds that week.

Anxiety disorder doesn't get better as you age.  In fact I was getting progressively worse but I didn't want to acknowledge it.  I cannot function without medication and it's definitely inhibited my progress in my field but now that I have some control over it the quality of my life has improved dramatically.

I've learned to be very honest about my limitations with people.  Some people think anxiety disorder is a joke or fabrication or that it isn't that serious.  I don't really worry about that so much because I can't control what they think of me.  A lot of people are compassionate.  It is hard to explain to family why I miss out on so many events but my spouse is as supportive as he can be.

Those who have anxiety disorder; don't wait to seek help.  It might get better on it's own but it can get a whole lot worse.  I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through what I had to go through.","1401580944"

Still nervous until the anatomy scan. My Dr does an integrated first trimester screen - NT + blood work at 10 weeks, then at 16 weeks more blood work.

I know it isnt the same as rape, but it still isn't easy to go through. The best way to get closer to her and be intimate is what 31245 said, be patient with her, talk to her about sex and that she is in control. Thats what I did. Also try and understand what her triggers are. It takes a long time for someone with this kind of emotional trauma to trust you so understand that. I should know. Lastly, do not expect a normal sexual experience for a while. I would suggest relieving your sexual urges before hand and focus on supporting her. You can't save her, you can only give her support.

I walked from Baptist, to atheist, to gnostic, and from there every point inbetween.

I found my way to some bastard form of Catholicism. I count my rosary, and say my prayers. For some things, though, I know God is too large to understand. God had to learn what it is to be human, and he did that by living vicariously through Jesus, or whatever name you give his avatar (since I don't exclude Buddha, and the others, because who gets anything in his first try?)

God was cruel early on, because he didn't understand. He had to learn compassion. God is a lot like us, because He had to learn, too. I like to think that our similarities bring us closer to Him. The rosaries and prayer bring me comfort, not divert my faith.","1401580952"

Remember that you are part of this equation and if she slips whilst not on meds and if this continues, you have to decide how strong an approach you take or do you become a co-dependent. in our case: Early after the diagnosis, she would change her mind on drug maintenance and slip (then include alcohol). I had to take a hard line for both our sakes. Suicide attempts is incredibly hard going, but depressants are by nature of the disease, selfish and you also have to look after yourself. Maybe going to a different psych to see if another avenue exists, or to get piece of mind with the original diagnosis. Most important thing to remember is that diet alone is only part of the mix.

Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the [La Tène culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture), which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to [Rhaetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaetia), [Noricum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum), [Pannonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonia) and southwestern [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania) during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: [Gallia Cisalpina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Cisalpina) was conquered in 203 BC and [Gallia Narbonensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Narbonensis) in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded by the [Cimbri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbri) and the [Teutons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutons) after 120 BC, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his [campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars) of 58 to 51 BC.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It went relatively well.

It started with my friend, let's call him Hank, whining about how he wanted to throw a party, needing his ""fix"", but his parents were there that weekend. It so happened mine weren't, and I had a relatively large house. So I told him if he set everything up, I would let him throw it at my house.

He gathers up a bunch of his friends who get the booze and whatnot, someone sets up their beast of a sound system, and everything seems to be going smoothly.

Come Ten, there's at least fifty people here; some in the house, some in the backyard. This is in the country, having a 50 acre lot, so plenty of room for people, and no one is disturbed. We're all having a good time, getting drunk and whatnot. Then *she* shows up.

My crush since the sixth grade, let's call her Amber, cause she was a ginger, absolutely stunning. She knew of me, smiled at times, but I hadn't thought she was interested until she came up to me. ""Cool party.""

""Uh, thanks, but it's really Hank's.""

""Well this isn't Hank's house, is it?""

""Nah, but these are Hank's friends and stuff.""

""Not your friends?"" I shook my head. ""Well am I your friend?""

She gave me a cute smile, and I just melted. But being tipsy, I didn't really think when I said ""I guess, but I'd like to be better than friends.""

She blushed, and took my hand. We went inside to my bedroom, and started making out. Another couple (I guess you could call us one now) barged in, but quickly left as they saw what we were doing. She got up and locked the door, and before making her was back to me, started to strip. I almost dies then and there, but her words brought me back.

""Do you want me?"" She beckoned.

""Yes. God yes. Do you...want me?"" I asked.

""You know what I want.""

""Perhaps,"" I said, feeling dizzy, ""but could you clarify for me?""

""Well...about tree fiddy.""

At this point I noticed my crush was about 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic Era. Her head went in and out of my ceiling, while her long red hair crushed across my face.

She saw my confusion, and quickly jumped and ran across our pasture, crushing about ten people outside.

I never heard from her again.

Tl;dr: don't make out drunkenly with your crush.","1401580957"

"serialkillers","t5_2s9td","The two main things that personally freak me out most is how ""normal"" they can act around their families or in public; and how much they torture their victims without any negative feelings about it.

Like Jeffrey Dahmer, no one suspected him at all, they just thought he was socially awkward. But he acted like a totally normal dude.
Or the murder of Junko Furuta, where she was tortured to an unbelievable extent for over 40 days. It boggles my mind that people are even capable of these things, but there's killers who are, and it's scary to think about.","1401580957"

The other thing - they're (and by extension, I'm) perfectly justified in not wanting your animal on their property. They maintain it and they pay taxes on that plot of land, and they're backed by laws and by-laws in turn. It's not an area where you can decide that your animal can freely roam on, whether or not you agree with it. Perhaps you're misinterpreting your neighbourhood's kindness.

If you want 20-100 Mbit/sec down most people are at the mercy of a single local cable company in many cases.

For a single person that doesn't have concerned about latency DSL it is OK, but for many people with 2 or more people sharing the line the limitations of DSL become apparent rather quickly.

Most companies don't even use the term broadband for internet service anymore anyways.  They just use a nebulous term for high speed internet.","1401580964"

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","I wanted to kind of wait before I responded to you, so I could formulate some thoughts and answer some concerns about burning man and smaller burner events.

To me, these events have always been about radical self-expression. Everyone brings there own experiences to enjoy and share. In my camp, we have a professional pole dancer who really enjoys what she does. It takes a lot of skill and strength to perform pole dancing maneuvers. She wanted to bring an affordable and mobile pole dancing stage to SOAK so she can perform and share with others. That is why we built this.

I've seen all kinds of wonderful performers. Musicians, fire dancers, hula hoopers, trapeze artists, aerial ribbon dancers, pole dancers... ALL are valid forms of self expression. 

If it's stripping that you are against, I can assure you that our dancer doesn't have immediate intentions to be sexually provocative. Even if she did, though, who am I or you to judge? I've seen all the above acts performed clothed or nude. Whether your an attractive poi artist in the nude, or just some shirt cocker on mushrooms, or some nudist enjoying an orgy tent, I would never rain on that parade. That's the beauty of burner self expression events.

I'm really sorry that you feel that you can't go to Burning Man because of me. You don't know me or the people in my company, which is really a shame. Whether you think for some reason I contribute to some ""Bro-culture"" or that I am exploiting women (which I do not, and am open to all sexes of performers), you don't know who I am... and I wish you did.

I wish you'd go and come and meet me. I'd be happy to talk to you and share life experiences, and, hell, even feed you some bacon (or home made hummus, if that's your preference).

The real people that I don't want at burning man are the ones who think that some sort of performance is less valid than others. The people who come close minded and harbor resentment. ...and even then, I wish they WOULD come. I wish they would come so that someone like me can say hello, let them enjoy our camp fire and enjoy a little unique slice of life.","1401580967"

Hitting things on the order of 30ms is considered VERY high end precision of pulling off moves in a competitive fighting game scenario, it's something that is supposed to be difficult and unreliable for the average pleb. This is not what the leap attack and shield bash are supposed to be.

Besides, it's a pretty similar window to the iFrames for the default roll, it's around what is supposed to be manageable for everyone.

&gt; Really, using both hands, hit your ""1"" and ""0"" keys at the same time. Unless you have mobility issues you are hitting these keys a single-digit number of milliseconds apart.

I think you underestimate how accurate single digit milliseconds actually is... I mean, just error alone ont he USB sampling rate is 8 ms, which will pretty much blow you single digit readings out to double digits every time. If you don't have both buttons pressed within the same sample window they are goign to be a MINIMUM of 8ms apart, and then the game engine on top of that if it's not sampling the USB state at the same time as well (which is highly likely given interrupts are a thing of the past) will add at least another 16.7 ms. So if you expect 30ms accuracy from the user then a single ms out on the users part could register as 25ms to the game. If the user is off by 6ms and unlucky then it could count as a failure...

There was one point, right when we were being sieged at Eli the first time, where there was more VS than NC at every single engagement, and in the warpgates, and even then Cobalt were capping 2 empty lanes with 12-24 VS.

PTS was falling apart mind-you. Cobalt guys were teleporting everywhere and bugging out a lot; some of my members ever recorded it. 

The PPA spam and Miller's lack of air would've probably lost this for us, but not by too much of a defeat. The population advantage made it a nightmare for morale and caused the defeat to be far worse than it should have.

Miller needs to take a long hard look at itself with the way it organises the ServerSmash, because the plans are usually solid and the outfits that play are fucking good. Then again 250v250 basically boils down to mass redeploy and zerging anyway, which Miller outfits lack the synergy and willpower to do, and if you have more numbers and A2G dominance, you're going to do it better.","1401580969"

&gt; Guess we are sharing FFXI stories now? Here's mine...
Started back on FFXI right when it came to the US. It was still a delicate time with the Japanese and the NA population, and since I leveled really fast, I found myself without a lot of grouping options other than the already leveled Japanese crowd.

&gt; Met a Japanese guy who helped me out with everything. Gobbie bags, level break quests, all the way down to just spamming heals on my party out of group to help me exp. Guy was awesome. He didn't know a lot of English but we could communicate.
&gt; Me and him were good buds. But his in-game wife (remember you could get married with the wedding dresses and all?) was his real life girlfriend and future wife. She couldn't speak a word of English and I really wanted to be able to talk to her, mainly to thank her cause she often got dragged into helping me all the time too.

&gt; So I decided to start taking Japanese at college as an elective to my Computer science. Because of how much this guy influenced me, I eventually switched my major to international studies altogether.
&gt; Then, while completing my study abroad requirements in Japan, I got the chance to meet the dude. We decided to meet up and hit the town one night and catch up on all the things we always talked about. Apparently he was a semi-pro disco dancer, and we decided to sleep in a Manga cafe, something we had always joked about in FFXI.

&gt; Jump forward a few years, I had just finished graduate school for International Studies, again focusing on Asia, was living in Japan, and getting married to my Japanese wife. This dude drove across the country to join my wedding, bringing his wife (again, the same one that really started my interest in Japanese), and his new son.

&gt; Guy was quite the honored guest at my wedding in my opinion, because, due to his selflessness in FFXI, he promoted my interest in Japanese which led to my degrees, my home, my wife, and my career.","1401580970"

In any conversation like this I think the first thing you should do is get away from one word encompassing terms because these tend to have many different interpretations.

I believe every human being should...

* Empathise as much as possible with other human beings.
* Listen to others experiences and not unduly disregard them.
* Give help to others in every situation if it will not be more than a slight inconvenience.
* Give help to others in dire need if it will not place you in dire need of help.

It's disgraceful.  My father went to a segregated school in the Deep South in the 1960's.  Sure he had raggedy books and had to walk miles to school, but he would tell us kids that he had the best education as a youth.  His teachers were demanding, he was taught Latin and German.  My brother and I would giggle when he spoke it at home when we were young.  His teachers were in the business of teaching.

Possible solution to the smell:
If we decide to introduce them to restaurants like Subway(I am doing the project on Subway), the cheese would have to be cut into 6'' long slices which will then be packaged individually in small bags that would be opened only when the customer places an order.

A separate grill with a powerful integrated exhaust may be required to suck the much more powerful odour of sizzling cheese if the client asks for it to be grilled.

Next, not too sure if Shadow is really optimal in this deck, especially not at 3. When you draw it without a Boxer XYZ on board, it sucks. It doesn't do anything to advance the gamestate like Headgeared, Sparrer, or Switchhitter unless you already have your boss monster out.  Seems to me that 3 would clog, and just running it would lead to brick hands.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I have been riding for 1.5 years (27k miles) I ride almost exclusively to commute 90+ miles a day to work. Knowing this would be the case, I bought a tourer. I just finished grad school and am now studying for the state boards so I haven't ventured into group riding. In a few months I want to start a California chapter of [this group](http://www.emsroaddocs.com/).

 I know a few male riders on both sport bikes and cruisers. The only female riders I know are related to me and ride cruisers. If I were going to stereotype based on my personal experience (which I do reluctantly,) I'd say the breakout of cruiser vs. sportbike is related to age more than gender (and personality?) I'm over 40 and so are my relatives that ride. If you combine our (mine and your) experience, the stereotypes don't hold up.

There's a big part of me that wants to get a sport bike when I can afford two bikes, but I probably never will. 

My sister is a ""biker chick."" She is as knowledgable as any male. Me, not so much, but I learn more everyday. I do feel a bit of pressure to be taken seriously. I don't really want to be ""one of the guys."" I like being a girl and enjoy being recognized as one, but would prefer not to be singled out as one.  It's an interesting quandary.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","When a band signs a recording contract, they usually receive nothing up front. It's basically just an agreement that says ""We, the label, are going to put up x amount of money to get you recorded, promoted and - if you score a hit - sent on tour. Once we break even on our investment and you become profitable, you'll begin to receive a percentage of sales"", which is usually something like ten-to-25 cents per dollar of revenue that they generate. 

The band usually makes most of their money by touring, through the sales of t-shirts and bumper stickers and through product endorsements. For example, a famous guitar player may be approached to have a custom model of Fender Guitar made with their name on it, or they may get other deals from the companies that make their favorite amps, strings, microphones, instrument cables, VSTis, etc. 

If an artist is signed for five million dollars, for example, and their album flops, then the label will sue them for their money back, at which point they'll have to file bankruptcy. The producers and writers, however, generally work as independent contractors, and never go into debt to the label. That's why, a lot of the ""one hit wonders"" will gain experience in the industry, and then begin writing and producing for other artists. ","1401580989"

I wouldn't agree with that.

The analysis fails to take into account the [change over time in the age of the competitions elite](http://theconversation.com/youll-never-see-another-teenage-tennis-champ-heres-why-21529). An ""over 30"" champion is more likely now than it was say 10 years ago

So if this (reasonably arbitrary) score was different by just 0.02, the conclusion would be completely different?

"apple","t5_2qh1f","The line for the keynote really is insane.  Get there early... as in, camp overnight.  When you get in line, immediately get to know the people around you.  Introduce yourself and make friends.  This will come in handy when you need to go to the bathroom, get food, etc..., plus you're likely to meet interesting people who share common interests.

If you have something to promote (your app/company) wear a t-shirt with your logo, and have cards/flyers to pass out.  If you're on the first block (in between Moscone and the garage), keep an eye out for reporters. 

I've covered the event a number of times for various media companies.  We're usually looking for people to approach for interviews and approach those that make good eye contact with us as we're walking down the line.

Across from Moscone is the Metreon it has a food court with free wifi and plugs to charge stuff.  There's also a Starbucks on the side of the garage on 4th Street.  On the other side of the garage (on Mission), there's a large mall and restaurants (Denny's open all night, Mel's to 3am).

If you're driving, park in the garage on Mission between 4th and 5th.  It's expensive, but easy and safe.  As you drive up the garage, each level has a sign showing how many spaces are available.  I usually just drive up where it's vacant so I can park near the elevator/stairs.

It gets cold in the city.  Usually, the hotter it is inland or down the peninsula, the colder it is in the city.  It's expected to drop down to 54 degrees. ","1401581004"

The equipment is licensed so the users don't have to be.

Ham radio is a service for tinkerers and hobbyists, many of whom build their own equipment. so they can have cool toys, that have more stuff they can do, but more ways to screw it all up. The users are licensed so the hardware doesn't have to be.

hence, ham radio hardware might not have safeguards to stop you from doing something illegal, but thats OK because ham operators are Licensed and trained not to do that.

 If you want to transmit on EMS frequencies, you need to by a radio certified for those frequencies. there isn't a way around that.

&gt;

&gt;[Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) __mission__ is ""an organized effort for the [propagation of the Christian faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization)."" 

&gt;Mission often involve sending individuals and groups, called ""[missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary),"" to foreign countries and to places in their homeland for the purpose of [proselytism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselytism) (conversion to Christianity, or from one Christian tradition to another). This involves [evangelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism) (preaching a set of beliefs for the purpose of conversion), and humanitarian work, especially among the poor and disadvantaged. There are a few different kinds of mission trips: short-term, long-term, relational and ones meant simply for helping people in need. Some might choose to dedicate their whole lives to missions as well. Missionaries have the authority to preach the Christian faith (and sometimes to administer sacraments), and provide humanitarian work to improve [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development), [literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education), [health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care), and [orphanages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage). Christian doctrines (such as the ""Doctrine of Love"" professed by many missions) permit the provision of aid without requiring religious conversion.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","&gt; my larger point was that education purely for the sake of education is a worthwhile enterprise, even for people who are poor. 

I believe so too, but that private benefit must be subject to the market. If people want the personal benefit of education, they must be prepared to bear the costs of it. Since we subsidize education to leverage a greater social good via a better economy, I can understand if there's some strings that come with aid. Education is a worthy endeavour for its own sake, but that makes it quite similar to plenty of other things we don't subsidize for the personal benefit they grant, however great they might be.

Does choosing a major count as one of those strings? when it comes to financial aid, absolutely fucking not. However, I understand having different prices of majors based on the costs of the program or favouring certain disciplines with shortages or a foreseeable need for more grads. I think that universities should be moving towards a greater focus on alignment with labour market needs. I don't think they can meet them perfectly, but they could do it better if they give such alignment greater importance.

The Waterloo universities in Wilfrid Laurier (my school) and University of Waterloo do this *very* well. They both have quite extensive co-op programs, with Waterloo's unmatched anywhere in Ontario and probably Canada/most of North America too. While roughly two-thirds of WLU's business co-op employment is in vertigo-inducing Toronto (sorry I had to haha ;)), 30% is local. That's not local-for-the-sake-of-local either, I'm talking employment with Google Canada HQ, Communitech (terrific federal centre of excellence that promotes entrepreneurship. I also worked there last summer), Desire2Learn (education company that might just have designed your university's learning management system), Manulife, Sun Life, Kik Interactive, Blackberry... the universities have been really integrated in their communities (they work with Communitech and other local groups to boost alumni entrepreneurs for example. Bufferbox was a UW-supported start-up that was eventually sold to Google for $25M) in ways that boost employment for their students and boost the local economy. 

More important than both of those, however, is the innovating culture that both universities have been able to cultivate in the community that has contributed, somewhat, to why Kitchener-Waterloo, the booming tech city once subject to doomsday theories with the sharp decline of local manufacturing, is such an anomaly in southwestern Ontario. None of the factories my father used to work in his youth still stand, such as kaufman footwear or the electro-plating plant. They're often turned into lofts or condos. Hell, half the above companies I listed are based in the old [Lang Tannery](http://www.therecord.com/news-story/2603379-tannery-building-a-jewel-in-high-tech-hub/) (that's a great article to show how many factories have gone down and how tech is booming. The developer literally says that UW is why he bought the place), the biggest leather tannery in North America IIRC. Not only is KW booming, but it's booming *when the rest of southwestern Ontario is suffering mightily*. I think the universities' relationships with the city and integration into its community and economy is a contributing factor to that.","1401581006"
"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","The first vibrators had literally nothing (heh) to do with women pleasuring themselves. it had more to do with Victorian English doctors wanting to successfully manipulate and ""understand"" the female anatomy. 

Women in the 19th Century were conditioned not have a sexual drive, and doctors did not believe they did. They would masturbate women to cure them of ""hysteria,"" and they were just getting very tired. And this the first vibrator.

&gt; Not surprisingly, these beliefs left an enormous number or women sexually frustrated. They complained to doctors of anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability, nervousness, erotic fantasies, feelings of heaviness in the lower abdomen, and wetness between the leg. This syndrome became known as “hysteria,” from the Greek for uterus.

&gt; Women's sexual pleasure was the furthest thing from the minds of the male doctors who invented vibrators almost two centuries ago. They were interested in a labor-saving device to spare their hands the fatigue they developed giving handjobs to a steady stream of 19th century ladies who suffered from “hysteria,” a vaguely defined ailment easily recognizable today as sexual frustration.

I'd obviously prefer a good answer to either no answer or a bad answer, but I'm pretty sure that science is only ever going to produce bad answers (at least when it comes to complex systems problems). In this particular instance I don't think it's worth fretting (i.e., lacking an answer is probably fine), but in cases that do matter, well, more legitimate takes on complex systems epistemology is probably the thing I care the most about at the moment.","1401581010"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; In other words, if it’s true that the human brain is wired to believe in something that is false, then isn’t the human brain demonstrably unreliable for discerning truth?

I would say that the human brain is wired to believe things, and that truth is not the highest priority when determining those beliefs. It is wired to detect patterns in its sensory data, and extrapolate a conclusion from those patterns.

This often leads to assuming that certain phenomena are caused by something similar to everyday experience. What are those flashes of light and then the loud noise? If we don't yet know about electromagnetism, then it's pretty obvious that someone really, really powerful is somewhere above us throwing those thunderbolts around.

The human brain's discernment of truth is demonstrably unreliable when taken at face value. But one does not need to do that.

&gt;  Can an atheist trust that their brain has found the truth? 

He can. Whether he should or not depends on the atheist, the truth he thinks he's found, and how much he trusts it.

I'm not concerned about finding the truth. It'll probably never happen in my lifespan, even if transhumanism becomes widespread and my lifespan is tens of thousands of years. The important thing is to *get closer* to the truth than you were before.

&gt; Is an atheist free from the mental subroutines programmed via evolution? 

It's not impossible. It will happen eventually. But I don't think there is such an atheist at this point in time.

&gt; Can an atheist be certain that their brain found truth, not just in this case, but ever?

He can indeed. I'm of the opinion that he's probably not 100% correct about what he's found actually being true. If an atheist is never certain that he's ever found truth, then it sounds like he's an epistemological nihilist as well as an atheist.","1401581013"

1. Uninstall and update his video card drivers. It may be that simple as there could be new compatibility issues with Watch Dogs that need to be fixed with a driver update.

2. Make sure his his monitor is connected to his video card and not the the motherboard I/O. I had a friend once that was connecting a VGA cable to the mobo I/O when he had an 7850 with DVI and HDMI ports. So, make sure he's plugging to the video card and not the motherboard.

/////////////////////////////

When I look at that pic in the post I'm only seeing the requirements in full, which isn't enough information. If indeed he's using a Pentium CPU, even it's an Ivy Bridge, because it's a dual core he's kinda screwed for newer games going forward. Watch Dogs has been criticized greatly on /r/masterrace for it's poor optimization. The CPU must be holding it back with 2 threads, but I'd be curious if he's having problems in other games.

The good news is that the socket type for a G2120 is LGA 1155, which is the same for all i3 and i5 Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge CPUs. He has a path to upgrade for his system, but as time passes Ivy Bridge parts will become more scarce and expensive. I'd recommend upgrading to a used i5-34xx or i5-35xx series CPU, a trade in could be arranged for like $100 maybe at a computer store. 

Look at the 3Dmark 11 benchmark for these comparisons. An AMD build would've been better on the CPU and mobo side for that price. Even if AMD quads are inferior to Intel ones, they get the job done better than Intel duals for the same price. 6300 isn't a quad, but AMD has sub $100 quads that would be better than a Pentium for the same price like a 750k. The Pentium brand hasn't been a good series for gaming for over 10 years.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; You don't need ""permission"" from a doctor anymore than you need their permission for any other elective surgery. You find a doctor with the right specialization, pay the money, they perform the procedure.

No, this isn't true. It's not like getting a boob job, where you just pay the money and sign some informed consent forms about risks. Surgeons follow the [WPATH](http://www.wpath.org/http://www.wpath.org/) [Standards of Care](http://www.wpath.org/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf). There's actually pretty strict criteria that a trans person must meet. For example, I had to be living as a woman for a year, been on hormones for a year, and I had to meet with two psychiatrists who wrote a letter saying they recommended me for surgery. The surgeon required this letter before booking me for surgery. Even the Thai surgeons that don't follow those requirements strictly still have their own standards that go far beyond that of another plastic surgery.

&gt;. For instance, someone who is transgender can hide that they're transgender, someone who is black cannot hide that they're black. 

I used to live as a man, now I live as a woman. How could I possibly have hidden that? I could have suffered quietly and just stayed unhappy, but that's not any more reasonable than telling a gay person they are never allowed to tell anyone and that they are never allowed to date someone they are attracted to. If you meant that it's possible to hide being transgender after transition, that depends on a lot of things. Someone who transitions in their fifties isn't going to have as good results as someone who starts at 18. Things also have a way of following you around. I just applied for a teaching job. I've been able to update the name on my teaching certificate, diplomas, pension plan, transcripts, resume, etc., but it wasn't possible to update the name on my practicum reports. Applying meant informing the school district that I was transgender - it wasn't possible to hide that. I live in the bible belt here so it's definitely a concern when it comes to getting hired.

&gt;you're letting personal bias influence your belief that someone who is transgender automatically has it harder than other minorities.

Yes, I totally messed up with that! [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26yktz/cmv_i_am_unsypmathetic_to_the_plight_of/chvyzso) an attempt I made to explain what I should have said.

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","Before the season began, there was a thread in /r/NewYorkMets comparing Chris Young and Nelson Cruz. Cruz had just signed a contract remarkably similar to Young's in terms of dollars and years. I remarked how Cruz would have been a more worthwhile investment than Young. Nearly everyone else said something along the lines of ""Young is a better defender than Cruz. This will give much needed confidence to the young Mets pitchers. This will outweigh Cruz' anticipated advantage over Young at the plate. ""

Yeah, hindsight is 20/20 and $6 million or whatever for Young was a pretty good deal. Plus, he was due to bounce back. But imagine having Nelson Cruz (aka the AL homerun and RBI leader at the end of May) in the Mets lineup right now. Imagine having him batting behind Wright and in front Granderson. It's not the least bit of a stretch to believe the Mets could be within a couple games of first.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this team - with its rotation and rapidly improving bullpen - is one impact bat away from really contending *right now* and that impact bat was within reach. ","1401581020"

Once a jet has that energy however its retention is extremely high, you will need to do something stupid in order to loose it.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Imagine the Internet is a vast sheet of paper, and each individual web page, including this one, is a tiny square. Each hyperlink on each web page is a line connecting one square to some other square. So from the square that represents this page, there'd be a whole bunch of little lines leading to other squares, most of which don't go anyplace terribly interesting (unless you think Reddit's ""contact us"" page is interesting).

This kind of structure — squares connected by lines — is called a *graph.* And it's possible to pick a square and *traverse* the graph by following lines. You could, in this way, get from any square you might pick as your starting point to any other square, given enough time.

The graph that represents the Internet would be incomprehensibly huge. Trillions of little squares, trillions upon trillions of lines connecting them … but it would still fundamentally be a graph. And it would still be traversable. Not in anything like a reasonable amount of time, but it could be done.

Only if you zoomed out, like *way* out, you'd notice that the Internet isn't actually *one, single* graph. Instead it consists of one incomprehensibly vast graph, and then *millions* of much smaller ""satellite"" graphs. It is, in the general sense, not possible to get from the main graph to any of these satellite graphs. There are no hyperlinks that lead there. You can only get there if you know the right address to key in.

Most of these satellite graphs are entirely innocuous. For instance, one of these satellite graphs is your online banking site. It consists of a set of web pages that can *only* be seen by you (or, I suppose, anybody you gave your credentials to, if you were so foolish). There is no hyperlink I, or anybody else, could follow to get to your online banking site. Your online banking site is cut off from the Internet. You can't get there from here … *unless* you know the right pieces of information to key in. So your banking site is one of these satellite graphs.

But there are other satellite graphs that people have set up for nefarious purposes. Distributing child pornography, that kind of thing. These graphs are only accessible if you know their addresses, and the addresses are shared only by word of mouth, in general. You can't follow a hyperlink to get there, nor can you search for them in Google or what have you. But if you get the address from somebody who knows it, you can dial it in and go there directly.

This is what people are generally talking about when they talk about the ""deep web."" They're little archipelagos of information, the sort of off-shore shoals that people sail out to if they want to conduct unpleasant business. Want to steal a copy of a movie or trade away a hundred naked pictures of an eight-year-old? If you know the right address, there's a place for that.","1401581021"

2.  Loki God.  God's just crazy. 

3.  God exists as part of an organization farming humans for some unfathomable reason.  He tells them whatever he has to in order to keep the farm going. 

4.  God was a passing alien that just tried to give some advice on their way through space.  

5.  God is a title rather than a person.  That's why the instructions don't make sense.  

6.  We're all a simulation to better understand humanity. 

7.  The babylon 5 theory.  There is no God, only beings that have existed so long they think they're gods. 

8.  Satan is God.  He won in the Garden and has been ruling this earth ever since.  

9.  God is an idea founded in the culture of his, her, or their creation. 

10.  Shared virtual reality.  We're all gods, bored ones at that.  So we created an imperfect world without our prior knowledge just to keep ourselves entertained. ","1401581021"

Dumb because he even believes him that it was all in his head.  How was he so certain even?  He'd been wrong 50 other times about this guy in the episode so his ability to read him was clearly suspect.

Dumb because the guy even lets him in with that gun.  Magnussen supposedly knows that he's being trapped, he's this paranoid genius with all this security and shit, but he doesn't even frisk two people he knows are trying to bring him down at this exact moment?  

Dumb because even if it was all in his head, he told Sherlock.  Even if Sherlock gets arrested and ""loses"" he's going to tell his brother or government people there's no secret archives.  Once anybody finds out its in your head, you lose any ability to blackmail anyone ever again.  Now they know they can just kill you.  So even if Sherlock doesn't kill him right then, admitting it's all in his head is just asking to get shot by somebody real soon.

This is called bad writing when one super-genius villain just ruins his whole villain game boasting to Holmes, and then Holmes just fucking shoots him to win.  Neither of them acted their parts in the end.  The genius villain was undone by monumental stupidity his character isn't supposed to be capable of, and Holmes just goes all bad-ass action hero.

If I'm watching a boxing movie, and two boxers are training hard, both want to win, I want the conclusion to be a boxing match.  What I don't want is them sitting down to play chess, for no reason, totally out of characters.

2. Out of curiosity, can you tell us why the account on mturk changed names from Social Research to Marketing Research? That looked suspicious.

3. I think there is a soft block, or at least another method. Sometimes, I have accepted a HIT and the HIT window says ""You have accepted the maximum numer of HITs for this requester. Please return the HIT.

4. In general, IP blocking may work. You may get some complaints, as there are some households that have multiple turkers. Also, some people may work in different locations, e.g. at home and at the coffee shop, so it may not be 100% effective at filtering duplicates.

5. I think there are other methods as well, namely around worker IDs. Sometimes, in qualtrics, I am automatically redirected, and it says I've taken the survey before. Other times, it has you input your worker ID to check for eligibility, and then it will say ""You have not completed a survey from the 'Brand Response 3 group'"" or the contrary. I'm not sure how the requesters program that; you could inquire on a requester form.

6. If your research allows it, try giving the HITs more unique and memorable names, or even a codename, such as ""5-minute marketing survey *Dinosaur Forest*"". This can help alert workers who may make a duplicate accidentally.

That's what feedback I can give from the workers' side. In general, mturk is a great service, but the reality of the matter is that many things are unclear for both the workers and requesters. Thanks for contacting Amazon too, as the more pushes they get, the better.","1401581031"

The LGBT movement also could use some support around here indeed. That's part of the problem: there aren't many ""mixed"" places and social circles where one might meet LGBT people - at least not ""out"". They have their parties and bars and gatherings which straight people rarely attend, and vice versa. And for example I've just recently found out about a friend that he's gay (and only by accident, from a mutual friend). But what you say certainly holds truth, so I'll try and make acquaintance in those directions as well.

I'm quite torn between the two options, but I still tend to lean towards the full honesty. Withholding information would more frequently cause bad dates, wasted time and effort, and possible tension and confrontation. Maybe, just maybe would it succeed the way you described, and I find it too unlikely to be worth it. :(

Or maybe FSG will see a move for Fabregas as worth it, I mean they are talking about bringing Liverpool up to a top five world wide club and that would certainly help their cause. I like Lallana but without a doubt Fabregas is the more quality player. Also, the English angle doesn't really work in this case because we are already stacked with English talent.

"PSO2","t5_2sjei","Techer/Hunter isn't bad at all, but it focuses heavily on melee. Techs are mainly just used for support. The gameplay is based around the unique way that Wand Gear explosions work, which is that the damage scales up with the number of enemies being hit simultaneously. If you hit one enemy, you will do one S-ATK hit and one T-ATK hit on that one enemy. However, if you hit ten enemies in one strike, you will do one S-ATK hit and ten T-ATK hits on *each* enemy — that's a total of 110 hits in one strike, and the damage is very impressive. To fully exploit this, melee Techers make heavy use of Zondeel to group up enemies before meleeing them.

If you want to play a more balanced hybrid, Techer/Fighter is good with both melee and techs. The melee damage is usually slightly lower than what Hunter offers, but it can actually be higher in certain situations. The tech damage is reasonably high thanks to Fighter's damage multipliers. The melee gameplay is the same as Techer/Hunter, but Techer/Fighter can effectively mix in offensive techs as well, giving better single-target damage and a good ranged option. I personally play Techer/Fighter a lot, and I love it. It's great fun, and it works well.

I suggest taking a look at the [melee Techer guide](http://www.pso-world.com/forums/showthread.php?t=217314) for more information.","1401581038"

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","Chronic intern here. 2 companies offered me jobs outright, 1 invited me to apply for a position, 1 was not looking to hire. I'm from the UK, so the following advice may or may not apply. I know internship culture is much bigger in the States.

&gt; Does the end of a internship usually turn into a job?

I would not recommend going into any internship with the expectation that there is a job waiting at the end, unless this was specifically stated when you applied. A lot of companies rotate interns and have no intention of taking on extra entry-level employees.

&gt; Or are there ways to turn an internship into a job, even if it's not a job running the program I develop?

That said... There definitely are ways. Work incredibly hard, take on extra projects, never complain, create something of value to the company which is above and beyond what they took you on for. It sounds like you're doing OK. However, nothing, sadly, guarantees a job offer. Some may *want* to hire, but can't justify the expense.

&gt; Do I just apply to jobs listed in the company, and use my previous work with them as proof that I'm a good employee?

Yes! This is probably your best bet. It's what people usually mean when they say that internships = long interviews. If you can get references from your superiors, they'll know they can trust you and that you fit in well. Takes a lot of risk away for the company.

Either way, the most useful thing you can do for your career right now is to keep working hard and proving your value to this company.

The girl will eventually start to trust you again, and one day will bring it up, and you can laugh over the true story. 

Act embarrassed and sullen, and it will make people think you are the kind of weirdo who would have been taking a picture.

People know that events can be misleading, and read more into your actions than your words. If you *act* like you've done nothing wrong, people will believe that. The opposite is also true. 

But even more so, the way you weather a storm like this shows a lot about your person, no matter what happened. 

So behave as though you are a honorable person, not like you have something to apologize for. People pay less attention to what happens than how you act. 90% of what we know about one another comes from indirect cues. ","1401581045"

You have misrepresented the facts time and time again. Israel seized Palestinian taxes from the people of Palestine as  punishment, not because they wanted debts being repaid.  


Now israel has hundreds of thousands of settlers living outside israel in Palestine, illegally.  Asking for back rent and taxes due to them would be letting israel off easy.

 Israel also has taken Palestinian property and continues to quarry pslestinian stone, again illegally. Again asking istael to pay for what it has plundered would be letting them off easy.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt;I myself cry easily, it doesn't mean I'm a manipulative asshole using it to get my way, it just means years come out of my eyes when I'm upset.

While I agree with this statement (it applies to me as well) and I agree that GF isn't being a manipulative bitch, the only thing that concerns me is the ""I'm a terrible girlfriend!"" bit, where he's trying to talk to her about something but OH NO now his concerns can't be addressed because he has to comfort her, and his issues get thrown on the back burner. 

Where I think reddit is fucking up here is that I really don't think she's doing this on purpose, but it's incredibly immature to turn his problem into her problem and not address his concerns. I can't fathom having the insecure kind of mindset where that's your logical response to your SO coming to you with a problem that needs to be discussed. And unfortunately, I do feel like it's a mindset, and he can't just be like ""hey could you not be like this, I need to talk to you for real."" Because then that just compounds the problem and probably makes her feel like an even *worse* girlfriend for not having the ""proper response"" for him.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","It's a strange feeling, not knowing how you got somewhere; it's even stranger when you don't remember where you came from either. Nevertheless, here I am, having been apparently plucked out of the ether by the greasy fingers of fate, and clumsily deposited onto something cold, hard, and a little wet. For the sake of argument, we'll call this the floor. I can feel something similar against my back, which logically must be the wall. Yes, I think I'm getting the hang of this now.

'SNEW.'

I've never seen that word before. It's printed in neat letters on aged wood, a little way across the room. It's a struggle to comprehend what it could mean; the bits of thought that should be words are dancing a waltz around my head. I've got a cracking headache, and everything feels off-kilter. It must be concussion. Perhaps I've forgotten how to read?

I reach up to feel the thudding pain in my temple, and notice my hand feels a lot heavier than I remember. Relaxing the arm, I feel it tumble backwards, my palm slapping wetly against the wall. Aha. Unless the laws of physics have been recently revised, the floor is not where I thought it was. Being a staunch believer in physical laws, I would suppose the latter. Besides which, it's far too early in the day to have to re-think anything that complicated.

Awkwardly, with all the grace of a small child stuck inside a Christmas jumper, I right myself. Reassured by my arms' new-found ability to hang in the correct positions, I finally have a chance to look around. Pale blue cubicles line one side of the room, sinks arranged in single-file along the opposite wall. A simple wooden door waits patiently opposite me, framed by narrow, frosted glass windows. Though dimly lit, the letters on the door look more familiar now.

'MENS.'

That would explain the smell.

I suddenly realise that whatever I'm sitting in is soaking through my trousers. Scrambling to my feet, a small piece of paper unsticks itself from my forehead and flutters down onto the tiles. Squinting, I can just about read the words scrawled across it.

'I'm sorry I left you, but the machine only carries two people. Besides, I never was any good at farewells. Good luck.'

Shuffling across the floor, I gently push against the door. It swings open easily, and a blast of musty air hits my face. Outside, the floor drops precipitously away into darkness, and the ceiling is abruptly replaced by open sky. It looks like a chunk of the world is missing. Not particularly damaged, or forcibly removed - just missing. The gap must be several kilometres wide, and just as deep.

I look up, past the far-away rim of the hole, and out towards the distant stars, and for the first time in my life I find myself wondering if the laws of physics are just guidelines after all.","1401581059"

I'm digressing from the main topic but, funnily enough, thinking back to the Subway scandal, am I correct in recalling that they made a statement claiming that they'd always used halal meat, and that it wasn't anything recent?

If I remember correctly, then that moral panic is no different to that of the horse meat scandal - everyone ate it happily without caring, but were only concerned because they assumed it was something else and had their sensibilities rocked. Of course, unlike the bogus science that was bandied around following the horse meat scandal, there is no harmful effects of eating halal meat - that much is beyond dispute.

For these people, it seems to be a matter of principle - that we'll accept the implementation of vegetarian opinions, or segregated bathrooms etc., but as son as the word ""halal"" is mentioned then people will throw a hissy fit. Funnily enough, ""kosher"" doesn't give the same reaction, despite being practically the same.","1401581060"

2. You can make it pop more than one between gcds via the rotation scripts, but the second off-gcd skill's animation time is going to push back your next gcd skill slightly. Each skill (that isn't a cast), whether it's on gcd or off-gcd has a 1 second animation time. So if you have a gcd of 2.5 seconds and you hit two off-gcd skills between gcd skills, it'll push your next gcd skill back by half a second. I've been testing that with my monk and I'm pretty confident that's how it works in game. If not or if there are actually varying animation times for some skills, it's really easy to change.","1401581070"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Just to clarify, I'm not really a fan of Mark Jackson as a coach. I'm glad he was let go, and I think it was best for both him and the organization to part ways. But I'm starting to think that Woj has some sort of beef with Mark Jackson. This is from a [story](http://thedissnba.com/2014/03/26/goddammit-another-warriors-controversy-explainer/) that a blogger wrote towards the end of March, after Woj broke the story about Mark Jackson forcing the reassignment of Brian Salabrine to the D League Warriors.

&gt;The circumstantial evidence—and to be quite clear, this is speculation—points to the leak coming from somebody on the Warriors assistant coaching staff, likely second assistant Darren Erman, whom Wojnarowski has a longtime relationship with. Wojnarowski met Erman ten years ago while he was writing about the St. Anthony’s High School basketball team, where Erman was an assistant coach. He wrote very highly of Erman in the book, has written highly of Erman in the past, and broke the stories of Erman being hired and promoted by the Warriors. Scalabrine himself is also a possibility. Wojnarowski was very complimentary of the late aughts Boston Celtics teams that Scalabrine was a part of (and that Darren Erman was an assistant coach on), wrote a piece on Scalabrine retiring—not something he does for every NBA role player—and has broken multiple pieces of Scalabrine news. We already know Scalabrine has Wojnarowski’s phone number! 
&gt;
&gt;On the surface, the gain for Darren Erman and/or Brian Scalabrine is clear. Erman is the Warriors hot coaching prospect (lead assistant Pete Myers isn’t really seen as head coaching material), but it is more difficult to raise his profile under Jackson’s strict media rules. Certainly Erman would be a candidate for an open head coaching position, were one to open. Assuming Scalabrine knew he was going to be demoted, leaking tales of dysfunction gives the impression that Jackson doesn’t know what he is doing, rather than the impression that Scalabrine is a bad assistant coach. Perhaps more important than the precise identity of the leaker though is the fact that things have devolved to the point of anonymous leaks and mud-slinging.

So Woj apparently has a connection with Daren Erman, who also was fired a few weeks after this story was published. Considering everything that's unfolded since then, i.e. Jackson saying his only mistake as a coach was hiring Erman/Scalabrine, that probably didn't sit well with Woj. On May 3rd, shortly after the Warriors lost to the Clippers in the playoffs, Woj tweeted:

&gt;Mark Jackson doesn't have one GSW front office ally who'll make a case to ownership to keep him. ""He's on an island,"" league source says.

I know Woj was just doing his job as a reporter, but you can tell just from the tone/phrasing of that tweet that he probably doesn't think too positively of MJax... and obviously the tweet from this morning doesn't state names, but from an outsider's perspective it kind of does seem like a shot at Jackson. Anyway, like I said, I agree with the decision to let Mark Jackson go, but I think there may be some things we don't know about going on between Woj and Mark Jackson.","1401581072"

This is relatively simple (and taught in most basic drawing courses (HS or college)). Basically, you stare at an item (I always used my hand (off hand)) and essentially ""trace"" around the edges of that object using your pencil. As your eye moves around the edges of the object, so, too, does the pencil. The trick, is not to look at the paper at all. In college we actually took the previous page of our sketchbook and flipped it over our drawing hand to discourage looking. 

This activity is a lot of fun and promotes concentration and line quality. One of the other rules that I was taught was to NEVER take your pencil off the page. The point being that every line should be used and no mistake is ""bad.""

I've used this technique to combat drawing-blocks and boredom.

"news","t5_2qh3l","So what *you're* saying is that everyone who benefits from trigger warnings doesn't have ""real PTSD"", is that it?

It sounds like you think people who have PTSD flashbacks from reading certain things, don't *really* have PTSD, and I'm wondering how you came to that conclusion.  Is it really so outside your mental capabilities to imagine that someone who was abused as a child might have a PTSD episode from reading about other instances of child abuse?

I'll say it again, *You don't get to choose how you're affected by trauma*.  Some people get lucky and aren't easily triggered.  Some people aren't so lucky, and the rest of their lives are profoundly affected by it.

Who the hell are you to say one person's suffering is less legitimate than another's?","1401581073"

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Seriously, if you're having intractable health or skin problems, it's worth getting tested for common deficiencies. I have other health issues that led me to develop iron-deficiency anemia recently. It did change my skin in that I went from pale to ghostly and had some of the corner-of-mouth cracks that can indicate iron deficiency. I also have constant headaches, fatigue, and so on. I'm getting a series of intravenous iron infusions now and can expect to feel a lot better in a few weeks.

That said, ***do not decide that you have a deficiency without talking to a doctor, and DO NOT TAKE AN IRON SUPPLEMENT WITHOUT CONSULTING A DOCTOR.*** Not even a ""low dose"" one. Your body has no way to dispose of excess iron and there are serious long- and short-term health consequences of excess iron. If you're menstruating, iron deficiency is much more likely than excess, but excess *is still a risk.* Excesses of other vitamins and minerals can cause problems as well.","1401581076"

It's possible for them to have raised a tiny fraction of their full budget and still have enough to finish the second half without issue.

Also, the number of people who I've seen indicate that they're waiting for the second half before they pick the game up indicates that they can expect a significant number of sales once it's released.

And regarding the number of projects they have going at once, that's because they've determined that they're more successful doing multiple small projects than putting their eggs in one basket. Considering the number of people working at Double Fine I'd actually be concerned if they only had one project going at a time, because there's no way they'd be able to keep the entire team busy at once.

Provide examples of healthy sexual behaviors, healthy relationship behaviors.  Provide examples of problematic relationship behaviors and problematic sexual behaviors.

We could make it so that the rules which are currently in place become obsolete because young adults engage in sexual relationships in ways that do not allow for any of the current problems we are faced with today.","1401581086"

 Every time there is a thread about getting rid of players, people mention Young, Nani and Valencia to be sold (can't remember seeing Zaha that much). 

But there is usually a counter argument for Valencia (for the other two, not so much), that's why I said half of the sub (even though that's probably not true). He's still mentioned very often, though, which is what I was getting at.

People here have such a short-term memory when it comes to some things. He was our best player 2 seasons ago, why couldn't he be again next season? He'll be 29, which is still a very productive age. 

Also, it's not like we can sell half of the squad in one window. People expecting total overhaul (usually about 5-8 players out) are out of their minds.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","The people looking to do the solar roadways thing responded to this method, stating that the whole point is to take the money currently allotted for building and maintaining roads, and placing that in solar roadways instead. With the roof structure, you're now paying to make roofs along every major highway and road *along with* the cost of maintaining the existing asphalt and concrete and what have you. 

Add to this the potential safety concerns of load bearing (what with snow and rain) and cars potentially colliding with the metal banisters needed to hold these up, and it just doesn't work. 

Don't get me wrong, I have no clue if the roadways idea would work but I'm also not sure why there's such a backlash... These people have been working on this for quite a while now, and half of the issues that people have brought up have already been addressed by them, as well as an explanation of why they're taking the route they are.

I just think it's strange that people assume their criticisms--legitimate though they may be--haven't already been considered by the engineers and people (that obviously aren't that stupid to have developed this) that are working on the concept. ","1401581093"

Look at your rural communities in the midwest, upper midwest (MN so forth), and the south.  Those low population communities are usually where the jobs are to be found. Imo it's awesome because of the low cost of living, low crime, and other factors.  Also, be prepared to take any job you can find. Once you get that initial experience, doors start opening.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Regular drug tests for dole recipients, because that's not going to coast more money than it will save.  Refusing drug tests or failing drug tests if looking for work, that's going to mean they stay on the dole AND get penalised.  Making them pay it back?  Yeah, that's not going to make someone in desperate financial situations just that little bit more frantic.

  If this is a move to try and get people off the dole and in to the work force, then it's a shit idea. And it's such an obviously shit idea to anyone not Neo-Liberal.  If it was so easy to find employment people on the dole wouldn't be on the damn dole!  If someone has a serious drug problem 30 days is jack shit in regards to the time it takes to get straightened out.  Then there's false-positives, ways to cheat tests, typical centrelink bureaucracy which is murky even at the best of times, and a whole bunch of other problems I'm sure more creative people can think of.

I made homemade sushi the other day - cost of all ingredients $35 and I ended up with enough to make some for myself and four other friends.

I have a friend who bought a mini pizza oven and makes pizza about once a week - and the good stuff too, with spinach, goat cheese, good pepperonis, always good ingredients. He says a pizza cost him about $10 to make and they are big enough to feed him and his wife.

I eat meat about two or three times a week and the rest of my meals are usually salads, pasta with sauce, soups, and whichever leftover I may have.

I haven't specifically tried to save money cooking for myself. I usually end up buying some high end ingredients and I have an entire cabinet filled with ingredients: spices, vinegars, oils, pasta, rice, flour, sugar, quinoa, honey, cornstarch, vanilla extract, food coloring, chicken stock, etc.

I usually buy a lot of meat whenever it's on sale and freeze it. That helps offset the cost of meat.

As far as Lady and Nymeria not being with Sansa and Arya, it's probably like they are truly alone in the world, without their family to unconditionally love and protect them.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Having having done a combo of 200 ug lsd, 200 mg mdma, 14 mg 2c-b, and potentiated it with 2,400 mg piracetam, yes it is intense and crazy. I took the mdma 5 hours in and the 2c-b 7 hours in. I'm finally ready to talk about it after a month later cause it was so nuts and I didn't really remember much after the trip. I didn't remember much except for some key memories which still stick with me. It is my strongest drug experience I won't do for awhile. It was most likely the piracetam (a brain vitamin) that made everything so intense. Here's my timeline: I was tripping within 20 minutes after doing 200 ug lsd and 2,400 mg piracetam and pulses of the ground were rippling within an hour in. The reason why I say its intense is because when my peak hit 4 hours later, the entire room was changing sizes. If I became scared, the room would literally start collapsing. When my girlfriend came over, the room turned pinkish and looked romantic with hearts and the lines of the walls were rippling. I saw things I never have seen before on an acid trip such as flowers without colors blooming from the lights (it was like a stencil of flowers blooming and they brought me to tears). I didn't think I could handle taking the mdma after hour 5 of this, but I did and I'm glad cause it pushed the trip into a great light. If anyone tries this, be warned. It is intense and unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Fun memory though.

"science","t5_mouw","NASA actually quantified that for their rocket-building bits a few years back. They ran a study of how much SpaceX F9 would have cost NASA to develop through first flight under standard NASA launch-vehicle development procedures, using a standard NASA project cost estimating model. Their answer was $3.977 billion.

SpaceX's actual costs for F9 through first flight were $300 million. Add on the $90 million they spent on F1 because a lot of that work applied directly to F9, and actual F9 cost was $390 million - 1/10th NASA's estimate for F9 done the same old NASA way.

Worse, GAO around that same time released a report on a half-dozen recent major NASA projects. The average actual major NASA project cost was about 50% higher than NASA's initial project estimate. So, for MSFC doing a major launcher development, as of 2011 we're talking a 15X multiplier over the commercial equivalent.

If they kept their unity, banned the use of Russian, destroyed all Soviet symbols, created a nationalist government, didn't allow the oligarchs to gain power, they would now be a near-developed OECD country.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","I wouldn't call what our government provides ""basic"". So few people have private insurance, there's little incentive for private insurers to really compete (in Australia, you're penalised if you earn over a certain level and don't have your own insurance). 

There's also no rebate or whatever if you do have private insurance, and I'd like there to be. 

Ideally the government level of health insurance would be extremely basic, kind of like the benefit in relation to the minimum wage. It'll get you through, but it won't be fun. If we're trying to encourage people to use private insurers then we need people to have a reason to want to, and what the government presently offers is far too comprehensive for that.

&gt;Although honestly, by your standards NZ is already a big nanny state, what with the already existing nutrition campaigns, the smokefree 2025 campaign, etc.

Yes, it is. The government has no role in advocating shit like ""smokefree 2025"". I don't really know what nutrition campaigns you mean, but basically anything outside of the school, doctor's office, and social work kinds of environments is going too far, IMO.","1401581111"

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Adama had been making pretty good progress for a while and I was starting to feel pretty optimistic but today we had two bad events. The first was we encountered a chow with a lion cut on our walk (body shaved, full head of hair). He's been kind of weirded out by these dogs before, maybe because they look like they have giant heads. I'm not sure. When I saw the dog, I turned him around to walk the other way. Maybe we were 15-20 feet and I let him look back. My mistake b/c then he lunged and snarled in a scary way. I was able to turn him around and get more distance quickly and he calmed down immediately but it was still very bad in the moment. I hadn't had him do the bark snarl in a few weeks. 

Soon after we encountered a medium dog of about 40 lbs that I don't think he would normally care about. But he snarled and barked at this dog too. I guess he was still riled up and there just wasn't enough space for me to get some distance quickly. Plus, even though I was clearly taking Adama to the side to do some click-treating, the woman let her dog approach mine. Most people normally get it and are respectful but for some reason this woman didn't.

Both events really upset me though b/c I'd been starting to think we were making more progress and I hate when he gets to practice bad behaviors. ","1401581114"

A few things to keep in mind:

* Try to only have one per project. Some projects like Cargo have a `CargoCliError ` and `CargoError`. This allows to have user facing errors that you can always display, and internal errors.
* It doesn't matter what the result returns as it's error type (string, int, bool, struct, etc...), you'll have to convert it if the calling function isn't the same.

The standard library only has an `IoError` and `IoResult` that you would need to convert.

On the other hand, perhaps you could make the argument that converting between error types is better because you would always have a base error type that you're working with.","1401581122"

I don't think dangerous things should be banned. I'm saying that if you're going to build a building, you'd *want* to use the thing that's 100% safe for 100% of the people 100% of the time.

I'm saying there's only like two of these things on the planet because THEY SUCK. Any device, like a conventional elevator, that couldn't hurt you if you were trying to get hurt is an outrageously fantastic device. Plus it's one that nobody has any problems with anyway!

They are perfectly recognizable terms to anyone with any sort of basic understanding of fluid dynamics or airflow management. Which tells you just how little clue remains these days. PC building is not easier, it is just as hard. Fools convince themselves because they can throw parts in a box, they're somehow master builders or it's somehow easy to do it right. Which could not possibly be further from the truth.

But, I digress from the point which is: if you don't like learning the right terms, you have no business building anything. Technology is about learning. So you can learn from a guy who's been building legitimate world-class systems for *twenty five years* or you can prove his broad generalizations correct. 

*ANYHOW*, since I'm here to address the actual question and may as well get my teach on...

Because of the way the H440 and X60 are set up, it's always preferenced toward a push-forced because of the fin pitch of the radiator and tendency of the H440 to be fairly neutral trending toward positive. Sole suction is always going to perform worse with tight pitch radiators unless you get actual high static pressure fans or a shitton of CFM. Physics: not just a suggestion. Force-Suction sandwich works because the force layer creates pressure; the best performing Force-Suction is always extreme pressure force layer, all flow no-pressure suction layer. 

""But the FX140LB is high static pressure!"" No. The FX140LB is a whopping 27 Pascals. High static pressure is the god of 140's, the [Sunon PFE0381BX](http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Sunon%20PDFs/PFE0381BX-000U-S99_Spec.pdf) - 510 Pascals at 40 watts and 70dBA. Those aren't typos. It is literally 18.8 times the static pressure and because dBA is *logarithmic* it is somewhere north of 10 times louder. (30 times louder if I did my math right, but I don't trust it.) And no, the Sunon PFE will not fit an H-series. The FX140LB makes the trade off between high numbers and not killing your hearing.

ANYHOW. Will suction work? Yes, in a fashion. The X60's radiator is big enough that I have entirely accidentally kept a 135W LGA2011 below 60C for a while with *no fans at all* in free air. (Kids, don't try that at home!) ""Working"" is entirely different from ""working correctly."" It won't kill the CPU - Asetek does think of things like that in advance - but it's not going to perform anywhere near as well. They are also well aware of this; every 120mm system they OEM (R9 295X, Corsair, etcetera) defaults to or specifies to use push or push-pull for a reason. Plus, you know, [amateur testing backs it up some more](http://martinsliquidlab.org/2012/01/15/radiator-shroud-testing-v2/3/). 

Getting the hard numbers for the loss is, well, hard. How hard? [This is a rough starting point](http://www.tlv.com/global/TI/calculator/air-flow-rate-through-orifice.html). It's so complicated and difficult that I have no trouble saying I am *not qualified*. Which is exactly why in the past I hired an engineering firm to explain it to me and do all the modeling and math! And show me exactly why 750Pa of suction per radiator would perform significantly worse than 675Pa of forced air. Your PC is nowhere near the scale of that setup (6KW+ semi-open), but the physics are the same.

**TL;DR: Forced push will always be the best performing single layer configuration because physics. If you want to disprove, hire an engineering firm to get the numbers yourself.**

Also, thanks for reminding me that I really wanna do a ducted remote blower fed X60 build. Somebody bring me SanAce B76's and a welder. :P","1401581128"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Eyh guys,

Hyrqbot has been playing with this teams since several months. They already played together for 2 french lan and played two times against ""worth it"" in the final, they won the first and lost the second.

This team, is not a serious team, the real name of the tean is : Hdmix. It's 5 french players, all good that don't want to commit full time as a player.

Doigby is a caster and streamer for Millenium, once the top laner of their team, i don't think he will go into the competitive scene again, and can benefit more from streaming.

Shaunz, is still a student, in his last year of engineering school, he thinks about going full time after he gratuated but not before. He was also one of the two pro players with chips &amp; noi at the zenith for all star along hyrqbot.

Nono and shlaya, i've doubt about their future since they never stated anything about it or i've missed it.

Hyrqbot, never talked about playing again, he's currently at the head of a league of legends website that works pretty well. As said in other comment, he has eyes problems, and can't play for too long. 

This team, is a fun team, they are all competitive player and as such want to win, and train for it. But they are not commiting full time.
They can easily apply for a top 2 in every french lan, even if they don't commit entirely to the competition.  In two months they already earn several thousand of €, and maybe they will try to reach the next coke league, but i really don't see them aim for the lcs.

If you want to get a grasp about the mindset of this team, the following photo, taken during the biggest french lan 'Gamers Assembly', will probably help you. (they finished second)

The fit is according to the measurements included in the item description, so measure up and then decide what size you want.

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","1. Do the absolute best I can in my professional life. Negotiate salary, stay late, nose to the grind stone. I CAN be one more successful professional woman and I CAN be an example to younger girls (hopefully if I have daughters) and boys that girls can do anything.

2. Ban inter-female competition. I use [this article](http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/05/shine-theory-how-to-stop-female-competition.html) as a guide when I lose my way. End the girl-on-girl policing/sabotaging

3. Call out sexism where I see it and disassociate from consistent/vehement offenders. 

4. Get my ass out to the polls and vote for feminists. I also vote for them in the companies I own stock in. (Warning: beware of Michelle Bachmann and other women who are enemies of women's rights, for whatever reason- research each candidate!).

5. Pay attention to intersectional issues (race, age, able-bodiedness, other genders, class, etc.). These are important and this is the biggest change in my feminism of late. I'm white and upper-middle class so I was poorly educated in these issues. I read about this kind of stuff the most on Reddit, since my daily exposure to some of these walks of life is low (to my knowledge- i.e. I don't think I know very many disabled people but some disabilities are invisible).

6. Support woman-owned, minority-owned and other businesses owned by the disenfranchised. Your dollar is your vote, people.

All anyone can do is their best. I might not be able to make some huge sweeping kind of change in the world, but my corner of it can be what I want it to be. Internet activism is great but walking the walk in all the little things is important too.

You say that things in league have minimal cast times and that makes league harder to play, but dota is just the same. Things like blink dagger into black hole (using the example you gave) is almost instant. If you're against that, you're entirely aware of that threat and you play accordingly. The number of backholes that completely dictate if a team fight is own or lost in pro games in the recent months could be counted on one hand. The truth is, those big play spells that are devastating are actually very difficult to pull off because of the caliber of players playing. Most team fights are fought much like league. With mostly individual spells, and are dictated not by 2 button presses, but the movement and position play. ","1401581145"

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/dozybolox13-1407/hero/48441221

My spec is close to yours. I can fly through rifts on T1-T2 right now.

Basically what my spec allows me to do is stand still and spam electrocute and frozen orb. If I need a quick out I can teleport out and spam from a distance.

I only just got back into the game so my gear isn't too great.  Basically I just ran bounties for a while and got a fat stack of rift fragments for when my gear was decent. I'd say you should rum bounties on normal for a while and then run rifts on normal. I basically went straight to T1. I didn't see the point of doing any difficulties in between normal and torment as the rewards didn't outweigh longer run times. To test that I was ready for torment, I jumped into doing bounties on T1. Once I completed a set on torment I knew I was ready. However, keep running bounties on normal as the point of them is for the rift fragments.

He killed countless skunks and squirrells and even attacked another dog once. He went straight for the neck and bit a huge gash in this 35lb beagle. We paid the vet bill and everything but I felt terrible. I couldn't hold him back. But if he was out on the chain out back and a dog walked through our yard, he wouldn't give two shits. He only attacked if we were with him. Complete protect mode. Very good, obedient dog but he definitely had to be kept away from other animals while out with him. He loved his walks but always with a muzzle and we had to use one of those horrible choke collars. It was the only way to hold him back if he lunged.

It's actually mostly in the forearms and wrists with a quick hit with a squeeze/twist (tenouchi) at the end. I'm assuming you don't mind a few bruises that sting a little (like paintball).

Strength is less important, you want speed and footwork, distancing, good technique and above all cardio. You're not actually cutting through anybody with a bamboo blade. If you hit people too hard like you're swinging an axe and break a bone/give them a concussion I can pretty much guarantee you'll get hazed by people who have been doing it for longer.","1401581147"

You're situation sounds pretty reasonable honestly, and I'd give you no reason to not go through with it, simply because you know she wants more and you don't.

The thing with my ex, was we had talked about marriage more times than I can possibly count, and our kids names, and just everything, haha. We were closer than close, like with each other every day ( which I think was some of the problem ). The reason I have such a hard time comprehending  what happened with him, is the fact that there were no indicators that I could possibly pinpoint, and it's been almost three months since the breakup. I would have probably realized or seen some signs by now, or have remembered something. Unfortunately, I can't.

However, when we broke up, we had a fight, and then he wouldn't talk to me for a day, and then the next day, he decided he didn't love me anymore, or wanted to be with me anymore. It was heart breaking to say the least, but it didn't seem as planned out at all as yours, which is ten times more reasonable.

But if you do, let me know how it goes. And for the love of god, please be civil towards her. Mine was. For the first two weeks then after that, he wanted nothing to do with me. You don't have to talk to her after, but if you do, don't be heartless. Good luck. :)","1401581147"

"firefox","t5_2qh4p","That's a silly comparison. The functionality of NoScript was never in the browser. Incredibly basic customisation options like being able to resize the toolbar icons or move whatever buttons you like were. For over a decade in fact, including when Firefox was at the apex of its popularity. But now they're too complex and confusing and need to be locked down to stop the idiot userbase hurting itself? Horseplop.

The whole Australis mess is nothing more than a panicky attempt to win some users back from Chrome, by making Firefox look and behave like it (i.e. near-zero customisation). But it won't work, because Firefox will never be called Google Firefox, and that's all the mainstream users are really interested in. Perhaps the current... people running the hapless UX team will realise that when the userbase continues to slide and undo the mess they've made.

* Use hand sanitizer, then some TP with a little water to rinse off your ""tipping"" finger and the cup in your palm that you rub them. *do not* get the hand sanitizer with lotion. That same TP can be used later for... well, whatever.

* I use a multipurpose wash/soak solution. If they're not too grimy, you can reuse the stuff in the case for a day or two, with some fresh squirts of new stuff in it.

* Contacts come in individual blister packs. Now, while I haven't done this, it makes sense that they individual packs can all be broken down into a few smaller cases, each holding multiple contacts. You'll likely need to use a softer saline solution. Someday I'll talk to an eye doctor and get a recommendation on that.

A good chunk of the books seem to do no more than describe, in a very unadorned and raw style, the prosaic happenings of Knausgaard's life. He'll spend a couple pages just making coffee or boiling potatoes or wandering the streets of Stockholm, which really should not be interesting but somehow is. I have no idea why it should be interesting, but it is. 

What's somewhat less mysterious to me is the appeal of the essays and polemics interspersed throughout the books. Knausgaard is sorta like the anti-DFW, in that he doesn't seem to give a fuck about rhetorical high jinks or the idea that there is a ""reader"" in need of ""persuasion"" (though no doubt this could be seen itself as a rhetorical strategy). Like his prose it's all very raw. And the appeal is that he can be serious and unironic without verging on the sentimental, or in fact coming anywhere near it, which nowadays seems incredibly rare.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Absolutely true, and is suggesting not to fight for a federal law on gay marriage, with the next election they might actually could pass. In fact DOMA has been passed before, think big picture here.

And *his* big picture is that he would support a national ban on gay marriage if they had the votes. I'm not the one trying to spin this to make Rand look good.

&gt;Which if they above quote is true won't mean they'll win, it will mean they'll lose short term. 25-30 years? LOL This is a game, pay attention.

The ""debate"" is the national ban. He is saying wait and in just 20 or so years they can get that national ban back.

&gt;Evangelicals in the Republican party make up a good 15% and have a death grip on party functions, it's political suicide to piss them off.

They were 40% of Ronmey's vote. To a first approximation they are the party. 

Now what makes you so sure he is lying to them? He is an evangelical Christian and does oppose gay marriage. 

&gt;This is carefully crafted lie.

By that you mean it was the truth.

&gt;Saying he did nto tell ""them"" that, of fucking course not, who the fuck would tell evangelists that.

A man who actually wanted to get rid of marriage laws. A man who held that view rather than  expressing platitude to get the libertarian vote. The carefully crafted lie is that he actually opposes marriage laws.

&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/03/13/rand_paul_on_gay_marriage_if_we_make_the_tax_code_neutral_we_don_t_have.html

I can't tell if that is ignorance on his part or what. The tax rates is a tiny part of marriage law, the federal tax laws are a tiny part. If he knows about the rest (as any married person would) then he is playing for the audience. If he is ignorant then that much worse.

For jobs, the State of California is one of our biggest local employers.  The pay is below what you'll get in private sector on average (with some exceptions) but the benefits are good and the work is steady and often less stressful than private.  It's a pain in the ass to get picked up by the state, but if you'd like some help navigating you can PM me or one of several others here who know the system fairly well.  

Good luck, fellow nerd!  We just had a pretty good sized comic book convention here, and our anime convention has grown rather large, so there are plenty of like minded souls.  Great Escape Games, one of our local game stores, has RPG groups looking for people if you're willing to brave that often traumatic experience.  :)","1401581157"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","World of War craft is an awesome option for getting into MMOs.

I've played it off and on since launch, and here's why you should:


1. Playerbase: wildstar just launched and will no doubt be crowded and have a strong player base, for now, but like every mmo chasing WoW, there have been none thst have survived a healthy population 6 months to a year after their release, some flopping even after just 3 months. 

Wow has a huge player base and it's still a subscribe or don't play game (not counting the play for free to level 20 starter edition)

And if your servers population is low and isn't pending a merge in wow, it doesn't even matter because everything is done across realms, seriously, you can do anything.


2. Content: my guild I belonged to for the last 2 years finally quit our primary game (the old republic) because we were tired of shitty content release time tables, lack of content, and the F2P plague of making everything possible cost you more money than a subscription. 

Wow has excellent content for EVERY player skill level, it's ok if you aren't a top tier difficulty elitist like me, there are still many newbie friendly options for less seasoned players.


3. Friends: when you find out you have a friend who plays your favorite mmo, there's nothing worse than having to flip a coin to decide who pays the money to server transfer, or worse start from scartch.

World of war craft completely did away with this issue, add your friend to your account friend list, invite them to your party and you can go right into questing or just standing in a pub together no matter what server you each belong to! ( faction still matters though)

4. Future Xpac:

By biggest hesitation for buying wildstar is this, today's gamer population is much different than those that brought MMOs into mainstream gaming, the kids who were playing on their parents systems back in 2000 are adults with jobs now. Or even families, and I sure as hell don't have 6 hours to play every day and only a 1 in 40 of my gamer friends do. 

Blizzard has done SO well because they recognize their audience, a lot of wow haters call it dumbing down for kiddies, but it's really smart marketing by making enjoyable experiences with just 1 to 2 hour play times.

They are further reducing your time commitment in the new expansion by making it so that your armor and items will transform their stats to what type of play you are doing, such as healing or tanking or dps. This is groundbreaking for MMOS and as a parent and business owner, I'm damn happy for it.

I believe you also get a free (currently) max level character in game if you preorder the new expansion right (maybe it's not even preorder it might be if you just buy it even after release) 

This is awesome because while people in game are sometimes dick to boosted characters, they ignore the fact that this allows new players to get in and have fun right away, I loved Ever quest 2 but I was the only person I knew playing it so I stopped to play other games, when I came back to it there was some 80 levels of SERIOUS grinding I had to do, plus alternate advancement points to catch up on before I could even begin to be considered competent, this has killed every attempt I've made to return to EQ2, and I LOVE that world!

You will probably get a lot of hate responses to your question about Wow, but the fact that their player base is what it is, and they have WAY more populated servers versus any other mmo (not counting wildstar as it just launched) and is entirely subscription based means Blizzard is doing something right no one else is.","1401581158"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""I would always see it. The stranger. The being. The foul demon who stalked my every waking hour, always following, just out of view. The first time I saw it I thought I was just imagining things, I hadn't slept enough or I was stressed from work. I tried to rationalise this figure I saw over my shoulder. Like any sane person would I suppose. I remember it was a Saturday, early afternoon, and I went to the bathroom to straighten myself out before I went out. I glanced at the mirror that conceals the medicine cabinet and there it was. Just standing and watching. When I turned around there was nothing and when I looked back into the mirror, well, I thought I'd lost my damn mind, there was nothing. I figured those things happen though; people think they see things all the time, it's just those micro-naps or whatever isn't it? You know, when we're tired and we fall asleep without knowing? Something like that anyway"" 

""Yes, curious a phenomenon isn't it?"" The doctor's voice was one of learned wisdom, his every word a culmination of years of education. Yet he spoke with a soft warmth, his beard seemingly a filter for aggression, as if no single unkind word could escape past it. The grey bristles surrounding his mouth and jawline were flecked with black, a sign of a youth now fading. It wrapped the man's face and framed it, linking with his equally monochromatic hair, kept closely in check. His kindly brown eyes flashed an ethereal gold in the sepia sunlight that flooded the room. ""So tell me then, what of the next time you saw this man?"" 

""Creature"" 

""Ah, creature, my apologies""

""The second time was much like the first, but at work this time. It was some time later, I don't know - maybe a week, possibly two? I left my desk to go to the toilet and as I washed my hands I saw something, or someone, in the mirror, behind me. I looked around but there was nothing. I blamed sleep loss and stress again and got on with my day, albeit slightly spooked. It carried on like this for a month or so, just glimpses in the mirror but nothing more. Then they started becoming more frequent. It'd be every day instead of every week!""

""So this demon of yours, is it only mirrors in which you see it?"" The word demon sounded out of place in this man's mouth. He sat comfortably in an antique armchair, it's dark wood frame accenting the red velour upholstery. The decoratively carved hand rests gave a grandiose air to the seat, almost giving the owner a supernatural command of attention. The doctor in his regal chair sat a few metres from the reclined sofa, which in turn sat centrally in the room lined with bookshelves. Hefty leather-bound tomes, with undoubtedly great educational potential, adorned the shelves, rising from decoratively plastered ceiling, to the thickly carpeted floor.

""Initially yes. I only caught glimpses in mirrors, for a while but eventually it seemed to escape the mirror. I'd see it from the corner of my eye, just a black blur of a figure materialising and vanishing like a cruel joke. Not long after it's appearance in the real world it appeared in every mirror. I had to stop driving because when I looked in the rear-view mirror, it'd be there, sitting in my back seat. Smiling""

""It has a face? I thought it was not a person?""

""It isn't. It's a demon in the shape of a man. I could never see it clearly, it wouldn't stay for that long, but I saw it's smile. An ungodly baring of thousands of yellowed-pearl needles. It's larger than a human mouth, probably about up to the bottom of your eyes. Then the eyes. Oh god the eyes. I saw them once, not for long but I didn't need long to see the evil in them. Even with all of this I could never really 'see' this thing though, only ever glimpse it's presence. It was always a blur""

""Perhaps..."" the doctor interjected, ""perhaps we might try 'summoning' this creature, so to speak?""

""Wh... What? No, I... I just...""

""Please, this could be important to finding a cure to your affliction""

""If we must""

""Very well then"" the doctor strode to one corner of the room where a sheet of cloth covered a mirror haphazardly. The ornamental notches and waves of the dark wooden frame fit the aesthetic of the room to a tee. The two positioned themselves in front of the mirror; the doctor to the right of it, his patient facing it with their head pointed firmly at their own feet.

""Here we go"" he said as he drew back the cloth and allowed it to fall to the ground. He returned to his place behind the patient, so he could observe the mirror also. The patient let out a deep, rolling, breath and slowly tilted her head upwards. She followed her body upwards, before arriving at her face, and locked her stare into her own eyes. ""Is it there? Do you see the demon?"" The warmth in the doctor's voice had gone. She allowed her eyes to drift to meet the doctor's but instead of his kind brown eyes she found a milky yellow glare which chilled her very soul. The once gentle man behind her was now a creature of pure malice, flickering a grainy black, like static. It's yellowed needle teeth clattered as it laughed.","1401581160"

I have no problem against having fun, don't get me wrong, I just don't enjoy myself playing again someone who's not playing to win. I'd much rather walk away from a table with a loss after a great game where I learned something than a get a free win off a guy playing cyclopes tribal in standard that has to read all his cards.

And I don't think my attitude is particularity rare when it comes to MTG. So you can see how having these indifferent people in a meta can be frustrating to people who share my attitudes towards the game.

It also comes into play for events such as pre-releases or drafts where these casual players do not understand the interactions between cards. I do my very best to try not to ""rules shark"" people, but it's sometimes unavoidable when a player does not understand something. An example of this came up a few weeks ago when I was in the finals of a draft. My opponent was a little off tilt and was missing some constellation triggers. I think the pressure was getting to him as a dozen or so people were watching us. The first time he forgot it and didn't remember for the rest of the turn I believe, the 2nt time he drew a card, went to his attack phase, and I declared blockers. Then he tried to use his trigger from constellation. I cannot remember what card it was at this moment, sorry for that. Anyways he asks me if it's ok to use the ability. I said no which I think was perfectly fine to do. He proceeded to get mad at me and say he thought we were just having a ""fun friendly game"" of magic. Well that is true, I also try my best to hold myself to the highest standards with respects to interactions. Naturally I don't think it's unfair to expect the same from my opponents. This little interaction between us made for a very uncomfortable situation and I haven't seen the guy back at the shop since which is a shame for him as well as our meta.","1401581161"

First, the problem for the republicans is the women's vote. [\(the numbers\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/26vi83/hillary_clintons_benghazi_chapter_i_will_not_be_a/chvfbvx)

Secondly, he's not doing well in Florida polling against Hillary. (I really believe that Florida has moved from 'swing' to 'blue' for a number of reasons)

Third of course, is that last name. I think it's too soon.  I also think people vote on pocketbook issues, and running a Bush against a Clinton sets up the argument:

Bush 1, recession.  Bush 2, recession.  Clinton: probably the best times economically that most Americans can remember. And for her, it's not just a last name - Bill Clinton will be in the White House, at her side, advising her. She can point to Clinton's job creation, booming economy, falling deficit. ""I was by Bill's side through it all.  We knew how to create jobs.  We knew how to lower the deficit.""

Otherwise, I agree with you, at this point he's probably their best and most likely candidate, although, running the most centrist candidate *for the third election in a row* is going to leave them with an enthusiasm gap.","1401581162"

Or, there could've been some other trigger. Clearly since she's alive, didn't murder Capt. Picard, or James Marsden and everything's hunky dory, she was better equipped to control her powers when she did go all Phoenix in this timeline. So something was very obviously different about how it all went down. There is no reason to assume the second movie played out as it did, yet she just woke up in the bottom of the lake in a better mood, that makes no sense. The entire timeline changed, Professor X is different than he was in the original timeline, he's more enlightened, he specifically saw that Wolverine would have to kill her after she killed everyone in sight. Which he never saw in the original timeline. He of course would handle her differently in the new movie timeline.

I really don't understand the logic here. Jean Grey is Phoenix. And clearly has a much, much better control of her powers in this new timeline than she did in the first 3 movies. That is how I took it, the entire ""Jean is the ultimate mutant"" (in the movies) idea was handled correctly and peacefully this time. Changing the timeline so that X2 never happened wouldn't make it so she could never become Phoenix. Nothing about that lake turned her into Phoenix, that couldn't have been accomplished some other way. As X2 does a good job of showing, she was starting to realize and come into her powers throughout the movie, even during peaceful times. The lake was just the catalyst at the time, not the unique and necessary catalyst. Seriously, I took her standing there as Phoenix to mean that Charles didn't make the epic fuck up of mishandling the world's most powerful mutant (in the movies) in the way he did, and everything turned out for the better. Don't forget that X3 made it fairly clear Professor's ineptitude was the cause for some of the disaster. He clearly didn't make the same mistakes again. That has nothing to do with X2.

Really though, there is not one hint that X2 had to happen as we saw on the screen.","1401581163"

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Hey guys,

I'm moving into a house soon, and am looking to set up a decent-quality entry-level speaker system. I'm planning on starting with two front floorstanding speakers and everything that goes along with that, and would like to leave room for upgrades (subwoofers, 5.1, etc). 

I'm totally new to speakers, so there's a lot I don't know, but for now my main goal is to figure out which front speakers I'm getting. My budget for both of those is around $800 at most preferably, $300-400 per speaker. 

My sound preference is also generally undeveloped for speakers, but for headphones, I tend to like a warm, Sennheiser-esque balanced sound; generally even lows, mids, and highs, though it's worth saying that I care more about mids than anything, tend to dislike too-bright highs, and care the least about the lows, though they are certainly important and not having to immediately buy a subwoofer would be awesome. My fear of bright highs and love of good mids pushed me away from the Klipsch F30, the top rated speaker on Newegg.

Wharfedale and Indiana Line are names I've heard so far that have floorstanding speakers in my price range, particularly Wharfedale's Diamond 10.6. I'm not sure what Indiana Line products fit my description; their website isn't very helpful in that regard.

So yeah, my question is pretty simple: where can I get the best bang for buck $300-400 each floorstanding speakers to start up my sound system?

Thanks so much guys!

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","Doge is dying a slow painful death, and honestly I am surprised it has not held up better, at least recently.  This started off a joke coin, and it took off, but that interest has waned.  I know this is a unpopular opinion on here, and I will probably be down voted, but maybe somebody will understand where I am coming from.

The view from this sub is basically no care about value.  The problem is, for a currency to mean anything, it has to have value, and it has to be relatively stable. About a month or so ago, I moved all my doge to bitcoin, and after that it began a very bad slide.  While bitcoin was currently down, I knew it would go up, at least a bit.  Now we are looking at ~$630 value on bitcoin.  When I bought in it was about $430.  My holdings are very low, so it means very little for me.

The way this coin is setup, it will fail.  You cannot introduce that much currency and expect it to have a high price.  Before when it was going up, it was doing so because the amount of coins in circulation was pretty low, but now massive amounts of doge coins continue to enter into the system at a fast rate.  There is no way it can hit $.10/coin let alone $1/coin.  What you are left with is a micro-currency, which if that is what everybody is happy with, then that is fine.  The fact is when Doge slides further down, and more coins continue to be released, its gonna go back to a ""joke"" currency.

You guys have fun tipping, and helping where you can, until the value becomes so low, it will become impossible to do anything good with it, besides maybe just making people smile.","1401581167"

There's a difference. While you may not like controller mappings for an FPS, they do actually work. They arent as good as using mouse and keyboard if you're a skilled player, but they get the job done. Nothing I've ever played indicates that the same is true of RTS controls.

 In an RTS when you need to select a unit or group, you need to do that pretty quickly and accurately or risk losing the map. Have you ever seen a real solution to that, on a console? If there is an example of that kind of game working on a console I'd be fascinated to see it.","1401581174"

Right, because they used perhaps stock footage or prop footage of people collecting glass. I highly doubt those two folks were collecting the glass that the Kickstarter company uses to make their prototypes. Maybe they will be stupid and use colored glass, maybe they won't. Either way, it's about a lack of information from the organization trying to make the solar roadways, it's not about actual bad science. 

""We don't know because there's nowhere near enough information"" seems like a much better response than ""from the tiny amount of information available, this is wrong"". Either way, that particular Kickstarter isn't getting any of my money. ","1401581177"

The time and effort that you have spent already should be treated as a sunk cost and simply a learning experience. drop all of that and go for a long walk or even a short holiday for a few days, just to think about what sorts of projects you could work on that would really excite you - make a list and bring to your adviser and say ""I was not enjoying my old work, so I wanted to start afresh"".

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","Manabolt is a bad example of a indirect spell, because its actually a direct spell.

Indirect spells do travel from the caster to the target and can be dodged.

Direct spells while it can look like its shooting to the target, it will always hit as long as the caster has line of sight. There is no dodge, only soak.

Indirect spells do force in damage + net hits with force in AP.

Direct spells deal net hits in damage only and are resisted with either will power or body, depending on the spell.

Manabolt is a direct spell. And is resisted(aka soaked) with Will.

Flamethrower is an indirect spell. It is dodged with int+rea and soaked with body+armor-force.

"speedrun","t5_2sf9e","FYI, here's the category list + their definitions:

Any% - complete the game. Skip any non-required missions (with a few exceptions). The only required missions to complete are the last mission of a Level and the last three missions of Level 7 (Alien Auto-Topsy Parts 1-3). Half the run consists of pausing and restarting, so Any% isn't a very exciting category in the ""things actually happening"" department. In terms of money, some costumes and cars are required throughout the run, which usually leaves the money route very tight with small room for error.

All Missions: much more appealing category than Any%. Completes all the main story missions without skipping any. This includes absolutely dreadful missions such as the armored truck and garbage missions in Level 5 and pretty much everything in Level 7. Lots of more opportunities to get money than in Any%. This run does not include the bonus missions. This category is roughly 30 minutes longer than Any%.

100%: complete the game and get EVERYTHING. This includes all main story missions, all bonus missions, all vehicles, all 49 collector cards, clearing all 21 street races (which end up giving you a vehicle once 3 are completed), activating all 140 level gags and all 140 Wasp Cameras. Routing for this category has been minimal since no one has attempted a serious run of this, as far as i know. A few runners have considered running this, but nothing has been said as far as i know. My estimate for 100% would probably be an hour and a half or so longer than All Missions.

3. Warns you when you leave your phone behind and acts as security when you're near your phone disabling pins/gesture passwords when you're within range of your device and re-enabling when you're away from your phone. Also it can ""find"" your phone by setting off a ringtone if in the vicinity. 
4. Can act as a TV remote when you can't find yours.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","I don't know why you're being downvoted because you're bringing up a legitimate problem, here.  

There are any number of reasons why we SHOULDN'T be doing this kind of thing, and education is only one of them.  You're right.  We're absolutely not taught in the standard paramedic curriculum, unless of our own accord, what improving lab values should look like and at what speed those values can be expected to improve.  Such as in the case of fighting an infection when doing a follow up on a sepsis patient, for example. That's a very real question that needs to be addressed.  

That's where the extra curriculum comes in.  The other commenter who states you're selling us short is right and wrong.  He's right because we are plenty smart and capable enough to be able to be taught these things and read information off a computer screen just like a doctor does.  He's wrong because the standard curriculum does not teach these things, not just any paramedic is appropriate for this profession, and unless every single paramedic who endeavors to undertake this ""Community Integrated Healthcare"" role humbles himself to the education and takes it seriously we will cause ourselves problems.

In regards to ""there must be an answer""- the entire reason this program is coming about on the EMS side is because of what I referred to earlier.  Hospitals and Docs under the current status quo have interests contrary to our own on the streets who, in my opinion, have much more altruistic motivations.  The fee for service model with individual item billing propagates a system that sees repeat patients, raises costs to the end user, and in general provides poor long term healthcare that is focused on treating acute events as opposed to encouraging long term wellness.  The government and insurance companies know this, are both changing rules to combat it, and EMS is and always has been the type of people to tell others they're sick of waiting and to just get it done themselves.  

It's like the show Emergency and even our founding fathers/mothers of Paramedicine said way back in the day-  is a Paramedic the right answer?  No. A doctor is.  Problem is- there aren't enough doctors, and even if there were there aren't enough of them willing to take the drastic pay cut to do it.  So you have a gap, and it is up to individuals like us in Paramedicine to improve our own standings and improve our own situation by capitalizing on filling that void.  

One of my fears in that regard, and in regards to what you've said about education is that our Paragods will burn us with overconfidence causing us irreparable damage to our credibility in the long term.  I don't lose sleep over it, but it's a small fear I have.  The fear I do lose sleep over is making sure this is driven from the ground up so that we make SURE, and I mean CRYSTAL clear sure that we demand a pay raise, we demand more respect, and we demand increased staffing levels in lieu of windfall profits from companies that are sure to implement these programs.    

Edit:  why don't you people down voting actually contribute to the conversation and provide a legitimate reason why any of this is not true?  OP is right, I'm a paramedic and when I have a medical issue I see a doctor for a reason.  Not the least of which is because I lack the diagnostic tools, education, and experience to deal with non emergency healthcare issues. Seriously, you don't agree with what I have to say as someone deeply embedded and researched in this topic but you don't stand on your own two feet and defend your stance?  If we don't wake up as medics on this issue the powers that be (Hospitals, Docs, EMS directors) will determine its direction and once again medics will stand by and play last fiddle to a system that is not in our interest.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It sounds like you've pinpointed the trouble spot - something's going wrong with whatever you're doing between the invite and the push for sex. A woman who responds to a text invite IS interested in you on some level, even if they could still go either way on whether they actually want to sleep with you.

- It's possible that you're approach to ""pushing for sex"" needs some re-evaluation or fine-tuning. Without knowing what it is you tend to do there, there's no way to know.
- It's possible that your place itself is a major turn-off. That's not always a huge deal, but if you live in a space that grosses women out, that might be a dealbreaker. If you don't even bother to pick up, that communicates that you don't think much of the woman.
- Based on some of your other posts, you may be overcommunicating (intentionally or unintentionally) that you're not interested in anything romantic. Many women still want there to be some romantic *aspects* to casual hookups, even if both parties understand that it's just a hookup.","1401581192"

No, I care about logic and facts.

&gt;We both know that if you thought this segment of the electorate was more likely to vote for Republicans you wouldn't give a crap what ""domicile"" they voted in.

How does this effect my argument? Even if we assume I am entirely hypocritical as you suggest, you haven't made any indication that what I said was *wrong*. All you've done is argued that I think it for the wrong reasons. But of course, that's irrelevant to the substance of the argument itself.

If anyone is ""desperate"", it's usually the individual who is forced to attack the person, rather than the idea. And you have surely not attacked the idea here, you've attacked me.  

Why is it that this is the first line of attack for you? Do you think it is an actual argument? Do you know it is not an actual argument, but only care about ""beating"" someone you disagree with? I'm honestly not sure which one of these is the better option here.

And we cannot ignore that evidence to uphold philosophies that aren't based in reality.

 I just assumed that the EverClear version of heroin probably should be prohibited in some way. Or maybe not. Maybe aggressively educating people and having warnings on the labels is good enough.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt; The claim with the wage gap is that women are paid N% or whatever for the same job and the same hours, but what isn't and can't be said is whether they're paid N% for the same level of output.

&gt;In other words, if hiring managers systematically believe that women just aren't as productive as men, then it would make perfect sense, even in a myopic economic framework, to see women paid less.

In most ""myopic economic frameworks"" (ie: all of the models you'll learn in a first year economics course), for almost all professions, any employee that meet the minimum requirements for a job is interchangeable with any other employee who meets those minimum requirements.

There would be a difference if we're talking about [piecework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_work), of course. But if we're doing piecework, your pay is already directly tied to some measurable unit of productivity.","1401581199"

"halifax","t5_2r77k","Again all of this info has been coming from my head. Maybe I should never have said 10 million when it was 9 however if the ridership decreased again in 2010 as it had every year for 8 years what makes you think the Ferry would not need more money to cover there costs? I wasn't in the room for the ask for the 2010 year but people were I have spoken to a few of them. The ask was impossible for them to achieve just as it had been in 2008 and 2009. They were 4 million off both years. 

That mill was always a good bet. It had brand new equipment in it and was something that was killed by the recession. As other mills closed around North America mill product demand went up and Stern is really good at what they do. Of course they drove a hard bargain they had to but it isn't the Yarmouth Ferry not by a long shot. 

It isn't a power subsidy. NSP has to sell so much power to maintain their lines. When power consumption goes down rates have to go up. I suggest you look at what happened when the Mill shut down for just a year.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/power-rates-will-spike-as-mill-closes-nsp-1.1123248

That mill actually operating means your power costs less. It is complicated I understand that but the fact is NSP needs those large power consumers or you and I pay more. 

&gt; Rene Gallant, NSP's vice-president of regulatory affairs, said losing a customer that large will mean higher rate increases than the company forecast a few months ago.  ""The loss of NewPage does change that calculation, and it would mean that on a percentage basis it's greater than 20 per cent over the next three years,"" he said Wednesday.

I never suggested you voted for the Liberals. I am saying you are repeating their spin that was reported for years in the media and if you look at any outside report is dead wrong. 

I understand the history of the Ferry. When I said it meant something to the people of this province I was more talking about those outside the Southshore. I understand why a direct money losing subsidy means something to them. I don't know what it means to everyone else in rural NS who fought for it. I can see how you would interpret it that way but maybe we both need to stop talking past one another. 

I am from the Valley, living in Halifax thanks for asking. I stick by it was the right decision to end it when it was ended. It was the wrong decision to bring it back. The market for boat tourist is saturated and diluting it means it costs more for the same return.  ","1401581201"

I had to quit the awesome bar I worked at making stupid stacks of untaxed cash. I stopped talking to all my friends because they all drink and I'm not confident I could resist the temptation to drink. I was happy being a bartender, I was/am very fucking good at it (one of those craft barkeeps, fancy tools, bitters, diff types of ice, ect), I've won legit competitions and was working on starting a chapter of the US bartenders guild. So now, after a short stay at a treatment center, I have an alright part-time office gig, I'm broke and asking family for bill money. 

I'm 30 and forced to change careers, have intentionally severed my social life; oh and my car is dying so I can't frequent AA meetings or even drive out to go on a hike. Worst, I could get laid BUT stopping to top off the coolant in my car and having no cash to buy a girl so much as a cup of coffee is a turnoff to say the least. 

So I sit at home, cook, watch tv, lurk on reddit, read and try to decide another direction for my life.

I know this isn't nearly as bad as a death in the family, major medical issue or homelessness; but it sucks to go from being respected downtown bartender w plenty of friends, sexual prospects and enough cash to cover a major car repair to a bored, broke part time hourly office worker.

Meanwhile, your enemy might come into lane with a Pickaxe, Greaves, VS, or some other item advantage; and outtrade you, possibly killing you and/or your support.

It obviously depends on champion, matchup, team comps and other stuff. Going back into lane without taking advantage of your lead, or without having something to deal with their lead is not good.

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","I apologise. But anyway, we do know for a fact that there are people who do not feel pain and not *all* of them die young, so it's *possible*. If with no pain at all it's possible to survive, with something that works like pain but isn't horrible why wouldn't we?

And the ""but transhumanism"" thing isn't really an argument. It's more of a ""I don't care what the difficulties may be, they just mean you *get creative*."" In this specific case, I'm not dismissing your difficulties, I'm just saying that they're not that important overall? You mentioned the fact that we need pain to be insistent. It doesn't need to be that horribly unpleasant, and/or lasting, though. For example, a screen on the corner of our vision that flashes a warning, or just some feeling in the back of our head that cannot be ignored (it'd be designed for that) telling us about pain are less-than-5-minutes-thinking-about-it solutions.

So um, as you said, the principle behind pain is pretty solid, even if it could be optimised. I'm just agreeing with you and saying that it's not an easy problem to solve, but that not being easy is not an objection.

Uh... I don't think we disagree at all, just that maybe I expressed myself badly because I insist on doing so at night when my mind is not 100%. Like right now. Principle of Charity me if you can x)","1401581205"

**Rampage** - (9) - Really a fantastic game. I remember when I first heard about it I thought that it was going to be a chaotic mess with pieces flying everywhere but that's not the case at all. It's really well designed.

**Suburbia** - (8) - Fun game. I really liked the objectives as well as the hidden objectives. It gave the game some spice.

**Space Cadets: Dice Duel** - (7.5) - Easily the most cognitively demanding game I have ever played. It's crazy. Now that my mind has been destroyed the first time I would probably do better the next time. Either way it's a lot of fun.

**Midgard** - (7.5) - A surprisingly fun game. It's somewhat light but I like the card drafting and it's short and doesn't overstay its welcome.

**Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures** - (7) - I'm not a big fan of minis games in general but this one has easily been my favorite. I like how simple the movement is and how you can customize your ships. Neat game.

**Shadow Hunters** - (7) - I like hidden team games and this one did it well. It was definitely as short and simple as it needed to be to work well.

**Ingenious** - (6.5) - This looks like the kind of game that I wouldn't like but wouldn't you know it, it's pretty fun.

**Pastiche** - (6.5) -  Fun game. I don't know what else to say about it. It's fun.

**Dirty Minds** - (6.5) - Yep. :)

**What's Yours Like?** - (6.5) - Yep again. :)

**Merchants &amp; Marauders** - (6) - Interesting game. It's a little slow and random but still fun and the theme is really strong.

**Tokaido** - (5) - Meh. There aren't many interesting decisions to make in this game. Somewhat boring but not the worse.

**Sails of Glory** - (4.5) - I like how the ships move in this game but the wind really screws you up. Also the damage is painfully random and you can either completely miss or completely destroy your opponent by the luck of the tile draw.

**Carnival Zombie** - (1) - Pure garbage. Every decision in this game is stupidly obvious. It's a complete waste of time.","1401581216"

The gun does not have to go bang every time it clears the holster. The gun doesn't have to go bang when pointed at someone. Your advice is bad, people who sit on juries are explicitly instructed on how to evaluate the evidence presented, and the doctrine behind self-defense. There is also the process of jury selection where that entire issue is hashed out.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","I'm on day 5 of sobriety and day 5 at a inpatient VA clinic. I was drinking a bottle of whiskey a day. Smoking weed all day long. Not working. Quit school. Being a lazy drunk loner. My boyfriend is a successful software engineer and my drinking was severely affecting our relationship. It wasn't until I broke down in a relationship counseling session that I accepted I had a problem and needed to go into a treatment program. I'm just taking it day by day and hoping that I'll be 100% sober for the rest of my life. I'm currently 30 and havent been sober in 15 years, besides six week of basic military training. That's half my life that I've been drunk or high. It's sickening really. I know the things that I need to work on and currently taking the steps to do it. And luckily I have VA resources to help. Sorry if this is a rant. Just make the choice to stop drinking and take it day by day. I know easier said than done, but you have to.

Hotel Dusk has you investigating the weirdness going on in the titular Hotel Dusk over the course of one long sleepless night. You talk to people and do a few puzzles (a couple of them really threw me for a loop). Trace Memory dumps you on an island and saddles you with a ghost boy; your job on the island is to find out where your dad is and, optionally, figure out how ghost boy died.

In particular this quote is alarming in particular. ""Zimbabwe was harshly criticised by the international community for redistributing farmland to smallholders in 2000. They now produce over 90 percent of the nation’s food crops, compared to 60 to 70 percent before 2000.""

This quote is amazingly misinformed and misleading as it seems to imply that the criticisms were proven wrong, and that more food is now produced when it could not be farther from the truth.  That retribution had horrible negative consequences for every aspect of Zimbabwe leading to failed harvests, lower yields, lower total crop production, and lower food security.

Also if alliance have a bad week, the one whose score is going to be hit the hardest is shook, because the carries will still play careful and make some plays.  Because shook has been scoring well, you should be able to get another good jungler who might not be scoring well, like meteos.  **If you cant get a good jungler trade lined up ahead of time, I dont think you should trade for tabzz.**","1401581223"

Eventually, I'll taper down the nicotine level. I'm chilling at 18mg, but I'm fine with it for now. No worries.

I definitely recommend keeping yourself hydrated as much as possible. I practically keep a stainless steal water bottle within reach at all hours. Double bonus: no cigarettes and a hydrated body. I piss clear &amp; it's awesome.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Think of the world's wealth as a pie. The actual size of the pie is the *nominal wealth* and the cut each nation get is the *relative wealth*. It's important to understand this distinction when you talk economics.

When people say it's ""not a zero sum game"" they are referring to the nominal wealth. If US owns 25% of the pie and China owns 10% of the pie and the pie grew in size then they both became ""pie wealthy"" as does everyone else. 

Now let's talk relative wealth. In this case it is absolutely true you benefit because someone else has a hard shitty life. Resources on this earth is finite and therefore has a finite price. If that banana farmer get the same salary as you, then the price of banana will absolutely rise. And even worst since that banana farmer now can finally afford his own bananas, driving up the price even further until demand meets supply.

This distinction is even more evident when we discuss inelastic strategically useful resources like oil. Wars have been fought over who gets oil and who don't. Seen any poor oil exporting countries?

-My wallet was slowly falling apart for years; slowly and surely, it's transformed into a wallet made out of duct tape. I can't even tell that it was once made out of leather because it has so many duct tape patches on it.

-In college when I was a major alcoholic I used to go classroom to classroom and dig through the recycling for returnables. It got to a point where I could rifle through all the collectibles and non collectibles in less than 10 seconds, even with a full bin. One time while doing this I ate a whole pizza someone threw out into the trash. I won't go into details, just let it be said that I'm not proud. 

-Used to collect cigarette butts/ends and consolidate all the leftover tobacco into a new cigarette that I'd roll up in a paper. If I couldn't afford papers, I'd use newspaper to roll up.

-I used to save/steal nice beer bottles and, if I was going somewhere where drinking MD 20/20 or Natty Ice was frowned upon, I'd poor the shitty beer into that bottle. Or if I was feeling fancy, I'd poor the MD 20/20 into a juice bottle.

-More duct tape. Man, doesn't it suck when your shoe gets holes in it? Well, shoes last forever when you duct tape the entire bottom of it! I also used to make duct tape shot glasses for my friends for their birthdays and would rip shots out of the glass for them until the weird taste of the duct tape was gone.

-I used to smoke cigarettes and joints rolled up with newspaper. That probably deserves its own bullet point.

-I got the cops called on me for digging a hole in the ground outside my apartment complex and starting a fire in it. Apparently that's fucking illegal--who knew? 

-I re-used condoms. Don't worry never from day to day, all within the same night.

-I had long hair, cut it all off, and then saved it because I thought it was cool. I showed it to a couple friends because I thought it was cool, but *apparently* showing off a pile of your chopped up hair is weird!

-I got drunk tanked early easter morning once and later that morning I blew a .15, about 8-10 hours after being detained. That night I bought a gallon of milk, poured 2/3rds of it out, and filled the rest with vodka and kaluha. 

-Had sex with this girl -while I was-(edited because I'm not a rapist) black out drunk on a dirty ass couch at about 1 am while everyone else was ~10 feet away grilling up some burgers and dogs for late night drunken munchies. Don't remember any of that, but my friends said I kept on giving them the thumbs up. 

Thankfully all this lunacy is behind me and I'm sober now, but for a while I was pretty not-giving-a-shit about anything. There's probably more awfully horrible things I've done but I try not to drive too far down memory lane in fear of not returning.","1401581239"

"stata","t5_2stu0","You want the average score holding the two factors constant at their means?

Y = B1 x X1 + B2 x X2 + E

Where Y is the score, B1 and B2 are coefficients to be estimated, X1 and X2 are the environmental factors, respectively, and E is the residual.

Fit the model using reg:

    reg Y X1 X2

After fitting the model, calculate the predicted average score by multiplying each coefficient by the factor mean (e.g., multiply B1 by the mean of Y1) and adding the constant term.

If you want to do it for a subset of cases having, for example, Z = 1 (where Z is model type), you would fit the model:

    reg Y X1 X2 if Z==1 // note double equal sign

And again calculate predicted score by hand. There are ways to automate calculating the predicted score (including using the user-written ""prvalue"") but the model is so simple that these should not be necessary.","1401581245"

When I was in middle school (mid-90's) I had some exposure to the goth, metal, and raver culture, though I didn't live somewhere metropolitan enough to have a real scene. By junior high school I was definitely aligning with gothic culture: musical tastes like Sisters of Mercy and The Cure, classical literature like Poe, and dark, baroque style, t wasn't until my sophomore year that I moved and actually met other goths to hang out with.  After having a social circle it was pretty much a sealed deal. While there we had a good number of German exchange students, and I also got into the German industrial scene with them. ","1401581246"

It's because a shit ton of the posts here are by people who need to be told it's time to break up. 

Our friends won't do it, we can't stand admitting it to ourselves, and we are too inclined to stay in bad relationships for all kinds of crazy reasons. 

But people want to hear it personally. They want to vent it. They want to know they aren't alone and someone or many someones have been there before. 

Love doesn't always conquer all. You cannot fight for a relationship alone. You shouldn't stay in abusive or manipulative relationships. And, for the love of nothing, when kids report they're 24 in a relationship for 6 years, you're damned right they need to break the hell up. 

Yes. The old ""love is forever"" idea is adorable. It's also man made and total bullshit. We shouldn't keep raising our kids to believe they're supposed to pick a mate **for life** when they're 15-25. 

So, no. We don't need a bot. We need to face the fact that people who ask for advice here actually do need to be told to break up a seemingly disproportionate amount of the time. And we need to support them, not convince them to stay in shitty situations. ","1401581246"

But there is no better way to learn than live your success and mistakes first hand, so the last answer is up to you. 

The problem with very thoughtful people —and I have chatted with them quite a bit— is that sometimes it comes to bite them back because they have the ability to reconstruct reality with apparently sound syllogisms and, at some point, they convince themselves of a reality that they forged perfectly in their minds. I may be wrong. But if you are wrong, the price is higher. But maybe then it is better to know that you were right or wrong by acting than simply pondering relentlessly on it, afterward there will be no excruciating doubts left, and that is really good whatever the result.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","So today was a gorgeous day and after I got out of work, I decided to meet up with two friends... call them B and S. The three of us drive over to a local nature preserve to go smoke. B rolls us two joints and we get out of the car to walk and find a spot to blow. I put the joints (or so I thought) into one of my pockets and we start walking. We climb a huge grassy knoll and decide to stop there. I reach into my pockets and find that I only have the smaller of the two joints. Searching all my pockets I still can't come up with the other. We spark up the first J before we head back down the path to the car to see where I might have dropped it. We pass over a bridge and see this guy fishing, along with his girlfriend. I guess we must have been talking about where I could have dropped the joint and he had to overheard us. He asks us if we've lost something, with a smirk on his face. At this point none of us can tell if he's fucking around with us cause he knows we're high or what. Both him and his girlfriend start to laugh and B asks him if he found a cigarette on the ground. He puts down his fishing pole and takes us over to his car and pulls out the joint, telling us he found it lying along the gravel path. Needless to say, my day was made. ","1401581252"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Many of the things you are describing as negative side effects are actually normal features of many types of breasts. Breasts are wonderfully diverse in appearance and form, and can hold their weight in many different shapes.

&gt;So there is a bit of red scarring around the areola. Which makes them a bit bumpy when her nipples are hard instead of soft and smooth like natural breasts.

I believe you when you say she is scarred, and that's very unfortunate, but many people have areolas with varying hardness and texture. [Here](http://www.007b.com/nipple_gallery.php) is a gallery of TONS of different nipples.

&gt;There is this heaviness only at the very bottom of the boob. Natural big boobs are kinda heavy everywhere because they start so high on your chest and slowly curve.

This is incorrect as a blanket statement. Breasts have a [wide variety of shapes](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/shape_guide) and can be measured as shallow or projected, full on top or on bottom, and broad or narrow. Large breasts are no exception.

&gt;When she lies on her back its as if she has ZERO boobs as they simply disappear. And not under her armpit as you would assume. They just kind of pancake flat on her chest. Again not the end of the world. But at no point could anyone assume they were natural any more.

I really don't know why you think this is unnatural. I have seen the pancake effect in numerous women who I know for a fact have never had surgery, myself included. Again, this comes down to how the breast tissue is distributed on the body and it varies from person to person. Breasts going flat when lying down is quite normal.","1401581254"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sure, no problem! Wicca is a nature based religion that focuses on a God and Goddess. The specifics as to the theology differ between Wiccans but we all follow the god/goddes framework. They are complimentary opposites like Yin and Yang or the poles of a magnet.

In Wicca, we have 8 solar  holidays called Sabbats and a myriad of smaller full and/or new moon celebrations called Esbats. 

Then there is the thing everyone gets all in a tizzy over: magic. In wicca out ritual system is called magic, it's sometimes spelled with a 'ck' at the end to differentiate it from stage tricks or harry potter type stuff. Magic is basically like a really involved, active form of prayer. Personally, I see it as an art form of sorts as well as a ritual system. Much of the time, there are candles, poetry, etc. in ritual. It's all very pretty. With that said, the only real requirement for magic is yourself. The candles and tools aren't nessecary.

Another big part of Wicca is it's ethics. Wicca has no infallible divinely revealed text like the bible or koran but it has a few spiritual poems which lay out basic ethics. The most famous is the wiccan rede. The final rhyming couplet, and the most quoted, is ""eight words the wiccan rede fulfil, an it harm none do as you will."" Basically, do what you want, just dont hurt anyone. 

There's a big emphasis on personal responsibilty in wicca as well as a strong encouragement towards learning, thinking for yourself, and forging your own path through life. All religions and paths are seen as valid and it's basically forbidden to actively try to convert others.

There are currently a series of pagan AMAs on /r/religion. Many of which are wiccan. There is also a wiki on /r/wicca which gives more basic info. The community there is also very nice and helpful and can answer any other quesions you may have.

TLDR: Wicca, it's kinda like the DIY Punk of religions.","1401581258"

"SWORDS","t5_2qt1p","Academically we say that during the 1400s (and maybe early 1500s) you had a transitional adoption, with overlap, from cavalry tachi to the already existing foot soldier uchigatana (proto-katana) to official adoption by the samurai of katana. There is one strong definition blade-wise btw. tachi &amp; katana which is that the blade is signed either on one side or the other, depending on how it is worn (the signature is usually on the *omote* or outward side). There were some exceptions, for example Hizen swords were often signed tachi-style even on katana, and some blades were mumei (unsigned), but there is no obvious ""middle style"" that we can point to definitively today. Mounts from that era are extremely rare today even while the blades have survived, so it tends to all get simplified into tachi vs. katana. The distinction between katana and uchigatana is mostly cultural / post-hoc, in that they were essentially the same weapon but the katana was highly ""codified"" and officially adopted by the samurai in the early Edo period, due to the Tokugawa laws on weapon length and koshirae style.

This is an abridged simplification of a process that is actually a bit more complex, so I can recommend [Markus Sesko's book on koshirae](http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/markus-sesko/koshirae-japanese-sword-mountings/paperback/product-20466848.html) as one good source for more info.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I'm just going to tell this in order of it all happening. For the sake of this story we will call this girl Megan. 

Megan joins a student club that I am on and has about 30 people in it with maybe 20 being men. She gets hit on by this one really desperate dude that will hit on anyone. He gets shot down and makes a big deal out of it. 

I then get Megan's number to try to be her ""study partner"" with as a way to try to date her. She's really forward and I quickly get the feeling she wants to fuck and not date. I don't go for chicks that put out that easy, its not my thing and I just pretend like I'm super oblivious to her moves like asking me to drink with her in her dorm room.

Move forward 2 months and she's slept with a couple guys in the group. Word hadn't spread and I'm saying this in hindsight I don't think people were gossiping about it yet. 

Then we go to a party together. The night begins with 

&gt;Don't worry about me, I'm Eastern European, I can drink like a man!

3 shots and 45 minutes later she plops her face in my crotch and starts trying to blow me through my pants while mumbling something that vaguely sounded like

&gt; Take me upstairs and give me a back rub 

I sat there with a confused smirk on my face thinking 

&gt; Yeah right I don't want to get fucking herpagonasyphilaids

That night ends with me giving her a piggy back ride back to her dorm because she wasn't making it home on her own.

A couple weeks after that she gets in a prolonged FWB type deal with a guy in the group. Good for her. Sounds like she's settling down a little... In reality this guy was not alone and she was getting from someone else aswell. That went on for about 4 months. 

Now we're nearing the end of Spring semester. We have a classy party where I wear a suit that doesn't fit me with a clip on tie (as a joke), my then girlfriend wears a dress she made herself, and Megan wears a super short dress that is basically a tube of fabric from her nipples to her ass. Whatever I have my female with me she should at least know that and find someone else. Nope. Kept stealing my damn clip on tie and sticking it in her cleavage. I finally stop bothering getting my friends to fish it out and let her take it (I still haven't gotten it back). Later that evening she disappears with a guy that was no longer engaged after word got about that. 

Now we're at the end of finals party and fortunately I am just at the same party as this and have nothing to do with this. Megan goes outside with about 7 guys and the stories range form her making out with a bunch of them to her blowing some of them. This is all while things have gotten a little more serious with her FWB in the group but I don't know if thew were official. He stopped talking to her after that night.

Then she goes home for the summer and comes back next semester with the most *beta* boyfriend I have ever seen. This guy goes to school several states away and drives to our school to see her every other weekend, while she never leaves to see him. She makes a big deal out of how great their relationship is, and how great the sex is, and how much he likes her bla bla bla. No one gives a fuck. 

A little while later into that year she starts doing this weird thing where she sends snapchats of me or her leaning on/hugging/trying to kiss me to her BF. I told her to stop as soon as I realized and she kept trying. It got to the point I start just pulling my shirt over my face whenever she tried. I have no idea how her BF took this.

Then Halloween rolls around. HOLY FUCK! She comes to my party as a stripper. I didn't ask her to, costumes weren't required, she came as a stripper with her thong hanging out of her pants. I have to admit it was a good look for her but Jesus. She then goes around giving lap dances and being a stripper and made about $20 in singles people stuffed in her stripper panties. She also did the obligatory vanishing to what I assume was someone's car for half an hour. I now also have the reputation of arranging a stripper for my parties that I can never live up to. 

After that she stopped skanking around with my group as much. Word had obviously gotten out and everyone must have done what they wanted. 

I never slept with her and I'm proud of that. 

EDIT: TLDR Skank sleeps with pretty much everyone in a student club but me and this creepy dude (she tried to sleep with me). 

EDIT2: All the people butthurt about the idea of sharing stories about loose women need to lighten up. Its great entertainment, if you're thin skinned you don't have to read this thread. ","1401581263"

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","No offense buddy, but ""I don't have issues with addiction"", or ""I don't have an addictive personality at all"" are the famous last words of many an opiate addict. Countless people have entered the opiate world with this attitude, citing how they kept things they dabbled with in the past such as pot, cocaine, cigarettes, benzoes, etc, under control, using on rare occasions and always avoiding addiction with ease.

The reason I bring this up is both a.) it's important, and b.) your repeated insistence you're not the addiction-prone type. Maybe that's true thus far in your life, but opiates are an entirely different ballgame. It's a good sign that you don't particularly like the way they make you feel, but even that could change with repeated use and familiarity. Basically anybody is susceptible to opiate addiction and trust me when I say you are absolutely no different, as the drug has taken over people with stronger wills than you. 

By all means though, use them for pain; opioid-based pain medications have been the top-of-the-line treatment for severe, debilitating chronic pain for centuries (that's not to say seeking out other treatment options isn't a good idea also). And if you do as you say and keep the use of them to only several times a month, then you should be able to safely avoid dependence and addiction. But also keep in mind that it's possible to get dependent without being mentally addicted. This following scenario is one familiar to many pain patients; they start with a pill once or twice a month to successfully control pain outbreaks, but an increase in those suddenly requires relief once a week, then soon it's a few times a week, then once a day, then multiple times a day…and just like that dependence sets in and the medications becomes necessary to function beyond just reasons of pain. All I'm trying to say is please don't underestimate this class of drugs as there is *always* the possibility of addiction in any patient, ""addictive personality"" or not.","1401581264"

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","I'll x-post something I put in the thread for a first-time 48-hour filmmaker:

One LAST thing:

Want an easier way to shoot a story that will feel 'fresh' and still keep it simple? Shoot a nonlinear piece. Use TWO stories 'A' and 'B' and have one be actions, the other dialog.

So that 'A' story actions are the consequences of 'B' dialog, or that 'B' dialog is a revelation following 'A' actions. I'm not saying you have to make Pulp Fiction here, but to shoot one dialog scene that you can continuously cut back to throughout your narrative. This can act as a pseudo-voiceover that can inform the thesis of your project and keep the audience watching by breaking up the pace a bit.

The beauty of this also is that you just have to script one stakes-ridden scene of dialog, shoot it, chop it up throughout your narrative's timeline in the editor, and then fill the gaps by shooting some actions on a 'B' story that correspond to the 'A' dialog. This sounds like a cheap trick, or something very convoluted, but it's a lot easier -- because once you've wrapped that dialog scene during your shoot, you've already got half your movie.
If you're curious as to the style I'm speaking of, please check out this 24-hour video race entry I shot two weeks ago in Dallas, it's a pretty good example of this nonlinear technique, and how simple it can be:

"tf2","t5_2qka0","For this survey, I decided to take into account a couple of things.  
1: How much it shows the character's personality.  
We all know the characters and how they act. Soldier is insane, scout is narcissistic, medic is crazy in an awesome way, engie is southern and very smart, heavy is a bloodthirst killer, et cetera. But which of these depicts their personality the best?   
  
2: How much is shows the classes' play style.  
Again, pyro is burn shit, scout is go fast and meatshot 8), medic is heal, et cetera
  
3: How fucking awesome, batshit crazy, and appealing it is to a new player.   
Where's the WOW factor? Which of these would make a new player want to play Team Fortress 2?   
  
Taking all of these into account, I decided to vote for Meet the Pyro. It depicts his (or her if you're into that) play style, its mental illness, and WOW, it sure does look fucking awesome. Not to mention that it was highly anticipated for such a long time. ","1401581265"

So the FIL texted me the dimensions, I got 2 hrs in and he texts back to tell me he got the dimensions wrong, 4 board feed of Tennessee red cedar in the scrap heap(Ill find a use for it).  I got the correct dimensions, got out 4 sides in 1/2"" and the top and bottom in 1/4"".  Hand cut dove tails, then routed a 1/4"" rabbet in the top and bottom, the top and bottom press fit in, I glued the bottom in and will glue the top on when I get the ashes.  Then I ran a 1/8"" roundover bit over the entire box.  Scraped the sides and sanded the radiuses, and that's all.

Plus the commison for insurance is built into the cost and the realtor fees are clearly stated upon entering the contract. 

What should I tip? 10%, 20%, $5?

Do I tip the same percent at mcdonalds and gotham steakhouse?

What if my food is cold? Did the server let it sit at the pass or did the cook mess up?

What if my server didn't adequately serve me?

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Exactly! Once you do something it so easy, your personal decision regarding your relationship with God isn't something to take actions on quickly/without contemplation. 

While I can't think of a ton of scriptures mentioning the word Christian, I would say a Christian is a person who is committed to following Christ. In James 1:27, we read that ""pure religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained from the world."" 

Broadly, this can be interpreted to say to serve others (as in the first century orphans and widows were the most helpless people in society, without a way to provide for themselves) and follow God's new testament law (as being stained from the world means to engage in sin; read James 4:1-10 for James's explanation of how ""friendship with the world (i.e. loving to sin) is enmity toward God"" (v. 4). 

Ultimately, just as someone of India is an Indian, a Christian is a person who is of Christ in terms of beliefs and deeds. ","1401581273"

Maybe even offer them a hug to make up for the ones they obviously missed out on. 

I've got bright blue hair and I totally understand how much it sucks to get those comments. I've dealt with stuff like that for quite a while now and it's been shitty at times but its not so bad now that I've grown thicker skin. Ithink you look fucking fantastic and gorgeous and you're rocking the shit out of your hairstyle (and I'm so jealous because I WISH I HAD CURLY HAIR) so just try not to take such nasty and inconsiderate comments to heart because they're stupid and judgmental and shallow.

Honestly, I think people say such things because they're scared of things that are different and sometimes also jealous that they don't have the same courage/opportunity to do what you did. So don't forget that you're fifty million times a better person than they are because you dare to be who you want to be and you don't try to attain some sense of superiority or gratification by insulting other people like they do.

It's hard to not let those comments get to you. I think the best way to deal with it is honestly to just show them how happy you are. It's hard to be confident when people say things that obviously hurt your self-esteem. I'd personally just respond to such comments by overloading them with niceness so they'll feel guilty about being such dicks or realize that Im totally comfortable as I am.

Really, the best way is just to pretend you've got really thick skin until you've actually got it. And don't forget how fabulous you are. don't let these people get you down because it's not worth it and they're just trying to bring you down with them. I'm really sorry you have to deal with such comments still but I hope that maybe in time people will learn to stop being such assholes. In the meantime, I am sending you hugs over the internet and letting you know that you're a gorgeous and cool person and you have nothing to be afraid of with these comments because they're all petty and untrue. 

Sorry for how long this turned out to be. I just really sympathize a lot and I hope that stuff can get better for you :(  I love seeing people with such bright hair so don't forget about the rest of us on here who support you very much!! &lt;3","1401581275"

"women","t5_2qh8d","Yikes, three weeks??  My situation may have been a bit different from yours, but I recovered in about a week.  It does sound like you are making progress in your recovery.  You've stopped bleeding and are experiencing a little less pain.  My guess is that the stitches are what are bothering you the most at this point.  I've had dissolvable stitches that did not dissolve and had to be removed - I don't think that's a major area of concern.  Once they remove those, I think that you'll feel much better.  You sound like you're healing, maybe just a bit slower than you were anticipating.  Everyone's body reacts differently.

I had what I thought was a really huge zit down there but I just figured it would eventually pop or something.  It got worse and worse until one night the pain got so intense that I got out of bed at like 2am and drove over to my parents' house about 10 minutes away in order to get some pain meds from my dad.  He always had a lot of strong meds and all I could think about was getting some relief.  It never occurred to me to go the the ER or anything.

I made it to the morning and went to see my primary care doctor.  (At that point it never occurred to me that I should have just gone to my gyno, but in my defense, I was in some major, intense pain and couldn't even think straight.)  He examined me, diagnosed me and *attempted* to treat me.  He made a couple of small incisions, squeezed the area and pus came out.  I got some immediate relief from pain and thought it was finally over.  He gave me some pain meds and sent me home.

Shortly thereafter, my pain began to come back and grow to the point that my fiance insisted on taking me to the ER by that evening.  They took me in and the ER doc said that my doctor did not do a good enough job and that the cyst was still there.  He made deeper incisions and squeezed about 3-4 oz. of pus out of the area.  That was freaking unbelievable.  He told me to follow up with my gyno the next day.

I went to the gyno, told him what happened and he admonished me for not coming to him in the first place.  He claimed both doctors' approaches were incorrect and that I was a risk for a recurring problem.  He placed a shunt from the wound opening that would drain any remaining liquid into my panties.  I had to wear it for a week and possibly at the end I would have to have surgery on the area.  The shunt was long and uncomfortable, but I dealt with it and by the end of the week, I was pain free, completely healed and did not end up having to have surgery.  He warned that it may happen again, but it has been over 8 years and nothing has happened.

That was one of the most painful experiences I have ever gone through in my life.

I don't think you need to worry about scarring.  I have no scars in my area; in fact, you would never be able to tell anything happened.  Hang in there!","1401581276"

"Permaculture","t5_2qkib","There's no problem with adding insulation, but think about it like this.  A buried ice chest vs an ice chest on the surface.  Which requires more energy (and insulation) to maintain a comfortable interior temperature?  The exposed one, of course.  Because the thermal mass of the earth provides less of a differential between the interior temperature and the external temperature.  That means you need less insulation, and less energy input.

The earthship method of getting the space underground while still having the solar gain is a south facing hill.  You can tap into the thermal battery AND get solar input at the same time.  Are there other ways of doing this?  You bet!

Sure, 50F may be too cool for comfort, but when it is 0F outside, starting from 50F saves you a load of energy!  It takes considerably less energy to go from 50 to 70 than 0 to 70.

And that 50F temperature is exactly the point!  That soil didn't have sun heating it all winter, and probably had snow and freezing temperatures above it, too.  Yet, the soil just one ft below the surface is at 50F.  Now, consider an earthship in your climate that gets no heat input all winter, it will likely never get below 50F.  I don't care how much insulation you have, any house on the surface without a heat source all winter will be a lot colder than 50F.

I don't know why you would have a temperature range of 66-76F daily, it's more like 65-70F.  But, if a 10 degree temperature range is too much, then by all means, use your backup heat source.  Again, to regulate a 10F temp change is going to require considerably less energy input than outside, which is likely 40F change or more.

It's not just going deeper, you can also build up.  Berming can be just as effective as digging down.  The principle is the same, though, you are surrounding the living space with a giant thermal battery, so that it is not exposed to the severe air temperatures and daily ranges.

I believe the Tegra Note is on 4.4, now

the Tegra's on Amazon now ... reviews are somewhat better

my HP is great ... I use it all the time now

I don't use the stylus much ... the few times I have, it's been absolutely superb ... hard to believe it's capacitive ... I'd use it more if I wrote well ... but I type for a living, and otherwise prefer swype

at this point, I'm planning to get the K1 successor (*although, it doesn't sound like it'll have a stylus ... no matter to me ... but I think they'd do very well in the student market, if it did*)

I would've suggested it for ya, but ya sounded purdy hot for Windows","1401581287"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Throwing Stars are cute, but they are ammunition and are incredibly expensive to provide enough magical ammunition for the throwing. No self-respecting villain is going to throwaway his hard earned loot every attack, so you're gonna need something else, something better, something that comes back to you every round.

Gloves of Taarnahm the Vigilant from Player's Guide to Faerun (pg. 128) gives any melee weapon the throwing and returning property. **Any melee weapon.** The downside to the Returning Property is that it comes back to the square your throw originated on your next turn. You can keep throwing it each round, but you need to stand still.

Now, you're gonna want to optimize with the *Weapon Focus (Any Thrown Weapon)* pre-requisite of Master Thrower, but you do need a melee weapon to take advantage of those gloves. I'm a fan of the Desert Throwing Knife from Sandstorm (pg. 96) - It requires an *Exotic Weapon Proficiency* feat but gives a 1d6 damage die, 19-20 crit, and 15 ft of range in trade.

-----

We want Master Thrower 5 asap. Since we're using daggers, we can take *Palm Throw* for double throwing action. We've already given up our Str Bonus, so we might as well take *Weak Spot* as it is awesome and we want to be awesome as well. For the third MT trick, I've always been a fan of *Trip Shot*, especially when you get lots of attacks. Master Thrower prereqs require 3 feats.

You're a Thri-kreen, so you might as well take advantage of *Multiweapon Fighting*. At 20th level, you'll want up to *Greater Multiweapon*, giving you 3 attacks per additional hand. This will take 3 feats.

Before we even think of anything else, we're sitting at 6 feats (7 if you want the Desert Throwing Dagger), and you're not human... So you're gonna be a fighter, Right?

Assuming nothing else, and merely looking to opbtain MT5 as soon as possible, you want Fighter 5 - MT 5.

     1: F1 - Exotic Weapon - Point Blank Shot
     2: F2 -               - Precise Shot
     3: F3 - MultiWeapon
     4: F4 -               - Weapon Focus
     5: F5 - (DEAD LEVEL - Taken for BAB requirement)
     6: M1 - (Open Feat)   - Palm Throw
     7: M2 -          
     8: M3 -               - Trip Shot
     9: M4 - ImpMultiW.
    10: M5 -               - Weak Spot

For your level 6 feat, I suggest Weapon Specialization. It may not be the most impressive damage boost around, but you're throwing a metric shit ton of the same weapon, and a flat +2 each adds up.

If we ignore levels 11-20, and merely consider a full BAB Thri-kreen with Greater Multiweapon and the above, your attacks look as such:

    20/15/10/5
    Add Greater Multiweapon: +3 hands/attack, -2 roll/attack
    18/18/18/18/13/13/13/13/8/8/8/8/3
    Add Palm Throw: Double attacks when throwing small item
    18/18/18/18/18/18/18/18/
    13/13/13/13/13/13/13/13/
    8/8/8/8/8/8/8/8/
    3/3

That's a grand total of 26 attacks. Each attack does Weapon Damage + 2, gives an automatic chance to trip, and  is a ranged touch attack instead of a normal attack.

If anyone lives past the first volley, they'll still have to stand up. And we haven't even considered what else we can add for levels 11-20. Rogue Levels give Sneak Attack against tripped enemies.

Oh! Let's talk other items! Bracers of Lightning give +1d6 Lightning damage per attack (Magic Item Compendium 206). And you'll have 26 weapons to enchant...  ...   Well... Maybe just masterwork?

Here's my question. It seems that CoreOS is currently focused on making stuff work when it is deployed on existing cloud infrastructure. However that seems a bit suboptimal because there still is a layer of virtualization sitting between the hardware and the containers. I've read that you can also PXE boot CoreOS onto bare metal, but CoreOS currently does not seem to provide the environment (eg PXE server etc.) to facilitate that. As I know from first hand experience that setting up a robust PXE environment for several thousands of servers can be a challenge in itself, I'm wondering if there are any plans to include such functionality in CoreOS in the future?","1401581305"

Their singer was this weird gangster wannabe Frankie Palmeri type and the rest of the band was all native dudes with sidecuts.  The dude had no power whatsoever and just ran around the stage doing karate kicks and spinning his arms and in between songs he would dump water on the crowd.  It was pretty sad.  The dudes were beyond rude too and acted like they were better than the other bands.

We're walking around, filling up our basket. And then we start to notice that we're the only shoppers there. Apparently, we walking in *right* as they were going to close their doors. The employees were standing silently at the ends of every aisle making our walk to the checkout a procession. And as we passed each one they bowed to us. O_O We felt so guilty. Man what a cultural difference though. We were there for at least 15 minutes and every single person in the store just silently waited until we were done. ","1401581314"

If there are no state actors then you can't have a constitutional violation (except in very rare exceptions created by statute). 

Additionally, I think it would be very hard to show that this terribly bad pun, is coercive or burdensome to anyone's faith or lifestyle. Especially combined with the possible fact that this is a private company.

When it's just a daily grind for another piece of gear or farming gold to buy a better thing, that's when the world starts to close in around you and you find yourself just sitting on an expensive mount in the capital cities trying to show off your gear and recover a sense of excitement or worth. In short, now is always a good time to start. Knowing when to move on is the real question.","1401581322"

It happened in approximately the same location with both my planes, and orientation doesn't seem to matter much.  (One plane had the antenna vertical, the other horizontal, both mounted internally)  I've moved both antenna to external locations hopefully to address this next time I go fly.

Edit: I can only remember two dropped signals right now (one is very obvious, the other I mentioned in the video)  Here are links to the times.

1:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzz6oaiHr6w#t=81

9:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzz6oaiHr6w#t=577

The one at 1:20 was not supposed to be a loop at all, much less that double loop.  9:35 I think I was trying to roll a bit or something and it just wouldn't, I don't exactly remember right now.  The issue at 9:35 is where I had the most issues though, I actually only ever hit that one at 1:20 once.

The fire analogy is simple and does not cover all aspects. It would be more akin to setting the house on fire and using all your roommates possessions and wealth to save yours. Licences to have children would be much easier to obtain in a developed country by any measure, so you are taking the lions share of the insurance check to have a nice house.

Implementation is a very big issue when talking about controlling someone's body. Look at how China handles it and you will see the horrors and reality of it.

Experts on what? Parenting? How do you determine, before hand, who is going to make a good parent? Look at how voting tests have been used to disenfranchise people, now imagine if you could racially engineer a country by controlling who can have children.

The important part is: it all formed at the same time. The theory is based on the idea that it was all a big nebula, and as such, it all had to be formed at roughly the same time.

In the chloroform method of caffeine extraction, all the dark roasts had more caffeine than light roasts.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","**What you'll need:**
    


* An Android phone that supports NFC  
* WhizTags: Available on Amazon [here](http://amzn.com/B00CE3IC74)  
* The app [Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher)  
* The app [Strava](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava)  

**Steps:**  

1. Open the Trigger app.  
2. Tap the ""plus"" sign  
3. Tap the ""plus"" again to add a trigger.  
4. Tap ""NFC""  
5. Dismiss the message by tapping ""Next""  
6. Tap ""Done""  
7. Tap ""Next""  
8. Tap the ""plus"" sign  
9. Tap ""Applications and Shortcuts""  
10. Tap ""Open Activity""  
11. Tap ""Next""  
12. Choose ""Strava"" as the application  
13. Choose ""com.strava.NewRideActivity"" as the activity  
14. Tap ""Add to task""  
15. Tap ""Next""  
16. Tap ""Done""  
17. Tap the NFC tag  
18. Tap ""Done""  


    

Next, affix the tag to your bike somehow. When you're ready to ride, just unlock your phone, tap the tag, and hit the record. I find that the one-button press of this method is a lot easier than fumbling to find the app, going through the menu, etc. Sure, it doesn't save that many clicks, but it's way cooler.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","40 year old mom of 3 here. All of my kids - two girls and a boy - love the show, and hubby and I enjoy watching it with them.

It's made by the same bunch of folks as other cartoons we've enjoyed (Powerpuff Girls). It's also, honestly, one of damn few cartoons my kids watch that I don't actively hate. Everything is either 'stupid for the sake of being stupid' humor (Spongebob, everything on Cartoon Network) or just syrupy-sweet and preachy.

MLP has a lot of positive messages, but tackles serious issues kids face without being preachy about it. There's some actual good writing, and some really fun and catchy songs. Even though the main characters are female, it doesn't really come off with the same syrupy-sweet, girly feel as other 'just for girls' cartoons. And like all the best cartoons, it throws quite a few gags and references that go right over the kids' heads but are clearly aimed for the parents watching with them.

It probably doesn't hurt that I loved Ponies when I was a little girl and had a box full of them still sitting in my mom's attic.

In the end it's all a matter of taste. I'm not going to get upset if someone else doesn't like it. That's their prerogative - don't be obnoxious and annoying about not liking it, and I won't be obnoxious back, yeah? Sure, there are some weirdos out there - but there are weirdos in every fandom, if a visit to /r/rule34 hasn't clued you in to that.

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","1. Yes, your girlfriend needs to block his number and file a police report for the harassment.

2. No, a letter from you (an uninvolved third party) won't hold much weight and this dude is a grown ass man - his parents really can't do anything about his behavior so complaining to them won't do anything but make him angry.

3. And you'd find out who his parole officer is....how?

4. No one's going to run a story on a he said / she said bit.

5. And you'll get yourself arrested for doing something stupid and escalating the situation. Knock off the chest beating and calm down.

Your girlfriend needs to talk to the dude's brother and tell him to keep asshole away from social groups because of what he's done to your girlfriend. She needs to tell the asshole to stop speaking to her and immediately block him on all mediums of communication - texting, facebook, etc - then file the police report. If he tries to contact her again, she'll go to the police again.

I get that you want to help your girlfriend, but other than making things worse, you can't really do much as a distant third party.","1401581333"

The ship in the story that cover image is for is clearly described as heavily modified, with even the basic frame being unlike any cutlass the protagonist has ever seen before.  Don't hold your breath expecting this to be one of the standard variants.

If you're interested on what Australia's foreign policy towards Indonesia should be like, I'd suggest that you watch this very interesting lecture by Hugh White called [""Indonesia and Australia in the Asian Century"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSJayGOElsg) It's just 1 hour long and it can open up your mind about Australia-Indonesia relations, especially since Indonesia is projected to grow as an even stronger nation in the future.","1401581337"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It happens in Alaska, and it's fine. The idea of the government writing everybody checks as a share of the public income itself isn't fundamentally garbage. 

The problem is that it needs to be coupled in some way with economic productivity and the country's current accounts, or else you run into fiscal and inflationary crisis. It's an idea like the Euro -- works fine in good times, not really designed for bad times -- but bad times are when you need it to work more than good times.

I don't think a lot of the people who advocate for basic income are keeping that in mind.

EDIT -- Another way to think of it is that things like unemployment benefits and social security benefits are structured like insurance -- there's an amount that's paid in, there are actuarial tables and discount factors and all that, and there's an amount paid out. Despite right-wing claims to the contrary, these sorts of systems are generally very stable -- setting up an expenditure with a built-in revenue stream to feed it.

Basic income seems at least on its face to be moving away from this idea of it being based on a risk that is variable over time and a revenue source that is variable as well, but both of which can be established externally, instead trying to set up something that is flat and intended for the long-term -- and that might, say, rise with inflation or political pressure, but probably wouldn't be locked in to rise at a specific rate (there would be inflationary expectation problems with this -- stores would just raise its prices for necessities in advance at the rate of the rise in basic income). 

This kind of program could run into a lot of problems if there isn't an intuitive way to connect the funding for it to the expenditures, like there is in a social insurance program. And because the amount of this income seems, at least intuitive to me (a pretty left-wing dude), to be generally up for negotiation and not locked in, then that means you'd have pressure to raise the basic income at times when the country can't afford it, or cut the basic income at times when the country can't afford it, and it would be a huge political fight.

Keep in mind, for example, how much better Social Security generally works than the minimum wage does, and how much more effective it is at its goal of supporting people's livelihoods.

Political fights are bad for budgetary items. It makes things go unfunded, it guts important programs, and it increases waste. As much as possible, it is a good idea to set up critical spending initiatives in ways that aren't really susceptible to last-minute jockeying -- like how you don't pay for a road with ongoing tax dollars, you pay for it with a bond, and then you pay the interest with tax dollars. It's much more stable. It makes planning possible at all.

And on top of that, political fights during crises over government-guaranteed incomes are a textbook nightmare scenario for hyperinflation.","1401581344"

It is not that devs do not learn from these things, but it is the players that do not. Every game that has had a massive population looking to play on a single server experiences this. Archimonde in wow had 21 Day Queues. The only reason it did not go down is that people are refusing to go to other servers. We can complain to carbine, as it may have been better to open up the extra pvp server earlier, and in my opinion they also kept the nexus server up too long which did not give them accurate metrics on where players want to go.

In the end though, it is our own stubborness, and the fact that we are willing to sit in these queues that they exist in the first place. We are a stubborn breed when it comes to our server choices.","1401581349"

"Amsterdam","t5_2r117","&gt; I am really wondering where you found ""high-quality restaurant scene in the €5-€8 range"" in Paris, maybe you know some local places, but I didn't experience anything even remote for said price/quality.

For example in the 10th there are many Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Vietnamese, Turkish, Korean restaurants serving honest and well-made food at those prices. Just walk around the Porte Saint-Denis neighborhood with an appetite and a few €2 coins in your pocket and you'll be delighted. Skip Passage Brady of course. Look for restaurants that are ugly and crowded.

When I say ""high quality"" I mean that the food is expertly prepared by people who really understand the cuisine they are working with, and the results are pleasing to the palate, and succeed in achieving what was offered (i.e., unlike ""Indian"" food in Amsterdam which tastes nothing like anything ever served in India).

This is almost unheard-of in Amsterdam, except when the bar is set incredibly low: Buy an expensive piece of meat from a butcher, and don't burn it. Yes, there are restaurants here that can competently achieve that, and charge me €50 for the privilege of witnessing the outcome. But I can do that at home. It's not interesting, it doesn't provide me with value in terms of the food. Maybe it's nice to go out with my friends and eat at a restaurant, but that's really not about the food here, it's about having a place to go.

And aside from ""ethnic"" food (which is my main interest, displaying my subjective bias here), in France the local cuisine is also well developed and there are many restaurants where you can have an excellent French meal for under €10. I have the benefit of French friends who guide me to these restaurants, because as someone who only spends a few weeks there a year, I don't have the updated insider knowledge, but nobody in Amsterdam has ever been able to show me any such thing, and I myself have been looking for years. If it's here, it's very well hidden.

When you have these restaurants that provide democratic opportunity to experience good food, then the refinements for which some restaurants charge higher prices, start to take on legitimacy. But without them, you have the situation in Amsterdam where the expensive restaurants don't have to compete with cheap restaurants for quality of food, so they spend all their margins on hiring decorators instead, because after all, it's easier to get a trendy dining room than it is to consistently prepare high-quality food.","1401581349"

You would think people with that level of business knowledge wouldn't go for such a dumb idea. Make a new brand, don't live off their brand.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","As I understand it, a timelocked transaction is cancelled if a balance is spent from the address before the original transaction unlocks.

The steps are:

* Multisig address established between client and server.

* Client tells server 'here is a transaction for TotalBtc timelocked to be refunded to me if all else fails'

* Client then sends signed signed transactions that, if broadcast, would overrule the refund (so that the server doesn't lose the all the money, only the outstanding change)

* Eventually the client calls quits and the server broadcasts the latest signed transaction received from the client, which overrules the timelocked refund transaction, meaning the server pays back the amount originally sent, minus the sum of all the micropayments

Seeing as how one of the main mechanics is on trade runs and 100% of the risk is on the people who made the trade packs and 0% of it is on the people who are ganking them it is horrendously imbalanced PvP. 

Even if you manage to kill them they lose *nothing* if they manage to kill you say goodbye to *everything* you had. That is a very, very, very bad system. (As a comparison to EVE, if a ganker fucks up they can easily lose millions, possibly billions, of ISK. Most people won't go after you if you're worth less than what it'd cost to replace their own ship, especially in highsec)

Of course the people who only like to gank and make people have bad days *love* this but don't seem to understand that without the people doing the trade runs the economy will essentially grind to a halt.

I'm actually only using the two internal slots with two HDDs. Waiting just a little more for a bigger SSD. It hasn't been a problem for me, but if you must have more than 2 internally and dont want to use the hot swap bays, it would be a concern.

So skipping over what I don't know and onto what I do know; the question here is, are you running this Windows 2012 machine as a VM only, or are you using real hardware? The reason I ask this, is because with Windows 2012 you essentially get THREE licenses, if you use them correctly, one for a HyperV host, two for VM's within that host. My recommendation would be to set up a DC and an APP VM, don't mix the two.

But in saying that, if your readme's all assume AD, you might not have TOO much trouble authenticating just to a single server and have the users added locally, just use SERVERNAME in place of DOMAIN and you'll have to set up any GPO's what not manually (I'd say this process will be a lot harder and more time consuming than just setting up AD)","1401581367"

My automatic response was ""Ummm...do you know how many blacks, whites have killed???""

But that's how she grew up.  I've explained to her many different outlooks, but she's always been quite stuck to her convictions which I can't do anything about.

But not once has she ever spoken to me the way your grandmother spoke to you.  She's never held our differences in beliefs against me.  She's also batshit crazy (no joke.  She talks to Jesus and Jesus talks right back.), and extraordinarily paranoid (she thinks that when my dog barks at people, it means we will get robbed my them that night.  It has yet to happen).

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I don't ""dislike"" star wars, but I guess I just never understood the huge fandom behind it. I like some of the ships and the light sabers, but other than that there really isn't much that I like as far as movies go. (I have enjoyed some of the games)

I'm not big into fantasy and to me it feels like more fantasy than sci-fi so that could be the reason. I haven't been a huge fan of the nolan batman movies either so maybe that's indicative of my tastes. On the other hand I've really enjoyed most of the avengers/marvel movies and I'm really big into star trek, stargate and other sci-fi shows and movies. 

I really do think the problem is that it's too heavy on the fantasy. The force is basically magic. The technology isn't explained (not necessarily a bad thing) and most of it doesn't seem like it should work. Mostly the technology just doesn't seem practical and the way it's shown to work doesn't feel cohesive. For instance, new technology is revealed when they face a specific problem, it doesn't feel like it's part of the world, just added to fit whatever scenario the protagonists are in. Not to mention the droids all seem useless, having a droid in your ship to fix problems seems a bit pointless since they don't have materials or a way to reach all the damaged parts of the ship. All the droids seem to do is weld a couple things together any time there's a problem and it magically works.

Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people disagree with me but I like my sci-fi to feel like a real world and be practical. To me, Star Wars just doesn't feel like sci-fi.","1401581368"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","&gt; The very most basic implementation of a solar panel requires oil at nearly every step. Oil heats the crucible you extract your silicon crystals from. Oil lubricates the factory that builds the solar cell. Oil transports the raw silicate to the solar cell factory. Oil gives the mine or recycling center the ability to extract and separate the silicate. Oil products clean and lubricate the materials at every step of the process to produce a solar cell.

You know, you can make this argument without silly exaggerations. Really. Your arguments are stronger when you don't treat the people you're trying to convince like they're eight-year-olds, because when your arguments are half bullshit it's hard not to conclude that they're entirely bullshit.

Like, for example, are you arguing that there is no way to heat a crucible without oil? No, of course not, nobody would be silly enough to argue that. Right. Oh wait, you just did. And obviously you are also arguing that there is no way to transport things without fossil fuels, no way to lubricate things without fossil fuels, and so forth.

You COULD make a cogent argument. In my opinion it would still be misguided defeatist thinking, but it would still be a good argument. But you don't.

(which is probably mostly due to steroids...  They both have or had at one time amazing physiques)  I accepted Pulp fiction because Bruce portrayed a pretty regular guy.  I don't really remember much about Sin City... but Die Hard always seemed silly to me...  It crossed his level of believable badassedness.  The only good argument I have for Bruce Willis as an action hero was the fifth element.  I believed it in that one for some reason.  Possibly because he was always surrounded by smaller people in the movie.  Or possibly because it was an amazing fucking movie at it's time.","1401581372"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Some women have difficulty getting wet. It seems like that might be the issue here? Maybe her being self conscious about her ability to get wet is killing the mood for her and since she doesn't know what she likes she doesn't know what to ask for, or even there are other things to ask for, to get her wet? 

Touching myself doesn't really get me wet either. I can use a vibe by self and get off but that's irrelevant to sex with a partner. I could touch myself all day alone or I front of my SO and it wouldn't make me wet or ready to have sex. Maybe masturbation isn't a turn on for her, nothing wrong with that. 

To me it seems like she wants to work with him she just isn't sure what to do and she needs more guidance than ""touch yourself"" to figure it out. 

OP needs to talk it out and say he will try new things with her but she needs to cooperate so they can find things that work together. Obviously she wants to get wet, not being wet upsets her and she shuts down. Why not incorporate some massage oil/lube like coconut oil so there is less pressure on her to get wet and she can stop worrying about it? I bet of she stopped worrying about it she could get wet more easily. ","1401581377"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are two phenomena that work to get someone to do you a favor.

 There's the [Door in the face phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique), which basically says that someone will be more willing to do you a smaller favor if they have previously rejected a larger one. So imagine you want  $50, if you ask a friend for $100, they might first reject, but if you follow up with a request for $50, they have a higher tendency to accept, (it's the least they can do), which is the amount you wanted in the first place.
The second phenomenon is the [Foot in the door phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique), which says that you have a higher chance of having a friend do you a large favor if they have already previously accepted a smaller one already (asking to go to a friend's house, then asking if you can spend the night there).","1401581390"
"longboarding","t5_2qvgw","Mid to high speed freeride: get Divine Street Slayers. The 78a feels super sugary and smooth, especially after you get the lips a bit rounder and wear of a few mm. They can be a bit chattery at first, but it completely dissapears later.

They shave off quite a lot of speed in the lower duro, and they also have a rather big contact patch. But they *feel* great at lower speeds, even if you don't slide that far.

They also grip pretty nicely when you need them to, it has saved me in some situations.

They are also pretty durable in my experience, and hard to flatspot at low/medium speeds at least. Haven't gone faster than 40 mph unfortunately, so I don't know exactly how they feel at higher speeds.

If you don't weigh a lot and slide on super gnarly, hot pavement going 40 mph all the time, then they should last a while.","1401581390"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","1. Think about what you can do at this point in time with your own power. What do you immediately need to do that you can accomplish without help from anyone else? This can be something as simple as cleaning your room to something like calculating how much you spent this month.

2. Realize that if you don't do something, nobody will. This is probably the biggest hurdle because too often, people will do #1 (if they do anything at all) then throw their hands up and say ""I give up."" This is common in things like coding and group projects where they expect someone else to do the work for them. You just have to rely on nobody but yourself. If you dont do the work, nobody else will. 

3. Take your time to do it well and do it once. It is more costly to do things over again so take your time to focus on one task and one task alone. If you have multiple things due at the same time, work in parallel and organize when you do what. Create a plan and follow that plan UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

Surrender your free will to a plan you have made for yourself.

4. Career-wise is probably the hardest because it involves relying on the mercy of someone else. I would say it has to do with how you present yourself to people. First impressions are important so what kind of impression do you want to give? Do you want to be known as someone who can get things done or someone who can give moral support where it needs to be? That question is up to you and how you want to fit into the new job. You can relax a little once your coworkers know you better but basically, your first impression will determine how your coworkers will treat you for the rest of the time you are there so take care of yourself and TAKE YOUR TIME.","1401581390"

If they're contracted by the governing authority as the sole provider of a public utility, then I believe that would further constitute a breach of contract. It could snowball from there into sanctions, fines, and other penalties for the provider.

It kind of falls into the same category as Pedro's perfect game.  Pedro went nine perfect, but gave up a hit in the 10th and was pulled.  Pedro did everything every other perfect game pitcher did except have a team that scored any runs.  Lots of people remember the game, but it isn't considered a perfect game because he lost it in extra innings.

Technically Randy Johnson SHOULD get credit since he struck out 20 in 9 innings without going into the 10th.  No one gives him credit in the same way as Clemens or Wood because the game went extra innings.","1401581391"

If you are invested in it and think they will deliver all that they promise, then I wish you much luck.... 

if you find it somehow strange that the developer of the coin did this payment to another coinmaker who does this on an assembly line, but claims he has written the mixer code from 0 in a few hours to implement it (between payment to loljosh and official announcement). than you perhaps should sell it like I did...

If that is possible, why in the hell are we doing this weird hand motion where we extend then retract to select? Why aren't we just grabbing the tiles we want to open? Why does the camera have to track hand relative to screen position to give us a mouse pointer rather than tracking hand to body relation to move left and right so that you don't spend ten minutes trying to get your hand icon to show up?

The menu selection needs re-written. It should use the exact same controls the Kinect is using when you play the rock climbing games.","1401581398"

We were downstairs about to get in the car to go to the hospital when I collapsed. I remember dizziness, darkness closing in, and the deepest desire to tell my mom I loved her, one last time. I could vaguely here her desperately trying to give the ambulance, who was lost, the correct directions, and then starting CPR.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Uhm. Whats wrong about powdered alcohol? That stuff was patented about 1974, by the general foods corperation (owned by Kraft Foods).

2005, a the german Stiftung Warentest tested a product. 2007, some students made ""Booze2Go"", 2014 the TTB allowed and then banned powderes alcohol (""Lipsmark"", as far as I understand).

I found some news articles from 2004, 2005 and 2007 / 08. Everybody was a bit concerned that powdered alcohol uses a loophole in laws regarding alcohol. But from a chemical point of view, I could not find any concerns. 

Now, let me watch Thunderfoots Video.

2:36 - He makes the assumption that you can not put alcohol in powder-form without freezing it. Of course you can. With stuff like Cyclodextrin. It absorbs alcohol like the stuff in diapers and is water-soluble, as far as I understand.

Around 4:00: Oh. He understands it. Why ... why did he made the first assumption in the video then? On he goes about how impractical it is....

6:30. Multiple repetitions of the most ""stupid"" statement about Palcohol. Of course, after multiple comparions and some insults. Oh, and facepalm-scenes. Yay...?

8:00. Insults the .. uh.. moderator of a news show. Nothing to do with the ad for the product. Next...

9:00 he compares palcohol with a maxip... what? With a maxipad. Completely ignoring the feature of Palcohol: You can get the alcohol back from it. In a drinkable fashion.... *sigh*.

Aaand another 4 minutes or so of rambling about how impractical that stuff is, a few insults, context-less quotes, something about lobbying...

He could have made his point in 3 minutes or less: Powdered alcohol is possible, but it has fairly limited use and is not an effecient way of transporting alcohol or even hiding it. His assumption that this is completely useless..  mhm... not sure. People like stupid and amazing stuff. But the fact that Kraft Food never used that patent for three decades might say something.

~~Thunderfood~~ Thunderf00t sometimes has some valid points. But most of the time, he repeats those points over and over and over again. And he insults people without any good reason. 

Edit: Yes, downvote me. But at least be fair and tell me what I did wrong. Thanks!

Something like this aswell, you could add a secound card and oc however much you'll like.

CPU i5 for gaming is plenty, It's overclockable and i ofcourse added the new z97 chipset

full atx msi gaming motherboard full of features, I would've went with a asus Ranger board if i were you, but it's not released yet onfortunatly.

16gigs of ram, Since such a high build kinda deserves it, drop it down to 8gigs if you wanna save some money.

storage i choose 250gb ssd for online games, os and most used apps and a 1tb for game storage.

You could get 2 280x's aswell, but this way you get more preformance if you were to upgrade later to a secound 290x and then you would get more overall preformance

case is ofcourse whatever you like, but i got this since it has a nice look i think, but you can get whatever you want.

A high quality 1000watt seasonic you can't go wrong with.

And 3 60hz 5ms IPS 23"" monitors 1080p ofc.

No os added though I know it over the budget, but this would give you a better upgrade and overclocking path and you could ofcourse go water cooling if you ever wanted to.","1401581401"

&gt;

&gt;**Samuel's Warning Against Kings**  
[**10**] So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking for a king from him. [**11**] He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots. [**12**] And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. [**13**] He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. [**14**] He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants. [**15**] He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. [**16**] He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men and your donkeys, and put them to his work. [**17**] He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. [**18**] And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”

"androiddev","t5_2r26y","What you're trying to do is set up a listener on the asynctask on every getView, that's a serously bad idea.  When async completes and when an arbitrary view is inflated and displayed are two absolutely separate events that should not depend on each other. Look what happens - listview is initialized and displayed, it tries to add rows and populate them, - but it needs something to populate them with.    

 But there's no data. You set data to a textview only when the listener fires (that's what a listener does - its code *doesn't run when you set it*, but when the `onPostCompleted()` is called by the task - I guess in `onPostExecute()`?). And when does it happen? *Just once, when the current async instance (the one assigned to pTask) is done fetching the whole batch.* Not only that, it runs through the whole dataset and calls `setText` to the *same* instance of `title` for every ProdArray object - where each title should only display one name, it iterates through all of them on one ""window"" so to speak. The listener won't fire every time you need to display a row. The reason you're not getting an exception is because Java copies the reference to `title` inside the listener, so its not null when you call `setText()` on it, but it doesn't display anything, it's probably not on the screen at this time.   

    

You just want to update the dataset when the async fetches it, the Listadapter will take care of syncing between the data and views on its own through `notifyDatasetChanged()`. What you do is this (sloppy but fast):   

1) Set your listener right after you instantiate the asynctask, but before you start it.    

2) initialize the ListView on onCreate(), instantiate the adapter too, but don't set the adapter to listView until the async is done    
  
3) onPostExecute(or whatever custom callback you have there) - set the newly fetched data to the adapter instance and set the adapter to the ListView. You will need to put the AsyncTask class inside your Activity class for that to work though, and make sure to stop the task if activity is destroyed unexpectedly.    

4) Whenever a new task fetches new data, set it to be the new data for the adapter and call `notifyDataSetChanged()` - the listView will be updated to display the new items.    
        
5) getView() method should look something like this:    
    
    // usual inflater stuff    
    title = (TextView) view.findViewById(...);    
    ProdArray obj = myDataset.get(position);    
    title.setText(obj.getName());

From the typical citizen's point of view, it's all overkill. There's no reason to use SWAT tactics against a simple possession-charge, or even a minor distribution charge. It's just one more reason why government is getting too big, too empowered, and too out-of-control.

I'm a conservative, and the more liberal college-age young adults in my town, just about 5-10 years younger than myself, always try asking me, ""If you think Government is out-of-control, name just three things that are so out of control about it."" My response is always, ""Military Spending in one vein due to keeping and maintaining a standing army, Military Spending in another vein due to boondoggle contracts like the F35-JSF (A $5 Billion+ project last I checked, that the prototype still can't fly in the rain, and they still keep changing the design, going back to the drawing board to begin from scratch!), The abuse of Executive Powers in the War on Terror (Namely in UAV's, amongst others), and the War on Drugs. Technically four things, but still relevant.""

It may sound odd that a conservative opposes the War on Drugs, but if you ask me, what it boils down to is this. Who, ultimately, has the right to tell you, as an individual, what you can and cannot put into your body? The State government? I would say not. The Feds (Controlled Substance Act)? Definitely not. The sole arbiter of what you consume, should be you. Now, I know I'll get some detractors that say, ""But what about the stoner who wants to go out and get some munchies just after blazing out?"" To this, I reply, ""What of it? This is why we have Driving While Intoxicated laws. Intoxication is not legally cordoned off to only alcohol, after all.""

In the end, the DEA has repeatedly demonstrated that they do not care about the legitimacy of the law, especially where the Controlled Substances Act is concerned. Take *Cannabis Sativa* and *Indica* , for example. Both are classified as Schedule 1 controlled substances under the CSA. One of the requirements for Schedule 1, is that there is no medicinal use for the substance. We now have a mountain of evidence to the contrary, supported by many US doctors over the years. Despite these facts, which should nullify Cannabis' placement on the controlled substance list, by extension, requiring Cannabis strains to be reclassified, the DEA repeatedly refuses to reclassify the drug.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I wrote a lot of stuff, and you responded to *none of it*.  How does what you just said poke a single hole in my argument?  Yes, I have my own beliefs to, that I put online, and sometimes I feel they are better than other beliefs, and one of my beliefs is that a large percentage of the time the accumulated aggregate ""opinion"" of a large swath of users acting in tandem on this site becomes essentially bullying.  Are you saying that I'm doing the exact same thing?  My opinion was presented in a pompous way?  A bullying way?  I disagree, but I'm open to argument; I feel I made an argument and wasn't dismissive about it, and I did my best to make sure that I was talking about my own perceptions of a large amount of posts, not saying anything was 100% objective or covered 100% of users.  Do you have an actual rebuttal?

And just to be clear, I explicitly do *not* call ""everyone on reddit hiveminds"", nor at any point do I claim I am not subject to it too.  Its weird to quote what you are responding to, because I know you read it all, but I said:  ""I know that its a lot of individuals, and there is a *lot* of great content and discussion and humor and everything on this site, but most of the time I feel the ""hivemind"" that forms from all the reddit users is really just a big, self-righteous, pompous bully.""  I'm not sure where in that I claim everyone on reddit hiveminds, nor where I claim that I am never a part of the hivemind forming a bully.  But since you brought it up, even though I never said it like you claim, I *will* say it:  I believe that most of the time I'm *not* part of such a hivemind, because I actively try not to bully people or judge them to that degree.  I say  most of the time because I'm sure I've made mistakes, even if I can't remember specific instances, as no one is perfect.  But I strive to not be that sort of person, and I don't usually judge people for things like saying silly things at a young age, being awkward, liking sports, liking videogames, being rich, being poor, race, fedoras, etc.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","^ I want to second your statement about cipralex + fitness. 

It took me 3 years of medical testing, worrying, and stressing over what was wrong with me until I was finally successfully diagnosed with mild anxiety/depression. At the time, I didn't know at the time that anxiety could materialize as dizziness, chest pain, etc. I also had benign fasciculations (involuntary muscle spasms) in large muscle groups that had me thinking I had ALS or something. Lots of wasted time/resources on neurological tests to confirm it wasn't that. Even when diagnosed, it took me a while to accept it, thinking it had to be something worse. 

I started on Cipralex about four years ago. Shortly afterwards I really started to kick my ass into shape (biking/spinning, running, squash). It took a year to really get settled - to get used to the drug side effects and get over weakness from prolonged inactivity (fucking MMOs) - but thinking back to what it was like before, life is much much better now. More energy throughout the day and less dread for social aspects of work/home life. My drive to stay at home on my computer and avoid going out has completely dissipated. 

If cipralex works for you, it really works well and the side effects are relatively mild. And fitness really does a lot to combat depression and give you confidence (although those first few months really suck hard). 

Edit: Random disclaimers
- I am not a doctor/psychiatrist so cipralex might not be appropriate for you. And as with many similar drugs, results vary. Worked for me and I am very thankful for that. And to my doctor for figuring it out. 
- It took many months for me to noticeably benefit from the drug.
- Fun side effects include excessive yawning (that was ridiculous but it passed after ~6 mos) and difficulty in reaching climax (which you get used to and, as a dude, use to your advantage!)","1401581423"
"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Great! Medicare should buy me a house then. Relatively, the cost is low, and that seems to be a relevant factor in whether we should pay for something. Should.

A welfare system should provide you with lodging in certain situation, certainly.  Are you in need of one without the ability to fend for yourself?

&gt; How do you figure that? Know what i'm sure would do that? Them committing suicide.

Suicide would lower medical costs, but also reduce participation in the economy.  We're much better off with an extra healthy participant in society.

&gt; Well, since your premise is false i'm going to have to decline your invitation on the false conclusion bus. =( Do you somehow feel that, in this recession, there is a lack of those willing to work?

There are in excess of three million jobs available in the US.  And that's during the recession.  Over the next three decades, the odds of someone working enough to provide $30k in taxes in that time frame is pretty high.

&gt; Cosmetic changes should not be covered, actual healthcare should be.

So, a distinct difference in brain chemistry and the corpus callosum relative to those who share your body gender is a matter of cosmetics?  Pray do tell, how do you propose we solve the brain chemistry instead?  Or the wiring of the corpus callosum?  I mean, as an alternative to reassignment surgery?  I assume you are familiar with the actual quantifiable differences in the male and female brain, and how we actually quantify the discrepancies in the vast majority of those who do SRS?  

If you grow breasts and get a high pitched voice tomorrow due to a chemical problem or a wiring issue in your brain, sorting that would be a matter of cosmetics, right?  ","1401581423"

"cringe","t5_2r6rj","As a Dutch person I'd like to point to the fact that this lame-ass show does NOT reflect The Netherlands.

The channel this show airs on (SBS6) is well-known for being low-quality sensationalist television with very little content. It's the TMZ of television.

Every single 'odd-looking' contestant on this show is mocked because the sheer 'shock-factor' is the only reason to watch the show for some people.

*Holland's Got Talent* has (luckily) been losing ratings over the last few years due to a lack of actual content or enjoyability. This scene has actually given them publicity which is definately not a good thing.

Just note that the judges aren't actually racist in the way that they think less of other skin-colours but they just found the contestant's race the easiest thing to crack ^^unfunny jokes about.

Just stop reposting this video every month and giving this shithole of a show attention.","1401581427"

Online dating was a huge help for me. I was able to type out an interesting opener and pretty much forget about it (unless she responded). I went from nervously asking out women, to making out with them on the first date. 

There is a bit of a gap online of whom I can attract and whom I'm attracted to.. and that is a bit of a problem. Also, a picture is still a picture when it comes down to it. 

My limited social circle does mean its rare for me to come across single women. The bar scene is incredibly intimidating. I've made some progress talking with strangers, but have yet to pick up a girl or get a number there.

Sting, [Gabriel's Message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF2BzUDeTkY).  I grew up in a 'high' Anglican church where that hymn was a standard on Christmas week, and that hymn certainly never sounded like that.  Plus, young, exceptionally beautiful Sting.  

Aztec Camera's [Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COtZZmWKcRI&amp;app=desktop), vs. [Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap2J9RbXaP4).  Our high school had some rather large music divisions, but because of unlucky decisions surrounding alcohol and motorcycles, a friend of a friend (who also happened to be a Van Halen fan) ended up in hospital, in traction, for the last 3 years of my high school experience. Hospitals were a bit 'different' then- schools had recently gone 'smoke free' but hospitals weren't, which may have had something to do with the number of visitors that she ended up with.  And long-term patients could 'decorate' their rooms however they wanted to, and my friend's walls (and ceilings) were decorated with David Lee Roth and Van Halen posters. I was there the day that she ditched the Van Halen posters for Aztec Camera- in retrospect possibly not the most musically sound idea, but we certainly lit up a few in her hospital room that day. 

Cake's [I Will Survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596qaxm-u4o). 

[Roxanne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s12XiAOtjcg), the Moulin Rouge version, vs. The Police. 

David Bowie and Annie Lennox practicing [Under Pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VLS-P9m0BM) for the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert.  No one can beat Freddie Mercury for front vocals (in my opinion), but I love the interactions between the two of them, and the reactions of the original Queen band members.  They also did it well [at the concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwdORJVw3-o), but I like the practice session more. 

""Worst""  (and still kind of 'best)- I've got mixed feelings about The Who recording [Barbara Ann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQP29vNPG4) .  That song was totally a Keith Moon love project, and it's a bit heart-rending to see such a great talent wasted away.  But I'm also a bit happy that it was caught on film- Moon always wanted to a be a Beach Boy, and while it's nice to see the original band fucking around a bit, most of what I see is that Keith Moon was on his last legs. What a tragedy.

Fraud generally has an element of *scienter* -- the intent to realize a gain or avoid a loss through misrepresentation or deceit. 

If I hand you a check, post-dated or not, and tell you at that moment ""the check's no good -- don't cash it until Friday"", then there is no misrepresentation or deceit.

If I wrote the check believing the money was there, and then later warned you not to cash it, that's also not fraud.

If I wrote the check intending to deceive you, delivered the check, and then sometime later had a change of heart and warned you that it was no good -- *that* would be a fraud, completed upon delivery of the bad check.

Simply playing the game and wishing you were playing something else is completely without meaning in this arguement as it doesn't truly add anything.

To your credit, however, you then provide another reason as to your belief. ""...If they removed the hacking, it could easily pass as a GTA clone.""

This may in fact be true, however that takes away what makes Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs. The game has a large basis in hacking from what I understand. If you took away the crazy and silly antics of Saints Row, it could be argued, you'd also end up with a GTA clone.

This is most apparent when Riker and Picard are on the phaser range at the beginning of TNG 2x08: 'A Matter of Honor' -- they're hitting these small, moving targets with Type II phasers, and their aiming appears to be cursory at best.

*The March survey, from the National College Players Association and Drexel University, said that the projected fair market value of the average college football player is $178,000 per year from 2011 to 2015, while the projected market value for the average college basketball player for the same time is $375,000.*

Clearly, that is worth wayyyyy more then the average degree, and the players are entitled to this. It isn't unreasonable.

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","I'm not sure I'd say the casting for Wray was a problem, necessarily, but doubling up is something writers like to do, and it's an annoying trend. In some ways it goes back to your point about Greer: they need to do something to make the minority character interesting, but it seems like writers often can't think of anything besides making the character part of a second minority group. (For another example, I don't think it's a coincidence that Geordi La Forge is both black and blind. Or, if you remember the Michael J. Fox vehicle *Sin City*, that his friend was both black and gay.) But obviously real life contains lots of Asian women who are lesbians, so it's not like creating the character that way is offensive.

As for Greer... I'm less sympathetic to your argument on that one. They couldn't think of any other way to make the character interesting than to put another angry young black man on TV? Couldn't they imagine a flaw that didn't play into stereotypes? For that matter, why couldn't they have cast a black actor as Scott and a white actor as Greer? I assume they played into the trope the audience expected. That's business, but it's kind of racist.","1401581440"

He is a practitioner of ""new Indian history,"" which focuses on native agency and the contingency of the encounter process.  The argument is somewhat self explanatory in the title:  the Comanches created a rival ""imperial"" power in the continent that seriously challenged Euro-American powers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Most historians I've talked with believe that Hamalainen has stretched his evidence, but it is intentionally and explicitly meant to push on the historiography.  In my opinion, it's often good to be controversial. 

A classic would be Richard White's *The Middle Ground*.  It focuses on the processes of ""creative misunderstandings"" that characterized native interactions with the French and British.  Although it focuses on the Pays d'en Haut (Great Lakes) region, it has become the touchstone of early American historiography.  ","1401581441"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I agree with you that Bitcoin is the leader and most likely remain so for a fairly long period of time. But IMO putting all your eggs in the same basket is a bad idea. For example, I'd much rather buy a diversified portfolio with ebay, overstock, amazon and alibaba in it, then simply buying Amazon stocks because of ""it's the biggest one"".

This seems to stand true even more for something as new as Bitcoin. For example what if a new coin came up that was doing something useful instead of simply hashing proof-of-work? That'd be much more sustainable then the waste of energy the blockchains are right now. I see a lot of people here that are quick to dismiss altcoins as ""garbage clone"", but if you read the white papers some of them are truly innovative.

Finally, assuming a payment processor comes in and handles 1000 different cryptos, I wouldn't see why a merchant wouldn't go with that processor instead of one that only does BTC. Same amount of work for the merchant, but access to a larger audience. I'm not sure what scientific experiment Jimmy did, but I'd think that the analogy doesn't stand here.

   Another thing is that this vet put stitches in her eye and I had to bring her back every week for about a month, until I got tired of seeing her eye like that. I took her to another vet and he told me that there was no reason to put stitches in her eye and that she now had scar tissue built up. She's all fine now, but definitely makes me a little cautious.

I asked simple questions, and instead of answering those questions you just badmouthed people you don't agree with.  **The thread asked which principles of feminism you disagreed with.  No one asked you if feminists are stupid or if there was no discrimination of any kind in the country.  We asked you if you disagreed with the basic principles.  You do not in fact disagree with feminist principles.  You don't even appear to disagree with feminist laws.**

In the REAL world, what really happened is feminists supported the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act which ACTUALLY made it illegal to discriminate against women economically and enforced that law.  Until Democrats had the house, a supermajority in the Senate, and Obama in the White House Republicans blocked basic legislation that made it ENFORCEABLY ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE.

Up until that time, the laws said that you couldn't sue your employer unless you found out within 6 months of the 1st check that you were being underpaid as a woman.  Which means that virtually all discrimination was legal, because you couldn't sue an employer after you found out 8 years later that they had underpaid you as a woman.  Almost no one finds out within 6 months and the ones that do have very small damages (as it's only a few months of back pay instead of years).","1401581443"

But which makes me think that the 42 NNS car has that CGR financial backing is when Dylan raced in the 42 and not the 31. That and because when he was in the 42 that was still Target sponsored while the 31 was  unsponsored which told me a few things.

Target was willing to still sponsor the 42 even with Dylan Kwasneski in it, and he's only been signed to CGR as a developmental driver since I think Las Vegas. Target is willing to trust anything Chip will put his name on, that I'm surprised there isn't a Gamassi section at Target. Also the Target money stream has to obviously larger than the rocks star stream, and obviously Rockstar is there because of Dylan.

An incredibly powerful film about war and human nature.

* La Belle Equipe by Julien Duvivier

You know what? FUCK NEW WAVE! Godard, Truffaut, Rivette, Rohmer and their friends smeared directors like Julien Duvivier, René Clair or Claude Autant-Lara but they were great directors. La Belle Equipe is a proof of that.

* That Man from Rio by Philippe de Broca.

The film that invented the adventure comedy genre. Broca wanted to make a live Tintin movie but didn't have the rights. In the end, he borrowed a lot from Tintin books and made this film. And it's awesome.

* OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and OSS 117 by Michel Hazanavicius: Lost in Rio.

Two of the best french comedies that came out lately (screw The Intouchables!). If you want to understand the actual french state of mind nowadays, you have to want these movie. They describes accurately our self-deprecating, both proud of our past greatness and ashamed of our colonial and racist politicies humour. And the political incorrectness of the hero is funny as hell.

* The French Kissers by Riad Sattouf

The only good french teen-comedy. It is spot-on about how it sucked to be a teenager loser in the 90s in France. And it is hilarious.

* Un singe en hiver by Henri Verneuil

If you ask me, THE BEST FRENCH MOVIE EVER. Young Belmondo and old Gabin meet in this movie about two men with dreams bigger than their actual lifes and how they drink to reconnect with their dreams. It could be plainly sad, it is actually incredibly funny, incredibly moving, incredibly beautiful.

The only part I read was when some woman at a conference was propositioned in a lift. From there she went on to do lecture tours to tell atheists about this their terrible sexist objectification. Dawkins wrote that her experience didn't seem like a big deal and PZ went on the warpath.

&gt;There is an odd attitude in our culture that it’s acceptable for men to proposition women in curious ways — Rebecca Watson recently experienced this in an elevator in Dublin, and I think this encounter Ophelia Benson had reflects the same attitude: women are lower status persons, and we men, as superior beings, get to ask things of them. Also as liberal, enlightened people, of course, we will graciously accede to their desires, and if they ask us to stop hassling them, we will back off, politely. Isn’t that nice of us?

I don't recognize this terrible sexist attitude in the skeptic movement and followed the story no further.

I don't understand why you would choose not to. I know it's great to be able to do what you want, but (and without bringing burdens of proof and all that into it) is there an argument to be made *against* wearing a helmet? I'm not talking about arguments against helmet *laws*, but I'd like to know why you choose not to wear a helmet, apart from because you don't want to. *Why* don't you want to?

Are they too expensive? Uncomfortable? Don't like how they look?

I want to know what makes you look at a helmet and say, 'I'm not putting that on my head'.

Look at [this man](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-07-04-motorcycle-helmet-protest-death_n.htm). He protested helmet laws for motorcyclists. He got in an accident and died and would have (according to police **º**) survived had he been wearing a helmet. So, it's great he made that choice and only he suffered the consequences, but at the end of the day, he still *died*. So he's left behind friends, family etc, and can't do all the things he enjoyed in life.

So you don't wear a helmet because you don't want to, get in an accident that leaves you a vegetable for the rest of your life which you would've gotten out of unscathed had you been in a helmet …why? I don't think this is a lesser toll on you than wearing a helmet.

(**º** regardless of the particulars of this case, it is undeniable there exist accidents in which the victim's life is saved by a helmet.)

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt;No offense meant, but you are still ignoring the difference between fact and opinion. 

And you're ignoring that every single thing I've said can be backed up. When no one in STL watches the Rams, when they aren't selling out their stadium, when they aren't buying merchandise, it isn't an opinion when you say they don't care. The facts available show that they don't care. 

&gt;Not everyone can afford tickets and merchandise

You're right. But everyone can afford to watch the game on TV though, and the Rams were 28th in their local market TV rating. 

Every metric available to determine how much a fanbase cares indicates that STL doesn't give a shit about the Rams.

&gt;Not everyone can afford tickets and merchandise, but more importantly, you're making a blanket statement that you could never prove to be true.

Except there are statistics available which show how much support a team receives. These include ticket sales, twitter followers, facebook friends, TV ratings, merchandise sales, etc. The Rams are one of the worst teams in the league by all of those metrics.

&gt;but to discount an entire city's passion for a team based on attendance is not a very intelligent way of approaching the subject.

I'm not discounting them only on attendance. They're one of the least followed teams on social media, they're one of the lowest rated TV markets, and they're one of the worst merchandise sellers.

&gt;and the burden of proof isn't on me, it's on you.

And I've provided **plenty** of proof. Why does the Rams fan who said people care not have to prove that people care about the Rams but I have to prove that they don't (Which I did)? Seems kind of weird to jump on the only guy in this thread who backed his words up with evidence for not backing up his words with evidence.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Alright, time to clarify. Staying near cover, not being out in the open, angling the armor, getting the first shot in engagements, that's how you should play any slow tank. I know that, and I do it. What I meant by shit tank was the fact that it doesnt really have any redeming qualities other than a very powerful gun. Yeah, blowing up Panzers sky high with one shot is admitedly very fun, but at what cost? Not-that-good armor, slow movement, slow turning, slow traverse, slow reload, bad gun depression, low muzzle velocity for HE, making it harder to shoot over long ranges, large size, and a tendency to explode because of the ammo. Not to mention, as soon as the crew (especially loader) starts getting damaged/killed, the tank becomes unbearable to play, and I might as well bail out. 

Tanks need a ballance between armor, mobility, and armament. The KV-2 only has one of those (or two if your weakspots are unknown to the enemy). Maybe ""shit tank"" is a bit too harsh, but I would never consider this a good machine. The ZIS version is better, but it goes up a gains better tanks as well, so it doesn't matter.","1401581458"

My advice is to take this before God. Pray. Read the scripture and look at the examples of successful churches therein. Meditate on what your beliefs actually are, what you want out of a church service, and the role church will play in your relationship with God. Explore your city and visit different services and find the one that helps you grow in Him.

1: you could try withholding sex until she is sexually aroused and then more willing to participate in oral sex. Ease into it and don't force it on her.

It's not like she's giving you none any way. 3: relationships change. The road is long and the dynamics of a marriage tend to change over time. What she doesn't like today may change tomorrow.

"Vemma","t5_2uikd","&gt;Vemma is not get rich quick, it takes time and effort, those that call it unlit are either cross recruiters or people that didn't take the time to actually learn about the business. 

By design, a significant portion of people actively lose money by existence within the ""business"". 97% of everyone in Vemma makes less than minimum wage. 77% of everyone in Vemma makes $1,600 or less every year (source is https://www.vemma.com/backoffice/pdf/income-disclosure.pdf and 2013 is the most current data available from them; you can find the 2012 numbers and compare them) - and that's before ANY costs of doing business. The very structure of MLM/network marketing/pyramid schemes requires consistent recruitment of more and more people and when there aren't more people, the pyramid collapses.

&gt;Here's the deal, Vemma bypasses regular advertising methods because they are ineffective. Verve would not compete well with Red Bull in the traditional space. So those same dollars are used to pay affiliates.

Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope-nope. Nope. Those dollars are paid to the guys at the top. Those dollars are paid to the Alkazins and Mortons and BK ""Scamming Fuckhead of New Brunswick"" Boreyko sitting on piles of other people's money. When 99% of money goes to the top &lt;2% of everyone, what does that tell you about affiliates? When 96.79% of every penny paid out in Vemma goes to the top 0.62% of the pyramid (a mere 653 people compared to the 105,251 people in Vemma), the idea of the ""foot soldier"" worker seeing the efforts of the business's success is fucking hilariously delusional. (source: https://www.vemma.com/backoffice/pdf/income-disclosure.pdf with some completely transparent math you can do on your own)

&gt;We do not sell the drinks, we are customers who refer others to the companies products, the company sells the product. You get advertising commission off of if the company sells the product which is tracks back to you.

You get ""commission"" which you have to buy a certain amount of product every money to qualify for. You NEED to spend money out of your own pocket just to earn the right for a paycheck. That is, unless, you recruit enough people to buy it regularly, putting the focus on recruitment rather than selling the product. Why the hell would I buy something through you when I could just buy a product from the website? Unless, of course, you make money on recruitment. To call yourself a ""referral network"" is pretty freaking disingenuous. 

&gt;$3 a can is cheap when you consider the full nutritional use of the products. A full vitamin dose, full spectrum minerals, mangosteen, aloe vera, and then healthy sugars and natural flavors. Cut out a lot of the things you already spend money on and have a healthier product and it makes sense.

None of which have any conclusive or at all reliable scientific data supporting the claims made about them. http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775248/ demonstrate this precisely.

&gt;Every dollar you pay is towards the product, you are never paid to sign someone up. All these people (Hence above) who say they lost money are joking with you. I have a membership to Direct TV which also has an affiliate program, I haven't gotten free service from it but I still have it every month. I haven't lost 1000's of dollars cause I'm getting a quality product in TV.

Regarding ""every dollar you pay is towards the product"": Yes, because as an affiliate, you are required to regularly purchase your own product just to qualify to make money. You need to pay out of your own pocket and hope you can recruit people who aren't better than you at recruiting (since if they recruit someone who recruits 3 people, that one person doesn't count toward your possibly free product). Oh, and you have to spend all of your own money finding leads, tracking people down, and abusing current friendships/relationships to recruit. Oh, and you're the one stuck with your dick wagging around because you're making bogus health claims about the product (as you see people doing in this subreddit without pausing for breath). Oh, and when you are devoting 60 hours a week to finding people to get a very tiny slice of the Vemma coffers, I'll be sitting back and enjoying making more than what 99% of Vemma makes AND enjoying a retirement AND health benefits AND professional certifications AND credible education.

Regarding ""you are never paid to sign someone up"": **BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT.** Page 13 of your fucking compensation plan. http://www.vemma.com/Backoffice/pdf/compensationPlan.pdf You filthy, lying, sack of steaming predatory shit. Even on their damn website, there's a whole page devoted to it. http://www.vemma.com/opportunity/frenzy.cfm

&gt;Same goes with this, I cut out all the unhealthy things, use these products, and now it's not even an expense let a lone i'm ""losing money""

There is informed speculation regarding any fad diet or health product that having a person simply pay attention to things like portion sizes and balanced meals are enough to produce results; their consumption of an expensive product (which makes a variety of unfounded and fraudulent health claims) has nothing to do with their results. If you actually ARE not losing money, congrats on moving away from the bottom 40% of Vemma (according to their own numbers at https://www.vemma.com/backoffice/pdf/income-disclosure.pdf which are suspect to begin with) who are losing money just to stay in the business (the price of the mandatory regular purchase plus shipping/handling is more than what they would make from doing.... whatever it is they are ""paid"" to do). I'd have to wonder how long you've been with Vemma and what level you have reached.

&gt;People are just uneducated and don't know how this works, If you want a real opinion from someone that knows what they are talking about, email me:

I'll leave you with the FTC talking about pyramid schemes: http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ia_pyramid.htm#.U4prdygvBGA

&gt;* No genuine product or service. MLM programs involve selling a genuine product or service to people who are not in the program. Exercise caution if there is no underlying product or service being sold to others, or if what is being sold is speculative or appears inappropriately priced.

&gt;* Promises of high returns in a short time period. Be leery of pitches for exponential returns and ""get rich quick"" claims. High returns and fast cash in an MLM program may suggest that commissions are being paid out of money from new recruits rather than revenue generated by product sales.

&gt;* Easy money or passive income. Be wary if you are offered compensation in exchange for little work such as making payments, recruiting others, and placing advertisements.

&gt;* No demonstrated revenue from retail sales. Ask to see documents, such as financial statements audited by a certified public accountant (CPA), showing that the MLM company generates revenue from selling its products or services to people outside the program.

&gt;* Buy-in required. The goal of an MLM program is to sell products. Be careful if you are required to pay a buy-in to participate in the program, even if the buy-in is a nominal one-time or recurring fee (e.g., $10 or $10/month).

&gt;* Complex commission structure. Be concerned unless commissions are based on products or services that you or your recruits sell to people outside the program. If you do not understand how you will be compensated, be cautious.

&gt;* Emphasis on recruiting. If a program primarily focuses on recruiting others to join the program for a fee, it is likely a pyramid scheme. Be skeptical if you will receive more compensation for recruiting others than for product sales.

1. A can of ""energy drink"" (which features ""benefits"" which haven't actually been demonstrated to be true) for twice the price of regularly-available products seems to hit this one.

2. I'll point you to the ""frenzy bonuses"" as listed on page 13 of the compensation plan above.

3. Just gotta get the word out and you'll be RETIRING MOM AND DAD in NO TIME!

4. The day BK Boreyko releases this information will be the day the FTC rips it from his greedy, spray-tanned fingers.

5. Affiliate packs ahoy! http://www.vemma.com/opportunity/get-paid.cfm Oh, and dat recurring autoship requirement to make money (according to https://www.vemma.com/backOffice/pdf/vemmapnp.pdf you need to have autoship to qualify for the cycle bonus and the frenzy bonus, page 5)

6. 18 pages to describe how much money you make? http://www.vemma.com/Backoffice/pdf/compensationPlan.pdf Go ahead and thumb through that and let me know if any of that makes sense.

7. That frenzy bonus again! Oh, and that if you recruit more people, you get your product for free! (because then you'll have 3 people who will have to be paying the monthly fee).

Just take the rear wheel off by disconnecting the chain, or loosening the chain enough, then haul it down to your local motorcycle shop and have them replace the tire and balance. You could balance it yourself but that's for another day. 

Or if you're really just very new to this and don't want to bother, just drive the bike down to the shop, and ask them politely to do it. i'm sure they will provided you have a few $ to give them in exchange. 

Why don't you narrow down the problem you're having? are you having trouble taking the rear wheel off?

This issue doesn't exist for other forms of entertainment now that we're in the digital age.  A digital copy of a movie or a video will exist forever, and likely be watchable forever.

"Backcountry","t5_2sa05","Knew I forgot something. I do carry a snow saw and inclinometer. Also started recently carrying a rutschblock cord, its pretty convenient for isolating an ect. Although its pretty easy with a flicklock snow saw as well.

I find I usually break out the inclinometer when I'm digging a pit as a way to keep my slope estimating skills reasonably sharp, rather than to measure the actual slope I'm going to ski. Usually I end up making conservative enough terrain choices on a high danger day that I'm certain its well under too steep for that given day.

A map is something I usually carry during spring when I'm skiing peaks, usually in the form of my phone running trimble (highly recommend that app btw). Most of my mid winter touring is done in areas that I know very well so usually don't carry a map then.","1401581486"
"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","Ugh! I hate to be ""that dude"". 1st off, congratulations and thank you for sharing. But, if you believe in C&amp;R, please consider gently hand releasing them back into the water rather than just lobbing them back in. I'm not trying to just be negative at all. Rather, consider that fish are not physically structured for gravity or impact. They spend their lives in watery bouancy and have little need to develop a bone structure capable of withstanding whatever G forces are present at being lobbed through the air to impact with the surface tension of the water. Consider what would happen to you if you were jerked up and thrown into the water from maybe 24' at whatever angle you were pitched at. And, I guarantee you have a skeleton and organs far more capable of withstanding that than an overweight, or even an underweight fish. C&amp;R results in some unknown amount of fish deaths within 48 hrs or so. If you are going to do it, please consider doing it right. We need guys like you who are capable of repeatedly getting the slabs to make sure there are more slabs in the gene pool.","1401581486"

I over powered around a corner and dumped it. I went sliding down the street some 40 feet or so in shorts and a tee-shirt. I can't say that was fun, but all of that rests on me. I'm the one who dumped it while riding in shorts. 

If you are going to do it, ease into it. Especially since you don't have a history with them, get something cheap and light. If you find you fall in love with it, then trade up. 

If you are going to do it, learn defensive driving. It really doesn't matter if you had the right of way if you are wrapped up in the axle of a truck that didn't see you. The best way to not get run over is to not be there. Don't ride beside cars. Don't run left behind a car stopped in front of you - the on coming traffic will cream you. If you have to ride on the highway next to another car, get right up by the driver's window, come to realize its your job to make sure they know you are there. Assume every car is about to change lanes without seeing you and be ready for that. When you are riding, assume every car you see sitting in a parking lot trying to turn into the street is going to pull out in front of you. 

It really is fun, but it really is your constant job to make sure you are going to get run over. You can't afford to be arrogant and refuse to yield to drives who are encroaching on your right of way. ","1401581489"

1. You don't need to spend £63 on a Wireless Adapter.
2. A 290X will outperform the 780 and be great for when you decide to go 4k - You can also crossfire.
3. A Gold rated PSU is a better option at this price point and the XFX unit is solid and has full black cables.
4. The SSD out performs the Sandist and it a bit cheaper.

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Hi,

That's a pretty intense workbench for your first project.  I would recommend going with something simpler but functional and then use it to build a better workbench once you have some skills under your belt and you _truly_ understand what you will be using your workbench for.  There are so many nuances and types to and of woodworking and as /u/joelav mentioned, it may be wise to wait to see ""how"" you're going to be using your workbench and define all the little variables (height, width, surface material, vice locations) before investing a lot of money and time into something that you may wish you did differently after a few months and years.

That said, here's my go-to advice for any beginner woodworker which contains links to the workbench I built as my first project.  It's simple, functional, cheap, doesn't require many tools to build, and incredibly sturdy.   Good Lunk!

Here is a great site to get you started: [Woodgears Beginner Page](http://woodgears.ca/beginner/)

I ate up literally everything I could find.  I spent hours watching The Wood Whisperer, Wood Working for Mere Mortals, Fine Woodworking Beginner series.  Watch and read EVERYTHING you can.  [Here is my Evernote folder of a plethora of good stuff](https://www.evernote.com/pub/tmbridge/woodworking).

**I started building a work bench.  [This workbench](http://www.finewoodworking.com/item/18985/still-dont-have-a-workbench-this-one-is-easy) for which you only need a router, circ saw, and drill.**

Since I got a router, I wanted to build a router table, but just something quick and dirty.  So I built [this Minimalist router table](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTcKBk05ZvVePyBr-FcK2uSHDOJAgl-I0YboUaGBqf29ue87S6_jA).   It's basically just a slab with a hole and a pivot fence. 

Since deciding to get into the hobby, I prowl Craigslist for good deals on tools.  You can use the [Craigslist Notification Chrome Addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/craigslist-notification/aenadocogjnkbmchfnkpipdinoleakbj?hl=en-US) to set up ""saved searches"" and get a notification when someone posts a listing that would be a hit on your search.  I found a contractor table saw for $40 and figured why not.  Picked that guy up and then decided to build The Wood Whisperer's style cross cut sled for that.  I've since upgraded to a better table saw, and added a bandsaw and drill press to my kit.   You can also check out [IRS Auctions](http://irsauctions.com) for great deals on used machines.

Now I've got quite a few handcut dovetail attempts under my belt and bought the necessary tools for that task.  I've built a few cutting boards (end and edge), picture frames, and boxes.  I'm current working on a [Morris Chair (here's my LJ blog posts about it)](http://lumberjocks.com/TimBridge/blog/41183) and am now plunging head first into the world of finishing (which is a whole different skillset in and of itself) and growing my finishing tools/supply kit. I've also purchased a book on Box Making Basics and am experimenting with mitered boxes, dovetailed boxes, different lids, panels, etc.

**SO my advice to you, which you can probably infer, is start with shop projects that you need for your shop.  Do you have a woodworking workbench?  Build one.  Do you have a Cross cut sled?  Build one.  Do y ou have a router table?  Build one.  As you build those things, you'll find out which kind of tools you need.  Once you get some experience with those tools, you'll learn what you can do with those tools.  Then you'll start thinking of things to learn, practice, build, do on your own, organically.**  

To me, there are 5 tools that every shop needs to be minimally functional. They are:  Circular Saw, Router, Jigsaw, Random Orbit Sander, and Drill.  The ""evolved"" versions of these follow when needed/when affordable (Table saw, plunge router/router table, bandsaw, drill press). Buy the rest as you need 'em.  Let your projects lead you into your tools and new projects.

Your tool list and project backlog will happen on its own.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","It's Unfortunate that you've experienced that. There are always bad apples as well as a lot of misinformation out there on the internet regarding them as a group. I don't identify as an MRA, and while I do float around the community, I don't really participate too much. Usually the MRAs I get exposed to are the ones actually discussing the issues, as apposed to people just bitching and complaining. 

&gt;They really do believe that life is easy if you're female and hard if you're male. They really do believe that society is anti-male, and that misogyny doesn't exist (or, if it does, women deserve it).

I've seen claims of it being easier to be a woman, but easier doesn't mean easy. Generally though I feel these claims are too subjective. 
What we do know is that men are tried and convicted of the same crime more than women, they face harsher prison sentences. Depending on area they are around 1/3 to 1/2 of domestic violence victims but are far more likely to be the one arrested if police are called. Not to mention looked down upon for being a victim. Male genital mutilation is still a normal thing in Canada and the US. There are almost no places for a guy to turn to for help, unless they have the money for professional help. I think all of Canada, at the time of me writing this, might have one shelter for men. But I think i'm wrong, I don't think there are any right now. Government wont fund them.

Men are raised to 'suck it up' and 'deal with it' by 'being a man'. This type of mentality clouds their judgment when they're mistreated. It's easy to brush off sexual harassment when can't tell that it's happening to you. Also you're a man, you can handle anything brah... But when you have that epiphany and realize that these things do happen, and you don't have anybody to talk to about these realizations because most of your guy friends 'don't get it' and female friends insist it 'doesn't happen to guys'. What do you do? How do you deal with that reality? Some people become angry and spiteful, some are more constructive. 


I don't know how many hold the idea that society is anti-men, but society has always treated men as a disposable assets. It's part of what makes it difficult to get government support.","1401581498"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Ok I want to clear up a common misconception...Not all transgendered people feel the need to have sexual reassignment surgery! The desire for sexual reassignment surgery, some transgendered people believe, promotes a paradigm of binary heteronormativity...which is something that transgendered people so vehemently fight against. 

Let me break it down:

*Sex* is biological. Gender is not. Gender is created by society. Society is created by humans. Therefore, gender is created by humans; it’s created by the mind. It’s completely fictional. Gender does not exist as a constant...it's an ever-changing societal ideology that never means the same thing at two separate points in time.

So let me reiterate. It's a false assumption to accuse transgendered people of all being compelled to have body modification - this is simply untrue. Body modification and sexual reassignment surgery are ideologies perpetuated by the heteronormative patriarchy that we live in (this is what is believed - not saying I agree or disagree). We as a society try to dichotomize transgendered people to ""pick"" one gender. Many transgendered people fight to eliminate the necessity to pick a gender.

Trans is a lot more than what you make it seem. Trans is more a fluid concept. Some Trans folk find trans to be an ever changing third gender. It's not black and white. 

I don't know if I really answered your question but I wanted to clarify some assumptions you had, which hopefully in turn will open your eyes a bit!","1401581501"

"Diablo3DemonHunters","t5_2w1a3","So it looks like you want to run fire demon hunter.

The main aspect of this build is getting resource cost reduction through gear (mainly cindercoat) and resource regain (reapers fear), so that you can as many cluster arrows as possible.

It is the build where if you want to kill an elite pack in 5 seconds this is the build. As long as you have hatred you will deal damage.

The main problem this build has is that it sacrifices survival stats for the resource cost reduction stat, so you will die a lot. Also until you reach the sweet spot of having enough resource reduction to actually fire CA all the time you will be feeling rather weird.

The build is straight forward. Cluster Arrow and a generator (for now).
You can get fancy and use multishot to regain disicpline that you will use for punishment to regain hatred.

Passives you choose depending of what you need.
More survival? Perfectionist / Awareness
More damage? Ambush / Single out / Steady aim / Archery / cull the weak (this one is bad imo)
Resource regain? (Blood Vengeance / Night stalker (with punishment)","1401581501"

"bodyweightfitness","t5_2tf0a","I have a problem with the outside of my right leg which sounds similar to Aosdnoae’s problem. I used to keep my leg tucked underneath my chair and pressed against the leg. Now when I flex my muscle in my leg there is a visible dip roughly in the shape of the support of the chair I sat in. It hurts to the point of having to stop and give it a rest. I went from doing nothing but sitting around all day to walking about a year ago. When I first started the muscle became so tight I could not put any weight on it. I was half a mile into my first walk when I found a bench and sat for thirty minutes dreading the walk back to my car. After the rest the walk back was fine and I ended walking almost 7 miles that day. 

I talked to my doctor about it and she said to stretch it before walking or lifting. I also apply heat to it about 30 minutes before I begin to work out. That has also helped quite a bit. There is a good chance that this is not at all what Aosdnoae’s post was about, but I used to describe it simply as a “hole” in the muscle in my leg.

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","There's a difference between 'hurt' and 'meaningfully effect'.  Blast away with that AR, using APDS or Explosive ammo, and you're still only really chipping bits away with that meaty damage resistance test with six auto-hits+it's Body+Armor.  

You wanna take down a Force 6 spirit as a Mundane in 5E?  Overlapping blasts is probably your best bet.  Two HE grenades bola style to put two simultaneous blasts dead on top of it, hopefully near at least one hefty barrier for chunky salsa.  

Failing that, rockets/missiles.

Failing that, monofilament whip/chainsaws.

Failing that, Assault Cannons or Sniper Rifles.  

Most Exotic Weapons like sonic stuff and injection stuff is useless, though that may change when the rules for FAB come in.

Spirits of Fire and Water have Allergies to each other; tracers/Incendiary/flare ammo works well on Water Spirits.  Fire's a bit trickier, so check your environment.  As a GM, I extend the vulnerability to Fire Extinguishers too.  Helps to have a Decker hack the fire suppression system if you wanna take them down.

If you don't have an Awakened character available or an Awakened Merc on-call who can support DAMN QUICK . . . I guess get a buncha points in Handle Animal, armor with maximum Fire Resistance, and try to tame a Hellhound as a dual-natured watchdog for the team?  Great for Water Spirits, at least.","1401581508"

Try fighting the first bosses in DS1 again and you'll notice the same thing, you didn't the first time because you were the new player. I played through DS1 and DS2 and I'd say that DS2 were the better game. DS1 wasn't far behind and would pass it if they implented some of the improvements of DS2: 

More titanite. In DS1 you could only fully upgrade 2-3 weapons/armors, that's not even a full set! If you chose a weapon you were stuck with it. More variance = more fun.

More spells. DS2 did this better and I hope DS3 will introduce even more new stuff.

Level reset. In DS2 I could just level up what I felt was right and if I changed my mind 30 hours later I can fix it. In DS1 I felt I had to reserach a decent build and then I couldn't leave it without being very behind.

Rocky- Starts off as a bum who's afraid to take chances but ends up overcoming the odds and believing in himself

Adrian- Starts off shy and timid, being brow beaten by her brother and uncomfortable with social situations. Ends up standing up for herself, commits to her relationship with Rocky 

Paulie- Starts off as a whiny buffoon who's abusive and essentially trying to use his friend to get what he perceives as a 'better job'. Ends up mellowing out and using his own initiative to both help his friend and make some money on the side

Micky- Begins hating Rocky and pushing him away, reinforcing that he's a bum with no future, attempts to leach onto Rocky's newfound celebrity to relive some glory days. Ends up putting his full faith in Rocky and even encourages him to give up in the final fight to protect him. 

Apollo- Starts as a cocky brash fighter who sees the whole fight with Rocky as a game, ends up realizing that he's screwed up somewhere and ends up having to have the fight of his life (his character is better developed in the sequel to be honest)

The whole theme of that film is people coming out of their shells and breaking out of the ruts their lives are in. It's a really well written screen-play that allows four different characters to share in one plot but all develop a character arc sharing a common theme.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","The most I've taken is 800 mgs and I kept getting hallucinations of my door opening and closing but other than that I got nothing. I ended up not being able to sleep because I got restless legs. I also saw some slight white lights swirling in the sides of my eyes. It was incredibly uncomfortable and I hated the experience in general and haven't done dph recreationally since. 

Anyways wait a couple days until you do DPH again. It has a tolerance and it's also pretty bad for your liver.

Most people will tell you not to do it and that it's a fairly stupid drug in general. I agree with them but if you do want to do it then I say go for it. That being said the only enjoyable dose of DPH for me has been 150 mgs. You get slightly high but it's a shitty high in general compared to any other drug. ","1401581516"

Presumably because py gives the centre of the sled, while collisions occur in a larger box. (Testing suggests the box is 0.1 high, as y=py-0.05 does not move)  Edit: If you run y=0 you'll notice the sled jump upwards slightly when you hit start, while y=-0.05 shows no movement, y=-0.1 drops slightly, adding evidence to this explanation","1401581516"

However, I'll give you a few tips while we're at it. You're going to want to focus primarily on carbohydrates and protein, especially carbohydrates. Carbs are best at eliciting an insulin response, which will encourage your cells to take up and retain the nutrients you've ingested.

The oils are certainly your most calorie-dense option, but they induce satiety and slow gastric emptying, making the high intake difficult to sustain, without being particularly insulinotropic. 

You do need some fat, so don't eliminate it completely from your diet, of course, but focusing on carbohydrates and a modicum of protein (1-2 grams of protein per kilogram of target lean muscle mass) is your best path.","1401581519"

We dont live in a utopia, we are not sentient beings. There will always be suffering, unfortunately. But we still light years ahead of animals, which one could argue suffer a worse fate; existing without even knowing it. While tragic as it might seem, suffering will always be a part of life. Tragedy and success pretty much make up the definition of human ""life"" if you think about it. We are not perfect, and even if we were ""suffering"" is one thing that i doubt we would even be able to change. everyone suffers, everyone succeeds; the degree of which varys of course, but nonetheless is a constant of life. So our goal, as the only conscious species on earth (that we know of) is to accomplish things that which makes us humans. I believe space travel (and general wonders) to be one of them.

For the record, im not a sadist. I do truly wish that we could end all tragedy on earth; however im just voicing an opinion. An opinion that, in the end, is just one piece to the much bigger puzzle of life.

From the top of the tower to the area near spawn in most orange maps is roughly 150-200 feet, and you can't repeatedly get hits on any class but sniper and spy from that range. A single shotgun pellet isn't reliably going to kill a chicken. Even with a thick carpet of chickens racing toward them, the merc's weapons are going to not only inaccurate, but also weak due to damage fall off. While the sentry is powerful and almost untouchable, it will run out of ammo very quickly without an engineer. 

[I did some rough math] (http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/20hndu/how_many_bidoofs_would_it_take_to_take_down_the/cg3bt6w) a while ago as to how many bullets the mercs have. It's roughly 1,500 bullets. Even with all of the mercs crowded around a dispenser to constantly replenish their ammo, they would still be swarmed by sheer numbers of chickens.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This above all others mentioned here has the most potential to have the most radical impact on human society.  You think the portable Internet has caused a revolution in how we interact and function now?  Just wait until expressing ourselves online no longer even takes the minor physical effort and time of typing it out or clicking ""Like"" and ""Upvote/Downvote.""  We may not have begun uploading our consciousnesses to the cloud yet, but we might as well have for the effect it will have.  
  
Opinions will fly faster, social groups will splinter, reform, and fracture again like eddies in a turbulent stream, and massive paradigm shifts will occur in afternoons and be gone again in a week, before anyone has had a chance to understood what happened.  And all will be recorded, analyzed, stored, modeled, and extrapolated upon by ultra-sophisticated algorithms run on computers far beyond even the most powerful machines we have today.  Corporate and political groups will turn our every online thought into a marketable product, each of us leaving a palpable data ghost that could, and inevitably will, be used to predict and profit from our every move, and perhaps even to serve as proxy for us in those rare moments when we go offline.  
  
It will mark the embryonic development of a new layer of the human ""self"", above the ego and the id and the lizard brain; and that layer will be one connected potentially to every other ""self"" on the planet - a nascent Digital Supermind^^^TM of humanity.  
  
We are on the cusp of another exponential leap in the rate of societal change, and it will strain our technological, political, and ecological infrastructures to the breaking point.  By 2050, large parts of the world will be completely unrecognizable compared to now, and the huge void we feel between now and 1980 will be like a tiny blip by comparison.","1401581525"

It's called [motivational interviewing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_interviewing)

If someone needs to lose weight, you don't tell them they need to lose weight. You ask,""do you have any concerns about your health? What are they? Oh you feel like you are a little too heavy right now? Have you done anything about it? What do you think you can do this week to help achieve your goal?"" 

Stuff like that. Yes, it doesn't always work, as it requires buy-in from the person you're talking to, but it's quite effective, and the literature supports it very much as an effective communication tool to inspire lifestyle change in patients as opposed to telling them they need to lose weight.

&gt;""Every autobiography is concerned with two characters, a Don Quixote, the Ego, and a Sancho Panza, the Self.""  Of course, adding Aldonza Lorenzo would make the story readable.

Poorly deployed quotation.  It's unsourced, so it's confusing.  And then its metatextual context doesn't pay off.  I thought you were going to make some interesting gesture about profiles as autobiography, but there's no such follow through.  Instead, it's airless.  You display your erudition without making it an invitation.  Do you think a woman is going to be enticed by *making your story readable*?  No.  She wants to forge a new story with you and with her talents, her agency, her voice.  ""Please fill the empty spot in my life"" is not an appealing entreaty.

So: your opener is alienating and annoying with a whiff of narcissism.

&gt;I'm serious, but also somewhat quirky, I've been told.

Why do you need to be told?

&gt;I'm serious about self-improvement, to the point of apotheosis.

Unnecessary comma and hugely self-aggrandizing word choice.

&gt;I don't think anyone should be content with themselves, if a better version is conceivable. 

Unnecessary comma.  Mixing singular and plural pronouns.  And this is another alienating sentiment.  Will you hold your relationships up to this same standard?  If you presented your drive as something that brings pleasure and texture to your life it might be endearing.  But your framing is so pompous, from the vocabulary to the quotation, that it doesn't sound much fun, despite your vaguely asserted quirkiness.

&gt;I don't live near any volcanos, so instead, I push myself into education and exercise.

Surely you realize that *volcanos* is the less common pluralization.  Is this one of the aforementioned quirks?

&gt;Academically, I gravitate toward ancient history, epistemology, universals, morality, gender studies, military science, literature, evolutionary biology, and ecology.

This is overstuffed in a way that's more about self-congratulation than outreach.  Will we see any of the insights you've gleaned glittering in your profile?  One word-borne snapshot from an unexpected perspective is more ingratiating than a hundred self-professed PhDs.

Also, you've again chosen a pompous word — ""gravitate"" — rather than something that would indicate joy.

&gt;But I since I wanna know everything, the list is missing a few subjects.

""I want to know everything"" would be so much more appealing (and mutual adventure-spurring) than this scroll of accomplishments you want us to be impressed by.  Poor sense of salience.

&gt;As for art, I play the piano. Fashion counts as art, right? Applied fashion is an interesting field. Vestis virum facet.

There's nothing in all these admissions about what it is for *you* to do these things.  You only inhabit them as self-congratulation fodder.

&gt;I enjoy traveling and exploration; you can learn a lot when you see things for yourself.

This is the kind of wisdom you have to offer after studying all those fields?  Really?

&gt;so I workout everyday

""Workout"" is a noun.  ""Everyday"" is an adjective.  You work out every day.

Okay, that's all the close reading I can bear.

Scanning the rest of your profile, there are interesting facets of your personality (urban infiltration sounds interesting), but the quote-dropping and suspender-thumbing aspects really grate on my sensibility.

I like profiles that convey a sense of someone's company.  Are you really this pronouncement-prone and high-score-keeping in person?

There's also a me-against-the-world aspect to your profile.  I don't detect much of a sense of community or warmth.  Instead, you're always apart from others — exercising to get away from the pack physiologically, mentally, and spatially.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it means you'll have to work extra hard to portray what a community of two would be like.  And you don't do that with much care: the catalog of pleasures at the end of your profile is painfully generic.

So I'd suggest taking a walk, thinking about what the pleasures of your company would be, and then trying to incorporate those details into your profile more than the bare impressiveness-mongering you've heaped there now.  Try to make those professions and details more revelatory and interesting.

Right now you seem intensely thought-collecting but not, frankly, very pensive.

Good luck.  I've seen a profile more alienating than yours turn into something really sweet and likable, so I know it can be done.","1401581527"

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","""During the early 1950s, the city of Los Angeles forcefully evicted the 300 families of Chavez Ravine to make way for a low-income public housing project. The land was cleared and the homes, schools and the church were razed. But instead of building the promised housing, the city—in a move rife with political controversy—sold the land to Brooklyn Dodgers baseball owner Walter O’Malley, who built Dodger Stadium on the site. The residents of Chavez Ravine, who had been promised first pick of the apartments in the proposed housing project, were given no reimbursement for their destroyed property and forced to scramble for housing elsewhere.

Fifty years later, filmmaker Jordan Mechner explores what happened, interviewing many of the former residents of Chavez Ravine as well as some of the officials who oversaw the destruction of the community. Narrated by Cheech Marin and scored by Ry Cooder and Lalo Guerrero, CHAVEZ RAVINE combines contemporary interviews with archival footage and Normark’s haunting black-and-white photographs to reclaim and celebrate a beloved community of the past.""

Edit:   How do stories about that in any way shape or form fill the very real need of the children for a father figure in their lives?


Edit 2:
You're comments are incredibly biased and seem to be designed to infect your readers with that same bias. 

 First, you make it sound like the primary cause of fatherlessness is that the men choose to abandon their children.  The truth is that it is much more common for mothers to leave, even when there is no abuse of any kind, taking the children with them.  There is also the matter of work related fatalities being far higher among men than women.  

Second, you seem to think that fatherlessness being much more prevalent than motherlessness isn't a legitimate reason for it to be talked about more often.  You're implying that there is some kind of sexism behind it.  

The bias (intentional or out of ignorance?) of your comments burns.  There is nothing more for us to talk about.  

Edit 3: 
&gt;Doctor Who wouldn't be so white and straight.

There have been some very strong black figures in the show (Martha and her family, Mickey, the family that Clara was staying with) and you could probably argue that gays have been over represented relative to the population at large in NuWho.  It's true that Jack was the only gay companion (could you consider Vastra and Jenny companions?  I probably would), but it seems like half the couples we meet during the Doctor's travels are gay.  I'm not faulting the show for that, I'm just pointing out your bias once again.

Edit 4:  Assuming that mothers and fathers have equal value to the development of a child (I do make this assumption) then it will be much more important to provide substitutes for the one that is in short supply (fathers in this case).","1401581533"

* Violent generic death episodes involve ""posh git"" types that have just moved to the area, it's never the newbie gits it's the local posh gits wanting land/money/power.

Even worse is if you buy from somebody using Steam Bux.  Think about it, if I pay somebody 10 Steam Bux, Valve ALREADY HAS that money.  There is no actual money changing hands, because it's already in Valve's hands.

It still doesn't mean they weren't wrong. They weren't true at all, that was not a truth back then because it is not true now, it is only a lie that was believed to be true.

No, the lie believed as the truth varies. You are working on flawed logic that ignores the definition of truth.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Orianna is not *that* meta a pick, really. It's situationally strong, but it wasn't a great pick in that game, against so much mobility and with nobody to put the ball on for an initiate. Voy's Nid is actually pretty good IMO, and his Lulu brought him some pretty good success late last split. While his LeBlanc is largely hit-or-miss, it is pretty well on-par with other LCS mids.

And his off-meta or personal picks are pretty damn strong too. He has developed into a pretty remarkable Syndra for someone who hadn't really ever been a mage player previously, his Yasuo is (as you mentioned) excellent, and his Kayle play is ban-worthy (although against LMQ he had one pretty bad ult which probably cost them their comeback). 

In the end I don't entirely disagree, but I think that from watching his performance on his stream lately as opposed to his LCS play (and that's with his LCS play being generally pretty good so far) his main problem is not in his champion pool because I find it to be pretty broad and capable at most if not all top picks, but in his mentality going into LCS games.","1401581538"

It's much harder to do well when your team isn't doing what they're supposed to, and it can make you look bad. I'm not saying Brokenshard is the best player on Complexity, but he's the most likely (as a jungler) to suffer from his team underperforming.

1) developing countries need to pay in hard currency ($US) for using Tier 1 internet networks (like Level 3). This can get quite expensive for many countries and they need to make up the difference by charging more.

However, El Salvador is somewhat an exception to this rule (like Ecuador and Panama are too) since El Salvador uses the $US as its currency. 

Eventhough El Salvador uses the $US, what is $1 worth in El Salvador would be like $5 worth in the USA. The $US costs much more in El Salvador than in the USA. 

2) No competition from other sources. More than likely, there is no competition and they can charge whatever price they want to charge for maximum profit. 

In most developing countries, the rich upper classes control most of the wealth in the country since they can charge any price they want to charge.

Winning the group, much to your disagreement, is actually pretty important. England would have played Ghana instead of Germany, and would have actually had a chance to progress. English fans were quite upset after Hart let in the goal against the US. I was in GB, I watched the news, I don't know how you can argue otherwise.

But there's very little research on virtual child pornography itself.  I would speculate that is, in part, because any discussion of virtual child pornography being less than obscene and evil is viewed as a defense of pedophilia.

The problem is actually the same problem with saying that marijuana is a gateway drug.  It is *absolutely true* that most people who try crack cocaine or meth also at some point used marijuana.  If phrased as ""how many people who do meth also used marijuana"" it looks like marijuana strongly correlates.

But if phrased as ""what proportion of people who use marijuana go on to use meth"", the correlation becomes muted.  Which leads one to belief that it's ""people who do meth also do marijuana"" not ""marijuana leads people to do meth.""

Men realise the actual real implications of sexism, of course they do. Often the reality is different though to the perception of a lot of women. You're not constantly in danger regardless of how it feels, that's called paranoia. You're not going to be attacked and thinking that way is dangerous and only makes people into recluses.

&gt;I can't tell you how many shocked boyfriends I've demonstrated the keys-between-the-fingers technique to.

They're shocked because *that's incredibly paranoid*. You'd probably react the same way if someone told you they carry a knife to ward off attackers, because it's a ridiculous over reaction that goes way beyond a sensible precaution.

&gt;Also, his assaults weren't exactly random.

Yes, he was angry at women and attacked random women. He was also *insane*.

It's the same as quoting a bunch of news articles about women teachers having sex with students and then trying to project that onto *literally every woman* in the most patronising way possible.

""Look, *you* might not be a pedophile, but you need to be told these statistics as if you are or could possibly make a difference somehow.""

Imagine being told that, and when you explain that you already know it's horrible and that you don't do it or agree with it for it to be made into a joke and some ineffectual hashtag in an even more patronising way. 

""#NotAllWomen, LOL! Let me lecture you about child sex offences anyway because it's *your culture that perpetuates it*!""

Can you see why men are resistant to this sort of generalisation? For many it will turn them against you purely out of spite, and that helps nobody. It's where the extreme end of the anti feminists come from.","1401581549"

In and of itself, it's less of an encouraging phrase and more something that makes the journey towards becoming good seem like an arduous and tiring climb with no end in sight. All in all, while I do agree that in most cases practice does indeed serve to make one exceptional at whatever they are attempting, present case a perfect example, to me it's an overused phrase that promotes frustration.

Maybe I am indeed alone in this thought, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case; but that's the thought that lead me to writing the above comment.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","same reason everyone else is. They think Americans are fat lazy, ugly, greedy, and stick their noses where it doesn't belong. Its not secret Israel was founded as a classless society built around agricultural communes and ethnonationalism.

They also really dislike American and most western Jews because they think they are shallow, weak, and uncomitted. The history behind this is, durring the 1890s, their ancestors moved to Israel, gave up banking and proffesional trades to be farmers, settlers, and frontiersmen. Most of the original zionism was inspired by the same socialist and nationalist forces in germany that would later manefest into national socialism in Germany. Theodore Hertzel was very much a nationalist, and very much inspired by his German nationalist contemporaries.

Zionism from its very roots also disparages traditional European Jewish culture for a more Germanized version. the founders of what is now Likud even said the only problem they had against fascists where their jew-hating problem.

Then you get to Israeli labor, their left, which by the way is openly socialist. They are absolutely disgusted by America and capitalism, and pine with deep regret that Israel didn't get its original cold war alignment, with the USSR.","1401581555"

"java","t5_2qhd7","Yeah so you basically illustrated my point.   There really is no value in using JSF if want to work with a request/response based MVC web app. You're working against a programming model that many have found to be very effective.  

&gt; The word component should also not scare you. Maybe Rod has used this word as a stick against JSF? 

I don't why you always talk as if Rod Johnson is the root of evil or why you think he had anything to do with my preference but you should look outside of your comfort zone to see the direction  most web developers are choosing across different platforms.

Besides Flask (Python), Play (Scala) which I already mentioned also look at Sinatra (Ruby), Express (Node.js), or Symphony (PHP).  Do you think it's a coincidence that developers on all these different platforms have been gravitating toward this paradigm for modern web development?   Even Microsoft realized this trend in the industry and went from ASP.NET Web Forms to ASP.NET MVC.

I think many of the Java EE components are great, but JSF just isn't the right solution for my team's projects.  I've said this before but in case you missed it I'll love to be able to evaluate a Java EE MVC framework if they ever get around to it, but until then I think there are better options.","1401581555"

I know a lot of people tend to have issues with Neutrogena products in general so it might not be the right cleanser for you. Also you're not using a moisturizer, which is HUGE for some people.   I would suggest checking out the beginners guide in the sidebar, because there are a lot of variables that could be breaking you out and you may just need a better routine; I've never used proactive myself, but I know that it's at least a cleanser,  a toner, and a moisturizer,  which is a variation on the basic routine. 

Don't give up, and patch test EVERYTHING!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","What the hell is God? What are these people talking about? Jesus, what? What is sin? Wait, why is sex bad?

The conversations you have with religious people are so much more interesting when you step back and act like an alien from another world. I pretended at this for a while, but it did sink in, we accept too much as part of our culture. For example, without questioning it, we think of Jesus as good guy, this strengthens a lot of believers who can win points by mentioning his name. But asking them to defend every premise and bringing modern sensibility to the conversation really stumps them. ""How does killing yourself save other people? That's dark, and stupid."" Now when stopped on the street I genuinely like to show by questioning how ridiculous and unnatural the believer's ideas are: ""Who's Jesus? Why do I need to believe in him if he died for me? But jerking off is completely natural, every primate has been seen doing it? The devil, what? That is RIDICULOUS.""

For some people, religion is all they ever hear, and their salvation begins the second someone looks at them with an polite laugh or curious pity, and then happily walks away unconvinced. Negativity just emboldens believers. Friendly questioning and a ""that makes no sense"" sends neurones firing in the brain, a sort of frenzied self-searching panic. Besides, it's fun. It also says, quite clearly, ""I don't agree with you, and I don't mind.""

I had a Hindu-type woman preaching to me on the street about a civilisation on the Sun. I gently probed, ""If it's not hot on the sun, why is it warm on earth during the day? But we use line spectra to see that the Sun is a gaseous furnace of hydrogen and helium?"" She was disturbed by it, her tone fell. There was no spectacular moment of clarity, but it sent her scurrying. I think, just showing one can happily engage, be unimpressed, show it and happily walk away, makes the believer feel like an entertaining part of one's day, instead of one unbeliever being one part of the believers immense crusade of destiny. It reduces them to what they are, a silly ridiculous human. Such pleasures are life.","1401581562"

"Sacramento","t5_2qi09","Thanks for the vote of confidence. It's a big step and I'm a bit worried even though I think that I'm as prepared as a first-time buyer can be. I was saving for a down payment/closing costs for about 1.5 to 2 years prior to this and I consulted with a lot of people. 

I really think that now is a good time to buy instead of rent. Prices are still low, but the housing market seems to have an upward trend so there's a possibility for equity and good resale. Interest rates are still low enough to be acceptable (mine is 4.25% and my credit score is 770). 

When you rent, unfortunately you're covering their mortgage, giving income to the owner, and covering for the cost of potential repairs that the owner will need to make in the future. I already have money set aside for the renovation and I'm financially prepared to make repairs so I am hoping it works for me despite my age. 

Having two extra bedrooms helps me out also because my family will be living with me. The costs split between my brother and my mother cover the entire mortgage+PMI so I'll only need to put money into repairs/reno. And when my family moves out I can sub-let to roommates for even more than that. ","1401581564"

Riku is easy mode where things are sometimes doubled, and Animar is hard mode because of the sheer amount of B/W in my meta and his ability to combo off. (There are about 3 decks in entirety that don't run B or W)

1. Switching commanders does not help much. Experienced players know that your deck is meant to win even without the commander out, even with a weaker commander, the deck is still just as threatening.

2. Magic players are only slightly rational, and percieve threats based on what you have the potential for. Much in the same way that people hate control players, or Mimeo/Zur players. (esper in general) You will be targeted merely because of your choice of deck style, the colours you're in, or your commander. Regardless of how strong your deck is, or how big your board presence is.

If the game isn't fun any more because you're being killed before you can do anything, there's two options as far as I can see: Play a new commander deck that seems less threatening, or make your deck strong enough to withstand everything that's thrown at you.","1401581569"

The band was ready and the mic test etc had been done, the BVB look alike band members prepared, but i could't see the singer? It was the old guy in sandals... literally looked liked he was off to the library the way he was dressed.

And my lord were they bad, absolutely nothing sounded good. Only lasted for 1 song and then I don't know if they left by themselves or if they were literally told to get off of stage...

The heads of these parties try and deflect  the emotions and anger of the masses not to the real culprits but easily understood and identifiable scapegoats (immigrants, Muslims, leftists). It takes education and rational thinking in seeing the big picture. The system that produces crises like the one we're in and the one in the 20's and 30's is still in place and it is obviously not a surprise that war and nationalist authoritarianism is beginning to look like it might rear it's ugly head again.","1401581570"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I had two centuries on this Earth alone. That was before I met Charles. outside of Somme in 1916. It was astoundingly good hunting, as we had more contracts to fill than actual workers in Hell. I stalked Charles for months, taking someone from his trench just so I could peep on him and his unit. The inevitable happened though, and soon enough, Charles was among the many I had to claim.

Few realize though, that demons are immortal, but we still can die just like anything else in these realms. Charles found that out when he ran me through with a saber. Then again when he shot me through the face with his rifle. By the third time, a knife between the ribs, he was low on fight. And I had a contract ready for him.

We signed the contract in Paris, then made love together, as his reward for actually beating a reaper in combat. We've been lovers ever since. Our work bringing souls to Hell is almost a side gig, interrupting our eternal honeymoon with periodic distractions.

Of course, Charles also loves a good competition. Our mutual immunity to death has only fostered that love, and each soul we take becomes a competition between us both. I don't usually enjoy being on bottom, but my little reaper finds a way to make everything work out. So it's like I win no matter what, which is fine by me.

Charles and I have killed each other in fairly interesting ways over the years. I ran him over with a charter bus one time in Prague. He returned the favor by pummeling me to death with an electric guitar. I've blow him up with an oxygen tank, and he found a way to kill me with a vial of the ebola virus. That was...a bit of a mess admittedly, but we managed to clean it up before anyone noticed.

Those are just the ones that come to mind, as we've had a whole century to find new ways to kill each other.

But, with that said,  I don't mind fighting Hell for my soul every few months. Or having to sew my legs back onto my body. As Charles is there with me every time, laughing and offering me a drink along with his smile. Just seeing him happy makes it all worthwhile. I wouldn't trade that smile for the world or anything on it. ","1401581574"
"DotA2","t5_2s580","Here's what I wrote in another forum:

&gt; [Synergy is] basically saying how much better a team performs than it should given the individual heroes' performance. It's not difference based and the mathematics behind it is complex. Basically the farther away a win rate is from 50%, the less the synergy will move it. However, a hero that benefits a team by a certain amount will have the same synergy value whether the team's base win rate is 40% or 75%. It's prolly best explained with a table:

&gt; 50% w/ 10% synergy = 60.00%

&gt; 60% w/ 10% synergy = 69.23%

&gt; 70% w/ 10% synergy = 77.78%

&gt; 80% w/ 10% synergy = 85.71%

&gt; 90% w/ 10% synergy = 93.10%

&gt; The reason I don't simply display the difference in win rates and call it synergy, is that it wouldn't give you a consistent sense of how synergistic a hero is, regardless of the team's performance. I know it's a little confusing and I hope my explanation makes sense. I assure you it's the best representation possible. I can explain why with examples if you want me to, but it will take a small wall of text. Heh.

Counter and advantage values follow this same model.

Yes, it looks at heroes in pairs and will be using three hero combinations eventually. The problem with using more is that there are over 5 million possible four-hero combinations out of the current pool of 107 heroes. Each game will use ten of those combos for synergy and more for counters, but pulling data from the last million matches, many combos still won't even see a match. Forget five-or-more hero combos.

Even using three-hero combinations, it will have to be selective. Only the more popular combinations will have a big enough sample size and it will all have to be weighted in with the two-hero combinations.","1401581574"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I think by far the best way to think of Judasim is as a tribe. You hear jewish people talking about 'the tribe' in a semi-jokey way, but it's really very accurate. Think of any tribe, for example (picked at random from wikipedia) [The Bora People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_people), a tribe of native americans in the amazon basin.

Is 'Bora' a race, a religion, an ethnicity, a culture, or a language? It's sort of all of them, but really it's a *tribe*. It's a group of people who are to some extent genetically related, because marriage tends to be within the tribe. They share a culture, a language, and a set of religious beliefs. So there is an ethnic group known as Bora People, who have a [Bora Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_language), a Bora culture and way of life, and a Bora religion (which in this case is a form of animism).

Same thing with Judaism, except Judaism is unusual for a tribe, in that it has modernised and dispersed. So it doesn't look much like a stereotypical tribe any more. But all the tribal elements are there, right down to the tribal coming of age ceremony at the age of 13, at which boys face a challenge in front of the community, in order to ""prove themselves as men"".

Tribes have religious beliefs, but don't try to convert people. Tribes have ethnic identity, but not in the same way as races.

Think about Judaism as a dispersed and modernised tribe, and it makes much more sense.","1401581575"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've had my fair share of MMOs, so I'll give you my reviews of some of the better ones I've played.



1. [Path Of Exile](http://www.pathofexile.com/)  
*Path of Exile is, currently, my favourite MMO. It is a F2P Action RPG, similar to Diablo. The player base is quite large, and most of the people are incredibly friendly. The game has two permanent leagues that you can play in. One standard, the other hardcore. And then it also runs two four month temporary leagues, every.. four months or so.  
The game has ZERO Pay2Win in it. All microtransactions are purely cosmetic, aside from additional stash tabs.   
The skill tree in POE is incredibly large and diverse, and the different builds that can be put together through combinations of passive points, skill gems and various unique items are truly impressive. And to top it off, the economy is one of the most fluid I've ever seen. Easily one of my favourite games at the moment, and I absolutely recommend it.*  
**I am apparently being downvoted for including this here, since it's not an actual MMO. Yes, it is a pseudo-mmo, and not a real mmo. But apparently saying that gets me downvoted as well, since nobody here seems to understand what the word pseudo means. So, to hopefully explain to you what a pseudo MMO is, here's this boldfaced text to grab attention.  
A Pseudo MMO is a game that doesn't quite fall into the criteria of an MMO. But it's still quite close. It'll have multiplayer interactions, it will be online, and it will be quite large. ALL ARPGs that are online exclusively are pseudo-mmos. Pseudo means sham, fake. People don't seem to understand that this isn't a term I am creating, it is an actual term, and POE actually falls under it. POE is a pseudo-MMO and I included it here regardless of it not being a traditional MMO because it is an excellent game, and I thought OP should check it out if he wants to get his online game fix.**
2. [ArcheAge](http://www.archeagegame.com/en/)  
*Currently in a beta, this game revolves heavily on PVP and player interaction. This is a sandbox MMORPG. Yes, a SANDBOX MMORPG. Players can alter the world, changing it for better or for worse. You can raid, pillage, pirate, or deliver assets from one country to another. It's a very neat concept, but it's heavily focused on PVP. If you're not into PVP, this game isn't for you. It's f2p, but you need to buy a subscription to gain protected land for your farming. (Which, given the circumstances, is completely fair.)  
If you like PVP, and want to join a game at it's inception, ArcheAge is the MMORPG for you.*
3. [Maplestory](http://maplestory.nexon.net/)  
*I quite Maplestory a few years back, so I can't comment on it's present state. But Maplestory is a 2d sidescrolling MMORPG. I enjoyed it for it's simplicity, but overall, it's P2W, and a grindfest. I don't enjoy it these days, but it's still one of the most popular MMORPGs available. Worth a look, but don't expect greatness.*
4. [Dragon Nest](http://dragonnest.nexon.net/micro-site/level70)  
*I started playing this in open beta, and I was one of the top players at the time, if I may. I ended up quitting because I had completed the game too many times, and there wasn't enough to do. I intended to return after a few months, but I never did. It was definitely one of the more fun MMORPGs I've played, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. But, as with Maplestory, I can't comment on it's present state. Plus, it's with Nexon, so I can guarantee it's P2W.*
4. [Vindictus](http://vindictus.nexon.net/)  
*This was a revolutionary game when it came out, actually. This was one of the first games that allowed you to alter the world you played in. Or at least, the instances. You could break pillars into pieces, and use them as your weapon.. kinda. It was completely revolutionary at the time. But, as with Dragon Nest, I got into it early and got burnt out. Again, Nexon, so it's P2W. Nexon is always P2W, but they make some nice games.*


These are the only MMOs that I have played extensively and enjoyed. If none of these interest you, here are some other MMOs that I have heard good things about, but haven't gotten into myself.


[Everquest](https://www.everquest.com/register), [Tera](http://tera.enmasse.com/), [Phantasy Star Online 2](http://www.pso2.com/us/), [Aion](http://en.aion.gameforge.com/website/), [Final Fantasy XIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/)

And then [Dragon Age](http://www.dragonage.com/#!/en_GB/home/latest-trailer) is a game that I've never heard of before now, nor have I ever seen any gameplay of it. I accidentally called Dragon Nest Dragon Age instead, then googled it to see if it was a thing. Apparently it is. Maybe it'll be amazing. I have absolutely no idea. Don't even know if it's an MMO.","1401581583"

I do plan a walk tomorrow in a forest that lies a ten minutes walk from where I live, and see how it goes. I might just download an audio book or podcast of some sort and that way slowly get accustomed to my surroundings before slowly moving into denser woods.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Well yeah, a little bit seriously is fine if you just wanna analyze some aspects of a show, but calling any anime 'pretentious' just makes it seem like you think you're too good for it or something. 

I also have no idea how Monogatari may have come off as 'pretentious' simply because lot of the so called messages aren't really anything deep. Do they go in circles around each other a lot? Yes, yes they do. This doesn't mean it's try hard, just that it's trying to make the viewer take into account what is wrong with a lot of the characters (because of or besides their more personal problems) or something like that. 

Much of the series just revolves around the whole idea that 'ain't no body gonna fix yo shit for you' n stuff. In the later parts of SS the ideas are shifted more towards (in the most basic sense) just being who you are and not lying to yourself.

When it comes to the 'artsy' aspect of the show, I think they made great stylistic and artistic choices.... in Bakemonogatari. Bakemonogatari is (arguably) one of the most beautiful anime and the best artistically directed part of the series that will probably 'age' better than the later parts of the series. Nisemonogatari is super lack luster in the way that too much of it felt flat or dull to the eye with only a select few scenes feeling really dynamic. Monogatari SS is just a bit too stylized at this point. So much so, it's actually *leaking into different series.* All of them feel the same now... (Nisekoi was a bit more independent, Mekakucity Actors just looks like Monogatari with different characters/story)

In my opinion, Bakemonogatari had the best art direction, with a dull plot. Neko:Kuro was a perfect balance of good art and a well developed story. Nisemonogatari had 6/10 art direction with it looking gorgeous only half the time and having a pretty boring story along the same veins of Bake. All the while Monogatari SS had great plot direction, but less-than-great art direction, with only a very small amount of beautifully done scenes. ","1401581585"

Is there a man card or Dad card to play here, for someone to help you make a choice?  I know as a lady you want reliable transportation, but every vehicles has its own bugs sometimes.  A/C doesn't work, etc., which is a costly expense to repair.

There is or was a radio show called Goss's Garage, which pretty much stated if you have $3000, buy as good a $2000 car as you can, and spend the $1000 to make it perfect.  I think that applies here.  But, I still think you need someone to advise you on such things as, is the coolant (radiator) system in good shape, transmission, etc.  Different parts of the country require emission testing, as well as safety inspections, and if that is the case where you are at, never buy a car that doesn't have at least 8-10 months left on its stickers for that.  Also, inspect the tires, you want at least 1/2 the life time of tread remaining (15-20 thousand miles).  Also, your best new car may be a small truck, mini-van, and not a regular car

I'm at the stage now where I don't need to use it all the time but always have it at the ready. My guy even calms down if I just have it in my hand. They don't hurt or restrict the dog's breathing in any way; just a different sensation.

Littlefinger is psychopathic/narcissist/power-monger. I'm sure you know his backstory- recent lordship, insignificant lands. He's always had a chip on his shoulder about that. He fought for Catelyn as a child and got a sword in the chest in that duel fighting Ned's brother for her. His obsession for Catelyn defines his lust for power and the fact that he couldn't have her makes her the most precious object in the world for him to own.

Without knowing anything other than what you've said, I'd be inclined to suggestion caution. If you make a *thinly veiled* historical allusion, it's apt to come across as cheap or lazy. It's not a bad thing to take inspiration from history; to the contrary, that's basically what writers are *for,* if you see what I mean. But there's a difference between taking inspiration from history and taking history and slapping on a new coat of paint.

Maybe — and I'm just spitballing here; don't think I'm telling you your business — it'd be worth considering making this a *direct* quotation rather than an allusion. Instead of having your character say something that's Lincoln with the serial numbers filed off, just have him quote Lincoln, then go on to explain how that's applicable to his situation. Or something.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I notice you've replied to two of my comments in this thread (and about a week late), so I'll aggregate my response in just this one post.

[Here's a video from last year where Ron Paul reiterates his position. He pays lip service to the idea that government should have no business in marriage, but again, goes on to say that states should have ""the right"" to decide the definition of marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zY3omeDFtA).
He's saying one thing, but ultimately doing another. 

Ultimately, his voting record supporting bills speaks more of his true nature. He votes supporting the ""one man one woman"" view of marriage while voting against bills that would give gay people the right to marry. He can talk about how the government should ""get out of marriage"" but when he votes supporting the DOMA, which is a bill that exists completely to let the government define and enforce its definition of marriage, his actions speak louder than words.

In the same video, he goes on to defend his voting record (particularly wrt the DOMA), so I have my doubts he's had a change of heart with regards to gay marriage, unlike what you assert.


Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Ron Paul is critical of US militarism. I wouldn't say I agree with him on all points but at the very least any functioning democracy needs critical voices. However, asserting that Ron Paul would ""end war"" is absolutely ludicrous, and we the voting public should absolutely not vote in representatives who give lofty, vague promises vaguely ""ending war"" if it means voting in someone who has concretely taken hypocritical steps towards barring rights for homosexuals, and will continue said steps.

Besides, we've already done the ""let local governments decide, they'll do the right thing"" thing in the 60s with civil rights, and [it turns out that  sometimes it takes the national guard to do what's right.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine)","1401581599"

Once I get her warmed up I'll go back and forth between her clit, hole and lips. Which ever I am licking I'll use my fingers on the other. Either a finger in her or lightly touching her clit. your fingers are more course and rough than your tongue so be careful when rubbing her clit, unless of course you find she likes it rougher. 

Lick and play with everything from her clit to her taint and go further if she doesn't object. Remember, always be very gentle unless she otherwise gives the obvious hint (or outright says) that she likes it rougher. Err on the side of caution over possible pain.","1401581601"

Then, drive those back roads. I guarantee you that they will be boring. Before, you were taking a bend at 60 mph, and you thought your were fast. On the track, you are taking the same radius bend at 80+, with tires squeeling and you feeling the rear end of the car stepping out, and you feeling absolutely fantastic from that sense of speed. 

And that feeling of the tires squealing and the rear end starting to stepping out, and you being in control of the car - that feeling is exactly what the FRS offers at speeds well below the speed limit. When nobody is around, you can step on the gas and drift a turn, and the car feels extremely composed. Do the same in a Mustang GT or an S2000 or a Cayman and you are way more likely to spin out. 

I mean really, Im sure you know how much fun it is to take a RWD car in the snow? Imagine being able to have 80% of that at your disposal any time you drive. Not saying that you should be drifting every corner. But you can, quite easily in the FRS.  And speaking from experience, its honestly fun as shit to take an exit and drift it all the way through. 

And BTW the back roads that you speak off will have potholes, cops, slow drivers and oncoming traffic, all of which make going fast on them dangerous. You will probably have to plan to go on them at a specific time to have fun. And if you are going to plan, you may as well go to the track.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Im not having issues with difficulty, it's just rather dull and cam be broken by a single DoT. Let's see, going in melee, other than 1h/s survivability is an issue for 2 groups and 3 were almost impossible. I've tried to maximize dps with plenty of abilities and no siphoning strikes and that doesn't really work, seeing as our hardest hitting non-execute spell is siphon health. I have issues with generating good damage on melee stamina abilities. The highest damage attack I can pull of in melee is the channeled dw ability. Unless I shadow cloak around the battle Im toast and at that point i may as well cloak/concealed blade. 2h seems to be mote aoe oriented, but i can't aoe down groups of vr mobs. Strongest ability there is the knockdown, which again has a cast time and high stam cost AND it moves your target away from you. 1h/s i have a bit of trouble dealing enough damage unless i go light armor, in which case my stamina generation then suffers.
For bow/destro staff kiting seems to be the best option, but in solo dungeons and heavily populated areas this becomes a problem. A lot of our DoTs are fairly lackluster. My slowing DoT dealt about 750 damage over 8 seconds and the dot on break of the root ability was about 400. Combined that's less than half health for a vr mob over 10 seconds and in that time(for destro staff) im struggling to keep them off me while at the same time killing the group. It's even worse when there are archers/casters.

The main theme here is damage generation while remaining alive. We've got our 1 hot and a heal on execute. And those spells and hidden blade/morphs right there are also our highest instant damage spells. So, how can I do more damage and remain survivable? perhaps magicka enchanted heavy armor? But that then misses out on light armor.passives, which are amazing. I could kite all the time, until the environment gets too crowded. Or maybe there's just something im missing that would help with damage/healing.","1401581607"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

It was made by Lauren Faust who made such great shows as The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. When Hasbro approached her to make their new MLP series, she didn't want it to be like the old shitty versions of My Little Pony. If you think about it as a cartoon, and compare it to other cartoons, it's one of the best out there. I prefer several live action shows, but MLP:FIM is my goto cartoon.

Another reason is the fan base, and the amazing artists among it. [This](http://youtu.be/xPfMb50dsOk) is one of, if not the, most popular songs in the fandom, and it's a remix of another brony artist's song. There are musicians, artists, animators, authors, and all kinds of other creative people who are good at what they do. So even when the show is on break, there's always new content from the fans of this amazing show. 

tl;dr - great show with great fans. Don't knock it til you try it.","1401581610"

&gt;conformity to the same base model of filmmaking (Hollywood's infamous three-act structure used for pretty much every script) and decision to fit them all in the same universe which forces them to make certain decisions regarding scale and aesthetic means they're starting to feel really samey

I think expecting movies to break out of the three-act structure is asking a lot from really any movie (not just superhero movies). This can be more of a complaint of most movies rather than just superhero movies.


&gt; Superhero movies are becoming a genre unto themselves

I agree that superhero movies are forming their own genre and it is possibly reaching a point of saturation. However, I would argue that Captain America specifically broke the superhero genre mold and rather harkened back more to a political thriller. He was never is danger of suddenly losing his powers, facing an overwhelmingly powerful bad guy with one weakness (I don't think Winter Soldier fit this mold), or spending half the time worrying about his identity getting out. While it fit into the Marvel universe, I don't think it felt tired as a concept.


&gt; The increasing commitment to the 'cinematic universe' is reducing the freedom of the individual filmmaker and as a result reducing the individuality of each film.

I think it is absolutely true that requiring movies to fit into a more cinematic universe does reduce the freedom of filmmakers. However, I would argue that it also increases the enjoyment for dedicated fans. I've watched all the Marvel movies and watched Agents of SHEILD as well. I love seeing the interconnectedness in the Marvel movies and yet, it isn't necessary to enjoy the movie. I haven't reached a point where each movie is too generic and not enjoyable (and I would argue most other people feel the same way considering the response to the majority of Marvel movies).

I cannot speak to the future of what will happen. So far, Marvel hasn't given me a reason to doubt their abilities to create interconnected stories that are still thoroughly enjoyable by themselves. There will come a point where they fail. I'd compare it to Pixar when they looked like they could do no wrong. In recent years, Pixar's brand image has suffered and there will come a point where that will happen to Marvel as well. Hopefully it's a ways away.


I still understand where you are coming from and I can understand why these movies are not for you. However, I don't think this is reason enough to state that each of these movies are generic. Simply put, Marvel cannot please everyone but they seem to be pleasing the majority of people right now. In my opinion, that's not a bad thing to be doing even if each movie isn't drastically different from each other.","1401581614"

The point of my comment was to point out that an Australian not understanding or seeing something as racist towards Asians might partially be due to a lot of anti-asian undercurrents in that country. I'm not saying Bluapples is racist just because he's Australian, but he does come from a country where people are more inclined to hold negatively racist beliefs about Asians, and that quite possibly could impact his sensitivity to things that are subtlety racist towards Asians, like calling someone ""Yellow"" for instance, which is absolutely racist historically speaking.","1401581616"

They will want to minimise the exposure to the inevitable ""shadow men"" of the Liberal party rhetoric. Up until the last they will be praying for a dead cat bounce from Abbott. 

I imagine Abbott's replacement will be more of the same but with a new bunch of lies for the next election, then back to the same playbook after. The party is so off the rails now they can't win an election truthfully but they will likely struggle to attract moderate liberals to get them back on track.","1401581616"

Reality is much, much stranger than fiction.

Why do you think modern scientists have so much trouble attempting to verify the results of so many previous studies, studies that significant portions of our ""basic knowledge"" have been based on? We are constantly going back, finding new information, different results, and changing our views on the world and reality as we know it.

I'm also certain that the ascribing of Ishmael to Muslims, which many Muslims accept (although it's not doctrinal), arose from discourse between Muslims and Christians. Islam does not get its name from Ishmael (not that I think anyone claims that), Islam means submission (Salaam means peace, but Islam does not mean peace, Islam is a derivative of Salaam). It is true that it was generally thought, and probably thought by Mohammed himself, that Arabs and Egyptians and the like were descended from Ishmael, but Ishmael doesn't hold a particularly special place in Islam. I mention this because I'm an Ex-Muslim and it seems Christians are crazy about holding onto the Ishmael - Isaac (Isma'il - Ishaq) dilemma when it can hardly be inferred in Islam.","1401581618"

But Rotana isn't in New York or London; it's in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, a country in which women normally adhere to a strict dress code in public — a black cloak called an abaya, a headscarf and a veil, the niqab, which covers everything but their eyes.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","It's a lot like grieving over a death, IMO. 
Initially it felt so raw to me, like I was walking around with an open wound.
Then I was able to get to a point where more of the time, it was like, ""Ok, this happened, and it really sucked and was totally unfair and awful, but it's not the only thing defining my life now."" 


Therapy gave me the tools I used to work on issues down the road as they arose. I look at the good things in my life and the more I focus on those, the better the future looks. And I limit contact or go NC with people who treat me badly.


Over time, it hurts less. And it becomes easier to move on and start new projects, friendships, etc. It's partly a natural process of healing, and partly conscious choices to take care of myself and understand that I actually do deserve a happy life, because I may have wounds and scars, but I'm a decent person and I was strong enough to survive what happened to me.

&gt;

&gt;__Little Rock Nine__ were a group of African American students enrolled in [Little Rock Central High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Central_High_School) in 1957. Their enrollment was followed by the __Little Rock Crisis__, in which the students were initially prevented from entering the [racially segregated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation) school by [Orval Faubus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Faubus), the [Governor of Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Arkansas). They then attended after the intervention of [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) [Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower).

&gt;[The U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) issued its historic *[Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education)* of [Topeka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas), [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas), 347 U.S. 483, on May 17, 1954. The decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be [unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality), and it called for the [desegregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation) of all schools throughout the nation.  After the decision, the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People) (NAACP) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States). In [Little Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock), the capital city of Arkansas, the [Little Rock School Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_School_District) agreed to comply with the high court's ruling. [Virgil Blossom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Blossom), the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved. The plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957. By 1957, the NAACP had registered nine black students to attend the previously all-white Little Rock Central High, selected on the criteria of excellent grades and attendance.  The nicknamed ""Little Rock Nine"" consisted of [Ernest Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Green) (b. 1941), [Elizabeth Eckford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eckford) (b. 1941), [Jefferson Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Thomas) (1942–2010), [Terrence Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Roberts) (b. 1941), [Carlotta Walls LaNier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlotta_Walls_LaNier) (b. 1942), [Minnijean Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnijean_Brown-Trickey) (b. 1941), [Gloria Ray Karlmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Ray_Karlmark) (b. 1942), [Thelma Mothershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Mothershed-Wair) (b. 1940), and [Melba Pattillo Beals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melba_Pattillo_Beals) (b. 1941). Ernest Green was the first African American to graduate from Central High School.

"koreanvariety","t5_2wv54","I tried finding information before too. Came up with nothing. My theory is that her claim to fame is being a ring girl who then decided to train in MMA. I'm almost certain she has no professional record, but she may have an amateur record floating somewhere on the korean interwebs. At most, i think she may have 3 bouts under her belt.

EDIT - So I was somewhat wrong. Instead of 3 bouts like I surmised, she has a [5-0 amateur record](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=136&amp;newsIdx=149899).

Unfortunately, I have no idea what a .qbc file is.  If you mean a .qb file then there are instructions in the main post above for how to create the blueprint. Both Zoxel and Magica Voxel should have a QB export option.  If you are using Qubicle you need to have at least the Stonehearth edition in order to do QB exports.  If you have the free edition of Qubicle you can only save in qmo format which isn't admissible.  However /u/R69L tries to help people out in converting from qmo to qb.

Also, Knight weapons are a very low priority right now so it would be better if you would make one of the items that are listed in the menu on right under the ""Currently Requesting"" heading.  Assuming your Knight item is unique from the vast number of Knight items that are already in-game it may still be admissible, but based on current information it is likely to be over a month before it has a chance to be approved.","1401581628"

I waited the hour for Full Throttle with one car. That was a great ride though. 

I had been to Six Flags MM in like 2006 (when X2 was X) and found that they had problems with Superman, it was closed all day. So I expected the park to have problems with rides.  They do have a history of this.

to put it this way, yeah, sometimes you want a brighter or thiner sounding recording of a certain part.  But I can more easily get the U87 to sound that way than I can get the behringer to sound full on the bottom and midrange, and not brittle up top.  Why?

I have full Jade, Quetzacoatl, MoJ, T&amp;T, RoRG, 19% Cold Strongarm, the dog Mojo, and Harrington's, so I have most of the needed items; only my second ring (need TMF/SoJ/Unity) and amulet are garbage.

I can do T6 reasonably with the pet build, but I constantly get destroyed with Jade. Bosses take years to kill with it (seems like my Harvests only go off for around 300m on them).

The thing about stuff like this is, telling people is not usually a good idea. Everyone is different of course. But when you tell people you are doing something, your brain tricks itself into thinking that you have actually achieved something. For example people that plan on going on a diet, they will tell all their friends ""i'm going on a diet!"" and all their friends will say ""well done!"" ""you're great!"" ""I'm so proud of you!"".. And the brain takes that as a reward, it thinks you have achieved something... So then they don't end up actually going on the diet, because they already got the satisfaction. 

I'm not saying nofap is definitely the same, but I think it can be similar. It might just be a good idea, for the sake of your nofap journey, to keep it to yourself.","1401581639"

If you are not willing to let artists have some creativity then you are going to keep making the same movie. I can't remember what critic said this but he said after Cap 2 he feels like he has been watching a 28 hour movie. They all tie in together, they save the world, and then there is an end credit scene that shows that the world isn't quite saved yet. You need something to break the monotony.                 

Also, you risk getting to a point where this movies become as difficult to break into as the comics because they refer to themselves more and more each time. Eventually Marvel will make a flop, that is just the nature of the business and then what? ","1401581640"

Great point about Ne5, but (and I needed an engine to see why this wouldn't be so bad) O-O! loses a pawn for a large lead in development and central control. Be6 9.Ne5 O-O 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bxc6 Rc8 12.Bb5 d4 13.Ne4 Nxe4 14.Rxe4 Bd5 15.Re1

Great call on 17...Rc8. I went from being blocked by a pawn to being blocked by a pawn and letting him place his bishop where he pleases.

19...Be5 loses to 20.Qh5 mate threat capture the bishop for free!

Yes on the h6

As for 28.Qd5, perhaps I misspoke. This is something I picked up from Silman: play the board. The board is saying I'm losing, but not by much (Stockfish has it as +1.6, which at this level is anyone's game). The reason I screwed up here is because I knew I was losing on some level, but tried a move that gave him a chance to decisively take an advantage. I had nothing specific in mind, thus this move was ill advised. If I'd played the board, I would have protected my pieces and only made sound threats.

You win by making the fewest mistakes. I should have waited for him to either make an ill advised attack (as I did), or miss a threat.

I have Silman's book. It's golden. I hate endgames. (Therefore they should be my focus).

No, I know. It was just my contention that a fear of the self doesn't come naturally to people if they're left alone. Sure, they'll engage in superstition, but I think the fear of the self is a very specific ""mindvirus"" that must be planted by a person or institution that seeks dominance.

&gt;Not if he isn't already afraid of himself.

I just don't buy the idea of an in-born self-phobia. I think a human is naturally going to have an effective will to power if he is is brought up in an environment his physiology has evolved for. The outcome of evolution is never a species with such massive and widespread in-born will2power handicaps. The advent of civilization provided a much more effective means for widescale psychological domination, which we're simply not built for.","1401581641"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","This is a useful link to get the exact amount of dissolved CO2 you want depending on your storage temp.  It also has a very general style guide, but a little googling will turn up better info for the particular style you are brewing.

http://www.kegerators.com/carbonation-table.php


Generally, when my beer goes into the keg I do one of two things:

1. If I want to bulk age it, I hit it with about 10 psi and let it sit for a few minutes and then purge a couple of times to make sure the oxygen is gone.  At that point I will let it age for whatever period of time needed.

2.  If it's ready to drink immediately (or after it's done aging), I put it in the keggerator at 39 degrees and dial up the PSI based on the chart above to whatever level of CO2 I want and leave it alone for about 7-8 days.  At that point I back down to serving pressure if needed and drink.  

Good luck, kegging is the only way to fly.  You won't go back to bottling.

Edit:  Just saw that you want it ready on 6-6.  I would highly suggest going the slow route based on the table since it's your first time.  This will guarantee you get the carbonation level you want.  The fast/high pressure method is ok if you really need it in a day or two, but it's risky.  Over carbing your beer sucks.  You have the time, slow and steady will pay off.

Better positioning, more confidence, more comfortable on the ball, better tackling, seemingly stronger, doesn't elbow everybody in the face, and even drives forward with Yaya-esque runs at times. Granted I've only watched 5 or so of Sporting's games back when we were strongly linked to him and I wanted to see what he was all about beyond youtube videos, but from what I did see he would walk into our midfield. You can say his passing is ""lacking"", but I prefer unadventurous (at times). He has a great ball in him (most of those can be found in Youtube videos) and can do the simple stuff competently but he does misplace a pass every so often, but with proper coaching that is easily erased. He is not worth £30m, but his age and Sporting's apparent refusal to sell unless somebody meets his buy-out clause inflates his price.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","The more data/information that comes out about Beats acquisition, the more it appears Apple simply wanted to prevent the possibility of a competitor from using the Beats brand to build a potential rival to Apple's music business, gain some music industry connections to bolster its existing business, and give a short-term boost to its own brand by association with Beats.

Other than the additional music industry clout they will get from having Iovine and Dre, the deal appears almost zero-sum, and to some observers, negative - a loss to Apple. I'm more of the opinion that the deal will be zero-sum to potentially positive for Apple because we'll have to wait and see just how much Iovine and Dre bring to iTunes Radio and iTunes, and I can imagine them bringing more artists and new customers.

What will be most interesting to see is how long Apple keeps Beats alive - from its streaming service to headphones etc. In the long-term, which isn't long in tech nor in music these days, Apple doesn't need to support a separate brand, and it shouldn't. It should either merge their assets, where they have any, and transfers users to iTunes Radio after brand alignment/transfer is complete.

I can understand Apple's buy of Beats - to reinvigorate their music business - but I wish they had spent the same pocket change on purchasing Nest too. That would have brought Fadell's talents back to Apple, kept any Apple secrets/IP he had under wraps, and given Apple a strong start into the home automation business with Nests new IP. (And there would have been a nice symmetry with history, being that it would have been the first(?) big acquisition by Apple since it bought a similarly named company that breathed new life it it, NeXT.)

Apple is so quick to buy hardware companies to improve its existing product line but far too slow to purchase companies that can open it to new markets. From reading a lot of user feedback, the positive reviews of the human curated music selection side of Beats aside, Beats streaming music app is sub-par at music suggestion, at least compared to iTunes, and Beats headphones don't even 'make the (top 20) list' in most headphone reviews. So, it appears Apple will gain more new customers from the Beats brand overall than any particular Beats service or product. For this reason and all of those above, it appears Apple mostly purchased Beats for its brand, whereas if it had bought Nest, it would have bought not only a growing brand but also IP and talent that would have opened many home doors to new customers.

Perhaps Apple will announce at WWDC a roadmap for home automation controlled from iOS and also possibly from AppleTV - or a rebranded one or similar separate device called iHome or iControl (or whatever), which allows certified third party home device companies to pair with them as analysts/bloggers are speculating. And perhaps an acquisition of Nest would have been like Microsoft competing against its OEMs with their Surface tablets, but at the least they could have purchased Nest to stop their competitor Google from owning its IP.

**Addendum:**

Apple has a huge amount of work to do to stay relevant in a world where Android is 'good enough' to many - from greatly needing to improve iCloud (beyond just being 'green') as a user experience, standardising the quality of its software rather than poaching staff from working on one app to another and leaving some apps behind in functionality, to modernising OS X eg making it responsive (like web apps). But they continue to show that they put magnitudes more thought into a hardware vision than a software vision and have become happy with following rather than leading in many software areas. Sometimes this is for the best, as they bring a more deliberated approach, but often they have lost more users to a 'good enough' solution offered by someone like Google that iterates way more quickly while showing a software vision that is growing stronger every day. 

Apple can't expect to lead anymore just by releasing the best hardware - a new gadget - it needs to do so with software as much, because clouds will make computing ubiquitous and devices that can interoperate best with clouds will provide users with the most integrated, smooth, and enjoyable experience. To do that, Apple would need to develop a software vision as strong, and integrated with, its hardware vision, and yet all its recent behaviour eg Maps appears to question whether they have the focus/structure/leadership to do this. Instead, by all accounts, they often 'race' to get software made to 'refresh' an interface/experience rather than spend enough time upfront developing a new vision, and any app or OS that doesn't have a new hardware vision behind it, gets left of the list of priorities until its long in the tooth eg OS X. 

Apple needs to balance its vision across software and hardware, and I'm not convinced that Ive even has the focus/time/interest to do this. How hard would it be for him to invite every Apple employee to give feedback on how to improve OS X and then work with his team to filter/tune/integrate some of the best ones into a new vision for OS X - one that would be superior from just him and his small team 'reskinning' OS X to be more like iOS. Not hard at all, and I bet there are many employees at Apple who could help improve his vision for it. But from all accounts, he won't do this or take any other inventive way to improve his 'software vision', which is clearly lacking after seeing iOS 7 and where Android is now and Windows Phone (or whatever it's called now) is going. He's been given far too much control, and thus Apple is wasting a huge opportunity to create a new vision for desktop computing integrated with the cloud and mobile/wearables. Instead they are racing to 'refresh/repaint' OS X rather than spend the same amount of time they would defining a new vision for OS X and desktop computing as they put into the thousands of experiments/iterations in developing a new hardware vision for mobile.

The point is, you've been trying to argue from the beginning that the killing of the Egyptian firstborns was human sacrifice. It is not. Human sacrifice is when one *human* kills another as a gift to a deity. In this story, God simply killed humans. Since He is not a *human*, and He was not trying to give Himself a gift, it's not human sacrifice. If you still believe that it was sacrifice, then you're ignoring the definition of the word.

&gt;..to determine for themselves whether...is consistent with a just god.

If God exists, then He defines justice. One cannot call His actions unjust. One cannot ""determine for themselves"".

&gt;...to say that these little babies got what was coming to them...

I never said this or intended to say this. I simply argued that they were God's to do with as He wished, since they are sinners as well.

&gt;...I don't see why the same logic couldn't be applied to the little two year old sinner in the news story.

It can. He's also a sinner in the hands of God. However, I don't believe(and you've given no convincing evidence to the contrary) that God requires human sacrifice (as it is defined by everyone but you, as a human killing another as a gift to a deity). Thus, I believe that the woman did a terrible thing that was not required by God.

I've given you point after point of logic, and you've managed to ignore or sidestep it all. If you really refuse to finish this, then you're simply showing that you apparently can't handle a debate. Do enjoy the circlejerk that you'll go to to validate your opinion. If you need me, I'll be waiting here, in the real world.","1401581651"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The beauty of Wow is that you can go back and do everything. All of the old expansions are still relevant, and better yet, free with the base game now. I've been playing Wow since it first released, and I may be in the minority when I say this, but I'm actually enjoying it now more than ever. You can get to level 90 in a pretty short period of time these days, and that's when the real game begins. There's nothing like downing the final boss of an expansion, all the while knowing that something even more menacing waits for you later. Warlords of Draenor is going to pretty much revamp the entire game, so if you join now, you really wouldn't lose too much in the way of skill/experience. I would, however, recommend playing Warcraft 3. The graphics are a bit dated, but it's a great game, and gives you loads of backstory for the major events of Wow. Warlords of Draenor wouldn't be nearly as enticing to me if I didn't know who Grommash, Ner'Zhul, Gul'Dan and all of the other Warlords actually were, and the ridiculous things that they did in history.","1401581656"

Being human allows you to summon phantoms, other players, kindle flames (more estus flasks) and opens up for invasion by other players. Do this only when required as there are many who are restarting to go noob hunting. 

Learn to backstab, parrying is useful but outside of pvp backstabbing is easier.

FTR, I'm a MS teacher in the U.S. (I've actually taught in Korea too, ironically) and I scored quite a bit higher than that. Perfect score in the verbal, and I teach ELA, so I guess that's relevant.

I'm not sure if these are vegan/CF but I will list a few here for you and you can check them out when you have time. I am also acne prone and these are some that have worked well for me.

Hourglass Immaculate - very lightweight, I would say light/med coverage but buildable, good for all skin types but a bit more than $40


Lancome Teine Idole - not super light weight but not heavy feeling. Medium coverage, buildable to a point but not quite to full coverage. Ton of shades. Best for oily or normal skin, may aggravate dry skin. I believe it is about $45 a bottle.


Clinique even better Makeup- I have only used the powder but I know people who use the liquid, not sure on coverage. Great if your skin is sensitive or you have allergies as well as acne prone. Clinique also has a line dedicated for acne, but I've not used it


MUFE velvet - med coverage can build to full. Any skin type though again dry skin may not work great.


Not midrange but Neutrogena actually makes a pretty good foundation that is good for acne prone skin.\


**edit** totally forgot to add in... you might want to check out /r/indiemakeupandmore the amount of vegan/CF companies over there are outstanding and the ladies that frequent there will know who has great foundations.","1401581672"

I feel BC was the last good expansion, and parts of WotLK were good, but that's where the dilution began. The guild system seems to have really fucked things up also, and I know a lot of people jumped ship when guilds didn't have everything unlocked. One thing I've always hated was how gear numbers were introduced that made finding a group all but impossible despite your skillset if you didn't have max gear for the simplest dungeons. The raid finder feels like it allowed you to find groups easier, but it also diluted the community. I feel it could have been implemented better. At the end of the day it was Blizzard being unable to address the population issues of different servers honestly. Back on the Azshara is was impossible to find a group because of the horrible pop issues, and Blizz didn't want to to a server merge. Maybe I'm just ranting now, but BC was an incredible experience. You had to build your way up the raid/gear ladder, and epics were a bit harder to get.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","They've done a few experiments on this but I'll use one as an example.

There's a study where they had a queue for a photocopier and when a man asked somebody towards the front if he could push in front of them to use it (no excuse), it was something like 55% of people let him go ahead.

Then they redid the experiment and had him ask somebody towards the front if he could use the photocopier 'because I'm going to be late for my class' and something around 87% of people let him jump the queue.

They redid it again and had him say he needed to go in front 'because I need to use the photocopier' and 85% let him go ahead.

BECAUSE is the key word. If you have a valid excuse (late to class) or something obvious (I need to use the photocopier) it doesn't matter, 'because' is a trigger word where people think you have a valid reason, they're not bothered about the actual reason.

So if you want something, always use the word 'because' and explain why to increase your chances of getting it. All within reason obviously.

edit: here's a link to the experiment. My numbers where a bit off but the result was the same. It also has a link to the actual experiment paper.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I don't see how it could possibly be cheaper. If it costs a set amount of money to roll out dedicated lines every 1000 feet of cable, then you're gonna have to roll out magnitudes more cable the farther out you go due to a significantly lower population density. Instead of deploying say 2 miles of cable, you'd have to regularly deploy 20 mile runs. That's 10x the cost, and if we wanted dedicated fiber lines to our doorsteps it would be more like 50-100 mile runs, which would be exorbitantly expensive unless split across trunk lines for long hauls and branching to individual houses for shorter halls. Even then, running individual lines a mile or two from the trunk line to 50 houses is really expensive due to the permits and zoning, not to mention that is the same as one 50 mile track of cable, and there would have to be lots of split up trunk lines to allow branch lines to be that short. In addition, this kind of scenario would repeat itself across much of the US, including many states that are almost entirely a rural area themselves. Yes, Comcast could and should invest money in more widespread high-speed internet, but dedicated lines and/or gigabit for everyone in the US, while technologically possible, is not a financial reality. This isn't South Korea, where the entire country is obsessed with technology and has one of the largest cities of the world right in the center of the country with is only the size of Pennsylvania.","1401581690"

Plus they pick up people all night long and stuff it to capacity with people sleeping on the floor next to you! Some companies are a lot more comfortable than others but they come and go quickly so it'd be hard for me to recommend any at this time since my info is a year old.

If you want to do do co-op you can. The effect of which is that you have less money to pay back in loans, or you get grants. But a loan should *never* be denied to someone because they want to study Philosophy, Music, or Painting. 

Sure, there are more lucrative majors and the schools can push people towards them through grants and co-op placements, or even the government can. But they shouldn't deny funding for any subject area on the sole criteria that it's ""useless."" ","1401581692"

The chance of getting even a regular exotic are pretty low, let alone a good skin/precursor.  Taking 20 minutes even for gold CP maps for setup and completion doesn't seem amazing for 30-50s, 10 greens, and 2 skill points.  Almost everything you get out of the bags gets transferred into gold immediately, or thrown onto yet another stack of account bound dust.

I don't really understand how it's such a good use of time, when you can just run some easy dungeons with no headache of finding/joining a good CP map and get 15g a day in 2-3 hours.  Is there some calculation or drop rate that I'm missing from bags?","1401581701"

I tried telling my 15 yr old cousin that this group she's going away with for the summer called [Teen Mania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAKGVF3EooA) is a cult. She was upset because she's been working all year to be able to go. My grandma screamed in my face repeatedly at the top of her lungs that I'm Satan, that I'll be serving tipple time in hell, that she doesn't give a fuck about me, that I'm destroying households, that I live a terrible life and that I'm trying to take over. My cousin's parents told me to never talk to any of their children ever again. 

A couple weeks later my cousin apologized to me for telling everyone that I made her upset an she knows I'm just looking out for her, but she's still going and her parents and my grandma think I'm just trying to brainwash her. Apparently my grandma had gone to my cousin and started bragging about how she ""broke me"", that only if she could have seen my face when she called me Satan, and that she has me under her thumb now for good. 

There's more, but you get the idea. Your story made me feel better, so hopefully mine will help you as well. Whatever you do don't try to reason with your grandma--you'll never change her. There are some people words cannot reach, so don't waste your energy on them. Avoid talking to her, but forgive her in your heart; don't hate her over it.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","You are completely right. I think that if it was as easy as some people imagine to stop using oil, we would. If not because of environmental impact, just to get away from the political mess that oil producing countries are (Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, etc). It's simply not feasible yet.

Edit: I think it's a little bit unfair getting down voted and not receiving a reply criticizing what I wrote. This subreddit should be a space for this kind of dialogue, simply down voting adds very little to the conversation.

If it's about the political mess, well, it is, I'm not even doing a value judgement, but any crisis in the middle east (which seems to happen all the time this days), any problem with Venezuela (coincidence or not they are having a lot of public unrest), the price of oil skyrockets.

It's no only in the US, western Europe is dependent of the Russians because of oil and gas too, for example. So even if Russia screws up in Ukraine, there is not much EU can do.



Reducing the dependence of the most unstable countries and regions in the world is undeniably a good reason to move away from oil.","1401581703"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","It's very easy! You will need a food processor or a blender to do it.

Put in the food processor: a drained can of chickpeas, a peeled clove of garlic, a spoonful of tahini (sesame paste, optional, but nice), the juice of half a lemon, some salt, and a couple tablespoons of water. Blend it all up until it's smooth. Taste, adjust the seasoning (add more salt, lemon, water to thin it out, whatever is needed). Blend again. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours for the best flavor.

Feel free to get creative with add-ins. One of my favorites is adding fresh dill. You could also try cilantro and jalapeno, or whatever else you can think of!

You mentioned in a comment that you recognize that you really don't grasp an atheist's typical perspective on a number of issues.  Good on you for recognizing that and seeking information.

Here's a familiar irony for you then - I have an equally difficult time grasping the perspective of most theists.  I was born atheist in a Christian family and spent my young life thinking that religion was literally a social in-joke.  It was that unbelievable to me that people actually believed what they claimed to believe.  I still have that reaction to many theists when they witness.  It doesn't mean I don't want to hear theists' arguments or evidence though, and I'm reasonably certain I can give it a fair evaluation *as a skeptic*.  What I don't understand is why anyone who claims to value truth and reason would not want to take a skeptic's approach to evaluating claims.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","&gt; binary is most basic representation/description of data that we have yet to date

I don't think ""to date"" really comes into it - it's difficult to imagine a more basic, useful representation of data than one that involves only two possible values.

&gt; at the end of the day it seems arbitrary that we MUST explain information in binary.

Other than the above point, it *is* essentially arbitrary - you can compare it to other kinds of units in physics, e.g. meters, grams, and seconds are all arbitrary units.  

In physics, depending on the context, other units may be used, such as [natural units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) which use e.g. the speed of light 'c' instead of meters per second; or in astrophysics, using solar masses instead of kilograms.  In all such cases, it's possible to convert between one unit and another of the same type.

Bits are similar: there are in fact other units that are used, such as [nats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_(unit\)), based on powers of e rather than powers of 2; and [bans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_(information\)) based on powers of 10.  

As with other kinds of units, these can easily be converted between each other - there's a conversion table between bits, nats, and bans [here](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/audio/9780240818467/chapter-5-digital-theory/ch5_sec9_xhtml).

Which one is used can depend on the kind of formulas they're being used with.  However, bits tend to be used most ubiquitously - they're very natural in computing, because that's how the hardware works, but they're just as useful in many physics contexts.  In at least one sense, bits are better justified than most physical units, by virtue of being the most simple and minimal possible unit for the purpose.

 I remember one guy who was doing something Caribbean themed who requested ten of each island, which came up to a lot of flags. They do have walk-ins that come into the store and pick up the odd flag or two, but most of their business is wholesale.
They do have a variety of non-country or state flags, such as the ""Don't Tread on Me"" southern flag, or the typical Che Guevera kind of thing. I'd imagine they'll sell a ton of rainbow flags for Toronto World Pride this year, to people who want to party and to restaurants to decorate. Also they do have non-flag imports, like cheap knock-offs of soccer jerseys, keychains and t-shirts and such. Keep in mind that they're importing this stuff quite cheap. Also also, I know that two of the stores are owned by the same guy.

And lastly, I'm sure it helps doing flag business in the most multicultural city in the world.

- It was hard to understand what caused Gordon to be in such depressed state
- Editing was uneven. I do not understand why it jumps from one style of cinematography to another. It's very powerful and strong tool and I do not think it is justified to use it to illustrate transition from one charactor story line to another. 
- There were moments (heated parking lot discussion) that seemed to be written completely in generic cliches. I did not like it. 
- I was tempted to compare it to Silicon Valley in the beginning because of computer-related industry subject, but then it looked more similar to The Americans, being a period drama from the same period with similar style.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","1) I said I agreed with Malfoy's statement itself, not his reasoning behind it.

2) No, he did not have to preach his politics to keep the school united and it didn't work out that way anyway, as clearly the Slytherins were pitted against the rest of the other houses. He shouldn't be fired for his viewpoint, but he should have been admonished at least for preaching it to the detriment of student safety. Umbridge would never have been placed at the school if he hadn't told everyone that Voldemort was back. IMO, telling a bunch of basically defenseless children that the wizarding world's Hitler is back was irresponsible, even if it was true.

3) I agree with your point that Snape should never have been hired and especially made a Head of House, but Dumbledore should have made it clear to all teachers that only their Head of House can punish a student.

4) His favourtism of the Golden Trio wasn't completely altruistic which you find out in book 7 when Snape figures out that he's raised Harry like a lamb for slaughter. I agree with him being rewarded for his good deeds for the school, but the rule breaking still shouldn't have been so easily forgiven.

&gt; Elliot Brindle is a bright, meek salesman, drowning in debt - and desperate as he's about to marry the love of his life. Upon receiving a phone call informing him that he's on a hidden camera game show where he must execute 13 tasks to receive a sum total cash prize of $6\.2M, Elliot dismissively follows through with his first two instructions\: swat the fly that is currently bothering him, then eat the fly. With thousands of dollars suddenly appearing in his bank account, Elliot remains skeptical, though comforted by the knowledge that he can stop playing at anytime if only to lose every penny that he's won. Trapped into the horrors manipulated by unseen spectators, Elliot's need to complete the game escalates as the tasks grow more extreme, to a devastating point of no return.

**Critical reception:**

&gt; Critical reception has been mixed-to-positive and the film has a rating of 56% on Rotten Tomatoes as of May 16, 2014, based on 32 reviews. Variety and Fearnet both gave 13 Sins mixed reviews, with Fearnet commenting that the film's greatest weakness was its familiarity to earlier, similar films, but that overall ""there's more than enough here for a ""psychological horror"" fan to get behind."" The Austin Chronicle was more positive in their review, in which they commented that the movie would have a wide appeal to both genre and mainstream viewers. (*Wikipedia*)

1. cut your MTU in half.. rather than sending packets of 1500 bytes (standard) (technically it's 1472 with the extra coming from routing info) You can send packets of 750 bytes, twice as often. (again technically 736). Google ""change Windows MTU size""   Yes, you send data at roughly the same rate.. but your buffer doesn't wait till it has 1500 to send.. you'd need to do the same tweak for the router.

2. Yes, PMB, and the launcher widget that auto minimizes are basically torrent clients.. turn them off/end process.

3. Look into using open DNS, or Google's free DNS servers rather than relying on your ISPs possibly over burdened DNS servers.

4. If you know the host name and IP of the server you play on, enter it's name and IP in Windows HOSTS file, to avoid a DNS look up for it completely.   (granted DNS responses are cached, but it's needless traffic since these IPs aren't likely to change frequently)

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Specifically for you + your wife, I like **Morels** for a two player game -- ~30 minute romp through mushroom foraging and gathering via set collection.  Another favorite of mine that sits right around the 20-30 minute mark is **Biblios**, an auction game in the vein of For Sale! and works for up to 4.

**Hanabi** is always great for a small co-op, but is (imho) an inferior game at the suggested 5 player limit.  Stick to 2-4.  If you like Forbidden Desert / Pandemic, I enjoy **Flash Point: Fire Rescue** (so much so that I sold Pandemic).  Stay away from **Escape** if you do want something more strategic (1-2 plays @ 10m each and you'll want to put it away for the night).

My current ~30-45 minute crushes are **Splendor** and **Quantum**.  **Splendor** is incredibly accessible and just strategic enough for an engine-builder.  As for Quantum, the space theme is kind of plastered on but the gameplay is fantastic and very easy to teach.  2-4 players only, but this game's been an absolute hit for my gaming group.

For bigger parties, definitely pick up **7 Wonders** -- it's not that hard to teach and hits a great sweet spot at right around 4 players; the two player game is definitely the most strategic since you'll see each set of cards 3+ times before the end of the round, and the 7 player game more chaotic since you're largely at the whim of whatever your neighbors pass you.  For a lighter, whimsical version of this mechanic, try **Sushi Go!**.  Also, **Masquerade &gt; Citadels** in my eyes.

You think this checkpoint guy is only marginally helping? Really? I don't think it's hostility because he's exercising his right; for me it's the complete lack of empathy and understanding. Yes the constitution is to be upheld but it's also a subjective that is left to interpretation. One has to look at the whole issue and apply the constitution accordingly. I think everyone understands the bigger picture. This guy thinks he is speaking for the rest of us when in reality most of us see this situation, hear the points being brought up and thinking ""that's fair."" He, on the other hand, feels that the 4th amendment is an ironclad defense against something HE, deems unreasonable and ALL of use should be JUST like him. Sorry there are too many actual scientific reasons why steps like this occur, to keep us alive. He thinks they are there to fuck with him and most of the people see that isn't the case. So he needs to bring up actual instances of injustice not hitting soft targets like the border guy who wants to make sure you don't bring mites that will destroy entire crops.

"Frozen","t5_2vpth","Well, ""ð"" is a voiced interdental fricative, the ""th"" sound you make when you say the word ""this"" (in IPA, it's written as [ð], to keep it simple) so if you devoice it, it becomes ""þ"" ([θ] in IPA), which sounds like the ""th"" in ""strength."" When the speaker is speaking quickly, a listener unfamiliar with the language may have trouble telling the difference between voiced and unvoiced sounds that come from the same place of articulation, especially if the foreign language does not distinguish those two sounds as separate allophones of the same phoneme.

Take, for example, Korean speakers. If you ask a Korean speaker to pronounce the hangul 가, they will say something that could very well be either ""*K*a"" or ""*G*a."" If they continue to speak Korean conversationally, your English-speaking ear will pick up *both* ""ka"" and ""ga,"" but if the conversation is transcribed, each time you heard one of these sounds it will only appear as 가. This is because Korean does not distinguish between the voiced velar stop ""g"" and the unvoiced velar stop ""k"" like English does. To a Korean speaker, ""k"" and ""g"" are both allophones of the same phoneme ""ㄱ"", while they are separate in English.

So, since you don't know Norse (which is what I'm pretty sure the prayer is in), it may be the case that [ð] and [θ] fall under the same category as Korean ㄱ, where the two phonemes we have in English may bee seen as one in Norse.

&gt;(I'm on mobile so sorry for any typos)

&gt;Okay, here goes. Scene: my friend's 21st birthday party at a cottage in the mountains. Her friends are showing up throughout the night. Me and my group of friends have been drinking since we got there.

&gt;Fast forward to around 3:30 am. This guy starts hitting on me. Hard. Now, I'm not used to being the centre of attention, so this was welcome for a bit. It got to a point where I had drank WAY too much and maybe smoked some weed, but we started moving down to the room where my bed was for the night.

&gt;Here's where it gets typical. He wants to have sex. Okay, fair enough. Hooking up at a party is normal.

&gt;Not for me. I'm a virgin. Or, I guess, was.

&gt;He kept pushing the issue, saying it would help me relax and we would be safe. When I showed the slightest sign of doubt, he threw the ""I'm more sober so I think I'm more right."" shit at me. I tried to say no, but I was just too tired, so I agreed. He went ahead and had sex with me, and I basically acted as a blowup doll he thrusted for 45 minutes.

&gt;It wasn't good, and I consented so I don't think this would class as sexual assault or worse. He's in the bed I was sleeping in for a bit and I just do not want to head back down there. I also don't want him thinking we're a thing now because we hooked up and I wasn't feeling it.

&gt;What do I do?

do you really think coming in to say ""actually, that guy may be a jerk, but he didn't *coerce* her into anything"" is appropriate behavior? it's not. i wouldn't let you hang around with anyone who was just sexually assaulted when that's how you act, and apparently they won't either. 

edit: it's also telling that you couldn't just walk away after that, you felt like you had to do all this other shit. ""it is really important to me that i be allowed to hang out in this space where i can say dumb, tone-deaf shit to people who are in their most vulnerable state!"" that's even grosser, now that i think about it.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","So, I was searching for another question when I stumbled across this. I know it's 5 months old, but better late than never, right?!

The source I'll be quoting from is Charles Smith's *Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict*, which is a fantastic book on the conflict. He devotes a chapter to describing the various conditions in the Ottoman Empire that helped explain the Arab Revolt in 1916, the land reforms, and so on.

&gt;How did the various Arab subjects react to Ottoman reform efforts?

The 19th century, to be frank, was a period of colonial powers gaining influence at the cost of the Ottoman Empire. I say this because it's crucial to understanding the reforms, and how they came about. The reforms were largely inspired because of the pressures of the great powers (Britain, France, Russia, mainly), and because of attempts to get rid of that influence. In the early 19th century, and even dating back to the mid-18th century, many of the *dhimmis* (considered protected but subordinate classes to the Muslim Ottomans) gained increased status and wealth due to the pressures of the great powers. For example, in the Treaty of Kuchuk Kanarji of 1774 (between the Russians and Ottomans), the Ottomans ceded Crimea, and gave the Russians the right to build a Greek Orthodox church in Istanbul, the right to intercede on behalf of clergy and patrons of that church, and gave them greater access to building and traveling to Palestine.

In light of the not-so-subordinate classes anymore gaining power, reforms were implemented because of the instability of Muslim society, and the growing resentment (the person governing Syria, Palestine, and parts of Lebanon from 1831-1840, for example, put Christians in charge of tax-collecting). Though this arrangement was put in place by the Muslim ruler, Ibrahim (who was occupying the areas for Egypt's Ottoman governor/his father who almost overthrew the Ottoman sultan of the time), the resentment stuck.

The original reforms, those dealing with placing those Christians and Jews in power positions (though less Jews, who were cautious to stay out of trouble until the Zionist movement sprang up later), caused great resentment and strife. The Christians, noting the Jews were their main rivals in the trade that they enjoyed favored status in facilitating, attempted to enlist Arab mobs and their resentment against the Jews in 1840, but largely failed. In 1860, when Muslims rioted against Christians in Damascus, Jews were reported to have encouraged them.

The *Tanzimat*, or the reordering of Ottoman society, can be traced back to Sultan Abdul Medjid's issuing the Hatti Sharif of Gulhane, which called for equal rights to all Ottoman subjects, reforms to the justice system, etc. These reforms, again pushed by the great powers and their influence, only exacerbated the tensions in a society that had been used to seeing *dhimmis* in place below the Muslim classes. The Hatti Humayun, in the mid-1850s, proclaimed unequivocally the equality between *dhimmis* and Muslims in access to education and access to the justice system, and guaranteed freedom and openness of worship. Those instructed to implement these reforms were met with hostility by the populace, since these declarations were (correctly) viewed as foreign powers using their government as a mouthpiece for their ideas. Resentment against Christians in particular flared following the Hatti Humayun, and in 1860 (for one example) thousands were massacred in Damascus. There were riots in Aleppo and Nablus, both anti-Christian riots in nature, throughout the 1850s as well.

Land reforms went greatly along this tack as well, but protests by Arab subjects and officials led to the barring of land purchases by Jews in many cases. Jews were able to circumvent these regulations near the end of the 19th century especially, leading to even more resentment (because it was due to some corruption and otherwise ""turn the other cheek if we get our cut"" mentality among officials enforcing that let it happen). The enforcement of land reforms in general, which were intended to ensure that land titles were more widespread (and thus taxes could be easier to get ahold of), led to increased attempts to generate revenue that were the reason for this ""turn the other cheek"" mentality. Large swaths of Ottoman land, particularly in Palestine, had been uncultivated (as it was state land), and what was cultivated had been taken over by landowners/peasants who didn't pay any revenues to the Ottoman government. Peasants, once the reforms began to be enforced, couldn't afford in many cases to pay for the land title. They also didn't want to, since appearing on the tax rolls would put their sons and fathers up for conscription or military recruitment. Many of these peasants, though initially reluctant, worked with wealthier Jewish landowners to buy the land, and continued to work it as they had before, assuming they had customary right to the land. This led to the resentments I was talking about before.

So what did the reforms primarily do? They had the effect of fostering resentment against foreign powers and non-Muslims in the Ottoman empires, and can be (in some ways) traced through the effects on the Jewish and Christian communities that led to the eventual outbreaks of violence between Arabs/Zionists.

&gt;How did the various Arab subjects react to the attempts of increasing centralization &amp; secularization?

Generally, not well. Many Arab officials attempted to resist this centralization attempt, and secularization (which is what I covered above). The centralization attempts were contested just as much, with local officials attempting to gain autonomy and leeway as much as possible. Again, the resentment against Ottoman officials for their policies didn't help their cause in particular among the Arab groups, and it can even be said that the Arab Revolt during WWI can be traced in part to this resentment of centralization attempts. Sharif Husayn, the one who got the British support for the revolt and organized it in large part, was the guardian of the holy places of Mecca and Medina. He was also an Ottoman official, of course, but attempted to gain autonomy wherever possible. He was alarmed by Ottoman intentions to extend the Hijaz railway to Mecca, so he asked for British support (sent his son to negotiate) with stopping the Turkish plan. The British declined. Ten months later, when the British declared war on the Ottomans, the support for a revolt was solidified among the British. Husayn, approached by the British, sent a list of terms, and that forms the basis of the McMahon-Husayn Correspondences that form the backbone of pre-WWII Arab claims to an independent Arab state in Palestine.

This isn't the only example of resistance to centralization. Again, there were numerous instances of local officials ignoring orders or regulations issued from Istanbul, so long as they got a cut of whatever they were doing. In Palestine in particular, the appointed Ottoman governors of Jerusalem from 1901-onward allowed Jews to buy land in exchange for financial favors. The Ottoman empire had begun, already, to weaken its reach, and Istanbul was not effectively administrating much of the empire. It even came to rely on Arab families to carry out things like local tax collecting in some areas, which would form the basis for the more socially powerful Arab families that dominated East Jerusalem later (the Husaynis, Khalidis, Nashashibis, etc.).

&gt;How did they react to Ottoman militiary defeats?

I cannot answer this too effectively, I apologize! I'd rather not give you a half-answer here.

&gt;When did the Arab subjects fnially decide that the Ottoman Empire was no longer legitimate?

It's likely that the best way to assess this is just when the Arab Revolt started, which was June of 1915. However, many Arabs were reluctant to join at first, and it wasn't until 1917 (as Smith notes, anyways) that the Arabs managed to contribute significantly to the war (they were helped in great amount by the British, and funded by them as well). The Arabs had harbored resentment for quite some time, and there were separatist sentiments among the Ottoman armies (the Arabs inside wanted more autonomy for regions under Ottoman control in some cases), but it seemed the capabilities that Husayni boasted of in getting Arabs mobilized against the Ottoman Empire were greatly exaggerated. This was mostly because though Husayni had sent his son to Damascus to talk to Arab nationalists (in 1915), and though they met the suggestions with lukewarm support, a defecting Syrian-Ottoman officer told the British how he'd heard of Husayni's proposals and that his Arab nationalist superiors had been in contact with Husayni. The reality was that support by Arabs for fighting against the Ottomans didn't really solidify until after WWI began, at least as far as I can tell!

A decently large proportion of the day for virtually all doctors is dealing with headaches like insurance company documentation, talking to the insurance company, coding, and all sorts of other ""grunt work"" that no one likes doing.

Liking the idea of medicine is not enough to go through the process to become a doctor. You really ought to know how dissatisfied most doctors are, and how trapped they feel. Try reading blogs by doctors, or reading kevinmd.com for awhile. You really ought to understand why physician suicide rates are quite high, and you ought to understand that things for doctors are getting much, much worse.

&gt; Money. Even though physician salaries are going down, doctors still make a ton of money. In my case especially, I have earned a full scholarship and will have no medical debt. Immediately after residency, I'll be making anywhere from $175,000 - $250,000, more money than most people can hope to make in five years. I'll be able to buy whatever I want. Cars, luxuries, comfortable living. (It's possible to get this kind of money in fields like I-banking but those are also risky and dependent on widely fluctuating factors. Being a doctor is basically guaranteed job security and high salary). I've been poor, and being poor sucks. Never again.

Medical school is going to take you 4 years. Residency will take you 3-7 years. A fellowship (optional) can take anywhere from 1-4. After that, how much money you make is anyone's guess. Specialty pay is unpredictable over long stretches of time. How do you know that what you're going into will still be well-reimbursed by the time you're out? The whole issue with the match process and its unreliability (you might not be matched anywhere) is also something to consider, especially since if you don't match the first time, your odds go way down for a huge variety of reasons.

On the reliability issue, some people drop out of medical school. Some people drop out of residency. Some people drop out after they've got 'real' jobs as independently practicing and fully certified physicians. Because they hate it, or grow to hate it. If you're not 100% sure it's for you, you really shouldn't make the gamble.

Doctors work many more hours than most people do. They give up large stretches of unpaid (or comparatively virtually unpaid) for training. You need to account for the extra hours worked, since it seems your primary goal here is leisure. You need to account for the lost income and early savings compared to your next best option. When do you this, things often start to look dismal.

I'd suggest reading this: http://benbrownmd.wordpress.com/

That's comparing a doctor to a teacher. It's way worse if you compare a doctor to a UPS driver. Or a dentist, particularly high-paid dental specialties... or god forbid someone who has taught themselves to hack (program) quite well, where you can easily command a starting salary north of 150k and probably end up with stock and bonuses worth *at least* another 150k. Or even petroleum engineering (which you don't need to major in petroleum engineering to do, it's better to do chemical and take some extra courses, as you've got even a wider range of fantastic options). You'll get paid the same or more as a doctor as a petroleum engineer, you'll have to deal with a lot less bureaucracy/red tape/unpleasantness, you'll work less, and you'll have a well paying job much sooner. *And* no one is trying to replace petroleum engineers (as much as possible) with mid-level providers to save on costs.

I love how you say being poor sucks, and then plan to subject yourself to at least 4 years of desperate poverty coupled with extremely hard work, also known as medical school.

(Also as a note, I am immensely skeptical of you getting a full scholarship to medical school. This happens so infrequently, that unless you're an MSTP student and also doing a PhD, or committing to be a doctor for the military or similar, it's simply not happening)

&gt; Prestige and status. Having an MD after your name is a surefire ticket to making people look up. Doctors are widely associated with wisdom, hard work, success. It's nice to be respected immediately upon divulging that I'm studying one of the most competitive and lucrative fields in existence. Not many fields can say that.

This is largely a cultural myth. A myth that is quickly being deconstructed by corporate interests in medicine. Please read blogs by actual physicians. Or just go to kevinmd.com and read say, the last 100 posts there and the comment sections.

&gt; Girls. There's a huge stereotype that a white coat is the best aphrodisiac. A lot of women like the idea of being treated to a high class lifestyle, there's no shame in admitting that. Plus a doctor is stereotypically brilliant, confident, a strong leader, and does cool things with cutting edge technology. All of which are great traits to attract most girls, whether one night stands or LTRs. I guess I could hone these traits without being an MD, but it's helpful when girls immediately subconsciously assume these things about me after hearing about my career.

Yes, it's a stereotype for a reason. Stereotypes can be accurate, but they largely never are, and those that are sometimes accurate are inaccurate on most occasions.

You'd have those types of women fawning over you if you had the same or similar amount of money from anything else. Even (perhaps especially) if it was from a trust your daddy set up.

Doctors are more hard working than they are brilliant. People you wouldn't say are terribly smart become doctors because they put in a ton of work. Even the smartest have to put in a lot of work. The leadership thing is a stereotype. With the way things are going, you will very likely be an employed doctor, not an independent one. You'll basically be at the bottom rung of a managerial hierarchy. You'll likely report to someone who really has no understanding of what you do, and can't be bothered to really understand it.

Doing cool things with cutting edge technology works to sort of interest women from STEM backgrounds, possibly. But it definitely doesn't lead to one night stands. At best, it's just something you can talk about that is a mutually interesting topic of conversation.","1401581737"

There are many legitimate reasons for the removal of the foreskin.

- phimosis 
- balanoposthitis
- balanitis
- reduction in risk of HIV acquisition/transmission due to the presence of Langerhans cells in the foreskin and the fact that HIV is attracted to them
- Reduction in the risk of transmitting HPV and thus being the potential cause of cervical cancer
- Reduction in the chance of developing penile cancer
- Reduction of the chance of getting a UTI
- Reduction of the possdibility of acquiring HSV2

"japan","t5_2qh2u","About ten years ago, I came down with streptococcal tonsillitis.  As a general rule, I avoid taking any medication that treats symptoms, such as pain medication, but I happy take medication that treats the source of illness, such as antibiotics.  I visited a doctor, expecting to be prescribed Amoxicillin.  When he prescribed a different drug, I asked why.  He explained that antibiotics *are* generally prescribed in insufficient doses here.  Amoxicillin was rarely used in Japan because many strains had become resistant to it.  The drug that he prescribed instead is one that is generally not prescribed in the West, in order to maintain its efficacy, but it had to be used commonly in Japan because drugs like Amoxicillin had such low efficacy here.

From what you wrote, however, your last sentence is the most telling: ""I need to go back but my work schedule isn't really allowing for it.""  Medication can definitely help you get over an illness, but do not underestimate the power of your own body.  IMHO, your busy schedule is likely a **much** more significant factor to your lingering illness than a low dosage of medication.","1401581742"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","http://m.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/22/1181262/-United-States-National-Debt-and-Money-Purpose-Context-and-Mechanics

The Federal Reserve alone (which is an agency of the federal government, no matter what you may have read on a conspiracy website to the contrary) can print actual currency out of thin air (or the digital equivalent). The Fed then distributes this money into the system by purchasing assets from member banks (who collectively “own” the Federal Reserve stock which pays 6% dividends), which frees up money to banks that can lend money to businesses and individuals which injects credit and demand into the economy.

Traditionally the assets the Federal Reserve has purchased with new money have been overwhelmingly safe Treasury securities, but that has expanded since 2008, when Benjamin Bernanke began purchasing a wide range of assets from mortgage-backed securities to swaps and commercial paper. The main principle remains: new dollars created by the Fed are used to purchase debt created by entities that the government sponsors or guarantees. Thus, new money is always borrowed into the system, even if it's not the federal government doing the explicit borrowing.

Key Role of Government Debt in Money Creation

The architects of the modern system, such as Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under Richard Nixon,  knew that there had to be a high level of quality in the assets that the central bank would buy to put new money into the system. If the quality of the assets purchased was low, then the Federal Reserve risked losing money if cash dried up on the asset, forcing them to create more money to fill the hole and risk systemic instability. This is where the role of government debt came into play: the federal government creates Treasury securities out of nothing, which it then sells to the Federal Reserve, which buys the securities with dollars printed out of nothing.","1401581744"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've been playing the game for about 7 or 8 years now, with a two year break in there somewhere, and I have to say I think now might actually be the best time to get in. It's no longer the ""addict game"" people used to talk about. It's way easier to be a somewhat serious player without having to dump hours on end into it to even be somewhat okay. If you want to play on a more casual level, you are able to very easily. 

Even if you want to properly raid, it's not a big time investment. Up until a few months ago I was a pretty avid raider, putting about 2-3 nights a week into it. But that was basically the only time I actually put into it. I mean, 9 hours a week really isn't much if you're having fun doing it. And I would say that's on the high end. 

It has a good community, it's pretty easy to get into (in contrast to some other online games, like Eve, with a very steep learning curve), and it's just not the big black hole for time it used to be. Maybe if you used to be a hardcore raider you could say it's past its prime, but honestly, if you ask me the quality for a somewhat casual player, it's still more or less the same as it was in the first expansion (TBC). 

Wildstar looks promising as well though. I'd honestly give both of them a go if I were you (if you can, this go should include some endgame too), and just see what you like best. I know people, including myself, have said it before about different games, but this one might have the potential to compete with WoW (but admittedly the last 3 times I said that I just completely wasted my money on mediocre games).","1401581747"

Why, a MAN'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.

&gt;Your mistake is, that you didn't bring your balls with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your mask.

&gt;You didn't really want to shoot. The average man doesn't like trouble and danger. YOU don't like trouble and danger. You're only HALF a man -- like some streetcorner punk -- and you're afraid to back down -- but even more afraid you'll be found out to be what you are -- a COWARD -- and so you hide behind that gun and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do. But that just makes you the pitifulest thing out there; you don't fight with courage that's born in MEN. But a man without any balls swinging from him is BENEATH pitifulness. Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real killing's going to be done you'll need to fetch a MAN along.

Higher prices can be good in the case that the prices of things are being held artificially low via taxation, such as through subsidizing of corn, meat, etc. The prices don't really reflect how much the item actually costs. Further, each item has a societal impact. Having the cost reflect that impact is not necessarily a bad thing.

Personally I find his premise laughable and his understanding of the issue muddled. Craig insists on sticking to an A-theory of time, while every bit of evidence we have says otherwise. Craig wants to abandon Einsteinian Relativity completely - even though all the evidence and data back it up, without fail - merely because he finds the alternative - that the laws of logic aren't sacrosanct - undesirable.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It works really well if you have something like Haskell's `fmap`.  Haskell uses the `Either` type for error reporting and it works really well.

For example, let's say we have a value that is either an `Int` or a failure with a `String` error message:

    value :: Either String Int

Now let's say I want to apply a function to that value:

    example :: Int -&gt; Double

... but I only want to apply the function `example` if the `value` succeeded.  Otherwise, I want to just propagate the error.  I would just write:

    fmap example value :: Either String Double

`fmap` is a very generic function that belongs to the `Functor` type class that has this signature:

    class Functor f where
        fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b

... and `(Either e)` is an instance of the above `Functor` type class, for any choice of error message `e`:

    instance Functor (Either e) where
        fmap _ (Left  e) = Left e
        fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)

... so you can think of `fmap` as having this specialized type when you apply it to `Either`:

    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Either e a -&gt; Either e b

This is a handy way to manipulate potentially failing computations without having to do all the boilerplate of pattern matching on the value and re-wrapping it when you are done.

You can also chain multiple computations, each of which may fail, and that's where monads come in handy.","1401581759"

&gt;

&gt;__Hell__ is a village in the [Lånke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A5nke) area of the municipality of [Stjørdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stj%C3%B8rdal) in [Nord-Trøndelag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord-Tr%C3%B8ndelag) county, [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway). It is located in the western part of the municipality, about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of the municipal center of [Stjørdalshalsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stj%C3%B8rdalshalsen). The 1.48-square-kilometre (370-acre) village has a population (2009) of 1,418. The [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density) of the village is 958 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,480 /sq mi). 

&gt;Hell is a [post town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_town) with two [post codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_codes): 7517 for delivery route addresses and 7570 for [post-office boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-office_box). Hell currently has a [grocery store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store), [gas station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_station), and a [retirement home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_home). Until late 1995, the [European route E6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E6) highway was aligned through Hell and across the Hell bridge to Sandfærhus (nearby [Trondheim Airport, Værnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim_Airport,_V%C3%A6rnes)). The new road now goes around the village.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You're missing the point (no pun intended). :P

Let's say your rent is due tomorrow but you got fired 2 weeks ago. You spent your last paycheck on food, but you ran out yesterday. You don't have any money, no one to borrow from, and you need some TODAY. 

Someone approaches you and says ""Hey, I can help you out. I'll give you enough for your rent plus a little extra if you take the steering wheel from Paris Hilton's favorite car."" 

There is value in the rest of the car, but you don't have the money to hire a tow truck, let alone sneak it in and haul the whole thing away. There could be other valuables in the car, but you don't know how long you're going to have before a guard spots you. You might have time to do a search or you might not, it's risky enough to get the steering wheel. 

A poacher is already taking a huge risk to their lives by even being a poacher. It's a bigger risk to spend more time than necessary to get the one piece they need for money. Butchering it for meat takes time that they may or may not have, and it's also a lot of extra weight to try to sneak out without being caught. 

If it was only about the reward, you'd do whatever was necessary to get Paris Hilton's whole car. But the steering wheel is all you need to survive right now...and maybe you'll get a job and be able to survive without having to take any more celebrity car parts in the future. ","1401581763"

NO ONE here is disputing that.  Whether the person is your average citizen or the POTUS, they can still claim a privacy policy within Youtube's guidelines.  You need to take this up with Youtube, which I think you said you had, which is perfectly fine.  The TSA has nothing to do with it, period.  

&gt;This the video would fall under public interest because it is dealing with government officials and it has newsworthiness because you have TSA agents asking me to stop which is in violation of the TSA policy when it comes to video taping and recording the checkpoints. 

You failed to mention the part where it says, ""For content to be considered for removal, an individual must be uniquely identifiable by image,...""  and don't tell me that wasn't in the email.  I've rec'd the email regarding something else.  Its also on their policy page.  And it also says.  "" YouTube reserves the right to make the final determination of whether a violation of its privacy guidelines has occurred.""

I just read your last line so that's what I've been trying to tell you all these posts, its Youtube, not the TSA or the agent you need to have an issue with.  That was all I was trying to get you to understand.  That's why I had mentioned for people to band together and use another site, but since you're in need of their monetization tools, you won't do that.  So its a double edged sword.

There's admiration respect you offer to a skilled or honorable person, such as a master violinist or Olympic runner.  This is the light side of jealousy, basically.  You want to emulate them.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'd say XWX carries his team consistently and there is a controlled amount of aggression about him which means he is a very difficult player to shut down. Link played phenomenal against him as nidalee vs yasuo but he destroyed him even as clg were ahead for a bit in some of those teamfights. XWX is really hard to ban out and he can be dangerous even if you plan for him. 

Atleast for measurable ability, I'd say top 3 is cemented as XWX, Shiptur, Bjergsen, with virtually no difference between them ability wise as each having better mechanics on certain champions (I like shiptur's lb over bjergsen etc.) since link and hai's other traits are key for their teams rotation and objective control (with hai apparently dictating the entire game). I'm not yet convinced of link's ability as a solo laner just yet, TSM is looking weak in general anyway and link hasn't held up well to top 3 of NA (C9, Dig, LMQ) just yet though there are more games to go.","1401581767"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","&gt; Who's ever claimed that it would be?

Um, a lot of people, mostly politicians that purposefully misinterpreted the original Reinhart and Rogoff study. The original study only showed that there was a correlation between the two and made a few suggestions about the direction of the causation, mostly focusing on high debt =&gt; low growth. Certain politicians loved this and I can personally remember Merkel citing this result on numerous occasions as proof for her austerity and fiscal discipline policies. That kept happening even after the controversy with that study, by the way. 

&gt; If Greece would be used as a simple example we could make the case that once a governments ability to roll its debt diminishes civil unrest and political deadlock will follow. This will further increase the cost of borrowing and deepen the crisis. If the governments debt is below, say 90 %, its ability to act within the financial market is much greater. Even when sudden changes emerge in the global or domestic economy.

This is just a qualitative interpretation of the correlation. If the factors you outlined were the mechanism by which the process worked, this would leave evidence in the data and the study would find it. The fact that it didn't means that either the mechanism you describe does not have an impact on growth or that there are other mechanism that counteract it (or that the methodology used in the study is not so good at finding the direction of causation). 

However, within the confines of the scientific process, this is as close evidence as you can get that telling countries to not go into debt because it will slow their growth is wrong. (Obviously, that doesn't mean that all countries should start borrowing like there is no tomorrow.)

&gt; Arguing that this study finds that sovereign debt is not harmful to growth, is not only wrong but very narrow minded; it's merely a conclusion based on data that cannot take into account the full complexity of a government in an economic crisis.

You seem to not understand what the study is saying or how this works. The fact that you can present a qualitative story that is inconsistent with the result does not invalidate the study. Anyone can come up with any number of qualitative interpretations for any data. Your interpretation does not even fit the data, so what exactly is your point here? 

&gt; It merely shows that the results of this study do not support the claims.

This is just wrong. The phrasing is just an academic way of saying ""we ran our experiments and this is the result we got"". It in no way means that if you run a similar study with a different methodology they fully expect you to get a different result. 

In conclusion: You don't understand how science works and you just want to rationalise your ideological disagreement with the results. ","1401581770"

It's called growing up and it's only going to get worse. Before you know it your skills will begin to diminish and you'll find it difficult to compete. As a result, being the constant victim of tea-bagging kids half your age will make those competitive multiplayer games far less enjoyable. You'll also notice your free time diminish to the point that it takes weeks to beat that 4 hour single player campaign everyone is bitching about...but you'll enjoy it and roll your eyes at the complaints. In the end, if you don't give up gaming, you'll settle for co-op shooters with those few friends that stayed around, single player games that will entertain you for months, and (MMO)RPGs.

On the bright side of things, you'll spend a lot less money on games and get a lot more value out of the ones you do buy.

Note: Getting into an MMO and finding a mature guild of people roughly 30 and older is a great way to reinvigorate your list of gaming friends.","1401581777"

Admittedly there are some good ideas I've seen on here that I haven't tried yet when it comes to fishing cable, like tying a magnet to the end and 'guiding' it through the wall. ","1401581783"

There wouldn't be two sets of quantum information that were identical, there would be only one set of quantum information that is inside both minds. However, that raises the question of what would happen if you then made their environments different. The minds would quickly diverge as new, non-shared quantum information is absorbed by the mind.

This is the ""state of nature"". Hobbes is establishing support for his conception of man as being above the ""state of nature"" because we can enumerate things, which leads to thinking of and planning for the future, which leads to the necessity of state formation to protect stockpiled resources.

Eyeshine is a visible effect of the tapetum lucidum. 

When light shines into the eye of an animal having a tapetum lucidum, the pupil appears to glow. 

Eyeshine can be seen in many animals, in nature and in flash photographs. In low light, a hand-held flashlight is sufficient to produce eyeshine that is highly visible to humans (despite our inferior night vision); this technique, spotlighting, is used by naturalists and hunters to search for animals at night. 

Eyeshine occurs in a wide variety of colors including white, blue, green, yellow, pink and red.

I would invite new friends to play the game, but honestly I can't see them grind for all this stuff and they sure as hell will not buy RP to help unlock stuff. 

Another big problem is the many different servers, I started on EU and with the split I lost half of my friends because they were all on the wrong server for me. I switched to the other server where my main group of friends was playing (switching after release took 2 months before it was available). I still have people on the server I was exiled too that want to play with me, I also have people on NA that would like to play with me, my friends on other servers and me have some stalemate where nobody is really willing to make a new account and grind up to a decent level where the game gets to be fun.

I really wish they allowed me to make a new name on a different server and connect my main account to it so I can play with everything I have unlocked on my main, it would make it so much easier to play with friends, but it is Rito and Rito will never implement such features, either because their technical architecture would be impossible to upgrade from or because they need people to buy RP.

"Intactivists","t5_2si5s","&gt; Male foreskin takes years to separate from the glans (head), which is unusual enough of a process to suggest one if its main functions may help prevent infection, especially in infants. It helps shield the opening of the urethra from any contaminates or bacteria, explains Weinhaus. It also protects your reproductive chances: Without a foreskin, the glans rubs against objects, like your clothes, and develops a thick layer of skin to desensitize itself, Weinhaus says. Foreskin keeps men more sexually sensitive, which would’ve encouraged our ancestors to reproduce more.

That's kind of weakly pro-foreskin, but it's much better than what we see more often especially in US media.","1401581793"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't like a super sweet dough but you could probably add a bit to this to make it sweeter.

I start with a cup of hot water, a pinch of sugar or a small squirt of honey but you could add more, and 2 and 1/4 teaspoons of yeast.  I let that sit and get nice and frothy.  Then I add a teaspoon of coarse kosher salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, mix that in so that there isn't an oil slick and add 2 cups of bread flour and mix until blended using my stand mixer and dough hook.  I then add in flour in 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup increments (depending on how wet and sticky it is).  

Once it is no longer tacky, I cover the bowl and let it rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  The dough will be sticky again so I add a bit more flour, work it in, and once the tackiness is gone again, I knead the dough in the machine for 10 to 12 minutes until it kind of bounces back when I poke it.  Oil it, cover and let rise for at least an hour or until doubled in size.  You can use it then but I often punch it down, form it into a new ball and then place in a very large ziplock bag (leave rising room) and toss it into the fridge until the next day.","1401581796"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes. Most autonomic body functions are controlled by the primitive part of the brain found in the brainstem, such as the pons and medulla. As long as these structures remain undamaged, it's possible to lose all higher brain function but still be alive physically. This was the case with Terri Schiavo.

Is it common? No. Most of the time, somebody who is 'brain dead' has lost all brain function and is being kept alive through mechanical ventilation. In long-term situations, the body will still begin to breakdown, regardless of how many machines you put them on. Peristalsis of the GI tract will cease, so the tube feeding will have no effect. The damaged parts of the brain will liquefy, and the lungs will fill with fluid. 
Putting a brain dead person on life support is done for two reasons: to allow the patient's family sufficient time to say goodbye, or to stop tissue damage for occurring so that the organs may be transplanted.","1401581799"

---

&gt;___Out of Season___ is a [studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_album) by [Portishead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_(band\)) frontwoman [Beth Gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Gibbons) and former [Talk Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_Talk_(band\)) bassist [Paul Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Webb) (under the pseudonym Rustin Man). It was released on 28 October 2002 in the United Kingdom and on 7 October 2003 in the United States. *Out of Season* is largely a [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music) album with [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz) leanings, with Gibbons and Webb drawing more directly on the influences of [Nina Simone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone), [Billie Holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday), and [Nick Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake), at which Portishead's work in [trip-hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip-hop) only hinted. *Out of Season* also features contributions from Gibbon's fellow Portishead bandmate Adrian Utley and Webb's former bandmate [Lee Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harris_(drummer\)). The first track of the album, ""Mysteries"", appears on the original soundtrack of the French movie *[Les Poupées Russes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Poup%C3%A9es_Russes)* (*[The Russian Dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russian_Dolls)*) and in *[Wim Wenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Wenders)* *[Palermo Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo_Shooting)* from 2008. The album achieved a silver certification from [BPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPI)

Har aldrig sett en enda 90-talist som beter sig på det här sättet.

Jävlar vilken tuff kille han är ""snubben bredvid Håkan"" som tror att han kommer från utkanten av Londons fattiga gator ""jag är fucking indie, du vet ingenting"".
Han blev tyvärr ingen legend, inte lika tufft då att sitta och vara salt framför media.
Varför beter sig vissa musiker som om dom vore det djupaste av djup och det mörkaste av mörker?
Jag har sett denna snubbe tidigare och jag gillar denna sortens musik men fan vad det värker av ilska i mig när jag hör han prata.
Håkan ser ju sugen ut på att vara trevlig men så sitter salta killen bredvid så han vågar väl inte vara sig själv. 
Kanske därför han stack iväg och gjorde eget?
Folk måste sluta tro att dom är genier.
Jag tex är ju helt dum i huvudet som blir irriterad av sånt här, kanske är jag värre än ""salta killen"" men det är ju någon annans problem.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","1. If by f2p you mean to not spend anything on the game, yes, it's possible. Obviously you need to have some cards, but couple of packs are enough to get them (if you disenchant anything you don't need). But there is another problem. If you give a f2p deck to good player, he will get Legendary with it. It was already proven by many streamers. However, people who don't have cards yet are usually new players, which aren't that good at this game. My advice is to take things slowly. It took me about 4-5 months of playing before I got enough cards and skill to really started to climb the ladder. I didn't spend anything on the game yet, and I don't plan to. The most important thing is experience. I don't think it's possible for an unexperienced player to climb into Legend with f2p deck. So, just play the game, enjoy it, and you will learn something with every day. Also, don't disenchant the cards you don't need now! You'll see that many cards you think you won't use will come handy lter. The thing I did is disenchanting all the Golden cards I got (if I already have 2 normal ones). This way your deck isn't that shiny, but you can afford those Legendaries much faster. But it's up to you, I did it and I don't regret it yet.
2. If I were you, I'd try the Trump guides. Here's one of them: http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/arena-strategy/513-trumps-arena-tier-list-neutral-commons  
They're generally really helpful and will surely tell you more than I will. My advice here is to just play. Again, experience is the most crucial thing. You can follow general tips, but only after playing couple of dozens of Arenas you'll start to realize why you want to pick certain cards, how you pick depending on what you already have etc. Trial and error method. You pick a card couple of times, but it never works out, you don't pick it again. And on the other hand, if a card saved you many times and you feel that it was good, pick it again.
3. Sure, you can send me an invite. Stonekeep#2420 - I'll accept it tomorrow, because I won't play anymore today.","1401581802"

Cslhypo isn't a stabilized chlorine either, its just a powder so its stable to transport but will break down just the same in untreated water.  

As for the magic conversion of percentages its called math. If bleach has 5% of sodium hypochlorite and liquid shock has 10% sodium hypochlorite then it will take exactly twice as many gallons of bleach to give you the same amount of sodium hypochlorite as liquid chlorine.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The various terrorists will often create long and sometimes silly lists if demands, but it all basically boils down to one thing: the spread of western culture. The western culture bug has bitten countries all over the world, and it's reaching the middle east, much to their dismay. Ideas like women's rights (or allowing them to show their faces at all), free markets, individual liberties, consumerism, religious freedom, gay rights, the whole enchilada. It very much bothers them to see their youth thinking and acting in ways that aren't in line with their culture, and they point the finger of blame at America, who is sort of the poster child for western culture. 

The sad thing is that before 9/11, it was a very, very small group of people who 1) hated western culture that much 2) blamed its spread on America, and 3) were willing to resort to terrorism to fix it. But after 9/11 and our massive invasions every which way in the middle east, Al Qaeda suddenly had a perfect recruitment tool, saying ""Look at what America is doing to your cities and governments! They must be stopped at all costs!"" Because this makes a much more compelling argument that ""our kids are copying American TV so let's blow shit up"", their numbers multiplied in the years following. 

Tl;dr: It started as an intimidated hatred of American culture, but turned into a hatred of America's actions in the middle east. ","1401581808"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; You can't be serious reddit.

I'm not reddit, I'm Entropius.

&gt; Yeah, which is why China's development is much cleaner than that of the west.

You're assuming China uses all the available technology and same environmental protection protocols, but they don't.  China is cleaner versus the west in the past compared to a similar phase of economic development, but at the same time they're not enforcing western environmental protocols to the same level the west is.  They're roughly between 1900's industrial west, and the modern west in terms of what they could be doing.

&gt;&gt; Sorry but if you're going to make a claim, burden of proof is on you to supply evidence. And you aren't doing so.

&gt; You were the one proposing a certain metric of comparison. It's your job to make that. Not mine. I'm not interested in making your point for you. You said this was a better comparison so let's see what data it will produce!

You're trying to change the subject again. Let me refresh your memory.

And I quote:  [“*Except you want to go back in history and compare China to Australia/US/Canada during the same stage of those countries' development. Feel free to do so, that will make China look even greener.*”](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/26yknm/china_warns_australian_pm_tony_abbotts_plan_to/chvvjs4) That is you making a case which you are now trying to weasel out of ponying up evidence for.

&gt; Again, which is why China's development is much cleaner than that of the west.

Again, you're assuming China uses all the available technology and same environmental protection protocols, but they don't. See above.

&gt;Again, 5 times more people in China than in the US while the country is approximately the same size. Things should be 5 times worse.

No, because you're (again) ignoring the economic-inequity that's offsetting this.  If everyone in China were about as affluent as people in the West, it would be 5 times higher.  It's like you're incapable of considering more than one possible parameter at a time, in this case, per-capita.

Also, it's only 4.3 times more people.  Stop trying to inflate numbers to cover your ass.

That graph's most recent value for China and the US are respectively 40,000 Gg SO2 and 15,000 Gg SO2.   China and the US's populations are respectively 1,364,730,000 and 318,127,000.  And China and US's nominal GPDs (according to the UN) are respectively 8,358,400 and 16,244,600.

&gt; e = c(40000,15000)

&gt; p = c(1364730000, 318127000)

&gt; gdp = c(8358400, 16244600)

&gt; e/gdp/p

[1] 3.506631e-12 2.902563e-12

So China is 3.5e-12 and US is 2.9e-12. So accounting for population and GDP, China is worse when it comes to sulfur emissions.

&gt; It isn't cherry-picked at all. It's simply an example of how bad things were. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea_soup_fog

Sure it's cherry picked.  It was a single case of the *absolute worse case of how bad things got*.  That's cherry-picking.  Furthermore, they don't get that kind of smog anymore, you're having to reach into the past to drudge up this example.  China does get this kind of horrible smog nowadays.  The west adopted technology and practices China hasn't despite both nations having access to the same technology now.

&gt; ""But, but you're trying to cherry-pick data making China look bad."" :,(((

That's not cherry-picking, that's an annual statistic that is also modern.  Unlike your outdated worse-case example.  Also my statistic is for China, unlike your statistic which is a single city that you're trying to use as a proxy to paint the entire Western world, rather than actually citing a Western nation's annual pollution deaths.

&gt; Seriously, though: Once again you completely ignore population density in China. 

Just because it contributes to the problem doesn't mean you should factor it out.  If China makes its cities too dense, thats their fault and they should have spread factories out better to avoid the density.  Good environmental policy by the government could have encouraged that.

&gt; 500k a year in a country of 1.4 bn people... compared to 12,000 dead people over a couple of days in a single city of 8 mn (in a country of 39 mn).
Let's do the math on that... oh hey, in a year China killed a maximum of 0.0003% of its population all throughout the country.

**YOU SUCK AT MATH.  You forgot to multiply the results of your division by 100 to turn it into a percentage.  It's actually (500000 deaths / 1364730000 people) x 100 = 0.036%.  You're off by multiple orders of magnitude!**

I'll skip a few paragraphs of your post because they relied on this incorrect math.  While repeatedly rubbing your face in your shitty math every paragraph would be self-satisfying, it's a waste of time.


&gt; No, you saw much worse things during that stage of their development despite significantly lower population densities.

Again, and significantly less science and technology available to them.  You keep trying to conveniently ignore that factor.

&gt; You are trying to compare apples and oranges. Weren't you the one trying to dismiss bad comparisons? Not a single comparison I made was as bad as the ones you tried to make so far.

[…]

&gt; That is an idiotic assumption on several levels and I already pointed out to you why, remember?

&gt; Maybe you need that explained to you again: China is doing more for environmental protection than the US and isn't even remotely fully industrialized, yet. They are in a stage of industrialization. If you want to compare pollution on that level you would need to compare current-day China to the US during that stage of development when people in the US were as prosperous as Chinese people are today.

&gt; And to compare future Chinese people to current US Americans after having reached a similar level of prosperity, you would have to project their future environmental developments. Considering that China already is investing more than the US in green development, have fun providing evidence for your hypothesis.


Actually I just gave you an emission/gdp/per-capita comparison in which China still ends up worse.  Scroll up.

&gt; Whether it is a fallacy or not is of no relevance. The US is not in a position to criticize China. They can make absolutely no demands. That would make them hypocrites.

Whether it's a fallacy is **EXACTLY** of relevance.  Hypocrisy is not a reason to disregard or reject criticism, otherwise Tu Quoque wouldn't be a fallacy.  You're essentially implying Tu Quoque isn't a  fallacy when the rest of the world says it is.   Do you really think you're smarter than every logician in the world?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; And the West chooses to use them.

No, *corporations* choose to use them.  Western nations can only make environmental regulations within their own borders.  If multinational corporations wish to manufacture something in China at great cost to the environment, we can't stop them.  Or is China all the sudden cool with the idea of not respecting national sovereignty now?

&gt;A better analogy is: It's like going to a shitty mechanic and knowing full well how he will dispose of that oil. Of course it's your fault as you knew it would happen. If you wouldn't have given your car to that shitty mechanic, that oil wouldn't be in the sewers.

I know you think you're fixing the analogy but you're not.  Multinational corporations obey the local laws, and nothing else.  They choose where to manufacture goods (not western governments).  And China encourages them to manufacture goods there by not raising their own environmental standards, ensuring the costs of production remain low enough to out-compete manufacturing in western nations.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt; Is it feasible to complete this with about 5-6 hours of coding a week over 2 months?

I'm not a driver programmer, so take what I say with a grain of salt. But that seems extremely optimistic to me.

5-6 hours for 8 weeks is 40 to 48 hours. That's one normal work week.

I would estimate that someone who knows drivers well, and who has written USB drivers before would need more than a week to write something like this.

Someone who has not done this before will need significantly more time than the experienced person. So combine those two things, and I think it's very unlikely you could do this in the time frame you think.

it's why you have to train yourself to like certain foods like coffee and why certain flavours like wine are so easily corrupted: change them just enough and they no longer match what you've trained yourself to find palatable even if they're still similar so they just taste awful.

"EntrepreneurRideAlong","t5_2twzl","&gt; Honestly, I'm not sure what a good number to start at is...

Well what's a customer worth to you? Or better, how much advertising budget do you calculate is required per sale? And how much will a sale eventually generate in profit, which is where your ad budget comes out of? Because all Adwords gives you is clicks (unless you use the leads feature, which I assume you don't). Clicks can turn into leads, but most don't. Leads might turn into a sale, but still some don't and the sale will have to cover the advertising budget used on those that only clicked as well after all. You might want to monitor those transitions as well, for example use Analytics to monitor how many clicks are generated through Adwords and how soon they leave your website. Use a dedicated number in Adwords that's only posted on adwords that allows you to track the number of calls on that particular line. Use another one for your website, yet another for your business cards, for your flyers and so on and so on.","1401581823"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","It's unlikely to be a physical problem with the graphics card then, and temperature and clock speed should be fine with a factory OC. Drivers could definitely be an issue, or the card may be badly seated in the slot, or there is dust or something giving a poor connection to the card. You could try taking the card out and blowing some compressed air in the slot and them putting the card back in, making sure it's seated really well. It doesn't look like a bad HDMI cable to me, but I'd still recommend trying a different output/input if you get a chance, because that would help narrow down if it's only affecting one output and/or input.

Does your TV have any 'advanced' features? If it has motion interpolation or anything, try turning it off.  At 50Hz, you can easily move 180 degrees in the game in 20ms, so if the TV interpolates to 100Hz, you will have 1 frame that combines two completely different viewpoints while you're turning.

I'd also try posting somewhere like computerforum.com. You'll probably get a lot more replies there. Are you able to capture a video directly from the card? It would be a lot clearer than a phone recording. Or, you might even be better with just a screenshot. This would also help with the troubleshooting, because if the problem was present in a capture directly from the card, it would rule out HDMI or TV problems, and if it wasn't, it would rule out most card/driver issues.","1401581823"

"longboarding","t5_2qvgw","Hi /r/longboarding[1] . For the past week or so I've been reading everything in the sidebar and lurking this subreddit and I think it's time I finally splurge to buy my own longboard. Although it's looked down upon here, I've been pennying for the past few months. I'm looking to get out of the Penny world and hop into the world of longboarding.
I need some help completing the setup I'm going to buy.

In the beginner guide for longboarding that I found in the sidebar, it said that I should go for a freeride deck as they are versatile and I can find out what I really like doing (downhill, freeride, dancing, etc.)
Here's my setup that I have so far, I'm just unsure as to what deck I want to buy:

-Bones Reds Bearings

-Khiro ""Standard"" 8mm x 10mm Longboard Skateboard Bearing Spacers
-Khiro Speed Rings

-Sweetspot Milk Surfers

-Caliber Fifty Caliber trucks

-Vicious griptape.

I've spent the past two days looking at decks and I'm still uncertain which would be the best for me. Would a ""BAMBOO NS DROP THROUGH- 39 inch"" from funboxdist.com be a bad place to start?

Any help is appreciated. Please keep in mind that I'm very new to this and still learning. Thank you!","1401581830"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Yikes. I know you're just asking this question, not making an argument, but this post definitely puts a sour taste in my mouth.

Evidence is frequently collected after the fact. Catcalling, touching, all that is pretty ephemeral. It happens, then it's over. Unless somebody is already recording, there's no reason it would be anywhere.

There's [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIlObKYwUyI#t=12). So think about: this guy had his penis out in public and was rubbing up against this woman. When she noticed, she make a huge deal of it. Somebody near her decided to start recording. The guy was convicted -- he obviously did it. Yet even in this case, where somebody thought to take their phone out, all we get is the aftermath.

Men call at me when I'm walking from one place to another, when I'm in the mall, when I'm walking through a parking lot, all places where it is not at all convenient to pull my phone out.

Not to mention -- *I'd be scared*. If some dude is shouting at me, the last thing *I* want to do is give him cause to be angry at me. Other ladies feel more comfortable with reacting (like the woman in the above video) and that's honestly great. I applaud them for being bold enough to call these guys out. But I am not going to whip my phone out and record some guy being gross to me because my first instinct is to get away. I use the be polite and remove myself tactic, that's what I feel most comfortable with, and recording these incidents does not play into that. I think a lot of women do that as well.

All that being said, I am *positive* there is evidence of this online. A lot of it is probably not even catalogued under catcalling because it's just in the background of some other video because that's how commonplace it is.

Ugh, I really dislike your male friend. He has no idea yet feels justified in making these demands. Yes it's a burden. I'm not trying to get anyone put in jail. I'm just saying this is the way the world is. This is something men do. Most people know that, recognize it, but every so often, some man comes in whining that *he* never sees street harassment so it must not happen. As if the world that he sees is the only world that exists. It's a sad and damaging perspective to have.","1401581833"

"PHP","t5_2qh38","Are you referring to a single place for files and images like the Media section in WordPress? I can see that if this is what you are used to then it maybe be hard to change but I actually have to agree with the way processwire does it more.

See you can always add a files or images fields to a template, and if you wanted you could add them to add your templates. I feel like this process make more sense for my clients and they seem to agree. If a person make a page for a ""book"" I will define a field for the cover image and make a single file field for a PDF preview. But in a more generic scenario of a ""basic-page"" template I might just have a files field and an images field, the user could then place links to these file or images in the body content. To me it feels more logical if I make a page about my company and upload images of my building and office and files for my corporate policy and a brochure of the service I offer **to** the actual page they belong, instead of putting them into a giant melting pot where they get lots. I've help a few companies in the past manage large wordpress sites and SOOO often the will have upload the same file over and over again because they couldn't find the first ones they uploaded, but I've never seen the same thing happen with ProcessWire.

I've rambled a lot, but really I think ProcessWire is borderline perfect. And dont even get me strated on the selectors, I constantly forgot the WordPress query syntax, but in ProcessWire if I say, want to find the five book in my site wit the most sales that are in the category fantasy that have more than one author (try shit like that in WordPress and you will commit suicide) I just do something like this:

```
$pages-&gt;find(""template=book, category=fantasy, author.count&gt;1, sort=-sales, limit=5"");

"anime","t5_2qh22","I would not personally claim the Bakemonogatari series to be a masterpiece. I think it's very well done in all regards, but it isn't really anything special. 

Madoka, on the other hand, I would claim is absolutely a masterpiece. I am going to warn you right now that I am going to get a bit high-artsy here, and a bit long-winded. I don't believe that the question ""why is this a masterpiece?"" can be answered easily, because it's a subtle point.

First off, how does one define a ""masterpiece?"" According to the dictionary definition of the word (*a work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship*) both shows are masterpieces of animation. They are quite simply astounding from a visual perspective, and they make great use of the medium of animation. Shaft has an incredible understanding of the medium of animation. I could give you a much longer talk about why Shaft's animation is head and shoulders above that of most other studios, but I am not going to define a ""masterpiece"" in this way, so it is irrelevant.

We expect that a masterpiece should be something more than just a great work of skill. It should really mean something. There's an idea in the art community that ""true art"" is what happens when the audience reacts to a work. If you hammer a nail into a brick and put it on a table, it's just a waste of time; if you put it in a gallery and make people think about it, however, it might *become* art. It sounds dumb, but there is some merit to the idea. In the hands of somebody who has no understanding of racial history or justice, is *To Kill A Mockingbird* a ""masterpiece?"" Probably not. The book becomes a masterpiece when I read it and a discussion occurs between myself and the material, and it makes me think about what it means to stand up for equality and what is right. That is the real art.

On a thematic note, Madoka was a brutal representation of reality. I myself am a scientist, working on my PhD in physics. I believe in absolute academic integrity and freedom of knowledge, as do the vast majority of scientists. However, we have plenty of scientists who get paid by major corporations to run fallacious studies and then stand by their ""results"" in order to support the corporation and get paid a bunch of money. Nobody sits through 25+ years of school with the hope of giving up on academic honesty, people just get fed up with ""the system"" and eventually decide that there is nothing they can do but join it. You work for 20 years on your research only to have it squashed because an oil company lobbies against you. If you're not going to get any work done, might as well get paid a shit-ton of money to just lie to the public instead. Then you become the bad guy the next generation of scientists are brought up to hate. This same cycle happens in the medical industry, in law, in all sorts of places.

Madoka shows the same story, and it makes it painful. We expect ""The Power of Love"" to always win because that's what happens in other Magical Girl shows, but Love is subject to this same vicious cycle. It hits me deep in the part of my brain that understands that I may have my dreams crushed by reality and then I'll give in and become the ""bad guy."" That internal reflection is the ""art,"" and then it also comes in an amazing presentation. Amazing visuals, amazing sound, amazing story and characters, and then it also makes me really think; that's a masterpiece.","1401581843"

by George Dohrmann . It's about AAU and deals with shoe sponsorships, shoe company tournaments, etc. Features Tyson Chandler in parts. Follows Oregon State's Roberto Nelson extensively.

Also,  *The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams* by Darcy Frey.

Deals primarily with East Coast Ball (as opposed to *The Assist* which is set on the West Coast). Includes a lot of discussion of the Former-Former (Boston College era) Big East. I read this one like 8 years ago so that's all I can remember.

If you design a home so that it begins with the necessities of large great room (kitchen, dining, living combined), a laundry room w/pantry, a master bedroom w/bath and walk in closets but to which you can easily add more bedrooms on the other end of the great room it will cost less initially and that alone could make it easier; however, there are pitfalls to NOT knowing what you are doing.  So...

Also, pay close attention to the geography on which your home is to be built, including if you could start by building a basic concrete block southern facing basement or half basement apartment to live in while you later build your dream house atop it w/separate utility connections so that then either use the basement a home office or family / hobby room or for in-law visits or maybe even rent the basement as an apartment for income to pay for that dream house.","1401581846"

 [**Voronoi diagram**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi%20diagram): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a __Voronoi diagram__ is a way of dividing space into a number of regions. A set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand and for each seed there will be a corresponding region consisting of all points [closer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance) to that seed than to any other. The regions are called Voronoi cells. It is [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics\)) to the [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).

&gt;It is named after [Georgy Voronoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Voronoy), and is also called a __Voronoi [tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation)__, a __Voronoi decomposition__, a __Voronoi partition__, or a __Dirichlet tessellation__ (after [Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet)). Voronoi diagrams can be found in a large number of fields in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology), even in [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), and they have found numerous practical and theoretical applications.

* This i5 is being sold at Fry's for $100. You can price match at Staples if they're still sold out.

* The R9 270 performs far better than the 750 Ti. It can run practically all games on High/Ultra at 1080p/60FPS.

* Had to change the case due to PSU compatibility.

* The build uses around 300 W, so I had to upgrade the PSU a bit to give a bit of headroom. Also, this one is modular, so it should be a lot easier to manage cables with.","1401581851"

I don't think *all* of those sources are incorrect, and if you *do*, you need to re-evaluate your position.

You say:

&gt;The particle in a box is arguably the worst example you could pick to try and prove the point that energy is continuous.

But ... from the article on [energy levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level):

&gt;Quantized energy levels result from the relation between a particle's energy and its wavelength. For a confined particle such as an electron in an atom, the wave function has the form of standing waves. Only stationary states with energies corresponding to integral numbers of wavelengths can exist; for other states the waves interfere destructively, resulting in zero probability density. **Elementary examples that show mathematically how energy levels come about are the particle in a box** and the quantum harmonic oscillator.

&gt;**A** quantum mechanical system or **particle that is bound**—that is, confined spatially—**can only take on certain discrete values of energy**. This contrasts with **classical particles**, which **can have any energy**.

And from the article on the [particle in a box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box):

&gt;The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems. In classical systems, for example a ball trapped **inside a large box, the particle can move at any speed** within the box and it is no more likely to be found at one position than another. However, **when the well becomes very narrow** (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. **The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels**.

&gt;The particle in a box model provides one of the very few problems in quantum mechanics which can be solved analytically, without approximations. This means that **the observable properties of the particle (such as its energy** and position) **are related to** the mass of the particle and **the width of the well** by simple mathematical expressions. Due to its simplicity, the model allows insight into quantum effects without the need for complicated mathematics. **It is one of the first quantum mechanics problems taught in undergraduate physics courses**, and it is commonly used as an approximation for more complicated quantum systems.

So, you're really, *really* reaching far out of your element if you're saying that the particle in a box model is the worst example to choose from.  It is probably the *best* example to choose from, due to its simplicity and the fact that it can be solved exactly.

You say:

&gt;The very simple eigenvalue solution E = (1/8m)(nh/L)^(2) makes it quite clear that regardless of L, a particles energy will always be a quantified value dependent on an integer value n.

And as you can see from the very equation you typed out, as L tends to infinity, the quantity (nh/L) tends toward zero, indicating that no matter what integer value n takes, the energy eigenvalues are separated by infinitesimally small distances (thus forming a continuum).  Note that *you* were the one that typed out this formula, not me.  That means your own equations are at odds with your conclusions.

You also say:

&gt;There is nothing contradictory in stating that bands are simply overlapping discrete energy states

Saying that they are *overlapping* implies that there is *zero distance* between the energy states, again necessitating that it is a continuum.  If the distance between those energy states were *non-zero*, then there would be a band gap, the energy states would *not* overlap, and the spectrum would be truly discrete.

Further, you say:

&gt;As for introductory level quantum, any course worth it's weight in salt should begin with laying out its fundamental experiments: ... \[including\] the Planck solution to blackbody radiation ...

Speaking of the Planck solution to blackbody radiation, from the Wiki article on blackbody radiation:

&gt;Black-body radiation has a characteristic, **continuous frequency spectrum** that depends only on the body's temperature, called the Planck spectrum or **Planck's law**.

So the very examples you are using here to prove your points ... well ... those examples *completely contradict* your points.

Further, you later say:

&gt;It's translational motion may not be quantized but its electronic states, rotation, and vibration all are.

Even though you seem to lack a lot of knowledge about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, I'm sure even *you* are familiar with Galilean relativity, if not special relativity.

Then, you should know that a particle's total energy depends on its speed!

If the possible values for its speed (""translational motion"") form a continuous spectrum, then *obviously* the possible values for its energy must *also* form a continuous spectrum.

So ... all this being said ... I *strongly* suggest you do some further research about these topics.

If you are a teacher, as you imply in other posts on this thread, then you are *grossly* misleading your students about these concepts, and are contradicting all of the textbooks.  At the very least, when questioned about these topics in the future, it would be best for you to simply answer, ""I don't know,"" instead of affirming an answer known to be factually incorrect, and then citing examples which demonstrate its incorrectness.

I posted this in the hopes that you will take it to heart, recognize that you are wrong, and make an attempt to correct yourself in the future.  Teaching the wrong answers is worse than not teaching at all, after all ...","1401581852"

Terrible hit detection, damage high enough that you could mistake the normal mode for hardcore, easier quickscoping then ever, ""massive"" maps that are mostly long open spaces which are basically nothing but killpits. Killstreaks that feed into other killstreaks (in some situations.) A new form of proximity explosive that only gives you about half a second to react, has a massive kill range and looks like a rock or piece of rubbish on the ground...which is bad considering most of the game is covered in rocks and rubbish. Premade groups are STILL placed against randoms...

And that's only a few of it's problems. Mix that in with the traditional CoD community? It's a recipe for disaster. CoD have always been guilty pleasure games for me, but this was the straw that broke my back for Infinity Ward games, they're just a shell of their old selves but this was exceptionally bad...even MW3 was good compared to this crapfest. I'll no doubt grab the next two, but that's because I want to see how Sledgehammer handles the series, and I've always been a fan of the Treyarch CoD games since they focus on balancing ALL gameplay instead of just balancing player archetypes.","1401581861"

i am currently drawing 2 sprites to the screen, everything is working correctly as is, but i am trying to implement multiple files (as everything is currently in the main file) and that is where i am getting my error.

in my header file i have 3 functions: 

CMain(void)

~CMain(void)

 void GameLoop(void)

 i pretty much just copy-pasted everything into the CMain constructor except for declaring the variables in the .h file, and the gameloop itself, which i put into the GameLoop function. the video tutorial that i am following said that simply writing ""CMain cmain"" would do the same as all of the code that i had already written...

A lot of people (most people) are uninformed about it and have no idea how physically harmless it actually is until someone educates them. Often the fear of getting it stems from the fear that other people have of getting it. It's groupthink. People are afraid of it because everyone else is. It's not something to be afraid of. It's something to be aware of. She's taking just as much risk in the dating pool as with you, actually less. There is a 2% chance per year that you will give it to her with meds and condoms.

I ran Han with Falcon, PTL, Luke, Chewie, Engine upgrade, and a random Blue squad with HLC, FCS, and a shield upgrade.  

First game was against pretty textbook TIE swarm with Stealth on Howl, Dark Curse/Night Beast, and 4 Acads.  He just couldn't chop through the Falcon and its constant boosting/evading shenanigans, even with a damaged cockpit for Han.

Game 2 was a loss to the eventual winner.  Threw away the B-wing in a stupid joust on turn 2, but the Falcon again remained incredibly obnoxious.  Forced him to constantly split his bets by pointing in different directions, then managed to keep boosting out of his arcs. He got the kill in the end, but I managed to keep the firesprays so disrupted one flew off the board and the other two had 4 Hull collectively at the end.  

Game 3 was against a miniswarm of 3 plus Stealth and Swarm Tactics on Howl, with two concussion missile bombers for fire support.  The scrum went completely wrong for him.  He never got more than 1 or 2 ships firing at once, and I erased Howl early.  I never took hull damage.","1401581868"

I'm surprised that twitch, which seemed to be free farming early in the game didn't pull ahead of lucian and start causing problems. I really think LMQ adc was off his CS that game.","1401581874"

This isn't one of those ""Only RDJ can pull this look off, you will look bad"" comments, even he looks like an idiot here. I wouldnt be surprised if i saw some teenager who thought he was 'street' or 'ghetto' wearing shit like this to his high school prom. 

Anyways, Op. Never wear high top sneakers with a suit, im of the belief that you should never wear anything but shoes with a suit, loafers are acceptable if you can pull them off. I know some people will disagree and say you can wear certain sneakers but i think it looks childish. 

As for the check that suit has, urrrgh. Its just so garish. If you want a nice check look into something like The Prince of Wales check, its quite [subtle](http://www.gievesandhawkes.com/navy-prince-of-wales-check-single-breasted-peak-lapel-4745.html), [and another example](http://uk.burberry.com/travel-tailoring-wool-prince-of-wales-check-suit-p39180361) which i love, or you can be quite [overt](http://www.dapperedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Tom-Ford.jpg) but you have to fucking cool to pull that off. 

The cut of the suit is a slightly older style, the big lapels are traditionally from the 40's/50's. SuitSupply offer lots of suits in that style, basically what i think you're looking for that wont make you look like a tool is something like [this](http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/sienna-light-grey-check/P3646.html?start=15&amp;cgid=Suits&amp;prefn1=collection&amp;prefn2=basicDessinSuits&amp;prefv2=Check&amp;prefv1=Spring%2FSummer) or [this](http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-light-grey-check/P3802.html?start=3&amp;cgid=Suits&amp;prefn1=collection&amp;prefn2=basicDessinSuits&amp;prefv2=Check&amp;prefv1=Spring%2FSummer) or [this](http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-grey-check/P3826.html?start=12&amp;cgid=Suits&amp;prefn1=collection&amp;prefn2=basicDessinSuits&amp;prefv2=Check&amp;prefv1=Spring%2FSummer)","1401581876"

---

&gt;

&gt;__White-tailed spiders__ are medium-sized [spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider) native to southern and eastern [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), and so named because of the whitish tips at the end of their [abdomens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen). Common species are *Lampona cylindrata* and *Lampona murina*. Both these species have been [introduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). 

&gt;White-tailed spiders are vagrant hunters who seek out prey rather than spinning a web to capture it. Their preferred prey is other spiders and they are equipped with venom for hunting.

&gt;They are known to bite humans and effects may include local [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain), a red mark, local swelling and itchiness; rarely [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), [vomiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting), [malaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise) or [headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache) may occur. [Ulcers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology\)) and [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) have been attributed to the bites, but a scientific study by Isbister and Gray (2003) showed these were probably caused by something else, as the study of 130 white-tailed spider bites found no necrotic ulcers or confirmed infections.

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","As others have said, you can't legally do this without a ham radio license.

CB requires type certification (""this device won't splatter harmonics and distortion all over the show), as does FRS, GMRS and PMR. The ISM and LPD bands don't have type certification requirements, but you can't really do ISM without a ready made IC (like the nRF24L01, and even then, that's data only) and LPD has a duty cycle requirement that varies depending on where you are, here in the UK it's 10% I think (as in, for every second you transmit you must wait 9s for the next transmission) so it's unsuitable for voice.

With that said, though, I think if you keep the power under 100mW, keep to an unused portion of spectrum, and don't go overboard with the antenna, you should be okay. (If the FCC break down your door, don't come crying to us!) I'm not going to do your homework for you, and nor will anyone else here, but I can sure give you a push in the right direction. Bear in mind, I make some major dumbing-down here, since I'm going to assume you don't do RF often (otherwise you wouldn't have asked this question ;))

First you need to consider the TX/RX as seperate circuits. It's difficult to have one circuit perform both functions, although possible (such as in the Pixie II QRP TRX). Which, incidentally enough, fits your purposes with the exception of it being CW (Morse) only.

The basic structure of a reciever is

    RF -&gt; [Antenna] -&gt; [Tuned circuit] -&gt; [Detector] -&gt; [Amplifier] -&gt; Audio

* The antenna - well, you should already know what one of these is.
* A [tuned circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit) passes an AC waveform representative of its [resonant frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance) through to the detector stage.
* A [detector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detector_%28radio%29) or [demodulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodulator) converts the incoming RF waveform into an audio signal.
* An amplifier - if you don't know what one of these is, stop now, and find another project. :]

A transmitter is similar, but in reverse. You can't just pump in audio to the rx circuit though, that's not how it works.

    Audio -&gt; [Mixer] -&gt; [RF power amplifier] -&gt; [Antenna] 
    [Oscillator]---^

* The oscillator - be it a DDS VFO or crystal - generates your carrier wave.
* The [mixer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_mixer), which is often a [ring modulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_modulator), modulates the audio frequency onto the carrier, giving you a very low power RF signal.
* The [power amplifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_power_amplifier) takes your low power RF signal and amplifies it - which transistor and supporting components you use determines how much gain you get and at what wattage/power you are transmitting. I would highly recommend if you want to not go to jail to use something low power like a 2n3904, and maybe 5V max.
* I was about to mention SWR but at the power involved I don't think it will be a problem. Basically at higher power if the antenna isn't the right length for the transmission frequency your signal can reflect back down the antenna and damage the RF power amplifier. However you should be fine with a piece of wire cut to one-quarter the wavelength of the frequency on which you choose to transmit.

It's your job to find out how all these circuits link together, but once you know how, and you make that first transmission, I will warn you this gets addictive and this time next year you will have an Extra class ham license, two Yaesu HF rigs, a Yagi poking out of your shed and an empty bank account.

If you get stuck, /r/rfelectronics is a way better place to ask than here, or /r/amateurradio, although it's doubtful you'll get help with building if you're unlicensed. 

Good luck and 73!

"churning","t5_2vrf0","1.) chase ultimate rewards points can transfer to United (UA) , since they are transfer partners. additionally, they can also transfer to Singapore Airlines (SQ), which is in star alliance and partners with UA, so that you can use SQ miles to book UA saver flights

2.) if you look on united's website to look at award availability, it will usually show 4 rows; economy saver, economy standard, business/first saver, and business/first standard. standard awards are generally a ripoff unless the cash price is absolutely astronomical. additonally, saver awards on UA are the only ones that can be booked using a different airline's miles (such as SQ's KrisFlyer program).

3.) in terms of actual miles needed, you only need 35K/60k roundtrip using SQ miles, whereas on United it costs 45K/80k roundtrip, economy/business respectively. Since CSP can transfer to either SQ or UA, it's a no brainer to use SQ for a saver-level trip.

4.) obviously this is a good deal and if given the choice most knowledgeable ppl would choose to use 35K/60k points for coach/business rather than pay like a thousand for tickets. so the airlines will usually release a very limited number of seats (for business at least, generally better availability in economy) and will blackout some dates (or savvy fliers will already have booked the seat far in advance).

5.) it's even better if you can find space on internationally configured planes, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

on a completely different note, if you are on the west coast (like LAX) and don't mind flying economy, you could fly American roundtrip from LAX-Hawaii for 25k roundtrip using CSP points transferred to British Airways.","1401581885"

&gt;No scandal is fake if it poses a threat to the welfare of Americans. 

Agreed. A scandal is 'fake' when it's not real. Like the 'stand down' order, or like the claim that Fast and Furious was orchestrated to take away Americans guns. These are fake because they are not real. that's what fake means.

&gt;There is no reason that the government assistance of Mexican drug cartels should be done with impunity. 

Oh, it absolutely should. What evidence is there of this, specifically, again?

&gt;There is no reason that the government apathy concerning a surge in terroristic activities in Benghazi, predating the attack, should by excused. 

Agreed. But conflating it with silly-willy nonsense conspiracy theories like the 'stand down' order doesn't help, and in fact legitimizes real issues like the Admin lying as to the nature of the attack. That's what a 'fake scandal' is.

&gt; you think the president should continue to commit deplorable acts, with no criticism. 

Yes, clearly. How insightful. My post history is full of apologies for Obama. K.

&gt;To enforce and vindicate your hatred, 

My hatred of what?

&gt;you vilify and mock your opponents, as evidenced by your denouncement of the Benghazi COVERUP 

I think you maybe screwed up your wording there. I *have* been consistently and openly critical of the WH's lie in regard to the nature of the attack in Benghazi. 

&gt;and the government funding of VIOLENT DRUG PUSHERS as fake scandals.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","I highly recommend you buy most anything you can from microcenter ESPECIALLY cpu and motherboard because they have very good deals on combos for them - sometimes you have to wait for the right one to come up, but just for a quick reference, I just went out to buy an i5 3570k, which was 229.99 on newegg.com (also a very good place to go) and found if for 189.99 in microcenter.  Try to get parts there for the ability to get them inexpensive and quick (no shipping)

Also the warranties for both newegg.com and microcenter are top of the line in my opinion - do the trial for newegg prime and get free returns/no restocking fees/free shipping - and they have great customer service for when something goes wrong, which in my first building experience didn't happen until about a month or two after i built my machine.","1401581889"

For what its worth, i was in on Zeus and bought from GC for that one sub $200 (barely) with shipping included. I figured given the immediate premium jump on it I was going to have to hustle and probably pay more for Poseidon if I could find it, but given that they've got Poseidon up for basically Ebay Zeus prices, I think I'm out for this series sadly. 

I held my nose a bit buying Zeus at near $100 per ounce because I love the topic (minored in classics back in the day), but I don't think i can do $200 per. I don't blame GC, because I'd want to get as much profit as I could for them, but it is interesting I saw it last night and they're still available when first round was gone in minutes. I'm not sure what I'll do with Zeus, but unless i end up with one of the Perth ones a bit cheaper this week I might be willing to move it if one of you guys missed it and end up getting Poseidon.","1401581890"

You might be thinking right now, that this is not related, and if you are, you're wrong. It's just a different kind of competition. People will compete over a wide variety of things, and they're not always sensible about it.

The reason these challenge sites have been around so long without gaining the spotlight in the shooter community, is because, even an addictive personality will not be able to ignore the fact that they suck at the game. They don't need to play a wager match to find that out.

I do agree with some of what you say, but beating the odds is something that happens all the time, people actually strive for that. then of course there's people who do because they didn't know the couldn't, or weren't supposed to be able to do it.

Then someday you get nominated for the Nobel prize and in the ensuing publicity, somebody outs your terrible secret and your entire life is ruined.

So now, you do have an interesting problem. Do you say:

a) ""I went to Hateful U."" And just leave it at that, and hope that you'll be judged as an individual. Or ...

b) ""I went to Hateful U. But I don't believe any of that anti-gay stuff. Some of my best friends are transgendered."" I don't think you want to go that way either. It's condescending and *no matter what you say it is absolutely bound to come out wrong*; since it really is wrong on the face of it.

"gaybros","t5_2tdzg","Hey man, thanks for reaching out! I'd kind of crossed my fingers a fellow Jamaican might respond, but I wasn't betting on it... so wow! I did my best to be equally concise, but I'm pretty sure I failed at it..

1. To answer your question, we've managed to have a conversation around my being gay without directly addressing it. When I finally told my mom, she'd just stood up, walked away, and never addressed it. 

It started over a small thing; both my parents now know I have a bf (I actually just got back from his place). My mom made a passing comment about him, in a conversation that had nothing to do with him, but she deliberately screwed up his name. I shouldn't have gotten as upset as I did, but it happened. She said she was upset, and disappointed, and made some stock religion comments, but we haven't really talked about it since. Her biggest thing has been ""what will I tell my family and friends"". 

2. I'm tentative to give anyone advice about anything, because I think it's a little presumptuous, but if you're not really feeling someone (like, getting with a girl just to get with her), I'd caution that you don't make a move on them. I'm speaking only from experience; did it when I was 18, with a 20 year old girl, for the sake of what I thought other people cared about. It was disastrous when I came out to them (although I've known since I was like 8 or 9), and I really did hurt her. If I could take it back I would. Because no one honestly deserves that.

And, as far as I've been handling things, for the past two and a half years, I've been pretty deliberate with who I've let into my life. I think culture and heritage are important, but they both take a back-burner when it comes to personal well-being. Excluding my immediate family, I have three of four good friends that mean the world to me. But now, even when it comes to acquaintances and extended family, everyone else has to earn what I will and won't take from them. I don't answer questions or field comments about who I'm having sex with if I can't do the same for them. If someone doesn't agree with my choices or my ""lifestyle"" (which is such a stupid word to me), that's one-hundred percent fine. But I don't have to interact with them.

I wish I could say ""maybe try 'x'"" and everything'll work out, but I can't. If you can't talk to your folks right now, for safety or security or whatever, then don't. Easy. My bf's Mexican, and they're pretty homophobic too; he's only out to his mum. And if they knew he'd been dating a stocky black dude for the past year or so, it'd be an interesting situation.

I've found that the biggest thing is comfort with yourself though, whatever that's worth. Like, most people mirror how you treat yourself. So if you're comfortable/confident (or even if you just act like it), most people will assume that you are, because that's just how human beings work.

If you ever wanna talk, just hit me up on a ""pm"". YOU AREN'T A DISAPPOINTMENT. And you're right, we've still got a lot of time (assuming the absence of a meteor or nuclear fallout). :)","1401581897"
"roadtrip","t5_2r413","Here are some ideas!  I'm not mentioning any parks, because I assume you've found them already.

North Dakota:  [Jamestown](http://tourjamestown.com/) is worth a stop.  Jamestown is the home of the [National Buffalo Museum](http://www.buffalomuseum.com/) and the [World's Largest Buffalo Statue](http://tourjamestown.com/what-to-see/world-s-largest-buffalo-monument/).  It also has a really nice downtown area that's worth checking out.

Montana: [Missoula](http://www.destinationmissoula.org/) is a cool small city and is worth checking out, as is [Flathead Lake](http://visitmt.com/listing/categories_NET/MoreInfo.aspx?SiteID=1&amp;IDRRecordID=11891) north of the city.  On the eastern end of the state, if you find yourself driving along a small road in the middle of nowhere are reach the town of Two Dot, you should stop to check out [the world famous Two Dot Bar](http://www.getlostmt.com/places/658/two-dot-bar-grill-in-two-dot-montana/).

Idaho: In the south, Carey (right next to [Craters of the Moon](http://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm)) has some amazing camping in the mountains, and the nearby town of Arco was the first town in the world to use nuclear power.  And, in the north, if you're driving up 55, you should check out the skibum town of [McCall](http://www.discovermccall.com/)!

Illinois:  Collinsville has the [world's largest bottle of ketchup](http://www.catsupbottle.com/)!

Some people discover that they're non-binary, and that one gender's expectations are just as stifling as the other's. Some of those people decide that it's easier and just as well to not take HRT. So they stop.

Many detransitioners are ex-trans, as in, coerced and brainwashed by ""conversion therapy."" Think ex-gay. Except that for an ex-gay to fall off the wagon, they just need to hook up with the same sex. For an ex-trans, they need to go through the lengthy and deliberate process of being cleared for HRT again. So ex-trans enjoys higher retention rates than ex-gay.

But even with all of this, the latest estimates hold that only 6% of trans folk detransition.","1401581898"

For example, I was pre-firing through smoke and my friend walked right in front of me and took a crap ton of damage (he thought I shot him as a joke and killed me too). In the same game, we all rushed long a and got clumped in double-doors while CT's rushed in. While spraying a did a little bit of damage to team mates but killed both rushers. I was even the best player on our team, and nobody on my team, if given the option, would choose to kick me for team damage. For this reason, I think that team damage should not get you automatically kicked (unless at the beginning of the round, because that's obviously for trolling). Instead, I think that those who have done a large amount of damage to their teammates could more easily be kicked; requiring a vote of only 2/5 or even 1/5 against them to be forced to leave, preventing people in premade teams from keeping their friend from being kicked.","1401581900"

After work but before play time - throw Sunscreen on top of the whole mess, change my clothes

After play time - Shower and super quick modified routine - Cleanse, Tone, Moisturize - no spot treatment, no prescription stuff, no emulsion or spot treatment and either sunscreen and makeup or no makeup depending on what's going on (if I'm leaving the house)

If I've left the house then I come home and do my normal PM routine.

Another poster mentioned motorist not seeing you at a crosswalk.

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","I've played them all and I don't remember which order they are in (Wikipedia says Rorona, Totori, Meruru). I also played the PS2 ones and enjoyed them. My opinion of the PS3 series is that each one is an evolutionary improvement upon the previous entry. The first one I had trouble getting into the plot, but the second one really sucked me in.

For me, the most important difference is in how you get the endings. For the first entry, the ending scenes are triggered fairly early, meaning to get a different ending you pretty much have to start a new game. With something like 7 endings, this can be quite a chore. The second entry changed this so that the triggers were closer to the end, reducing how much you needed to repeat to unlock the endings. 2 playthroughs was what was needed to get and do everything. The latest ones I played made it so you can get everything in one playthrough, and when you reach the end, you get a menu of all the endings you've unlocked so you can choose which one to see. You still need to see them all for the trophy, but all you need is a save on the last day to trigger a new ending.

If you think you'll want to play them all, it is best to do them in order. If you only want to play one, I would suggest going straight to Ayesha. It's the same gameplay and the same world, but a different location and far less overlap in plot &amp; characters. Once you play that one, though, it might be harder to play the previous entries since they are inferior in gameplay; you might find yourself missing something that Ayesha had.

There's also Escha, and while I received it yesterday I still haven't had a chance to start playing it so I can't give any opinion on that one.","1401581915"

* Crashing is a part of nature, and nature doesn't give a damn how many hours I put into the simulator. So... Many... Broken... Arms...

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I probably would have continued which is why I'm kind of glad I ruined my life in so many ways because without doing that I don't know that I would have had the motivation to start trying to fix it.  It hasn't affected my physical health but it has definitely exacerbated my mental health issues (social anxiety, general anxiety and depression).

The euphoria is why I would do it.  Every little bit of negativity is just purged from you.  Every trace of insecurity, regret, fear, guilt, hunger, anger, pain, etc. are wiped out and you're left feeling so goddamn content with everything.     All of your baggage just goes away and is replaced by a strong sense of everything being ok and exactly the way it should be.  Anything that was bothering you or causing any kind of distress just seems so trivial and easily solvable.

People say it makes them feel like they're on top of the world and I guess that's a good description but I never did it to feel on top of the world, I did it to feel like I was part of the world.  The positive effects play right into the negative effects of my anxiety/depression.  They're like pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly and cancel each other out, but but it's like getting a loan from a bank.   You get things that you didn't really earn right now, but you've got to pay that back with interest.   

When the high wears off every bit of negativity that it eliminated comes back tenfold for the next 5-10 hours and even when you're not coming down, the negative effects are still heightened but nowhere near as bad as the comedown at least, which is why you want to do it again, which makes it worse, which makes you want to do it again.  

Even after all the destruction I've caused and after ruining everything good in my life, I still want nothing more than to do it again.","1401581917"

"tabletennis","t5_2rmfh","First off, you should expect to lose. Changing your style is significant. Most of your current habits will be counter to what you're trying to accomplish. Until those are adjusted, you'll be competing with your opponent and yourself.

The biggest change is going to be in the mindset. You'll need to take a proactive approach. Whatever risk-adverse tendencies you have will need to be discarded. Success will be depend on being willing to take (measured) risks. 
By it's nature, a more proactive or risky strategy will not always be successful. It'll be important to stay mentally firm and confident even if several shots are unsuccessful.

In the context of playing the ball, an aggressive shot is not always a driving shot. It can be placed aggressively, spun aggressively, etc. You'll need to figure out which works best for you. Leading into that, which shot are you most comfortable attacking, and how can you make your opponent give you that shot.

As for specific advise...
Begin by maintaining a good distance from the table. A distance where the you're rarely forced to contact as it's dropping.
Force yourself to play topspin off every ball that comes off the table. Spin and/or drive, it doesn't matter. If you find yourself blocking, add a bit to your return.
Pay attention to how your opponents react to your shots. Which they return ease or difficulty, or miss entirely.","1401581920"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm from the Cincinnati area and have heard a lot about these new restrictions.

Thoughts: 

* This bishop seems to be especially restrictive for the schools under his watch. Other dioceses in the area don't seem to have the same restrictions.

* Having someone follow a whole lot of Catholic morality EXCEPT explicitly the religious portions seems odd. I understand requiring some standard of Christian morality but if they're not Catholic, why require such specific things?

* I'm a teacher looking for a job. ALL of the openings at Cincinnati diocese Catholic schools now seem to specify ""must be a Catholic"" so why that's not an official policy it's very common.


* I had an interview at a Catholic school (non Cincinnati diocese). My cover letter specified I am *not* Roman Catholic and they were cool with that. However, they still asked me about my skills in catechesis so they may expect some form of faith commitment/ teaching even from non-Catholic students. I know if I get the job, I would be taking students to mass weekly. Maybe that's how the ""ministerial"" function is designated?

It might be thin ice for an employer to defend OP's termination, even in an at-will state, for refusing to refrain from cashing the check.  OP has a legal interest in being the first employee to get his check redeemed, and no duty to the employer to help them out.

That said, what's wrongful termination get you?  You won't get the job back -- absent a labor agreement, the court can't force specific performance.  So he gets some amount of money while he looks for a new job.  A couple weeks, or a couple months of pay.  Better than unemployment, but not likely better *enough* for a lawsuit.","1401581927"

"news","t5_2qh3l","There is nothing irrational about the fact that nuclear waste is a big issue, nor are the events recently in Japan an irrational fear.

What it boils down to is that the nuclear industry is its own worst enemy.  

People can go on and on about how supposedly nuclear is safe and how so few people have died from it, and yet entire regions of the world - be it Chernobyl, 3 mile island and Fukushima, as well as others -  are completely inhabitable because of nuclear reactors.  Is It because of poor design, poor supervision, or down right ineptitude?  It honestly doesn't matter because if it was a natural gas, hydro, or other power plant the area would still be perfectly liveable even after some disaster.   Instead, these areas are off-limits for literally hundreds, if not thousands, of years.  That's insane.

I understand that nuclear - while in use - is a very clean form of energy, but the waste is a big problem, and these accidents at various nuclear plants don't help its image.  The biggest issue is that there really are no ""fender benders"" with nuclear energy... a rather simple accident can displace an entire city ad infinitum.","1401581927"

**NL MVP: Puig**.  The Rockies probably aren't making the playoffs and it's very hard to get MVP on a non-playoff team.  Puig is the best player on a likely playoff team so he should be the favorite.

**AL Cy: Tanaka**.  He wins it in a landslide if the vote is today.  In my opinion, he would deserve it, but I also think he has the mix of stats that would appeal to a wide range of voters.

If everyone got rewards it would barely be a problem other than ego, but when you have to spend 8 hours getting your 5 wins because you dont have the top tier cards that are proven to be better in practice and math, then you have a problem.

Another problem is the lack of fun- the game sucks unless you get a specific deck. All 9 of the classes start out the same way- put down yeti and hope you win.

There is no different win condition, no different cards, and no variation. When you play against someone who has an easier win condition, or one that requires cards to counter, it comes more and more apparent.

Matchmaking is another problem- why should I play against this guy who has 200 card packs opened when I play the basic deck? I cant play ranked because I am too high rank to win against the high tier cards and legendaries, and in the normal mode you have a higher chance to lose against random multi-pack decks because of the lack of matchmaking priorities.

&gt;Since the outset of the Chicago handgun ban, the percentage of Chicago murders committed with handguns has averaged about 40% higher than it was before the law took effect.
 
&gt;In 2005, 96% of the firearm murder victims in Chicago were killed with handguns.

http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp

And yet we look at places like California and Chicago with some of the strictest gun control laws around, and those are the places we see gun crime most rampant. If it deters them to a degree, which is subject to debate, it's *certainly* a lesser degree than to the amount it deters law-abiding citizens, which means we still have armed criminals, armed governments, and disarmed law-abiding citizens.

Suppose you were getting mugged and someone demanded your cell phone. You go into your pockets, where you keys happen to be, pull this thing out, and suddenly are on fighting ground. And sure, perhaps it won't *directly* deter crime if people don't see it openly displayed, but that's true of other self-defense weapons like pepper spray and taser too. And let's not forget the deterrent effect of criminals knowing that there is now a higher risk that the people they're dealing with are armed.","1401581935"

There have been articles about graphene for years and how that miracle breakthrough will change every industry in ways you cannot possibly fathom!  Years later the only thing to show is that there are more articles and people are still making money writing articles about graphene.

Do not get me wrong, as an electrical engineer I think the 2 most important things we need are better materials and better software, in general the use of current materials is mind blowing to me.  However, I know of no actual use in production for industry or consumers.  It is all ""Hey look what this lab did!"" which is a great way to toss money at nothing.","1401581935"

"KarmaCourt","t5_2v788","I think you need to review the evidence, Mr. /u/atomheartother. The two jobs issue is no misinterpretation. The defendant herself said ""I work 56 hours a week"". She also state that she works from 10PM to 6AM. This is far more than ""perhaps a weekend"". These hours would clearly contradict her alleged job as a teacher. Most preschools start at 8AM. Teachers are often required to be there even earlier. If /u/itsallemily really worked until 6AM and worked at a preschool then she would have to rush to the school to get there on time. She wouldn’t even have time to shower and change clothes, which most administrations would be unhappy with. 

The plaintiff has done no mocking of any sort. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIm07LGTOIc&amp;feature=youtu.be) is of incomprehensible importance. The silly, lighthearted nature is very similar to that of a college freshman. They're excited about school and not at all worn down by the work. That combined with the fact that /u/itsallemily is following the University of California, Davis Freshman page on Facebook as evidenced by [this post](http://i.imgur.com/AYBRIZF.jpg) (which the defendant submitted to /r/UCDavis) is enough evidence to reasonably assume that the defendant is a college freshman. This is the second error in her lie about being a teacher. No preschool would ever hire a college freshman.

Let's assume that everything she says is true. She's working nights as a nanny, days as a teacher, goes to college, and still finds ample time to post to Reddit. If everything the defendant says is true then she should be dead from sleep deprivation!

I'm sure that the children she nannies would be very attached to her. There's no denying that babies wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. At least, they would if they existed.

Even though I'm sure that everything I'm said is enough to prove the defendant's guilt, I still have an extra nail to pound into the coffin. I've figured out the defendant's motive.

Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I present to you /u/itsallemily; a person guilty of a horrendous crime. You might be asking yourself “Why might she do this crime?” and the answer is simple. Fantasy. /u/itsallemily is in college. She’s absorbed in her studies and is unable to leave her dorm often, having Reddit as her only form of escape from the real world. The defendant sees our beloved Reddit as a fantasy land. An escape if you will. For example, she’s stolen an [image](http://i.imgur.com/qS401fi.jpg) off of the internet  and claimed it as her own, thus the GrandTheft.jpg charge. She said her boyfriend made it. Why? So she could pretend she had a boyfriend. The defendant says she’s a student, nanny, and teacher because those are the things she wishes to be. Innocent enough, right? Well unfortunately innocent motives can lead to evil actions. People commit heinous deeds based off of their fantasies; going so far as to harm themselves, even murder others, but even worse… Lying on the internet.

This may seem harsh, but the truth hurts and Justice is a harsh mistress.

With everything I have presented to the courts to day, I beg you that you please bring this heinous criminal to justice. Please. GrandTheft.jpg and 1st degree Bullshittery are very serious crimes and deserve to be punished to the fullest extent of the law.

The prosecution rests its case.","1401581938"

It is theoretically possible to create an underwater circuit, though some of the electricity would be lost to the surrounding water unless there was some form of insulator surrounding it (like rubber around a wire).

That said, discovering said electricity would probably be different. Electricity was discovered in its modern form by chemical reactions in a proto-battery. We knew about static electricity for thousands of years before that, but it didn't help us harness it in any way, so the species simply knowing about electricity-producing organisms probably wouldn't fuel the technology.

More interesting is how such a culture would even progress to using metals. Fire isn't exactly easy to make underwater, so unless the culture is deep enough to use volcanic vents as forges, metallurgy itself will be a difficult feat.","1401581941"

So, what I'm saying is that if you played me the acoustic sample, telling me which was which, then blindfolded me, I could proceed to tell you which mic was which on the bass, vox, electric guitar, etc...

This means the test isn't meaningless.  Of course there are tons of variables that affect the result, but as long as you can get somewhat consistent results, it's far from meaningless.

I would also argue that given the popularity of the U87 and it's prominence in front of some of the worlds greatest vocalists and presence on some the greatest albums recorded, the hype around it isn't ""insane"".  That being said, I prefer my u89.","1401581952"

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","Dragons of Legend can give you some pretty good pulls because it only contains 2 rarities, and both Soul Charge and Hands are widely sought after right now (Soul Charge is in the lowest rarity of that pack).

Battle Pack 2 contains a lot of mediocre cards, but also contains a lot of staples that people often need. Forbidden Lance, for example, is about 6 or 7 dollars and only a common or mosaic rare.

Most generic sets are pretty all over the place, but I'd say avoid Shadow Specters and go for the two newest sets, Primal Origin and Legacy of the Valiant. Your mileage will also vary with older sets like Order of Chaos, Abyss Rising, Return of the Duelist, etc.- generally as with all sets there are a couple of worthwhile high rarity cards and then a bunch of outdated nonsense.

Other than that I'd say avoid duel terminal sets (Hidden Arsenal), any sort of character pack, and anything too old to be relevant (unless it's *really* old and has some magical collector value). 

The best you can probably get is an Astral Pack, but those aren't (supposed to be) sold, you get them from entering tournaments at your card shop. Every Astral Pack I've gotten has incidentally contained a 20 dollar Ultimate Rare.

Remember to be careful with where you buy your packs as scalers exist everywhere, and good luck. It's really hard to build up a trade binder buying just packs.","1401581955"

The Xbox One's internal HDD has five NTFS partitions (all readable/writable by any computer capable of reading/writing NTFS partitions). They are Temp Content (GameDVR, a few caches), User Content (games, apps, DLC), System Support, System Update 1, and System Update 2.

The problem I ran into was that games and apps downloaded on the stock 500GB would not run from the 1TB drive when transferred from User Content (old) to NTFS PC drive to User Content (new). When this failed I redid the formatting and prepping of the 1TB drive (using a Linux command line tool) and copied everything from the old partitions to the appropriate new partitions - still no dice. After that, I gave up and had to set all of my games and apps to redownload overnight to the 1TB drive.

I haven't had a chance to read the forum posts around this tool, but I assume an external drive is just a giant (up to 4TB) version of the User Content partition that exists on the internal HDD.

It may indeed be the case that things are a bit different with external drives. I just wanted to warn early readers of my struggles with offloading User Content to a PC. Still have to try this out when I get home :)","1401581955"

It's an old school RPG, and gameplay reflects that.  I'd suggest this if you want to have a better appreciation for the game:  install Daggerfall and play that for one day.  Just one day.

Okay, lets think peice by peice.

The mods are in control, 

&gt; a way of organizing a society in which **a government** ruled by a dictator controls the lives of the people and in which people are not allowed to disagree with the government

And the mods have put down rules to keep order in how they want their subreddit to work.

&gt; a way of **organizing a society** in which **a government** ruled by a dictator controls the lives of the people and in which people are not allowed to disagree with the government

 They do control what they are allowed to do/post/say.

&gt; a way of **organizing a society** in which **a government** ruled by a dictator **controls the lives of the people** and in which people are not allowed to disagree with the government

OP got threats when he questioned these rules.

&gt; a way of **organizing a society** in which **a government** ruled by a dictator **controls the lives of the people** and in which **people are not allowed to disagree with the government**

&gt;Only third of the definition applies, one may or may not, and the last absolutely doesn't; 

That's more than a third for sure; But I don't know what parts you think don't apply.

&gt; I'm still of the opinion that the word is too strong.

Because you don't feel as attached or as strongly as OP does. You have to remember, that he's **supposed** use the language needed to convey his thoughts. He feels strongly that this isn't okay, so he used a word that he knew had a strong connotation to represent his strong feelings. So I think that you shouldn't give him a hard time for word choice, when logically, the word applies. (The last sentence was to represent how I feel, and how without a reason, how I feel has little significance.)

[Powerlifters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12741885), [Bodybuilders](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9134368), [Weightlifters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14666943).

Anything will work as far as hypertrophy is concerned.  Any rep range.  The central tenant to increased muscle mass is progressive overload.  More weight/sets/reps over time.  Rep range, etc., is not important.  Sets of 5 will work just as well as sets of 12, so long as you apply progressive overload.  But of course sets of 12 are very suboptimal for increasing 1RM, which is what most people here are concerned about.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","[According to this article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/can-she-consent-to-sex-after-drinking/article17158564/), it is illegal (at least in Canada, according to one university), but that seems absurd.

&gt; So here’s the $10 question. **Can a woman consent to sex when she’s been drinking?** *Universities have decided that the answer is no*. “We heard that students don’t understand that it is illegal to have sex with someone who is drunk because they can’t give consent,” says the Saint Mary’s task force report. Although that sentence is crafted to be gender-neutral, its warning is directed at men. It means that drunken sex is tantamount to rape.

&gt; **Is there a double standard here?** Indeed there is. *Men are treated as potential rapists, and women as their helpless victims (or, in current parlance, “survivors”)*. If two young people get hammered and have drunken sex, **he is responsible for his behaviour, but she’s not responsible for hers**. And even *if she does say “yes,” it’s up to him to figure out whether she means it*.

I don't know if it is actually illegal or just some spin by the university, but the two paragraphs I highlighted seem like pure and utter bullshit to me.","1401581961"

Haha, being stranded definitely doesn't help. But in my experience (I'll be a senior in the Fall) the program is very small, with only around 4 consistent faculty members. These faculty members are the biggest problem in my opinion. One, *maybe* two of them seem to care about the students and their learning. Their classes are difficult but manageable, and they usually will help out and answer any questions.

Now for the rest of them: A couple of them always seem so out of it that their lectures are almost nonsensical and worthless. The last one is very intelligent, but has no concern for the students and often ends up angry/frustrated with them when they don't follow his lectures.","1401581967"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm too tired to acknowledge your novel like rant you wrote there, but I will speak on a part. 

There is a *massive* difference between a God throwing a ball and christof throwing one. One is thrown by a man, equal to exactly what you could do. Not impressive.  Then if God were to throw a ball that, *OH my god!* we have a ball being thrown from thin air! Nothing was there before, now there's a ball bouncing! I can't do that. 


Christof turns on sprinklers for rain. God makes the clouds rain. Truman already had suspicion that something was off so by this time he would've thought the rain isn't necessarily ""real""  rain. 

A supernatural being doing acts is not in any way the same as a human mimicking a similar act. The humans version is false, while ""God's"" would be natural.  

You seem very close minded on your own opinion that your philosophy is sound, when to everyone else your speaking to is blatantly disagreeing. 


The difference between the ant -  child analogy is two different species, with one **way** more powerful than the other. Then there's christof, and equal man to Truman, besides his technological advantages.  He's using tricks, not God like supernatural powers to rule his life.

Part of having a normal discussion is being open minded and so far you've proven to be close minded to all other opinions and unwilling to understamd the logic and actually points others have proven. You just disregard them and go back to your theology on this movie. No one cares that you ""researched"" it in high school. That doesn't make your point anymore valuable than others.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well, this is a good question and one that physicists would like an answer to as well, as the details of the unification are still unknown. Basically, the way a force ""split"" is through something called symmetry breaking. The forces we know of (except gravity) are described by so called gauge theories, and have an associated symmetry group or gauge group, which determines their interactions. Electromagnetism has a gauge group of U(1), while the strong force has the group SU(3). Symmetry breaking is when something, like the vacuum, do not respect these symmetries. The example we know of today is the Higgs mechanism, which breaks the electroweak force (gauge group SU(2)xU(1)) down to electromagnetism (U(1)) and the weak force (with gauge group SU(2) but with massive force carriers). The Higgs field breaks the symmetry by having a non-zero value in the vacuum, and this non-zero value is not symmetric under the full SU(2)xU(1) symmetry but only under a U(1) subgroup. However, once the energies involved are large enough, the non-zero vacuum value won't matter very much and the symmetry is (approximately) restored. 

In a similar fashion, the idea is that the real theory of everything should have some larger symmetry group, that is broken by our particular vacuum. The extra force carriers are very, very massive which is why we do not see them, but once you reach energies above some certain scale, the theory will look like some gauge theory with a larger gauge group like SU(5), SO(10) or maybe E8, to mention some popular choices for unification. The dynamics of this theory will of course be very complicated, but it should be similar to QCD, just with more number of colors. ","1401581970"

You should at least watch the original trilogy,but recognize that X3 had a different director and most people don't like it. First Class is important if you're going to watch DOFP. X-men origins: Wolverine is mostly hated and not that necessary but it tells you alot more about Wolverines past. Finally, DOFP is definitely worth watching.

You're unlikely to be happy with a dude that much older than you for the long term and there is absolutely no reason to think you need to pick someone now, so it's kind of bunk to wonder if you ""fell in love with the wrong person"". You can love more than a couple times. Falling in love now does not mean you have to stick with a decision you made at 18 out of principle. Please get that out of your head. 

He should be dating closer to his age too. That he would aim so low tells me he's emotionally immature in a few ways and isn't ready for prime time, yet. Men close to 30 date women under 21 because it's easy to do. Adolescent women are very easily impressed and the older man really doesn't have to try hard. Then, she grows up and realizes she's too good for him, and he's crushed. I've seen that one too much.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Part of the answer is in how sex is determined in ants (and bees). Its called ""haplodiploidy"". Females develop from an egg fertilized by a sperm, while males develop from unfertilized eggs; this means that females have 2 sets of chromosomes (diploid), while males only have one (haploid). This system leads to all sorts of interesting consequences - including the fact that sister ants who share both a mother and a father share (on average) 75% of their genes with one another, because there is only one set of chromosomes for the father to pass on. This is actually more shared genes than they would have with their own female offspring, which may have set the stage for large social colonies to develop where only a few females breed.

Note that some ants do not have queens, and instead have workers capable of breeding; some colonies have more than one queen. But most typical is one queen, who produces a new generation once a year (they fly out of the colony, mate, and set up new colonies). Whether an individual develops into a queen or a worker can depend on what the larva is fed in some species, but the influences on this are still murky as far as I'm aware.","1401581980"

I don't remember doing it in pre-school, so Ill count that one as a no. 

I did get taught it in elementary school (grades kindergarten, 1st-4th) without knowing what the hell I was saying and had been given zero indication that I could choose not to say the pledge.

Middle school (grades 5-8) was a lot more lax with it. We didn't have to recite it unless it was Monday, and depending what teacher you had. But most teachers had us say it at least once a week. Again, zero indication we could opt-out without hating America.

High School (grades 9-12) we rarely, if ever, say it. I remember only once in the past year we had to recite it, and that was during a community assembly to hand out awards and scholarships to kids. Now having the knowledge that I don't have to, I politely just sat there, fiddling with my thumbs trying to not distract anybody. Well a couple of people got overly pissed at me for opting out, but eh, cant please everyone.

I think its ridiculous that we have to say it anyway, especially pretty much only at an age where it doesn't matter, and we have absolutely no idea what it means and that we can choose not to do it.","1401581982"

Is there any precedence to support your claim? How much money would you expect to get? Or are you just sueing for injunctive relief? If you're sueing for a tort how do you expect to argue yourself around qualified immunity? Would you make a tort claim?

Unfortunately, it doesn't matter if a company has a monopoly over your town. What matters for a constitutional violation is whether or not there is state action. Unless providing water is a thing that only the state can do then another company providing water is not state action and therefore there can be no constitutional violation. ","1401581987"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Criticizing the fact that people use Islam to justify and legally codify the right to marry, and rape to death, children must be similar to the revulsion felt by missionaries when they walked into Tenochtitlan and saw heaped into great mounds the skulls of the tens of thousands of people sacrificed annually by Aztec priests. 

Women to this god, children to that god, prisoners to a different god, and natives volunteering themselves to be sacrificed to Tezcatlipoca. With elite status conferred on warriors who had captured a prisoner to be beheaded it was a system the upper classes bought into because it brought with it great status. 

It made killing them and stealing their gold justifiable and even somewhat enjoyable to the Spaniards. 

If adherents to Islam desire a criticism-free environment, then they need to repeal the laws that allow old men to rape children to death. 

Oh, and the honor killings, too. 

I wonder how much Diyya is needed to make this go away or, if because wives are property, the girl's next of kin are ineligible for blood money. 

If contemporary Christianity got as butt-hurt as Islam does over every slight, perceived or real, there would be an unending stream of Mormons flying jets into buildings in an orgy of violence the likes of which has never been seen in the history of humankind. 

Maybe Trey Parker and Matt Stone should produce a sequel to ""The Book of Mormon"" called ""The Koran"".

"blackops2","t5_2sqqn","&gt; disrespectful? You're taking this a little too seriously.

I've explained myself very clearly.  I'll do it again.  

My favorite sport is basketball.  When I'm playing a casual game with friends at the park, it would simply mess everything up if anyone on either team started hucking up half-court shots.  

Do you disagree with that?   

This isn't a matter of me being overly ""serious,"" it is about demonstrating a rudimentary degree of respect to other players by playing the game as intended instead of just screwing around, whether it is basketball, Call of Duty, or any other game.  

Further, for some reason, you keep trying to make this argument about *me*, by attacking *me* and my supposed seriousness.  The issue, I will remind you, is trickshotting.  Let's focus on that, otherwise, there is no point in even discussing this. 

&gt;If you want to camp with an LMG target finder the entire game that's up to you. Is it annoying

You counterexample doesn't work.  

Sure, there are a lot of different *strategies* within the game that different players may find annoying.  They are, however, actually *strategies,* each with their own advantages and disadvantages.  This multiplicity of strategies is what makes CoD such a fun game.  Trickshotting, though, is *not* a strategy.  It is straight-up screwing around and ruining the game for other players.  This is very different than the slight annoyance that results from getting picked off by a LMG + TF n00b, or getting knifed by someone using Lightweight + Ghost, or any number of other *legitimate* ways of playing the game.  

&gt;I'm sorry it angers you so much

I haven't demonstrated any anger.  Please re-read my comments.  You'll find they were most polite.  *You* are the one interpreting my comments as anger, perhaps because you feel attacked as a result of so many people in this thread calling you out for absurd behavior.

As non-believers we are free from such perceived obligations. 

You may like your tattoos, but you don't believe you'll be tortured in a lake of fire forever if you don't have them. So the rules in this case are applied depending on how much distress they might cause.
Their indiscriminate enforcement could make a religious person extremely uncomfortable, but you don't have to be afraid to piss off some imaginary man in the sky, it's honestly no matter of (eternal) life or death to you. In the end just do as /u/bipolar_sky_fairy suggests and lie.","1401581989"

In the morning I use:

1. Benefit Gentle Foaming face cleanser in the shower. Very gentle and doesn't cause me to get red, which is awesome. I have a lot of redness and harsh cleansers exacerbate the situation.
 
2. Benefit Moisture Prep Toning Lotion once I'm out of the shower. Feels amazing and helps close my pores.

3. Benefit It's Potent Eye Cream on my undereye and across my entire lid. So hydrating, feels awesome, reduces puffiness and/or sunken-ness,  and helps brighten and tighten the area. Reduces the look of dark circles.

4. Benefit Total Moisture Facial Cream. I use this all over my face except my eyes since they're already moisturized. Feels amazing, completely got rid of my dry patches, and it doesn't make the rest of my face more oily than it already is.

At night I use:

1. Biore makeup removing wipes. Easy and effective. I like them because they don't upset my skin and they take off all my makeup.

2. Smashbox waterproof eye makeup remover. I use this on days where do heavy eye makeup because it will take everything off very easily and with very little product.

3. Benefit Total Moisture Face Cream again.

I also have other products that I use regularly but not on a daily basis.
 
1. Biore pore strips. I use these very sparingly for when I get lots of blackheads on my nose that exfoliation does not take care of.

2. Mario Badescu face masks. I have the calma mask, the cucumber mask, and a glycolic mask. I like all of them and will repurchase them when I run out. The calma mask is actually a hardening mask and I really liked it because it firms my skin. The cucumber mask reduces redness which is nice because I have a lot of it and feels really good. The glycolic mask is awesome for exfoliation and feels really really good. It makes my skin very soft and gets rid of dead skin.
 
3. Peter Thomas Roth peel pads. These are perfect for days when I feel like my skin is rough but I don't have time to do a full peel.

4. I have a bunch of samples from work that I am testing out. They include a Perricone face moisturizer I really like, a Philosophy face moisturizer that's alright, a Vichy face moisturizer my fiance stole so I don't know about it but he loves it, a Vichy face spray that's very nice because it cools immediately and doesn't displace my makeup, and some small Juice Beauty, Strivectin, and Ahava samples.

I also occasionally use peel off face masks like the Montagne Jeunesse Passion Peel Off Masque ones you can get at Ulta for like 2 bucks and I think they rock. They get a lot of gunk off my face and my fiance even uses them and loves them.","1401581993"

We have done that for a little over a year now and it is the best part of the week. But even though it was only once a week, I still began to feel the effects from smoking, so I started vaping. Just a standard ego-t w/tank so nothing special, but I was hooked.

When we would meet up, I would vape instead of smoking. In the beginning, I felt kind of douchy and like a snob that was better than the others, and I hated it. But my friends began asking about vaping and my setup and such.
When I upgraded to my MVP2 they got really interested. I brought both my MVP and my Ego when we would meet, and I would have a new juice in the Ego every time. The flavors in vaping were better than in the hookha, so the others began buying Ego and Evod starter kits, and I gave my Ego to my GF.

When we meet now, we all bring our E-cigs and try out eachothers setups and juices. The apartment smells much nicer now, and we don't have to deal with hot coals and greasy tobacco.

I feels douchy to say that I started it, but I really feel like I did.

Looking up before the ball even reaches you is a great way of knowing whats around you. As a CM, if they are pressuring the ball, then your best counter is to take a nice first touch, look up and find the open pass. keep on doing this and they will start to jockey. they start to jockey and you can start to run at them.

Work on different ways of receiving the ball during training. i.e head, chest, thigh, feet.

Once you have the confidence in your ball control, youll find you dont need to look down at the ball so much. You can then start to look at the cues of your opponent like their stance, looking at their hips helps in knowing what direction theyll next move in. Also which foot is planted on the ground.

Hope this helps!

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","This episode is important.  The occasional rough production edges are an effective frame for the larger, and immensely important, story--much like ragged, unforced, involuntary tears are integral to the importance of what actually occurs to all of us directly after someone we deeply love dies.

The death of someone genuinely beloved is an apt analogy, because this episode is really about preplanned, and very consciously directed, soul and life killing--the maiming and destruction of naturally good human beings who blindly accept what these many LDS authorities, spokespeople (I think all but one are male), and faithful LDS members say in this episode.

Everyone knows full well that the male LDS authorities we hear on this episode, who commandingly speak with such self-important, taken-for-granted authority, have in the past, and (depending on their health, mostly) DO, themselves, masturbate (or 90+% of them, anyway--this allows for the subtraction of those who are asexual or have serious emotional/psychological/physiological problems).  Their sonorous hypocrisy is enormously disturbing...because THEIR hypocritical words, spoken in authoritative tones of command and mandated obedience, are weapons chosen by them to destroy the most faithful and obedient of LDS members from the inside out.

I would like to say to the male who spoke in the 12-step program meeting about ""avoiding [human] feelings,"" and the supposed negative consequences of masturbation, that one of the many built-in benefits of masturbation is self-comforting...relying on yourself to comfort yourself at least in some situations...to soothe and heal YOURSELF the way Nature INTENDED, instead of projecting that need into a chosen outside world of unreflective obedience...drugs (prescription or not; doesn't matter)...other addictive substances, and self-harming behaviors (which can--and often do--involve the subsequent harming of other people as well).  Obedience to toxic LDS church dicta accomplishes nothing other than destruction of its members...one by one.

By the end of this broadcast, I was not only sad, but there were tears in my eyes.

The human destruction of LDS members which has been caused by the LDS church in the last almost two centuries is incalculable (especially when multiplied down through the subsequent generations).

Thank you, mikedMORMONS, for demonstrating so clearly one central aspect of how this occurs, and how life-destroying these deranged teachings actually are.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Wow. That's a poor analogy for speed limits. 

If an officer pulls a man over for going one mile over the speed limit, and everyone freaks out that a man was given a ticket for going one mile over the speed limit, so they change the law, like you say, to increase a hypothetical one mile per hour.

The next day, an officer pulls a man over for performing the same crime with the new speed limit. However, it was only one mile over the speed limit again. Therefore, the limit is changed yet again.

This is not an ""if  a happens, eventually z will occur"" situation. 

It's a practical reasoning situation, which uses the reasoning behind the action in the first place for another possible event that could occur. 

If it is alright to go one mile over the speed limit, is it alright for someone to go one mile over that person, while another person I'd going one mile over this person, and so on. 

Like if I had a gallon of water in the desert with ten other people.  I can't drink it all at once. If I say, I'll just have a little bit and take a sip. The next person sees me take a sip and drinks a little bit more water than me. The third person sees him take a sip and drinks a little bit more water than him. The fourth person sees her take a sip and drinks a little bit more water than her. The fifth person sees him take a sip and drinks a little bit more than him. The sixth person sees her take a sip and drinks a little bit more than her. The seventh person sees him take a sip and drinks a little bit more than him. The eighth person sees her take a sip and drinks a little bit more than her. The ninth person sees him take a sip and drinks a little bit more than him. The tenth person sees her take a sip and drinks a little bit more than him.

By now, the difference in the amount drunken by me and the last person is significant. ","1401582002"

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","I agree, but with Bitcoin, the initial focus seemed to be on building that infrastructure and USING bitcoin.  People were trading, gambling, buying/selling on silkroad, etc.  Bitcoin was being used pretty heavily before it started to take off as an investment.  With DOGE, I don't see people trying to use it, they are just here pumping it and making memes left and right.  

How do we get people to use DOGE over Bitcoin?  What's the advantage?  Saying ""oh, it's worth so little you can come to reddit and tip each other, it's fun!"" isn't going to bring a lot of users.  It needs to be built into games or some other medium as a real life micro-currency.  People need to be able to earn it from something other than mining.  

Imagine if kids were earning DOGE by playing video games?  This would be a lot easier if Google and Apple didn't have a lock-down on micro-payments, but I'm guessing it's still possible.  IMO, somehow getting kids into DOGE is the best way for it to take off.

Given that this dog hadn't even gotten up from its usual sleeping spot to go investigate the wide open door, I'm inclined to believe that it wasn't necessary to use 7 bullets to put it down; pepper spray would have probably sufficed, or even a fucking biscuit.","1401582008"

Oddly enough, humans are now causing reverse natural selection in ourselves with birth control.

The 360 controller takes over two players and the PS3 takes one player, leaving P4 to the keyboard.  If I hook up two 360 controllers and a PS3 controller, each 360 pad takes two players, leaving the PS3 pad without any control.

I loved the cards that came out in mirrodin, but I felt like they stuck out like a sore thumb while in my hand, or thumbing through cards. I get a nostalgic feeling when I look through my invasion block stuff, and onslaught, and odyssey block. Now I'm even more mad that they are doing it again. It looks even worse. I know they had to address the authenticity issue, but I just know I'm going to have to go through all that again. Hopefully it doesn't start a new, weird, post M15 modern format.","1401582015"

"science","t5_mouw","The windows aren't to minimize travel time, they're to minimize the energy requirement. You can always get there faster if you have more fuel to burn, the problem is that our existing technology puts very severe restrictions on how much fuel you can carry (it rapidly becomes absurdly expensive as you add more fuel, because it all has to be boosted up out of the Earth's gravity well). Presumably, the minimal-energy windows come along just as frequently for travel one way as the other, but they are not necessarily synchronized. Anyway, you could be looking at anywhere from 1.3 years to over 3 years away from Earth. Bringing enough food to last that long isn't actually a big issue (it turns out that dry food for a small crew really doesn't weigh all that much), but the water and oxygen are, so being able to recycle those will be valuable. We do have some knowledge of how to recycle those particular chemicals, so it's not an excessively difficult problem.

Keep in mind that actually landing on Mars requires more fuel than merely staying in orbit for a while, and taking back off requires much more fuel even than that. That's the main reason why plans like Mars One propose only one-way missions to the surface: They avoid the problem of carrying the vast amount of fuel necessary to lift back off.

It may also be possible to mine some amount of water and oxygen from Mars itself, which could reduce costs for any manned mission to the surface (whether you're returning or not).","1401582017"

As far as I understand it russian meds (and batchat + leo) are superior to other meds. I'm currently heavily considering getting russian med line and I would like a help with that from someone that seems to know a lot about those tanks.

First of, I have no idea which one to aim for (t10). I have kv-13 unlocked though kv-1s, should I just jump to t-43 for only ~20k exp, or grind the line from t-34 and go through Object 416 because it leads to all t10 tanks?

I have read tons of stuff about the t10 tanks, I just cant decide which one to choose, I will probably head off to t-54 so my main question is (as I feel like both obj. 140 and t-62A are equal) is more fun to play? Mostly for solo pubbing and maybe toons, dont really aim for CW. Or is the Obj. 430 the best option?

just to add if skill matters, I am currently at 2k wn8 in the last 1k battles and basically keeping that in daily sessions

The game is blatantly lenient about TT and there are many players who do it to move villagers in/out, build up and decorate their town faster, skip seasons to get that last fish, and so forth. 

While I worry about people using the AR to flood ACTrade with rare and hard to obtain items (thus driving the relative value down), I see no harm in using the AR if that's how a person wants to enjoy the game.

That's what pisses me off about feminists. I'm a woman by the way. I just feel like when you are SO aggressive and unmoving about your cause, it has ABSOLUTELY ZERO affect on the people you want it to. Sure, fellow feminists will agree with you and commend you for your courage, but your irrational behavior, aggression, and refusal to listen to any other viewpoint only makes the men that hate women hate you more. It also pisses of guys that don't hate women because no one likes to be called a chauvanistic asshole simply because they have a penis.

I digress. I think it's pretty fucking obvious this guy was mentally ill. I don't care if their lawyer retracted his original statement about Elliot having Asbergers/high functioning Autism, that could have been for many reasons. It was clear this kid was troubled from very early on. He had therapists since age 8. He was prescribed Risperidone, an anti-psychotic drug, but refused to take it. (This he wrote about in his Manifesto). That's a pretty serious drug... doctors don't just dole it out like candy. According to new reports, he was taking Xanax and his parents were worried he was abusing it.

I get that people want to protect the mentally ill from even greater prejudice than they already have, but I'm also sick of the ""mentally ill doesn't make you violent"" thing being shoved down my throat. Just because we're saying he was mentally ill does NOT mean we are saying mentally ill people are all violent! Could it make killing easier than the average person, for someone who the missing chemistry that allows one to have empathy? Yes. Could it make someone more apt to obsess over minute details? Yes. Could it make them more paranoid, and therefore farther down the rabbit hole of justifying their cause because they think everyone is attacking them? Could they be more greatly effected by watching/playing violent video games or movies? Yes. 

I worked as a film camp counselor at my university, and I had a particularly strange 10 year old in my group. His mother had warned us that he had Asbergers and we were to call her if we had any problems. He seemed to be perfectly fine, just a little nerdy, so I thought nothing of it. Then he started talking about his love of the Saw movies. OBSESSIVELY. And any time he had access to our lab computers, he was looking up details for the Human Centipede movie sequel, another favorite of his. If you've seen these movies or know what they're about, you could find this pretty concerning. It didn't end there. He also brought a fake knife and Jason mask and insisted that he use it in his group's video, despite the fact that it made absolutely ZERO sense with the story. I was getting more and more creeped out by this kid's obsession with violence. Then, he went missing. We searched around the building for almost a half hour until we found him on the 3rd floor. Up until this, he had been completely jovial, energetic, and nice. I found him sitting a foot from a window, just staring out into nothing. He was so close his face was almost touching the glass. I approached him and he was just not there. He finally looked at me with this cold emptiness in his eyes. The same ""dead"" look I've seen in Elliot Rodger. I was 23 years old and this kid was half my size but at that moment I had no doubt he could have reached out and stabbed me right there. Now maybe this kid had other mental disorders his mom didn't divulge, but I'm saying I've seen it in person. And I saw it in Elliot.

Please tell me how a sane person (who's SOLE motivation is woman-hatred) could write about how they were going to kill their roommates because they were ""ugly"" and had ""annoying voices"". Not only that, he also said he would ENJOY slitting their throats while they slept. Yeah, a real poster child for mental health right there.

Here's another thing... his manifesto recalls even the most mundane events of his life from a very early age, yet, despite having almost daily therapy/lifecoaching, his therapy is hardly mentioned until close to the end. I feel like this guy was so narcissitic, he didn't want to accept that something could possibly be wrong with him (I have a huge ego and refused for years to believe I had ADD, and resented my mom for thinking I did even after a positive diagnosis).

Women were the scapegoat for his psychopathy. ","1401582032"

Check out http://scannewengland.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page (with which I'm not associated).

I'm not aware of a statewide P25 system. There's a statewide trunked system that the State Police run (but subdivided into a bunch of zones), which does see a _little_ P25 use, but 99% of stuff, at least in Eastern MA, is analog voice on the system. I'm not familiar with Cambridge itself.

Conventional P25, however, is very common with police departments, at least in Middlesex County. A lot of it's in the 480 MHz range, which is annoying to someone that owns some R-split radios.

Edit: Oh, is http://scannewengland.net/wiki/index.php?title=Massachusetts_State_Police_Project_25 what you're referencing? I knew the State Police were building out in western MA and doing it with more P25 support, but I didn't realize until I just saw this that there's another system going up in Boston and that Cambridge is involved. Unfortunately, I'm a little too far too north to receive this, so I don't have much knowledge of it.

The nice thing about the _main_ State Police system (not the newer P25 system) is that, within each zone, all sites simulcast all traffic within that zone. So even though I live near the NH state line, I can still hear everything happening in Zone 5.","1401582033"

"raspberry_pi","t5_2syto","Gotta do the personal projects to stand out in experience. You have to realize an LED is a Diode, and if you go above the threshold/knee voltage, it acts like a short w/voltage drop (as expected). You should be familiar with [this](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode8.gif) graph. Sadly, I know people who graduated with ECE degrees from a top college that don't even know how to measure current with an ammeter. Always end up shorting something.

I've actually just created a security camera application that likely meets what you want (minus live streaming). I couldn't find anything online that let me do motion detection with 1080p 30FPS so I worked on my own solution. I theoretically can even do 90FPS at 480P, which should be nice for nature, but I think I'm hitting limitations on my model A and all my model B's are in use for Rasplex clients. 

It uses a PIR sensor (less false positives than camera processing, though i've left a spot open for PIR-less users), uploads video from before the motion, and after it (user defined) through a circular buffer, converts .h264 to an MP4, takes a snap shot and sends it to a phone number or email. Space management to make there is always X amount of space left on the disk (incase you disable dropbox through the dropboxEnabled variable). 

Things I'm still implementing (almost ready) location awareness. It will realize when you are home and not send alerts. If you are away, it will send you alerts, and who is home (if there are multiple uses). If every one is home, no alerts and no recording.

Of course, all these features can be disabled/enabled. I really should look into a web browser for mp4 files, and then you could view the videos live anywhere. Could probably also implement the stream into this, but again, these are features I don't really need. I want something set/forget. 


Took about 3-4 nights to program, and I have literally never programmed for Python before.

However, in this era of medicinal advancements and the ability to at least contain, if not cure, infections of normally fatal viruses, we allow them to persist in some method. Consider ebola, for example. It's pretty much an insta-kill for 98% of the human population. So, based on that, when an ebola outbreak occurs, it should spread very quickly and ultimately kill off most humans in Africa (or where ever the outbreak starts), and then ebola should go extinct because all non-resistant humans have died and therefore it's hosts are all dead. But instead, the WHO swoops in, quarantines the population and allows the virus to run it's course in a contained environment. And while that is incredibly beneficial, it is what allows the fatal virus to persist. 

The answer as to why is that there isn't one. A virus that kills it's host has failed natural selection since a virus must have a host to multiply. Therefore, it should be eliminated from existence as a by-product of the extinction of it's host, or it should mutate into a non-fatal form in order to avoid extinction. ","1401582036"

Thanks a lot for your honest opinion, and for playing the game.

I understand what you mean. We decided to do the more adventure type game out of it, and I think that it was the right thing to do, but there are many other ways we could've gone about it to make it different that would work very well too. 

There are definitely some rough edges left that we would like to polish out, but it came to a point where we just couldn't hold back the release any longer.

The splitter came with indention on it where to drill holes in it. I drilled them beforehand.

 The plastic/rubber air dam under the front has 12 plastic nuts/bolts holding it on, pretty easy to get to all of them with the front end jacked up, mine were very easy to loosen, i just used a socket by itself, no ratchet.

There are 2 10mm bolts under the bumper that also must come of at this time to allow you to be able to bend the bottom down to get your arm in

The 2 ends of the splitter are held by 2 of the plastic nut/bolt from the air dam. I held the middle up with a jack, make sure everything is straight and drill holes.

The hardest part is getting the nuts/bolts into the splitter because they are so far forward in the bumper but it is entirely possible to do it on the car as long as you have the 2 bolts in the bottom of the bumper out, there is enough play.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","This is exactly the type of thing people are willing to give discounts for though. Im still terrible at asking because it feels like such a hassle but more often than not they already have a procedure in place for discounting... At the hotel we could actually go off-book and price at our own discretion during down periods. It sucks, but the assholes really do get better rates. (Although the best rates go to the nice people who just ask :)","1401582046"

"ZBrush","t5_2tee4","I see where you are coming from. Sure you can just look at the outside and do your best to represent its form, but just looking from the outside doesn't teach you how an engine works (that engine being the human body). Sculpting an ecorche is all about seeing how and why things are shaped and how they move in conjunction with one another. Of course this is just my thought on the matter. :) It's cool to hear other opinions though!","1401582046"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I understand what a false flag operation is. I also never said that I don't believe the government was behind the bombing (they very well could've been involved in some way and it wouldn't surprise me). The concept of people ""faking their injuries"" and being sent to actual hospitals with actual doctors...and their involvement, etc...that just seems all very unlikely and senseless to me from the government's perspective. Why would they do that? Just use real bombs and injure real people...then you don't have to worry about ACTUAL doctors/police officers/civilians/etc. playing along with your ""conspiracy"".","1401582047"
