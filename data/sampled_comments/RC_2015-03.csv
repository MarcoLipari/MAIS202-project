"Anticonsumption","t5_2r83n","I think some people just get their mind stuck on the ideal ""zero waste"" expression and don't go beyond the terminology. Zero waste is really more of a target and some people get so awesomely close. Yes the girl in the post isn't EXACTLY zero waste, yes she still produces a tiny amount of trash, yes she still probably uses [unbleached recycled-paper] toilet paper (I can't blame her!). But surely a 1 gallon trash filled in a year is damn negligible compared to a 13 gallon trash filled every week!


Also, I think it can be a bit tough to put one's head around the idea of reducing waste(i.e. avoiding useless packaging or avoiding to buy stuff that can't be recycled/composted or re-used). It sounds like a very simple and basic idea (in particular for a subreddit like this one) but we're just so deep into consumerism practices that we don't realize to what extent it's a problem. I've been casually recycling for years without putting too much thoughts into it. I read the zero waste book from Bea Johnson last year and it honestly took me a while to really be aware of all the useless stuff that I buy or all the trash that I produce. I'm no where what she does but such an interesting read and eye opener and every bit helps.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I think a lot of people miss the message of what Jesus was conveying when He was on earth. It's not about sinning and not sinning, it's not about acts of righteousness but it's about loving each other and loving God.

When I read through some of the new testament it shows countless times Jesus trying to get it into our thick skulls that message, but all people cared about was how to get to heaven, or who's sinning more than others, or that the Messiah should be overthrowing the oppressive governments at the time.

My identity as transgender has challenged my faith and shook it a bit, especially as I think about the possibility that my very existence is a sin, but that doesn't make too much sense.

I used to go to an awesome church which focused on worship, but now I've been looking around for LGBT-friendly ones. So far no luck, some churches I just don't like. Maybe I'll go back to my original church and talk to my pastor about it.

Fortunately I haven't had any negative experiences with other Christians yet, but the possibility scares me because it would challenge my faith. It kinda stops me from going to church and the attitude to keep certain people out of church doesn't seem very Christian.

Think about when Jesus had dinner with those scummy people (people considered scum within their culture like tax collectors and other general sinners). People questioned why Jesus would do that and He said ""It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.""","1425168005"

"ask_transgender","t5_31hoq","Things I do:

* Play an instrument (I play guitar, and have been playing in bands for the last 6 years)

* Play video games, often with friends/housemates. RPGs, Hack n Slash or RTS games tend to work best because they require a lot of focus on the game-world and you can easily lose yourself in them. Games like Disgaea, Dynasty/Samurai Warriors/Warriors Orochi, Final Fantasy/Grandia/Dark Cloud, Command &amp; Conquer, Total War, Metal Gear etc. all work well, for me :)

* Watching movies - I love films, from comedies to horror to action to sci-fi. Movies are great for being immersed into an alternate world for a couple hours.

* Reading books, There are some great Thrillers out there, or action books or pop-science... or anything. It's all very interesting. Plus, some people will think you're smarter if you read books :P

* Coding. I've only just started recently learning MatLab (I wouldn't recommend starting with that language, though). You'd be surprised how much fun it can be. Kahn Academy has a great, fun interactive tutorial for learning basic JavaScript, and then you can move on from there.

Other things that you could do:

Draw, Write (poetry, short stories etc.), go for walks if you live in a place with nice scenery - maybe even combine that with photography.

Over time, the negative thoughts will pass, and things will pick up. It does get better :D","1425168006"

However here are some facts [Ajit Varadaraj Pai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Varadaraj_Pai) is ex Verizon lobbyist and [Michael O'Rielly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_O'Rielly) was telecommunication advisor at another lobbying company. Basically all these two puppets have to do is acknowledge that they read a fucking thing by submitting a BASIC FUCKING EDIT. Is that to much to ask? 

What is wrong with you? Why do you need to prove the point that does not exist? I could not care less if these two fwaknuts are republicans. Article mentioned that they are in fact republicans and that made you lose your shit. 

Fact they are not capable of reading, understanding and editing 8 pages of document over the period of two days, Fact only reason why they are in position of commissioner is because their prior employment as ""policy advisors"" at lobbying companies, Fact they are Republicans, Fact Republicans oppose this regulation, Fact you need to stop trying to make this something that it's not!","1425168008"

"japanlife","t5_2rg2o","Hm... in more detail. Before the Meiji Restoration, the common folks, like farmers and poor townsmen, did not have family names. Only the upper echelons of society were permitted to have a family name by which they could be identified.

For example in a village where there might be multiple ""Bob's"", people would refer to Bob who ran the rice paddies at the end of the village in the direction of the capital as ""Bob of the uppermost rice paddies."" And if they need to refer to Bob who's rice paddies were furthest from the direction of the capital, they would refer to him as ""Bob of the lowermost rice paddies."" Other variations may include the relative elevation of the rice paddies, north/south location, and so on and so forth.

Now, when the clans were abolished, and the new government needed to keep track of everyone, and kosekis and things needed to be created, they either assigned or made everyone choose a family name to be registered as.

For the former samurai and rich families (the big nobs) this was a simple matter, as they could simply continue to use their fancy-pants names with complicated kanji and a rich history. The top-knots had to go though, because there was no need to steady their helmets anymore.

For the simple-minded farmers, Bob #1, his wife, and their plethora of sprogs became ""Bob 上田"", and Bob #2, his wife, chickens and goat became ""Bob 下田.""

So, coming back to my original point. If you marry into a family that has a fancy-pants name, and they don't approve of you, you may wake up one morning with your own head on a different pillow.

Throwing minions of generally equal strength at it should be possible, even if it's inefficient.

it would be quite strong in arena, too, where hard removal is a lot more rare - if this ever made it onto the board, chances are good it would never leave.","1425168011"

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","Here's the thing about video games and anything that requires competent skill to make (art, movies, the usual things people think are only subject to subjective judgement): there are objective conditions under which games can be considered good or bad. People are wrong when they say that judging things can't *really* be done because of the variety in opinions. We can set out clear criteria for what counts as good using paradigmatic cases and use that as a way to judge. The closer to the ideal, the better the game. You know that games in the Super Mario series are expertly crafted and you know that Sonic Boom/Sonic 06' are the farthest thing from expertly crafted (you also can probably pick out games that are middling, for example the Assassin's Creed games or the normal stable of annual releases).  

Some Sonic games since the Genesis days could never live up to the idea. In fact, some are blunders that seem to have no peers in terms of how shitty they are. But to say that there hasn't been a Sonic game that comes near being good since 1994 is to admit you are not a competent judge of the quality of games (or that you have some kind of serious bias, or maybe you just aren't aware of the slew of titles that really would qualify as good).

"12Monkeys","t5_31827","Between this article and what I've noticed over the last couple episodes some thoughts on what's hanging and where things will go-

&amp;nbsp;
*Wexler gave us the first solid info on the Army of the 12 Monkeys. That plot finally has a jumpstart...

*which leads us to-Cole lives, somehow. He's the only person who heard Wexler so he will bring the info back whenever (and however) he does.

*Cole perhaps started to fuse with a version of himself?-he kept getting those images of a glass of milk dropping, blood drops, a gun being fired, and other things. Maybe they are images from his return.

*The Witness, 1987, the Himilayan virus mummy, who the Pale Man and Hawk Woman are (she kinda has a hawklike face) are all hanging plot points and at least some of them will comevinto play before the end of the season.

*Whats up with Jennifer? I doubt we've seen the last of her, which was her security (?) picking her up outside the Night Room at the end of 1x5/6

*What is going to happen in 87 that will be so integral to Leland wanting to create the virus? The ice mummy was found 'mid 80s' so Jones probably decides they need to travel back to THAT point of origin to try and stop the virus since that is presumably when Leland starts engineering the virus.

*Future reset-something in the future is going to reset enough that Cole lives and/or his jumps are reset or altered. Additionally this reset may be responsible for how they get enough power to send him back to 87. Cassie would have this intel so Cole would probably need to see her first.

*In the interview Natalie Chiadez states that Cole is coming back over the next several episodes. Did he splinter? Did it happen when the bomb went off and he became dislodged from time/the splintering process? Perhaps immediately after the explosion when new-timeline Cole comes in for the first time.

*The virus isn't gone because the show's not over. Who else has some of it? The easiest bet is Jennifer since she's the last living person who had ready access to it. Maybe Daddy left her some as his legacy of crazy for her. The guy at the CIA that Cassie confronts (he was at the party in the first episode) may also have some or access to be able to recreate it. 

*WHERE is the Witness? Cassie had been there before. The house she saw switched between standing and destroyed. Either she was there when she was young and again years later or perhaps she will start to time travel?

*The Army of the 12 Monkeys and the Drus (sp?) will necessitate more Chechnyan action as one of the gunmen had a monkey tattoo on his hand. Maybe Cole will resurrect/pop back up there (this is looking more likely-I hope someone teaches Cole Chechnyan.)

I saw a mirage that could have been an aura. Was the stage moving? I wasn't really sure. It shouldn't have been. Or at least so I told myself. It's probably a migraine. Great. I was kind of looking forward to sitting through this two-and-a-half hour opera *without* a debilitating headache -- at best. Wait -- no -- the stage *was* moving! The stage lifted up off of itself, and *flipped over!* There was no doubt in my mind now that the mirage was a deliberate stage effect. There was no migraine. I relaxed in my seat, and settled in over the next month to watch the whole of the ring cycle. And (with the exception of some bits in *Die Walkure* and a large chunk of the Walatraute scene in *Gotterdammerung* -- and the love duet in *Siegfried* maybe could've been a bit shorter) I loved every minute of it.","1425168022"

"tDCS","t5_2sfqg","You could potentially have sites in the brain receiving twice the current level that was being supplied, i.e. if you use 2 stimulators each set at 1 mA some regions could recieve 2 mA. Where this happens is difficult to predict without computer modelling. However (like in that example), if you use standard safety guidelines for tDCS like no more than 2 mA per electrode it seems very unlikely you could get enough ""overlap"" to really damage any tissue.

A bigger problem here is that you will be stimulating basically most of the brain, and we don't have a clear pciture of what that does. This is *not* hd-tDCS--in HD tDCS you would have either a common cathode and two anodes or a common anode with two cathodes, in both cases with a regulation system that ensures the current is evenly split between electrodes. The difference here is tht nw both ""stiimulators"" are in the same circuit, so you can make designs to improve focality like the 4x1 layout.","1425168026"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","No,

The question is, did he present my offer in a fair and balanced manner? He knew everything about our financial position and what we were capable of doing or not doing. Was there any personal bias towards presenting the offer? Did he disclose any information that he should not have? Also, when he suddenly decided to stop being our agent, was he really acting in our best interest? He did not even  make a recommendation or referral. He just tossed us aside like we were garbage. We had to practically plead with him just to get more information about how things would play out. And even after talking with 2 other agents about the situation, his decision to back out made no sense unless he was afraid that he would get caught with his hand in the cookie jar for doing something wrong. Is it not normal to ask the realtor how they would act in our best interest if they are playing both sides? 

Agent3 thinks that Agent1 is unethical - which is why he had the grudge. It wasn't because he slept with his wife or something. He informed me that all reputable agents in the area choose to avoid working with him. He did not give specific examples. 

Edit: Also my current agent made the suggestion of at least contacting his broker. Aside from her duty to me, she has no personal feelings about the situation. She just thought it might be something worth looking into because of how he handled the situation. 

I don't want to sue anyone, but I also don't want to just give up on the house living the next few years in regret.

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","&gt; I'm going to mention one pro that people don't seem to be bringing up, well...sorta. The armor is good, but the more important thing is that the effectiveness of the armor is significantly higher when you're playing against worse players. You can say this for almost any tank's armor, but it's perfectly exemplified with the IS-7. I had to pound it into people's heads that a lot of IS-7s in clan wars only works against shit clans, and I was proven right over and over and over again but people refused to listen to me.

Back when I was in BADGR there were a few battles where we lost to teams we shouldn't have and I remember IS-7s just getting obliterated in a split second against not great players (and they were being driven by very good players).  I started taking screenshots of every tank in the after battle report in CWs and SHs.  I recently went back and started crunching the numbers.  I put in all the numbers for IS-7s and E 100s and they ended up with the same number of bounced shots per game (1.8).

Didn't really surprise me.  It's seemed clear for a while that in an environment with all gold rounds flying around armor is largely meaningless and having more hps is what really matters (for survivability).","1425168030"

If you want virtual instruments, expect to pay about $500 for a somewhat decent library, and then you need a MIDI keyboard or external controller to play them with. Then if you need effects for processing your signals you pay more, and if you need decent preamps you pay more, better microphones, better interface... and so on. Once you get to a certain point you have to consider having a dedicated space to record, and that means adding acoustic treatment for the room. To have enough equipment to record a 4-5 piece band with professional gear will set you back over $100,000. ","1425168030"

Last time I checked, Sydney have more trophies than WSW in their cabinet.

&gt; Del Piero/Italy banner.

Would've made more sense to have an Austrian flag, no?

&gt; Your smurf village getting painted red &amp; black.

The opposite of that happened last night.

&gt; The reference back to the ""West is geography. Sydney is a state of mind"" (to this day I'm waiting for an explanation after asking a few people) tifo.

The reason nobody has explained it to you is because the tifo is pretty self explanatory in the first place. I love that the RBB response is to reply with a tifo that makes no sense and then start with the ""yeah your tifo didn't make any sense either that's the point"".

But you want to know my favourite part of the tifo? 

Every time the derby at SFS starts I see a torrent of WSW fans saying our tifos are shit because they aren't related to our team. Because RBB tifos are always about the Wanderers and not about themselves, right? This time it wasn't either.

In the end I'm not going to remember the tifo nearly as much as Antonis crushing the hopes of every Wanderer in Sydney.

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Doesn't effect towers like titan's does and the passive is near useless unless a lot of people build a lot of magic defense. Voidstone + dark stance 2 gets rid of 40 protections and that's basically true damage to the jungler, mid, adc, and maybe solo depending on who it is. More pen is unnecessary. The instant 15% of their hp gone helps when fighting gods with a lot of HP but few protections E.G. most mages that build warlocks. Soul Reaver also gives you more MP than Obsidian Shard and an extra 300 mana. Extra mana is always nice on hel, you run out fast. 

All that being said, I don't buy Soul Reaver very often, it's more situational. Only when they have high HP with low protections. I may get obsidian shard if they have a tanky team, but I don't like to. Something like, Osiris jungle, Hades solo, Zhong Kui Mid, adc whatever, and support whatever.","1425168034"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","It will be difficult (impossible?) for you to earn 7-12% on bonds after accounting for defaults. Those interest rates are basically junk bond rates and so at the very least you should have a huge amount of diversity for your investments which means using a junk bond fund rather than buying the individual bonds yourself. 

On the other hand, high return bonds are more sensitive to interest-rate risk for the same duration, so your holdings in both funds and individual bonds will either be exposed to significant interest-rate risk or have a reduced return by targeting shorter duration bonds. Holding individual bonds to maturity can mitigate this risk (but not the lost opportunity cost), but is harder to diversify the individual company risk without a very large account. Of course, this is just for anyone else reading this because you should already be aware of these trade-offs and pitfalls if you are planning such an investment (if not, seriously reconsider your investment strategy).

One alternative could be peer-to-peer lending which can provide returns within that range before defaults and at the lower end of that range after accounting for them. Sites like Prosper let you diversify with amounts as small as $25/loan, and thus diversify your account with much smaller amounts of capital. Just keep in mind that both p2p lending and junk bonds should be expected to be “front loaded” with higher returns during good times, but *very significant* declines and defaults during economic downturns.","1425168035"

It is stated that a lower version of GL had probability manipulation.

Galactus is more implied than most things...I know he has galaxy-level feats and the largest amount of Power Cosmic (which ain't nothing to fuck with), but he doesn't have a lot of showings.

The mastersprogram International Museum Studies did an exhibition project in 2011 where we were told to ""hack the museum"",  we descided to do an exhibtion about how gender matters, and since they pose a bull elephant in a super dominant posiotion despite the fact that they are matriarys we de descided to put it in a female item of clothing.

EDIT 2: In order to stay true to  Gothenurg humor we descided that in order to get a tilte that shows that it is both about how gender matters and also about matters about genders it was called Gender Matteers, ask any swede about Gothenburg and they will use the word ""pun"" as one of thier first 20 words =)

I agree with you on the shirts though, for years they've totally failed to provide merchandise that appeals to fan demographics, and instead we get homogenised shit that comes in both child sizes and adult sizes but which adults would be hesitant to wear in public.

The creative one is I've always been a low-level musician and I enjoy writing and recording songs. It comes and goes, and in fact is one of my self-indicators when a depressive bout is present in that I don't play or record at all during that time. 

Other than that I am a bit of an information junkie and am addicted to Internet news sources and such (like Reddit now). I also now reside in a very rural area and I try to routinely take walks and just enjoy the simple beauty of the world around me. Sad to say walking also comes and goes, despite knowing it's a very positive influence on my mental health.

I also somewhat look after some others in the area that need assistance. Nothing high level, just making life easier for feral cats, birds and the odd elderly or debilitated person. 

I'm far from busy because I've whittled a lot of stress and responsibility out of my life but I still try to stay somewhat engaged in the world. I got very, very lucky and found a job I wasn't looking for that takes care of many of my basic needs and allows me a lot of freedom to be a non-traditional worker. I have projects that I do that don't require regular office hours, I mostly work at home and as long as I meet the deadlines I'm not held to any schedule. 

It's sort of a depressed person's paradise, except I still suffer from depression so I don't appreciate it as much as I should or could. I've settled for a simple life straddling the poverty line but it works for me. I'll never be thanked in any Oscar speeches but I feel a measure of pride and accomplishment that I am affecting my little part of the world in a positive way.","1425168037"

You've said that you know he wouldn't want to date you, so putting yourself in that position is just going to make it harder for yourself in the long run, because you're not going to get what you want by giving him what he wants. You said it so yourself, he's using you. 

I've been in a similar position where I was constantly trying to be with a guy who didn't want to date me. It would always end with me wondering why I wasn't good enough for them. Don't let that happen to you. You deserve better.

The only wear I've noticed is that the heel has worn down just a little bit (I mean maybe 2 mm?) where I put the most pressure on them, which is on the back. Other than that, they're easy to wipe down when I get any mud on them. But I haven't had any damage done by salty - mostly because I'm afraid of damaging them.

Think of it like a joystick.  Imagine if you started a game while holding ""up"".  When the game starts, it assumes the joystick is currently at the center position.  As a result, you can't actually move up and centering the joystick would move you down.  This is why, especially in the old days of PC gaming, you had to ""calibrate"" your joysticks.

"crackpack","t5_31ac1","No one said the pack was meant to be easy. That being said, there's a reason I typically only play single-player worlds on Peaceful.

Regarding Morph, the 2-blocks-tall-bat problem is actually a problem with Ars Magica, which has been fixed as of 1.4.0.0008, but that version was not available yet when version 2.0.3.0 of the pack came out. I'm sure they're planning on including that and several other fixed versions of the various mods as soon as a few key mods are updated as well.

There are also other ways to fly which don't have the risk of suffocating in the ceiling, they just take more work to get than Morph does. 

Also, if there were a ton of mobs waiting for you at spawn, then the other players haven't done a good enough job at lighting the area so that doesn't happen. There are certainly plenty of light sources available to do just that, some of which have more than the standard light range, and some (very expensive to make) will actually prevent most mobs from spawning within a several block radius beyond the range of the light.

In order to transfer RF from the generator to the machines, you need either an EnderIO Energy Conduit (comes in 3 types, depending on how much you want to move at a time) or a Rednet Energy Cable (not as effective as the higher-tier EnderIO conduits, but sufficient for the lava generator). The Rednet cable is easier to make, but the basic EnderIO conduits are cheaper in the long-run.

The lack of the Thermal Expansion energy conduits (and Item and Fluiducts) is due to the TE team splitting them off into a separate mod because of some major rewrites needed to get them working in 1.7.10. If they had waited to include them in the main mod, we probably wouldn't have a 1.7.10 version of TE yet. ","1425168046"

Mint will give a notification that there are pending updates, which it can apply automatically if you allow it. Unlike Windows, you don't have to reboot or shut down anything during that. Also, it is much less likely that an update would break your system compared to Windows (Win7 updates often break my system) unless you use third party software not supplied from the software center,such as from a PPA.

I was fluent enough to chat with new Japanese visitors about anything really.


Then I moved to do TEFL in Japan and realised that I couldn't remotely understand humble speech, so it took me several months before I could get what all the clerks and customer servicepeople were saying to me (quite a big issue). Having come here, my kanji reading level has also shot up without ever touching a textbook or taking a note (there's often furigana or romaji under road signs and such). So summarily, I was 'fluent enough', then I became 'actually more fluent than that' by moving here. But note: my kanji writing still sucks even when living here - I have a bad back so it's been impossible for me to take notes for the last two years, unfortunately.","1425168058"

Which isn't to say that line doesn't serve a purpose.  Most people agree that we gotta draw the line somewhere.  But there are 16 year olds who are smart enough to decide when they're ready for sex just like there are 30 year olds who are dumb enough to be tricked or coerced into having sex against their best interests.  It's not a black and white issue.

My point is that different countries arbitrarily draw that line at different ages because there's worldwide disagreement over where that line should be.  If both parties are legally able to consent by their countries laws, then how is it different than shaming someone for any other sexual preference?

&gt;Would you personally date a 14 year old? Like you think that's acceptable?

Would I?  Probably not.  If it was legal here though, I wouldn't judge anyone else for it.  That's not my call to make.

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","I know, I had a turbo car. The oil pressure coming out of the turbo is very low. Turbo manufacturers have acceptable angles from vertical to allow the oil to drain properly. Horizontal is not an acceptable angle, much less pushing oil back up from a low mounted turbo (where the exhaust is) to the oil cap (top of the head).

&gt;Speaking of oil backing up in the center housing, a gravity feed needs to be just that! The oil outlet should follow the direction of gravity +/-35° when installed in the vehicle on level ground. **If a gravity feed is not possible, a scavenge pump should be used to insure that oil flows freely away from the center housing.**

http://www.turbobygarrett.com/turbobygarrett/oil_water_lines

Directly from Garrett Turbos.

What happens if oil doesn't drain properly and gets backed up is oil starts coming out the compressor and turbine seals.

The only reason I said most likely, is because there is probably someone out there who has a turbo mounted above the roof line that could conceivably use a gravity oil feed through the oil cap.","1425168062"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Didn't say low bar was meant to train your hamstrings, at all. I simply said they were recruited during the lift, along with the other muscles in the posterior chain, contributing to that typical 5-10% increase in weight vs. high bar that you mentioned. For example, on a 300# low bar squat the hamstrings themselves would help out with SOME of ~15-30#, which clearly not going to lead to any kind of hypertrophy.

The article you posted is great, very informative, however it doesn't actually refute my point in the least. In the section where the author addresses hamstring activation, he cites an article (which was coincidentally enough coauthored by my old physiology professor at UF, Dr. Tillman. go gators!) that demonstrates there is no difference between the hamstring activation in what is described as a high bar back squat, not a low bar back squat,  (""As shown in Figure 1, the back squat involves positioning the barbell across the shoulders on the trapezius, slightly above the posterior aspect of the deltoids..."") and a front squat. I think you'll agree that high bar and front squats have more in common with each other than low bar back squats.

More subjectively, in simply doing these movements one can attest to the fact that the do hamstrings engage in a low bar and not so much during a high bar.

Privilege, for example, can be completely voluntary creations of contracts (the actual origin of private law).  I am privileged to do that which no one has a right to interfere with and no one has a duty to provide me.  

For example, First Amendment vindication of freedom of speech is a right qua government regulation but free speech generally is simply a privilege; no one has a duty to ensure I am able to speak freely on my own property but no one has a right to stop me, either.  

&gt;CAPITALISM: That organization of society, incorporating elements of tax, usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while pretending to exemplify it.

This actually isn't capitalism; it is corporatism.  Capitalism isn't a social organization, it is spontaneous organization of an economic character when there are free markets, free people, and private ownership of all chattel (personal or productive).

You'll have to be honest with him at some point, and leading him on is a severe injustice. Letting the relationship fester like this when you are aware of your feelings is pretty rotten too. 

Talk it out with BF. If you do break up, give him space and yourself some time without Bob. Clear your head and after a few weeks, re-evaluate your desire to be with Bob.

Your defending of OP. If you want to be the mouthpiece of hers, then I will gladly play along.

I think men are more interested with systems than women are, yes. Women are equally more interested in social aspects. This is called sexual dimorphism.

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","I've been playing since 3-day headstart launch. There were a lot of major problems with the way the game was developed as well as presented to it's audience. It slowly filtered out a lot of people that enjoyed it. People were vocal about everything wrong and through that I slowly watched the game fix so many wrongs. I still think this game is one of the best MMO's I've played outside of WoW. It has all of the character that I wanted. Nothing felt too ""Generic"". The raiding is top tier if not the best. PVP is my only issue with it. But I look forward to the PVP changes coming soon.

Wildstar has never since advertised to the public that the game has changed in a positive way. They fixed a lot of it's PVE and End Game blunders. Once PVP is as polished as PVE and End Game I believe they will advertise again. As in ""Hey sorry about all that stuff before, we fixed it. Come back and give it another chance"".

Most of the people complaining about the game usually fit one of these statements:

- Left the game early on, stuck around the forums to rag on it. Haven't checked out how the updates have drastically changed the game. Sticking with an outdated opinion.

- Want to PVP/World PVP. (Of which the updates to support a working PVP system are coming but not in yet). When PVP is all you care about the game is nearly empty for you.

- Are annoyed with the low population on PVP servers.","1425168065"

"architecture","t5_2qhae","Hmm...doesn't it still work though since we are interested in the rotation of the whole system around the chosen point, not just the rotation caused by the 10k force?

- Put the point at the intersection of the 5k force with the -x, -y components and the 10k force we have to find the couple for
- -5k (negative since anti-clockwise rotation) * 4 feet (perpendicular distance between the force it is coupled with) = -20k feet
- -20k feet/10k (magnitude of the force we have to find the couple for) = -2 feet
- coupled force we are trying to find is acting downward at 10k 2 feet to the left of its coupled force

"freemasonry","t5_2qn38","I agree with much of what you've said but as a point of contrast, for example, when I drive the 140km to attend my mother lodge I use a parking lot 10min away to change into my suit.  I tie my tie in the reflection of my car window.  Although suits are the standard at my Lodge, no one would send me away (maybe give me a jacket) - I do it because it demonstrates my reverence for the Lodge, and the respect I have for my Brothers.   Could I do that through action, and language, and a thousand other little things?  **Sure!** but I do this in *addition* to those other things, or at least, I try.

If your lodge is mostly comprised of working men in the same field where you're very likely to be called out at a moment's notice, I've got no problem at all with that sort of dress.

"PandR","t5_2sa88","Season 6's ending was meant to wrap up the show there, but with season 7 suddenly coming up and cutting the season by half I guess the writers would rather give us a whole fan-service season to go out with a bang then rather rushing a whole other plot. Ben's congress run would've eaten up the whole season and we've all seen it before with Leslie, so it wasn't really something we needed more of and they knew it. I think that the writers handled this season really well, past season criticism showed what they needed to do with this season. No tension, no worrying, just straight up fan-service that people deserved since they started with season 1.

EDIT: All the short endings were equally as long as the other and they all pretty much were wrapped up with the final meet and greet they all had in the end, so I think they were all equally as touching and great. Jean-Ralphio's ending made me tear up. ","1425168072"

That will work quickly, but without knowing an exact dose in advance, Harry would have to proceed slowly enough that there's a good chance Voldemort will have time to react before passing out.

An alternative might be to discreetly transfigure some lidocaine onto a patch of Voldemort's back so that he can't feel there, and then transfigure a small injection syringe filled with propofol, positioned so that it will fall down onto the patch, with a spring-loaded mechanism to inject on contact. Harry would just have to take a guess at the right dose. Once Voldemort is out, he would have to use his time turner to buy enough time to get an intubation system and someone who would be willing and able to intubate Voldemort.","1425168080"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Marx also predicted that machines would make the working class obsolete. We are a lot closer to that being a reality than ever.

Most of the jobs in the world could probably be made obsolete with current technology. From the service industry to manufacturing, and hell even highly technical jobs.

What it will do over time is continue to ""liberate"" workers. Unemployment must naturally rise in capitalism because the name of the game is to offer a good or service better or cheaper than your competition. The most inefficient element to any companies business model is the human worker. They are expensive and have those pesky rights.

There comes a point that as the minimum wage grows, it becomes cheaper for a company to replace that job with a machine that runs 24/7.

Sure some people will vow to only eat at Burger King if McDonalds ever went fully automated, even if their hamburgers were $2 cheaper and always built consistently.

Plus, world population is growing exponentially thanks to technology.

So if your economic system says you need money to survive, and half your population has no source of income because the jobs don't exist, maybe it is time to get a new economic system.","1425168080"

"iamverysmart","t5_2yuej","&gt;through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through **observation and experimentation.**

The bot put this under your post. Emphasis mine. Where have we observed maro evolution. Of course, we haven't. It, according to you would take too long. Here is an experiment on evolution though. Dont have a link but here is the journal ""Burke, M. K. et al. 2010. Genome-wide analysis of a long-term evolution experiment with Drosophila. Nature. 467 (7315): 587-590""

The wolf/fox thing is pretty interesting. Do you assume I do not believe in micro-evolution and variations? That is observed, and yes, I accept that as true science. Because the coyotes evolved elsewhere than the fox, and the gene pool worked out to not be able to mate with foxes, then that makes sense.

&gt;There is also no arbitrary limit where organisms stop changing and adapting to their environments, and seeing as life has been around for over 3.5 billion years, there has been plenty of time (and if you don't think 3.5 billion years is enough time, you probably aren't grasping just how long a billion years is) for a single-celled ancestor to diverge into a giraffe, a pine tree, an E. coli bacterium, and everything in between.

Check out the [Haldane Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldane%27s_dilemma)

&gt;And you aren't convinced of evolution because of ""the amount of holes in it""? Creationism has more holes than Swiss cheese.

You haven't shown any actual holes in creationism, you've only shown parts of evolution.","1425168081"

&gt;In California law, there is no crime specifically called ""breaking and entering."" That's largely because the crime of burglary no longer requires forced entry.Suppose, for example, that your neighbor departs for work and accidentally leaves his front door wide open. Once he's gone, you walk through the open door, grab your neighbor's TV, and make off with it. Even though you didn't use any force to enter the home--you didn't even have to open the door--you would be liable for burglary just the same.

Friendship is effortless, and unlike other strong relationships where partners might complete each other's sentences, we consistently complete each other's *thoughts*.

He's the introverted, quiet version of me, with exactly the same chains of thought, logic, and reasoning, except from an internal perspective opposed to my external one. And he feels the same way about me that I do about him. We consistently amaze each other with how drastically we, together, master the intuitive function to its entirety.

That said, he's a stubborn headed jackass who is SO locked in his mind, and so quick to retreat when he feels threatened. And good luck convincing him that he's truly in a safe space, by the way, because to him the only safe place is in himself, tucked away where nobody see.

It's what has propelled pretty much any of the various human and civil rights movements of the past centuries (which came up with the concept of human rights in the first place).

Lawfulness alone does not tell us anything about an action being right or wrong, beneficial or detrimental, commendable or deplorable. Take the Nazis and all the laws they passed to make sure they were technically oh so very legal in everything they did. Fuck that kind of dumb legalism. Laws are made by flawed, fallible people.

"podemos","t5_31h78","¿VAMOS HACIA UN ESTADO POLICIAL O EN ÉL ESTAMOS?
El Aparato del Estado, y parte de la sociedad, están mostrando su cara más cruda con su particular forma de tratar a sus ciudadanos.
De un tiempo a esta parte se somete al cuarteto Pablo Iglesias, Tania Sánchez, Iñigo Errejón y Juan Carlos Monedero a una persecución inaudita en nuestra sociedad por parte de muchos políticos y medios a su servicio. Son cuatro cabezas visibles. Los chivos expiatorios del Dios Casta.  Bajo el agua, el iceberg es mucho mayor. Muchos somos los  sospechosos o susceptibles de serlo, casi todos. Como con los cuatro, con los demás irán los medios de propaganda disparando cuando lo vean conveniente. Pocos son susceptibles de salvarse.
Esos cuatro conciudadanos están sometidos a un acecho inaceptable, por cierto y por desgracia, ante la indiferencia de gran parte de la sociedad. Se ensañan contra ellos con un inaceptable examen meticuloso y exhaustivo en el orden íntimo, estrictamente personal, laboral, familiar, ideológico, económico, moral etc. de su vida actual, pasada y futura como no se ha hecho nunca a nadie. No importa a esos auto coronados Altos Jefes de la Culpa caer en el más estúpido de los ridículos envileciéndose espiando para atacar al padre de uno de ellos por ser, supuestamente, dueño de una mansión con piscina. Ante las evidencias, transvistieron ellos el caso que pasó a ser el del padre propietario de un piso con piscina de la comunidad de vecinos. Para concluir el patinazo abandonaron el caso porque el analizado resultó no ser la persona que tenían en el punto de mira los sagaces sabuesos sino otra, menos morbosa, que coincidía en nombre y apellidos con aquella a la que se iba a la caza para montarle un escándalo. 
A nadie cabe la duda de que no se persigue, en asuntos así, el delito sino a la persona. Según convenga se cambia de diana y se apunta a quien se quiere hacer daño, no se trata de evitar un delito ni siquiera importa si existe o no y si no existe se inventa. Tampoco nunca antes se ha hecho tanta inversión en recursos humanos, económicos y de tiempo para objetivos tan nimios, salvo que no sean tan insignificantes si de convertir se trata en cadáveres políticos a esos cuatro ciudadanos y de paso -muerto el perro se acabó la rabia-, a los millones de seguidores que parece que contabilizan las encuestas.
No importa perseguir el delito, les importa la presa en persona, su entorno, sus amigos, su familia, su intimidad, sus viajes, con quien habla y con quién se relaciona.
En el rastreo contra Pablo, Tania, Iñigo, Juan Carlos, Pedro y María, Juan y José intervienen agentes de todo tipo y color. El plan de acoso y derribo es obra de un equipo pluridisciplinar: periodistas, políticos, policías, empleados de la Hacienda Pública, funcionarios del estado, de la universidad, servidores de las altas finanzas y también ciudadanos espontáneos. Muchos sin darse cuenta, inconscientes, como debe ser, convencidos de que hacen el bien o una simple gracia.  La jauría humana explora milímetro a milímetro con linternas y antorchas los áridos y pantanosos campos de la noche política española. Rastrean, salen a la caza del rojo y del morado inflexibles. No para entregarlos a la justicia sino para lincharlos sin pruebas de delito. Para utilizarlos como carnaza para  votantes indiferentes e indecisos. 
El Gran Hermano, el personaje de Orwell es una broma al lado de lo que estamos viviendo ante la pasividad de muchos. 
Estremece pensar que, de repente, un día nos podemos despertar después de un mal sueño y descubrir por conjeturas, datos sospechosos, cosas raras de la vida, que alguien te espía, te siguen, sientes pasos a tus espaldas, estás bajo sospecha, te investigan, también a tu hermano, a tu padre, a tu novia, a tu hijo, a tu amigo sólo porque tienes tus propios gustos y tus propias ideas -o las tienen ellos-, que no coinciden con las de los Grandes Hermanos.
Ahí estamos.

It's also an extremely rules heavy and crunchy system though, and not for the faint of heart.  Nonetheless, it might have some mechanics that you can use to inspire other things.  One interesting dimension it forces is the idea of scene economy: every player (and the GM) is given a limited amount of scenes in which to accomplish what they want.  I'd recommend hunting down a few actual plays / reviews to get a feel for it.  A lot of them certainly have a Game of Thrones feel going for them.

Stars without Number also has an interesting Factions system that could be refitted for other systems.  It has rules for dealing with covert operations, political wrangling and deposing governments.","1425168084"

Anyway, I've seen a good few dogs of mine in the past getting to the slowing down stage. That's what made losing him so hard....that never happened. The morning of his last op, I had him out for a walk just before it and he was still running about full of life, like a puppy - he never did grow out of the puppy stage, typical bloody boxer! The last op to remove his tumour went well, the vet called me to update me as it was ongoing. But he'd been under anaesthetic for too long, and his heart stopped just as they were stitching him up, and they couldn't get him back. It was a complete shock, the vet was in floods of tears when she phoned me.

Dunno if I'll get another dog. Not yet anyway. Would feel like I was replacing him, and I don't want to do that. He is irreplaceable. He was everyone's favourite dog, he got on with everyone, loved everyone, and everyone loved him.

Active rain item would be awesome, passive sounds awful.

Needle is just... poisoning an enemy?

Fistful of Dollars is literally identical to Store Credit aside from the ridiculously OP arcade ideas.

Reverse Gaping Maw sounds awesome.

Puny also sounds awesome, but tear height should be tied to it- Number One should be able to hit them.

There are other items like Acupuncture. I don't know why you made this item, considering it's just basically an upgrade to The Virus.

Ever heard of the ""Curse of Darkness""? IMO, Mist would be just a worse version.

Poop mimic is a cool idea. Maybe give it a small visual indicator.

Retribution sounds cool, fast-moving homing tear conversion on damage.

Distortion sounds terrifying and I like it.

Flame Tears is... what? Maybe have them be time based instead of damage, having tears that stick around forever sounds like a PITA. Plus, not a lot of combos that Fire Mind doesn't already do.

It's a Mystery is bad. You give no info and it could be great or awful so, as a concept, it's bad.

Capsule Machine sounds great. Maybe make the coin requirement 5-30 coins so you have to decide if it's an item worth taking and if you have the money. Shit outta luck if you get a syringe.

Marshy poop is ew, we already have cobwebs and those are annoying as balls.

Hallucinations have a lot of cool ideas for rooms.

Call it ""Cage Fighter"" instead of ""Tantrum"", since it's the Cage's rocks.

Lots of other misc. ideas, little too lazy to crit each one. I appreciate that you can make all of them though, a lot are interesting.

I like to wash my jerseys by themselves, but if you do it with other clothes, make sure they are the same colors (but really, just do it by itself.) Turn the jersey inside out, use cold water, **don't ever use bleach**, don't use fabric softeners. I just use regular tide, you obviously don't need a lot for a single jersey. Also use a low tumble setting on your washer.

When it's done, make sure you get it out of the washer as quick as possible. That comes from Nike on their dri-fit cloth, don't let it sit on itself when wet, so make sure you are there when it's done washing.

As for drying, I turn it rightside out and just hang it up to air dry. I've never put one in the dryer just because I don't want to take that chance, but you can if you want. It says to set it on a low tumble only.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","The thing with Finnish Paganism is that Finland as one nation didn't exist before Kalevala and the 19th century. Before that, Finland was made of different [tribes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns#Subdivisions) that all had their own believes and traditions and one could even say that languages because of very different dialects. For Tavastian, Karelians were as much as ""outsiders"" as Russians or Swedes and vice versa. 

Now, considering this, Elias Lönnrot gathered most of the stories and folklore from Eastern Finland. I hope you understand that Kalevala is only part of old Finnish mythology and folklore, we have had tons of same and different stories in different parts of Finland that Lönnrot didn't record. What happens in Kalevala in story happens before Jesus Christ of course, but those songs were only created after we were already mostly Christians. It is possible of course that if Lönnrot didn't create that part himself, that they are heritage passed down generations about the Swedish and Russian Crusades. It is story of our ancestors how our religion was replaced by another, stronger religion. 

Ancient Finns were very stubborn to keep their pagan believes, but our conquerors were also very determined to convert us, with steel and fire if necessary.   ","1425168090"

Das ""schwul"" in negativer Form in den Sprachgebrauch eingedrungen ist, ist zwar nicht schön, aber nicht die Schuld der Bohnen. Hier kann man zwar durchaus mal drauf achten vielleicht was anderes zu sagen, aber unterbewusst adaptiert man leider viele schlechte Angewohnheiten.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Read recently that they are worse than the regular cig or just as bad...Would need to do more research on it.  I quit smoking 4 years ago or so and one of the things that I read about (because I'm a real nerd and read about things before doing them) is that what my brain would miss a lot is the actions: lighting and hand to mouth action.  We do this over hrrrm was it 40 000x a year.  You will have to look up the number, sorry.  It's been 4 years and I knew it then but it's avail on Google as is anything else.  So the addiction that is physical as in my nicotine craving and the nausea and insomnia and want of a cigarette went away fairly quickly.  It was gone well under a month.  The action of lighting it and bringing it to mouth and puffin on the other hand was another story.  I kept wanting to puff on something...I just had to suffer and wait it out as many others have done before me and will continue to do after me.  I think that for this reason, it may not be the greatest...unless you want to continue smoking but not get as many toxins as you do in a cigarette....Then this may be right for you.  For those quitting, I'd think about it twice.  You're going to have to quit 3x when you think about it if you go this way.  1) Quitting your real cigarette.  You will no longer buy packs but rather cartouches that you place in and vaporize.  A lot of places are making this illegal to use btw and you now have to respect the 9 meter rule-same as real cigarettes.  Their first adverts were ''smoke inside-nobody can say a thing as it's vapor.''  Well people have said more than one thing and a lot of places will not tolerate them.  So if this is your solution to smoke indoors somewhere, make sure that you can to begin with.  You may just be as well off with your real cigarette. 2) You are not getting those thousands of negative toxins from the cigarette but you are still getting nicotine.  There are different sizes-some offer more nicotine than others.  The goal is to go down to one size and then quit but let's face it, a lot don't.  They tell themselves that they are just inhaling vaporized nicotine and that it's safe.  So they stay on the strongest cartouche/packet of nicotine for the e-cig if you prefer.  If they forget it, they will smoke a real cigarette rather than to run out of nicotine.  Who's going to torture themselves if they have no plan on quitting?  Also, you may just increase your nicotine dependency.  It offers less than a ''real'' cigarette but if you can smoke it at all times, at the office, in a meeting, inddors, outdoors, on the bus, in the car with children...anywhere....then you may just be getting more nicotine than you were before.  So you quit the real cigarette.  Now you have an e-cig problem!  Yay! 3) You still have that action of hand to mouth problem even if you quit this.  This is still providing you with that.  So if you decide to quit, you have once again to quit mentally and physically.  You're at point zero or pretty much where you were when you first started.

TL:DR: I quit smoking 4 years ago.  Considered this option.  I wouldn't advise it for people wanting to quit smoking and explain why in length above.  Would recommend for people who do not want to quit smoking but want less toxins.  Cheap Ebay stuff will likely break a lot faster....be careful.","1425168097"

Obama is the most divisive President we've had in the modern era.  And before him, Bush 43 was the most divisive President we'd had in the modern era.  And before him, Clinton was the most divisive President we'd had in the modern era.  So, yeah, things are not good at the moment, and they've been getting steadily worse for the last 25 years or so.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Please explain how one unit of length makes ""more sense"" than another? Or one unit of force? Listen, there are a LOT of benefits to the metric/SI system. Ease of conversion, interdependence of definition/derivation, standardized scaling/naming conventions. Math with it is typically much easier. But what YOU'RE suggesting as a strength is actually one of the downfalls of the metric/SI system, and one of the reasons I honestly prefer working in english units: the metric system rarely makes sense. 

The SI has 7 base units (Kelvin, second, candela, meter, kilogram, mole and ampere) all other units are derived from various combinations of these base units. As an example, you end up with units like the Farad, used to measure capacitance, which is defined in base units as s^4 A^2 m^-2 kg^-1 .  As a result the Farad is a ridiculously huge amount of capacitance, and will rarely be encountered in practice. As such, you often see capacitance values being used in the micro- or even pico- Farad range, one millionth or one trillionith of a Farad... does this make sense?

Another great example is the Pascal, SI unit of pressure, defined as 1kg/(m s^2 ). In this case, a Pascal is a very very impractically small amount of pressure, you most often encounter values in the kPA to GPa range (thousands to billions of Pascals). Example: atmospheric pressure is about 101,000 Pa. Does this make sense?

Even the base units don't make much inherent sense. The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the surface distance at sea-level from the equator to the North Pole (yeah, that makes a lot of sense, most people have an intuitive feel for that distance and use it as a reference commonly!) and the kilogram was defined originally as 1000 times the mass of a cube of water with sides that measured one-billionth of the surface distance at sea level from the equator to the north pole. So Sensible!

Compare that to english engineering units or US customary units or whatever you want to call them. Most of these units are not derived from arbitrary base units, they became customary over time because they referred to quantities/measurements that people encountered on a daily basis, or which were easily related to as they were based on common frames of reference. Thought experiment: try explaining to some lost tribe which has never experienced modern society how long a meter is. Guessing they wont get it. Then try explaining how long a foot is. Guessing they'll get it immediately. Everybody has a foot. Everybody knows about how long one is intuitively. The downside is all the things I mentioned above as benefits of the metric/SI system. A lot of english units have goofy conversion factors, etc. The math is a little harder. But arguing that they make ""less sense"" than SI units is either a completely subjective assessment (basically opinion, neither right nor wrong) or if objective, a wrong assessment for all the reasons demonstrated above.","1425168099"

We're scared of all our fish being fished, all our resources being extracted, national heritage being destroyed etc.

It's not American corporations Vs. Europe. In truth corporations shouldn't be defined as the state they operate, the people in charge are global citizens who can go anywhere and do everything. It's all corporations vs. the state.

This perhaps won't immediately remove all regulations and traditions on protecting the markets and peoples rights, but it can be used to make a new battlefield. The exemptions some countries have asked for are along the right lines but they are too piecemeal.","1425168101"

If you play games because you like them, other things will be able to periodically take your attention away from them, and you'll be fine with that. Gaming won't be your only interest. You won't tell yourself you play games too much or worry that people will judge your gaming habits, you'll be thinking about how much you like playing games. If you're playing because life sucks, that's something else and the problem isn't the games, but whatever's causing you to not like other things. I say this from experience.

He introduces us and the lady said I was hot within the first few minutes of talking. So my friends and I decide to part ways. We head down to my room to smoke some weed and the lady followed us down. We all listened to music and hung out and eventually all my friends went home. We were alone for 5 min and she was tearing my pants off. As i said i was 16 so the sex was probably terrible for her. If my memory is correct she was 26 at the time.  A week later and this lady basically never left. She was crashing on our couch every night. Probably fell on hard times, but I'm not sure. Anyways, on the way to school my dad asks me if i had slept with the women. I lied and said no. Not sure why I lied he knew I was very sexually active. Saturday morning rolls around and I wake up to her missing from the couch. I pour my cereal, flop down on the couch and start watching some toons. Before I can finish breakfast she comes down the stairs from my fathers room, wrapped in a blanket and nothing else.

"AsianMasculinity","t5_30c2m","I think for OP, since he is at such a critical stage for growth, he should worry much more about whether he is maximizing his growth potential, so it is perfectly reasonable to dirty bulk. I think it is much better than maintaining lean but potentially sacrifice growth. He can cut and reach a more ideal body fat once he is past his puberty growth stage. 

If he is incredibly careful and heavily devoted, he might be able to remain lean and get all his nutrition he needs for growth, but he would have to be a pro at this and devote lots and lots of time, which it doesn't look like his school or his parents would let him.

Also, as a more personal question, how do you get enough protein, on traditional Asian food? I am aiming to get 1g/lb of my body weight each day. Kinda hard with just natural sources. It is much harder with natural Asian staple dishes. Also, why do you drop dairy products, because of the fat?

Daltons law of partial pressure means that as the pressure drops the partial pressure of oxygen drops. The amount of oxygen taken up by the blood is determined by the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. 

At a normal atmospheric pressure the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs is about 13.5 kPa. This gives 99% oxygen binding. If you lower the pressure this drops.

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","Good sound isn't why esports players use the headsets they do. The reason they use certain headsets is preference or sponsorship. What the real story is are the competitive settings available that *mix* certain sounds higher and others lower. This is why you see esports gamers pairing any old headset with astro mixamps and the like. For instance, when I set my astro mixamp to ""esports"", the bells and whistles are toned down and frequencies for things like footsteps are mixed louder. Explosions aren't as rattling, and seperate sounds are made clearer. When I put it in 7.1 mode, it sounds like I'm inside of the game, and explosions and lmgs in battlefield sound like a rambo movie In an imax theater.

Overall 7.1 headsets do incredible things, but esports players are more about functionality and daisy chaining than realism and immersion. My Astros do both. Hope that helps :).","1425168108"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","What I hope you can realize one day is that when you quit watching porn and fapping your brain ""wakes up"", which is the best way I can describe it, and you start to feel real emotions again. You start to actually exist as a person, instead of just being a formless blob, floating through reality. NoFap does not make you successful or interesting or funny or sociable, it just gives you the ability to become those things. It allows you to fully identify your weaknesses and gives you the tools you need to improve yourself. NoFap gives you wood-planks, drywall and construction equipment. It doesn't make you an electrician. It does not make you a plumber. It does not make you an engineer. It doesn't build you a house. Only you can do that. If people that you truly care about are suffering, be the shining light in their life that picks them up from their pit of despair. If your family has issues, be the foundation that they can build a healthier relationship on. If you want to go to school, then go. If you want more friends, go out and find some.

If you want people to care about you, give them something to care about. If you want women you love you, then give them something to love.

Do not get me wrong, I am obviously over-simplifying all of these issues. None of these problems are easy to deal with, and they all require a lot of time and effort to fix. What you need to realize though, is that almost every single person on this subreddit is dealing with these exact same problems, or has dealt with them in the past. You are not alone. You are not the only person that has ever felt this way and you are not the only person that will ever feel this way. Most of us can identify with what you're expressing and we're all here to help.

It's daunting to break free of your constraints and step out into the world, but no one is going to walk for you. No matter how long you stand on your porch, your shoes will never move unless you pick your feet up and take that first step.

Life is not a mission. It has no ""end"". It has no ""success"". You'll never see big green letters appear above your head that say ""You Win!"". You'll always be growing and you'll always be advancing, but that is what makes everything beautiful. There's so much to see and so much to do. Don't let that fill you with dread. Let it fill you with happiness. Be happy that you're never done, and that you always have something to do, and you always have something to accomplish.

Just like Benjamin Franklin once said, ""some people die at 25, but don't get buried until 80"". Luckily enough for you, you are not one of those people. You are not dead. In-fact, you're one of the lucky few that are truly alive.","1425168108"

Dolphins are incredibly social and speak with each other, and they also stay with the same mate for their entire life

I'm not saying that Cats aren't social, and i'm sure there exists cats that are insanely social but overall they are pretty solitary animals that doesn't necessarily even socialize with their own species

Honestly, I spend most of the time researching what to eat. There's so many conflicting theories for what to do in terms of diet it seems.

A consensus I've come to enjoy is to disregard everything within reason as long as you're getting your protein and staying under your calories.

But honestly, I don't even know. Just tried to make a healthy variation on taco pie - switching in ground turkey instead of beef, using healthier tortillas, but suddenly add in a can of black beans and a tiny bit of cheese and the entire recipe went through the roof in sodium haha.

The macros died.
491 Cal, 18.6g Fat, *892.8 Sodium*, *46.6 Carbs*, 40.7g protein.

I mean, to be fair, these are pretty huge servings and I'll be well full but for some reason those numbers being so high just sounds bad to me. I'm far too worried about what I'm eating and I think it's mainly because I just don't know what I need to worry about.

I suggest you seek out Baha'i with parallel goals in general. If you are into outdoor hiking and bike riding - it may be hard for you to spend lots of time with a Baha'i who is working 24/7 with a family to support. This is just my theory. If you are an artists - seek out other Baha'i artists.

"fragrance","t5_2sda0","You've misunderstood the science.  No one said anything about altering molecular structure.  Rubbing certainly changes how the fragrance is released over time.

But most fragrances are oils suspended in alcohol.  Alcohol slowly evaporates at room temperature, and a steady rate of evaporation is what is needed to get the top, middle, and base notes to come out over time.  Rubbing your wrists increases the heat absorbed by the fragrance, increasing evaporation rate and changing the way the scent is released (in particular, the top notes go away faster).

Evaporation is also what causes dabbed perfumes to sometimes smell different from sprayed; a spray increases surface area of the liquid exposed to air as it is sprayed and enabling greater evaporation over just the portion exposed on skin after dabbing.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; People literally rent out places to generate profit

Some do and some don't. A lot of so-called 'owners' rent properties out because they're stuck with a property they can't afford to live in.

This happens a lot as a result of the same fallacy /u/thebassoe is perpetuating: that buying is always better and renting is always throwing your money away. That is simply false, and built upon the myth that these asset prices can only go up. It has been parroted by the real estate lobby (for obvious reasons) and the US government for ages. 

Is buying sometimes smarter? Absolutely. In fact, a majority of the time it probably is. But in a substantial percentage of situations, renting is a far better deal. This is especially true in expensive markets when the potential buyer can't deduct some or all of their mortgage interest due to income-based phaseouts of itemized deductions. It is also very true in markets that are extremely inflated (which I'm happy to admit only becomes clear in the rear-view mirror.) 

Most people buy with mortgages, and most mortgages are interest-only for the first seven years or so. So for the first seven years, you're renting from a bank. And don't give me the ""oh, but interest on a mortgage is [sometimes, for some people] tax-deductible"" as if that could have any hope of offsetting the financial penalties of making a bad investment decision (and that's one of the key things buying is - an investment. Beyond that it's mostly an emotional decision.)

It's like we learned nothing from what happened in the previous decade.

[ETA: /u/DocBrownMusic seems to be saying the same thing.]

There is a big difference between thinking someone is stupid and thinking they aren't as smart as you. Probably the only person Amy thinks is smarter than her is the Doctor. 

Also, hitting does not equal hurting. There is a tendency in New Who fan analysis right now to hold up something so close to their face that they obscure everything else around it before they even begin to break it down to fit it into the conclusion that suits their purpose. I get it, but it only leads to circlejerks.  

Moff likes to write characters whose flaws make them well suited for each other.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","This class is very high on the power curve. As a martial class with some spell back-up, this is hands down above any Paizo written martial class. If you have a player who takes this 3rd party class, make sure that the group does not have any other martials, or they WILL feel overshadowed.

As for having it in a campaign, the dragonrider is fairly easy to work with. It has the potential to be a driving force of a story arc, or a whole campaign for that matter, but it does not necessarily have to be. I'd put it in easy in that regard.

The class is in essence just an excuse to play a dragon. All of the power of the class is funneled into the dragon steed, and the rider can do very little on his own. Especially in the early game.  
Should you wish to attempt to balance the class, you should simply look to add more power to the rider, and remove some from the mount. The latter being the priority.","1425168119"

What makes New Glarus fantastic, though, is their other beers. Their seasonals (Staghorn, Fat Squirrel) are fantastic, and some of their other year-round beers (Moon Man, Two Women) are great. The thumbprint editions are what sets them apart for me, though. 4 times a year, they introduce a limited edition beer that they only make for 3 mos. The best framboise and quadrupelbock I've ever had have been a part of that series.

My wife and I had always talked adoption. And our window of having a baby was closing.

I was always scared to adopt because I always asked myself ""WHAT IF."" What if I were to adopt a child, love him/her with all my heart and then have my own child suddenly. Would I be able to look at the two the same? I thought I would be able to... But was I sure?

The photos thing is weird, and wouldn't hold up for shit, especially if the photos are dated for two years before you even moved in. But it is illegal because if you signed the lease and had paid your first/last month's rent, at that point you've engaged the Residential Tenancies Act **and** your lease, and her refusal to give you the keys based on that bit of horseshit is ... well, breach. 

The snow removal thing is annoying, but not illegal. If it's in your lease, than you are responsible. However, familiarize yourself with the Residential Tenancies Act - Anything that's in your lease that directly contravenes the Act is ILLEGAL, and null and void, and completely unenforceable. The RTA doesn't cover snow removal specifically, so if it's in your lease that you remove snow, you have to remove the snow. 


Post-dated cheques aren't illegal in Ontario, but they can't be a requirement. BUT you can be super annoying right back and ask her for receipts for each one of those cheques, and she does HAVE to do that upon request according to the Residential Tenancies Act.

For fixing things, she's on the hook for that - any appliance or service that is noted in the lease, or was provided as of move-in is her responsibility to maintain.  ","1425168123"

&gt; The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse\: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; A VCS is not for backups. This is not its purpose.

Modern VCSes are kinda schizophrenic regarding their purpose though. That's why we have the whole rewriting history thing in git and controversies about that. When you commit to your local copy you're usually actually saying ""I'm creating a persistent undo point"", and when you squash your commits before pushing you're saying ""this is how my changes should look for anyone browsing the history"".

My imaginary ideal VCS would not have commits at all, it would automatically persist everything you do and back it up as well now and then, and instead of commits it would have tags, two kinds of them even, one sort of local (but still backed up to my centralized server of course) that says ""I'm going to do exploratory work on so and so feature"", and one global, that says that I've implemented so and so feature.

&gt; If I lost my disk drive due to whatever, I would recover my data from the backup server that performs nightly backups of everything.

It's not even about backups really: I have a VM where I test stuff and a server where I code stuff. Pushing code between the two is sort of a pain in the ass unless I commit and push untested stuff to a feature branch I'm working on.","1425168125"

That's not very surprising, seeing as you cannot even comprehend the words ""Deprived"" and ""stealing"".

&gt;A product costs money online,

You can charge for a digital product, sure.

&gt;And you use another service to get it for free

Yup.

&gt;The artist doesn't get the money they **should**.

Bolded the part that you pulled out of your ass. 

Oh, and even assuming that you didn't just pull that out of your ass, it STILL doesn't meet the definition of theft.

I cannot deprive you of something that you never had in the first place. I am not depriving you of money by pirating your work just as I am not depriving bottled water companies by collecting rainwater instead of buying their water. It costs neither of these two parties a single cent when I circumvent them as a seller so I can acquire the same end product at a reduced (or no) cost.


The internet has fundamentally changed the way that people can access information and products. This has caused certain business models to be rendered obsolete. When refrigerators came around decades back, the ice making industry died practically overnight. The only thing current copyright laws is (badly) attempts to criminalize anything that remotely nods towards the fact that certain business models are dying. Imagine a world where fridges were made illegal to save the dying industry of ice making. We are essentially in a world where that is true, only for a different industry instead. If you want to continue making money by creating software, music, books, or anything else that can exist digitally, then you need to adapt to a new market and stop trying to cling to old models. 

One model that very often works is providing a service ontop of your already existing product. You have a book? Print physical copies. You have a game? Add in support for functions like friends lists, server browsers, etc. for legitimate users. You have any kind of software? provide free, easy, automatic updates for legitimate users with useful features. You could write up a damn book on individual methods on how to adapt to this new market instead of trying to latch onto old ideals. The sooner you, and any content creators in general, figures this out, the sooner we can do away with archaic and utterly useless shit like IP.

Most of your peers might not *need* to know how math works, but society would be a whole lot shittier if everyone was ignorant as fuck about everything. 

And trusting teenagers to do decide things is bad. Same with some adults, and not all teenagers, but in general teenagers know less and have less intelligence and capacity to reason. For society to function reasonably well we need everyone to be educated or else we're open to even more issues than we currently are. 

Main point is, I don't think we should trust teenagers or younger to be able to ""deem things necessary"" for themselves, and I wouldn't in general want a parent to be able to completely fuck up their kids life either by making stupid choices for them. ","1425168126"

I wasn't into anime in my teens, I transitioned into manga by then.    
Now in my 20's and I'm into anime with great music and art, stalking Hanazawa Kana, and watching shows depending on the studio.

"navy","t5_2rg06","made in haste? This was a battle cry after the capture of the Chesapeake and one of our more stupid ones at that. It was based on the last order given by Captain Lawrence Don't give up the ship set flame to the magazine. His last order was to kill everyone on board. Lawrence who has just taken command of the Chesapeake weeks before hand had never sailed her in combat. He chose to meet the Shannon who was blockading the harbor. Rather than sailing past her in foul weather has the Constitution had Lawrence chose to meet the Shannon in fine weather, many civilian boats came to watch the fight. As the Chesapeake neared the Shannon the Shannon had the weather gauge , Captain Broke yielded the gauge to Lawrence. Neither Captain made any movements to better their position, as they came up upon each other nearly hull to hull the broadsides began. Nearly all of the officers were killed in the first minutes. Every helmsman that took the wheel was killed by sniper fire until a 20lb ball shattered the wheel. Anyone on the quarter deck was quickly made dead with by marine fire and deck guns. Captain Lawrence in his arrogance had lead his ship and his crew into a trap that they were unprepared for. Broke had been doing daily gun drills in the months it blockaded the harbor. So in the last moments before he died he ordered the ship to be blown up. Neither captain survived this encounter. Later during the war of 1812 on lake Champlain the war cry don't give up the ship was used to honor the loss of the Chesapeake which has been captured and sailed to Halifax. The Colors of the USS Chesapeake are still on display in the English Naval History museum.

* 8 items with broomstick enchantments - 4 practice broomsticks strapped to voldemort and 4 enchanted bones inside Quirinus Quirrell.  Broomsticks can be called by saying 'Up!' and Harry's experiments with the Mokeskin pouch suggest that magical items that respond to voice commands will respond to voice commands in languages other than those spoken by the original caster.  Thus Harry may be able to command those broomsticks while only speaking in Parselmouth.

* 1 wand.  Held in Harry's hand.  Only usable for spells that require no words and no wand movements.  Free transfiguration does not require words and only requires that the wand be in contact with the substance being transfigured.  It may be possible to transfigure Harry's own hand or the tip of the wand itself, depending on the rules of Transfiguration.

* 1 phoenix tail feather.  Harry's wand contains a tail feather from a Phoenix.

* The Cloak of Invisibility.  The Cloak of Invisibility is nearby and Harry has previously demonstrated the ability to mentally and verbally command it.  For the same reasons as the broomsticks, Harry may be able to command the Cloak in Parseltongue.

* Hermione Granger's robes.  They seem fairly inaccessible at the moment, but we have 2 hints from the story: 

Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be used to suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough times, or *Hermione Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips and tied into a rope and used to hang someone*, or Draco Malfoy's robes, which can be used to start a fire - (Chapter 16)

Even so, the most terrible ritual known to me demands only a *rope which has hanged a man* and a sword which has slain a woman (Chapter 74)

* Fawkes.  Fawkes was not with Dumbledore when he was trapped within the mirror.  Harry has previously thought about how to summon a Phoenix by taking on the proper mental state.

* The Sorting Hat.  It can be summoned using the phrase ""Deligitor prodeas"", and Dumbledore was able to summon it without his wand in his hand, though he is capable of wandless magic.","1425168129"

Not at all.  Some actors I work with can only do one voice, it just happens to be one that's extremely useful.

Both seem to be user error, what's the difference and why the different rules?

&gt; Each team captain shall verify that every player on his/her team has finalized their intended game settings
(including runes, masteries, controls, and GUI settings) before GOR is established. Any error in verification is not grounds for a game restart **after GOR is established**.

&gt; A game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has **progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams**. Once a game attains GOR status, the period ends in which incidental restarts may be permitted and a game will be considered as “official” from that point onward.

He paused and noticed the error before it could officially be called a game of record, as there had been no meaningful interaction.

I think those 1m point items are the last to get or should be left to the jackpot. i for one am getting all cards out of silver booster, then gold booster, then ill get the vanity set piece by piece and then maybe a minion or ill be savin up the rest, cause there isnt really anything to buy. or maybe ill use it on chocobo feed, but in no way im going to save up to 1m. median win daily from the mini cactpot is 260, thats only 4000 days of mini cactpot. or if i can win 100% against the imperial soldier thenits 90/min, so only 11111 minutes of endless farming, thats 7.7 days non stop farming. if i farm 6 hours a day i can have the mount in ~30 days. now my win ratio is around 80%, so add another ~8 days. now add in that you can only farm at most 3h per day (due to having a life and such), so it 76 days. so roughly 2.5 months doing nothing but dueling the imperial soldier to get the mount. that is without the cactpot. its not worth it and ppl are already complaining on the official forum.","1425168139"

Not only that the balm accentuates the individual hairs, making the beard appear neater and more defined, if you will.  

Regarding use I would use a balm paired with your oil of choice. Apply oil as usual and then comb through a balm afterwards to finish. I would suggest a balm with a very small amount of beeswax in it for a slight hold. I have found that I do not need to reapply any oil through out the day after using beard balm, best thing I've done for my beard so far.

I highly recommend the beard balm available at marinerjack.co.uk

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Hi, Kelly! Welcome to the *kindest* place on the internet (and yeah, I believe that. I think it *actually* is)!  

Your dog sounds adorable. I have a maltipoo who thinks he's a cat. 

As for books, I have three suggestions to try, in different genres. If one of them works, you'll at least have a starting point. 

*A Walk In the Woods,* by Bill Bryson, is a non-fiction, memoir type humor thing. It's funny, engaging, and quick to draw you into the tale of a middle-aged man who, never having done any real backpacking, decides to hike the Appalachian Trail. He has several other books, on subjects as diverse as the origins of the universe and growing up in the 1950s, and all of them are fun reads. 

Next up, give *The Eye of the World,* by Robert Jordan, a shot. It's the first book in an epic fantasy saga with the sort of typical good-versus-evil theme. If you like it, there are something like 13 or 14 more in that series&gt; The author died before it was finished, and another author, Brandon Sanderson, took over. So, if you enjoy the last few books, he has several books of his own you could read. I haven't read all of his stuff, but the *Mistborn* series is fun. 

Finally, you could try *The Lovely Bones,* by Alice Sebold. It's a crime novel, with a twist, and probably some tears. I cried, anyway. If you're easily triggered by awful things happening to children, maybe give it a pass, but it is an amazing book, and there are several others that have come out in recent years which fit with that theme.

They are the ones who have devastated Iraq and are now bombing Syria. 

The working class must develop its own independent politics and mobilize its enormous strength to take on the police-security apparatus. here is the [socialist view](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/02/27/pers-f27.html) of the causes and solution to the CPD black site. ","1425168144"
"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","This one definitely felt like the ""We're running out of money"" episode. It was almost like they wrote the finale first, and then crafted this episode based on what they'd be able to do with the remaining funds. This is especially evident from the fact that the big ""chase scene"" is just walking up and down the same alley a couple of times. It works well, though, because the character interaction is so strong, especially between Mickey and Rose. And as other people have said, the dinner scene between the Doctor and the Slitheen was good as well.

Looking at benchmarks for 4k with 780ti SLI, you aren't going to consistently get above 60fps in most games. 4K monitors can also have some UI scaling issues too.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Gravity team comp and draft needed a lot of work. So lets say you have your heart set on running Hec and Viktor. What does nidalee/graves/morg add to that team now? Graves has burst to finish off people, but no frontline to speak of with nidalee and hecarim, meaning his low range would put him at too much risk and turn any engage into an all in. If nidalee was a j4 and graves was a sivir/jinx this team would be much better. If the morg was a soraka/lulu/karma or even nami this team would have been much better.
 Lulu works the best because she can entirely hide this team comp from liquid. Open draft with sivir/jinx or lulu/nami and there is no indicator of what direction you are going. OR take the reksai/j4 because you need a front liner for mid game while hec rushes triforce. Picking either of the solo laners or the jungler early in the draft before was committing way too much.

edit: I mean at least wait till you see enemy jungler before you go without flash top lane. Reksai obviously has good gank paths, so not running flash is going to require strong 2 v 2 and jungler camp to get the ball rolling, but you cant countergank a reksai with tremor sense. ","1425168149"

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","My thinking is that anyone could be sent to Azkaban in Sirius' place, and they'd be there in Sirius' place rather than Peter's regardless of which one of them is the death eater.

Though, I suppose if Peter is the death eater, he'd be more likely to get Sirius imprisoned than Sirius would, and correspondingly less likely to get a fake Sirius. If Sirius is alive and good, he's unlikely to leave a fake imprisoned; and if Sirius is dead, why would anyone go to the effort of imprisoning a fake?

So Sirius does seem more likely, I guess, but I'm still on the fence. I'd like to know how this change happened. The fic may not be strict SPOD, but turning a hero into a death eater seems like it needs some justification.","1425168150"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","You're comparing two random bottles and asking about price. that is irrelevant. I've had a couple of two buck chucks I've enjoyed and if I was in a blind tasting might think they are more expensive. I will say the majority of cheap $5 wines suck - overly sugary inducing massive hangovers, no balance, terrible mouthfeel etc. 

There is constantly this anti-wine tirade on reddit which blows my noodle. It's absolute lunacy. I'm not suggesting that the average person can tell what soil a grape came from just by blind tasting - but a master somm can. 

To be clear - you can easily tell the region with enough practice but only if they wine isn't a total outlier. A somm isn't literally tasting soil in their wine - they are determined with a reasonable certainty that due to the qualities of the wine they are tasting (minerality, mouthfeel, acidity, tannins, etc.) that there is a likelihood the grapes grew in a certain set of conditions. There are always exceptions to the rules ergo we have great headlines about how some group of somm's were bested into believing they were drinking a red when they were drinking a warm white. 

Again - I'm sure you can tell the difference between Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, off brand, fountain, bottled, mexican coke, canned, etc. so why does it seem so foreign to you that twenty years training, studying and working in the wine industry might not lend someone a keen understanding of wine? One again: not everyone will be able to tell that the grapes in X bottle were grown surrounded by strawberry fields. Maybe someone can. Maybe for that bottle it is just a gimmicky BS made for marketing. 

Ultimately, I enjoy tasting. I like going a couple times a year to the local wine room with my girlfriend, trying a bunch of stuff we've never had and trying to guess what the flight notes say about each taste before we read them. We're getting better at making those guesses and determining what type of wines were in our flight each time. We never get a perfect score (so to speak) but it is a fun hobby and it helps me to refine why I like the small group of bottles I buy frequently and reminds me why I enjoy wine in general.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt; Australia could be an amazing place for cycling if the government would stop being so shit. But I guess that can be said about many other things.

Its not the govt, its the citizens.

The problem with aussies is, we all think we are kings/queens and that everyone should respect ME first and foremost and well everyone can go to hell.

So when it comes to things like co existing and trying to compromise on things like bike riding on roads no one wants to give u their throne so we get this stupid divide.

The suburban driver who hates the smug cyclists and perceves them as slowing them down on congested roads and who see's the bike rider as the inner city latte sipping lefty.

And then you get the other half, the ones who think they are being all proper (riding a bike in 2015 in inner northern melbourne is about being seen as being green and caring abut the environment) who cannot feel but act superior towards drivers, usually the PIA hipster type.

So when these two groups meet they try and out do each other in who is more entitled.

Australian society is very sick..like a bloated American actually. No one seems to want to get along and no one seems to want act nice towards each other. There is this perception that aussies are friendly people, thats so false because at face value we whip out our fake smiles and then mutter something cuntish under out breath about the person.","1425168156"

That is until you try to power an iron, vacuum cleaner, oven, microwave, refidgerator ... all of those things we really wouldn't have had, had Edison's DC ruled the day.

Your debunking of the quote is almost worthless. ""Edison did no have that kind money laying around""... yeah he did. Tour guides at his Winter Park Florida home gloat how Edison's ticker-tape invention netted him nearly $50,000. His consolidation of patents on the light bulb allowed him to create GE which had a monopoly on light bulbs for a good long time. Edison might have been joking, but there's an equal chance a better man would have been serious.

"SMITEGODCONCEPTS","t5_2xy2u","I would love for Chronos to have a better passive (and a better kit in general; he's basically a hunter that is only considered a mage due to being magical and a forced ability-reliance to get the damage output he needs to compete with other hunters.)

Although my one concern with this is it seems more suited for a defensive character. For a character to have all of these protections and sustain boosts, one would think the character plays like a tank in that he is supposed to absorb a lot of damage, although in reality Chronos is quite squishy and relies on aggressive skillshots and speed swings. That being said, I would not be opposed to this general idea of per-ability buffs, or potentially reworking Chronos into a guardian, because as the ruler of titans he should have a bit more presence within the fight (not quite sure if that is the same Chronos, classical mythology is odd like that, but the point still stands, time is a very powerful thing, and a representation of such should be feared a little).","1425168157"

Have everything you can documented. This is a health issue and the RA should not be dealing with this it should be elevated to university administrators. 

(I'm assuming RA's are students and RD's are commonly a mix between graduate students and professional staff, either way go to deans and throw a fit in the most professional way expressing how you are just looking for help, going in with the help me help me attitude has made life easier for me when dealing with school admins) ","1425168160"

(exept the starting area). getting the actual game its the best way to start you got all the expension up to mist of pandaria (1-90). i feels like so much people are missing out some of the best place/content in WoW cause of the lvl 90 boost like northrend or pandaria i feels bad for those people.

But for the love of god, do not accept any philosophy that describes the motivations of ""women in general"". People do make value judgments when they decide who to have sex with, and yes there are some broad qualities that increase your value.

 But thinking that there's one magic key to the way all women think is insane. Women and men want different things at different times for different reasons. 

The links you posted are an unverifiable story about a deranged woman, and an article about the importance of self confidence warped to fit a TRP agenda.

Think of the low hanging fruit of women as plates; slump busters to keep you in pussy and build an abundance mentality from which you can boldly reach for that higher hanging fruit *right now.*  Thinking you have to postpone making a move until something-something is an easy mental trap to fall into, whether in love, business, friendship, and all manner of human relationships.

"television","t5_2qh6e","Even Stevens was entertaining. Great... I can't agree. It's your basic family comedy *shrug*. It's nothing new honestly. I fail to see how it did anything new honestly (ok, we have a family. We have the studious older sister who is serious and of course the younger male sibling who is obnoxious. The only original thing is the sister wasn't so worried about shoes and what she looked like. I will say thinking about it, that was refreshing). Kinda like ""Good Luck Charlie"" except I think GLC is a lot more charming than Even Stevens (though the brother in GLC got a lot less amusing when he was no longer so little... it's like they lost the inspiration for that character).

Ned's had a lot more zany/amusing characters and went more on randomness type humor which appeals to me a lot more honestly (Though I do like cheesy family sitcoms too).

And, while Even Stevens wasn't a bad show (I just wouldn't put it as original or great, just entertaining), I can't forgive it for introducing Shia to the acting world. That's the only show I didn't want to bitchslap his character in (his character kinda fit for what they wanted, an obnoxious little brother). Every other thing he's been in that personality just comes off as an insufferable brat. And he can't do anything different. It really makes it seem like he's really just playing himself cause he has no range at all (I think even Brad Pitt might have more range... and Brad Pitt also is only good if you are going to typecast him cause he has little range. And at least his character he plays isn't near as obnoxious).","1425168165"

It's alot to pin your hopes on a medicine that has only one miracle cure story, but it's nice to know it can be done. I don't believe it will, and it's good it hasn't spread yet.

So I ask them to send me back the quest, and that I'd create it. They send me a Kill 2 Yian Garuga Lv6 quest... I ask for HR Garuga, like we were doing, since I need beaks (in my room), and low garuga is only good for tails. So someone pick that Lv6 quest and people start following him.

There is no need to continue this conversation, you have decided to do personal attacks. Ignorance isn't a demeaning term, stupid is. There is a distinct difference between being ignorant on a subject and being stupid. That being said I never called you ignorant (nor stupid for that matter), I said that taking a 100% far right or 100% far left of the topic is ignorant. To my knowledge you do not take a far right, or left position.

It's also quite funny that you continue to say, ""child"" without identifying your own age, which I did prompt you for. This is a common thing for young children from the Call of Duty franchise to say when they get, ""Salty"" or ""Sour."" That plus your grammar and spelling leads me to believe that you yourself are around the age of 16. 

P.S. 

The total list is: Vile, Spiteful, Depraved, a ""little child,"" Dumbass.

Yes, grammar can work like that, but it isn't necessary in that situation, you can reword the sentence to not be condescending, or just abstain from putting it in.

If you can't think of where to go, try writing a scene with a character you haven't even thought of prior to writing. A lot of times I'll do that and it'll work itself out. Then those characters can be kept. Or they were just there to get the juices flowing and can be excised in the rewrite.

Doing an outline is the smarter and better way to write but it doesn't work for me. To each his own I suppose.

Most of these top-tier authors / scientists are concerned about solving the physics / dynamics of the model, not with the efficiency of the numerical code (computing wise). And I totally respect that - the scientific part is a freaking pain in the ass to solve, let alone translate into a working computer code!

But WRF has matured quite a bit in terms of computational *easiness*. Many of the hacks and hard-coded stuff are still there, but the makefile auto-config has been fine-tuned greatly, and its capable of creating fully working makefile configs most of the time, with mild to strong optimizations (specially when compiling with intel compilers). That's where the guys that work with development in mind get to make a difference, making the model compile with a wide range of *nix/compilers matches and work in parallel non-homogeneous systems.

All it does is show me just how poorly my employer understands me, and what I want in a job. I live far below my means and additional income doesn't really affect me at all.

This has backfired so horribly I will in the near future resign, and dick around for a while as I look for other opportunities. The money I banked from my current employer's misguided attempts at making me stay is ironically what's giving me the financial security to not have to worry about income for a upwards of a year 

I'm leaving because of issues with corporate culture, general dickwadery in the management structure, and a lack of room for personal growth. This could of course all be remedied, but that would require a scary amount of *actual change*. Not particularly likely to happen :-/","1425168184"

Didn't happen. The New Black Panthers in that infamous case were in an almost exclusively black neighborhood and they didn't prevent anyone from voting.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I agree with btown.  The customers I have using ShareFile (like dropbox) are very small architect offices....where they don't share the data very often amongst each other, and they don't have enough data for it to be a concern taking up local storage.

BrendanLead...if the local storage issue is where the dropbox/sharefile solution falls short, in order to do what you're wanting, you might seriously look at a proper VDI solution, including proper implementation of the GPU's on that solution.  Someone giving you Win7/8 on regular server hardware without the proper GPUs is not going to work well.  

The basic idea is, the data stays local to the system you're accessing (your VDI desktop), but since it's in the cloud, it's available to you anywhere.  As long as the provider has the proper hardware backing it up, you should be able to have 3D capabilities &amp; such via NVidia Grid cards, etc.

My company has delivered this type of solution before...it can be done without a doubt....but you need to be ready for the price.

From the hosting providers point of view, you have to have dedicated hardware for those desktops.  That alone will raise the price significantly.  (win7/8 desktop OS requires dedicated hardware per tenant)  That doesn't mean you have to purchase it outright, but just know that the economy of scale that keeps regular hosted servers pricing in check doesn't apply in this VDI scenario.

Moving back from that, when we've used ShareFile, we've selectively sync'd certain folders.  Yes, the total size of data for those firms can get huge, but they're only syncronizing certain directories down locally to their PCs, so the local storage stays in check.","1425168184"

I really wish PMBR handled many of its newcomers differently.  Characters like Charizard,Ivysaur, Squirtle, Lucas, Pit, Dedede, Ike, Olimar, ROB, Snake, and Sonic would've been perfect to turn into fastfallers.  They don't have melee mains that wish they were more similar to melee, they weren't prominent characters in comp Brawl, why not make them fastfallers?


Say what you want about being salty because of Fox, but fastfallers are the most fun character to combo.  Floaties aren't fun to play against.

"history","t5_2qh53","I read more about the KAL case and here is what Osipovich could have done:   
a) fly up to the cockpit of the 747 and flash the navigation lights on his fighter to show that the KAL flight penetrated the Soviet airspace - he didn't do it - there is no evidence of the Korean pilots spotting the fighter jet on the CVR.   
b) shoot a burst of the cannon - he did that, however the ammo belt did not contain any tracer rounds, so the Korean pilots could not have seen them.   
Then, however, there was a fatal coincidence - after the cannon burst was fired, the KAL flight was cleared to climb to a higher altitude. Because of that it slowed down, which caused the fighter jet to overshoot it. Osipovich interpreted it as an evasive maneuver, and repositioned his plane to fire the missiles. At the time the Boeing was nearing the international airspace again, so Osipovich pulled the trigger on the missiles. One missed, second hit the tail causing a decompression and destroying most of the hydraulic and electrical systems, making the plane unflyable.    
As to allegation of the 747 being a spy plane - it would not be surprising. Boeing modifed the 707 to the RC-135 variant, so my guess is the Soviets thought the 747 was also modified and was later disguised as a passenger airliner. Osipovich, the pilot of the fighter, to this day claims that he shot down a spy plane.","1425168187"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Peak oil is not a myth, you just haven't actually examined what people are actually talking about. Peak oil is not about oil extractions stopping overnight because there is none left. It's about the implications of less oil coming out of the ground year after year and the implications of that on an economy that requires growth, growth in economic activity that relies on fossil fuels.

And no, renewables do not just fall in and replace oil, they can't scale up to ever produce as much energy as we do now using fossil fuels, and doing so would in itself require massive inputs of fossil fuels to achieve it. When you consider any object you need to consider the embodied energy it in, the coal required to produce the steel, or electrolyse the aluminium, the fuel required to operate the mining equipment, the natural gas required to produce the fertiliser to feed the workers which mine the ore to produce the metal to produce the windmill.

Try to replace just those things with renewables and you hit bottlenecks. You could produce the ammonia required for the fertiliser using electrolysis but then you have to add that onto the amount of electricity you need to produce, on top of all the electricity we already use etc. etc. etc.

Declining fossil fuel production results in economic contraction, results in unserviceable debt, results in default, results in collapse.

That is peak oil.","1425168189"

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","1) I think the might have him at more than trespassing.  Like, what was he planning to do?  I think they probably have him on burglary on the basis of entering a place with the intent to commit a felony (whether theft of property or harm of a person.)  Maybe that will make her feel better.  This would be easier to prove if he tried to do something.

2) I think you've got to talk to her about staying there.  She needs to deal with this fear to get on with her life, wherever you live.  Especially snce nothing all that bad happened.  Do you have a deadbolt in addition to the handle lock?  Start using that religiously.  Lock the windows.  Maybe get one of those hotel door alarms that they sell.  A gun might not be the best, but maybe some pepper spray/ Mace would be a good idea.  Maybe a self defense course.  

3) Then, look into how dangerous where you live actually is.  How many burglaries are there a year in your neighborhood.  In my city you can find that info block by block.  The answer is that there probably are not that many.  You hear about all the bad scary stories on the local news, but it really isn't that dangeroud.  

4) Get to know the neighbors.  I feel more secure when I'm alone at home when I know that the neighbors know me and think of me as a person etc.  I also feel safer that I know who they are and trust them a little.

Nada contra a Dilma, mas ela não tem força política para controlar a ala questionável do PT. Eu sinceramente acho que a solução para o sistema presidencialista seria ter sempre alguém **neutro** (ideal) ou em oposição ao Presidente da República como presidente da Câmara porque evita abusos.

Pelo menos o ânimo da população não está muito bom para tolerar esse tipo de desperdício e eu acredito que o Eduardo Cunha deve estar testando os limites dele com esses projetos. Dificilmente essa idéia sai do papel.

Frank and Claire are suddenly less ruthless, less clever and more prone to 'act out', plot lines play out in a way they would not have in previous seasons etc. This makes the season quite confusing to watch for me, the rules of the HOC universe have changed, while I expect them to be constant.

"thewalkingdead","t5_2rygv","Yeah, I see what you're saying (here and also in your edit above). In another thread here a week or 2 back, I pointed out that issues 48-50 were when Lori &amp; Judith bought it, and then Carl -- thinking his dad was dying -- decided he would be able to go on without him. But Carl wasn't ready to survive with no family.

I think those who believe the series is Carl's story are half-right and that it's a story of a father &amp; a son. Once Rick dies, the series loses that. If Rick's written out (as he has mostly been this arc) without dying, they can still dip into their relationship from time to time. Kinda like soap operas do with aging actors.

Is Maggie nearing the chopping block? I dunno if they'll get rid of her, because I think her elevation to a 2nd ""leader among the survivors"" position might also be part of a plan to make Carl the long-term main character. If the book remains Carl-focused, Maggie and Jesus keep the sociopolitical intrigue going, maybe?

Eh I dunno. The book has entertained me more since All-Out War, but I know that isn't true for everyone.","1425168196"

"Nootropics","t5_2r81c","I use phenibut without issue because I set myself a guideline that I must follow. 

**#1** respect this substance or it can kick your ass

**#2** never use it more than twice per week

**#3** never take it two days in a row (try to leave at least a couple of days gap between each dose)

**#4** plan ahead of time and decide what days you want to take it each week (could be a Tuesday and Saturday), or, use it intermittently for high pressure situations (like a job interview)

**#5** it's better to under dose than overdose. If you take too much things can become quite uncomfortable.

If you ever feel like you need to take phenibut to cope with the day, it might be best to consider another substance. Sure, it works, but unlike many of the anxiolytic nootropics, phenibut does carry a significant potential for abuse/withdrawal. **However**, if you do find yourself ignoring all this advice, please set aside enough phenibut so that you can start tapering down your doses and avoid a chunk of withdrawal side effects.","1425168200"

The word emerged because of this homophobia, but it is not always used in a homophobic context.

"SF4","t5_2r4cj","Decapre is fairly new and tons of people play her wrong, she has no vortex. It's extremely important. 

In half the tutorials online people show how her break/pound is safe if timed meaty after being blocked, it is worthless. A delay wakeup makes it unsafe again, a wake up dp makes it unsafe. There is no reason to block on wakeup against an airborne decapre if you delay it. She is not cammy. She has mixups and deals a truck of damage, that is the core of the character. You should apply pressure from the ground and exploit her strenghts.


Scenario 1&amp;2) That's not how the matchup is played, shotos have the best DP in the game and fireballs, not much else. Take away their fireballs and bait the dps, your tools are the EX feint scramble and the chain ""cr.lk cr.lk"" 

The EX feint is completely safe, dps go through your body and ultras get blocked even if they hit on your landing, use that. NOT from afar, from point blank. anytime you cr.mp their torso your mixup starts. That's your ideal position, point blank. blocked mp -&gt;air scramble and it's a guessing game, make your divekicks hit about crossup and they are safe from dps, feint into cr.lk to trap them, do whatever OR and i say OR go for tricks with the ground pound, the pound is worthless. it can be emptyjumped for free. You must throw other things in there or your opponent will bunny hop in place while absolutely safe.

now the cr.lk  cr.lk chain. 
It is bugged. It is not a blockstring as it should and will trap ANYTHING, crouchtechs, dps, jabs, standing grabs, it is amazing. and for whatever reason makes jabs chained from it able to link into sweep albeit pretty tightly.

Akuma is free. You can punish EVERYTHING they do, hop into training mode.

Decapre's charge takes a fraction of the other charge characters, you don't lose anything. Keep in mind however that for whatever reason your sting doesn't autocorrect on some characters, and for that reason CLOSE STANDING MP is your anti crossup. 

Scenario 3) stHk is death. don't do that. don't be afraid of being grabbed and do your best with standing mk, cr.HP and the target combo to break focuses


There are popular decapres with a truck of PP that play with tricks, they still play her wrong, everyone will catch up on decapre tech later on like everyone catched up with rose tech. Speaking of which, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwxw0iSC9w watch that.

I am a DSL technical support helpdesk supervisor.
My job is to sit at home browsing reddit and playing video games for $12.25 per hour until a technical support agent messages me with a question or has a call that goes over 10 minutes. Then I just tell them what to do to complete the call as quickly as possible while doing everything we can towards correcting a customer's issue. Occasionally I talk to customers if we get too busy and calls start to queue up or I get assigned a supervisor call. Sometimes I have some paper work to do. I also get some sales commissions if I sell antivirus or other soft-services to customers. I get full health and dental LOTs of paid time off and the christmas bonus checks are huge. I live a relatively simple life so my bank account is constantly full of more money than I really know what to do with.

Of course this is after spending most of my life in this 70%. 4 years working in restaurants and then 5 years of working as a first level tech support agent. I never thought I would actually enjoy my job.

My point is that great jobs are out there and you shouldn't settle for less. If you dont like a job quit and find a new one. I quit dozens of jobs before finding the right one.","1425168201"
"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Well because if you take a large enough group (and for America that group would be about the size as Senate and Congress are now, or a little larger) then you will get people who are representative of the opinion of people with a very small chance of really over-representing or under-representing any group. Like, statistically speaking, they will reflect the views of the average person. You will end up with a few really extreme people or irrational people, but the odds of them over-representing the general population of extremists or irrational people by a significant margin is low by having a large sample size. So yeah there's probably gonna be some nuts but there won't be many and they'll be drowned out in favor of the rational majority.

As for corruption, yeah it's still gonna happen but I think by less than any other form of election because it's just an average person. You don't need to throw a ton of money at ads to get elected, you just have to happen to exist and get a bit lucky. The group of sortition-elected people's views will reflect the views of the majority, because they are a sampling of the majority. I also believe that it may help reduce party lines, which are mostly just to get elected, and nobody has to just worry about reelection. 

And FYI sortition election is by most definitions a democracy (though some say it's not).","1425168202"

"talesfromthelaw","t5_31n76","Maybe an actual Computer Scientist can weigh in on this, but it doesn't sound that way to me.  We're talking about a process which is clearly designed to be as cheap as possible, yet the rank-and-file reviewers still all need to have law degrees to be effective.  That tells you the reviewers aren't just looking for key terms (which *would* be trivial to automate) they actually need to *comprehend* what they're reading.  In a natural language.  As used by a different set of human writers each time.

Would this be an *interesting* graduate-level CS research project?  Absolutely.  Is this a great example of an occupation that should be automated away to relieve human suffering?  Maybe (how are all of the marginally-employable law grads going to eat and pay rent while they try to get their careers going?).  Would a computer ""be really good at"" this?  Not reliably enough that a human wouldn't have to double-check their work (which defeats the point).  Not until AI makes a couple of big leaps.

In fact, all night long I was telling a girl her boyfriend was fine, and that the odds of him being one of the few shot compared to how many people were in the club were astronomical.  In the morning I had to call her and tell her he was shot and killed.

Dental care is covered in Italy, but it is basic. It won't cover straightening unless it's something that actually impairs mastication. Sure won't cover whitening. But dental care is an exception, since most of it is aesthetic, and so won't be covered. Everything that will impact health is covered.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","I find the arguments about relevancy in this thread to be really weird. Relevancy has nothing to do with an artist's sales, or whether people still listen to them today. It has to do with popularity some, sure, but for an artist to be relevant, there has to be a balance of popularity, innovation, trendiness, probably other factors as well. 

Sure, a recent Lionel Richie album sold well, but one would assume this was because of the plethora of modern country artists that were featured on it, as well as it basically being a greatest hits album. Even if one argues that Richie was working with modern artists, modern pop country is a genre that's arguably all fluff and little substance, and which caters to a large audience which desires authenticity and nostalgia in their pop music over anything else. 

An example of a celebrity who has fought irrelevancy in recent years has been Paul McCartney; his collaborations with Kanye have given him new relevancy. Kanye is an artist who is still and extremely relevant artist in pop culture, someone who in recent years has still created musical trends, and still delivers controversial and talked about dialogue. Working with Kanye shows that McCartney is in touch, or that he knows how to appear in touch, with modern music, and that he still has room for experimentation in his artistry. 

I kind of went on a tangent there, but it felt good to get my thoughts out. Sorry for the block of text!

TL, DR: Relevancy has less to do with sales and more about being in touch with modern music. ","1425168208"

"canada","t5_2qh68","From the perspective of a Canadian practitioner, I can tell you that you'll hear a mixture of horror stories and successes. Some people get failed by the system for a variety of reasons.

The public system, in my mind, creates a host of positive and negative social effects. On one hand, essential care is fucking free bud. I'm kind of proud of that. Lots of Canadians are, actually. It separates us from you shit-ass yanks across the border. It shows a certain level of giving a fuck.

A totally public system is also motherfucking expensive and unequally distributed in how it's paid for by taxpayers. A public system also gives the government a vested interest in controlling certain aspects of the market. For example, the price of drugs. This can lead to shortages, shortfalls in care, and absolute clusterfucks.

Another frightening issue altogether is medical malpractice in Canada. In my experience, an alarming number of doctors receive protection from prosecution by groups like the OMA. 

That being said, I would still never support abandoning public health care in Canada. I just think we need to let a second tier open up.","1425168209"

I have good days and bad days.  This past year has been the roughest even since before I got diagnosed.  I just had a permanent IV line installed last week (PICC line) to do hydration therapy as kind of a ""Hail mary"" because we were out of good ideas.  We're one week on and it seems to be helping.  
Because I have the mastocystic enterocolitis I spend a lot of time in the restroom.  It's similar to ulcerative colitis.  I know pretty much every restroom in town.  (yay)  
I have degenerative disc disease caused by mast cell infiltration of the bones in my spine.  That causes pain and loss of movement.
I have bone pain from the bone marrow involvement of the disease.  
I joke that I'm allergic to the world.  Things that were perfectly fine yesterday are not fine today.  Mast cells regulate the allergic system, and my mast cells are on crack, so they do what they want.  I'm allergic to chemical scents and perfumes, cleaners, lots of foods, I am triggered by heat and cold, I can be triggered by sounds and flashing lights.  I carry a carbon filter mask with me that I wear often. 

The misdiagnosis' were an ovarian cyst, celiac, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Crohn's.  Crohn's was the closest and was what led us to the mastocystic enterocolitis diagnosis.  The GI did a colonoscopy and biopsy and found high proliferation of mast cells.  After having the ME diagnosis I was able to find a specialist who diagnosed me with Systemic Mastocytosis.","1425168210"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","To answer your questions in order, yes, peeling for your carries is better than killing theirs. When playing against zed, run exhaust and use it when he ultis on your carry. If they are going to die to his deathmark, be sure to use mikaels on them to heal. When playing against Vi, just kite her. Flay her, slow her, whatever. Your team should be able to chunk her down before she can kill your carry. One thing that Vis tend to do is go too ham. they will dive too far without their team; abuse that. And to change your mindset, do not play on the front line unless your team has no tank. You should be letting your tanks/bruisers stay in the front while you sit back with your carries and peel.

[Daryl](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DERIV8Y/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_dAL8ub0R62TDF)  was a little more expensive, probably due to his popularity. He came with a knife (and holster), the poncho, the crossbow, and 4 bolts. One bolt comes ""loaded"" and the other three fit on the underside of the crossbow.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","&gt;Ontario Union holds the 2nd most amount of stocks in Canada

Yeah, except unions can't even strike anymore without being hit by back-to-work legislation. Union-busting has been center-stage for decades.

&gt;Good earn your money through hard worth and innovation

Yeah, that's not how the world works. Not everyone can be an innovator. Not everyone can even work in the first place. That's why we have the welfare state, in order to provide and protect those who cannot protect and provide for themselves.

&gt;The reason rich people are rich is, because they earned their wealth through hard work and effort.

Many people who work hard do not become rich because of sheer chance and sociological factors.

&gt;People seem to think that rich people are thefts who steal and poor people are saints who have been screwed over by the rich, this isn't true at all people know a days have such an entitlment issue it's sad. 

It's not that the rich are thieves, many want to eradicate poverty. However, I think many suffer from a disconnect with the struggles of the poor and the working class, so they're unable to formulate a reasonably balanced opinion. Alternatively, they don't care and only want to become richer. Most lie somewhere in between these two positions.

&gt;They want government to give them everything they need guess what we live in a world of finite level of goods earn your piece of the pie.

I don't think asking our government to assist those who are down on their luck, those who have been victims of systematic oppression, or those who simply need healthcare is entitlement. Asking for basic needs is not greed, it is a human right.

&gt;Go to university and major in somthing that is in Demand don't go to school for socialgy their are enough people with that degree it's sad....tale business, chemistry, and math those jobs are in high demand

Most of the jobs in the hard sciences require a masters, and in addition, academia is facing cuts across the board in Canada. Business majors aren't immune to recession. Their is no ticket to success in terms of major, major in your passion. Those who are passionate will always outperform those who go into it for a paycheck. Also, if you major in math without a passion for math, you will be utterly destroyed by the workload. Math majors have an insane passion for what they do, something I could never achieve.

&gt;Save money, even if you have to get a loan you can save money I did it and it works fine.

If you have to take out a loan to save money, you're not saving money.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Except the telecoms didn't build and maintain infrastructure with their own money and capital. They built it with the help of $600 billion in direct subsidies from the federal government.

That is like trying to argue that farmers don't farm and maintain their own farms, even though they get billions in agricultural subsidies every year. Subsidies are not transfers of ownership rights, and if you hate subsidies (as I do) then you place the blame on the Government that hands them out. 

&gt;They are completely violating what customers signed up for. The customers sign up for internet service with no expectations that their experience will differ based on online services.

That is a contract issue to be settled by a court, not a massive ""OMGBBQ Lets give the FCC massive power to regulate an industry hur dur"" issue. If a person doesn't get a service that they contract for, then the proper course of action is lawsuit followed by termination of service and resumption of service with a different provider. If you have an issue with court costs and accessibility of legal services, then that is also a problem with Government that would have to be addressed separately. 

&gt;They actually have been a problem for most of the last ten years. Comcast and Verizon have been caught and sued multiple times for throttling all sorts of traffic.

That is fine. Let it work its way through the Courts then.

&gt;The FCC Act of 1934 explicitly made AT&amp;T a de facto monopoly

It is hilarious that you admit that the explicit purpose of the FCC is to facilitate monopolization of the telecom industry, and yet this is the agency you turn to to help us give consumers more choice and better quality? Are you joking or just stupid? 

&gt;That might be what you think is the only real solution, but that's not an alternative on the table.

It **is** the solution, but it isn't currently on the table because the telecom industry, politicians and FCC have no incentive to reduce their own power. 

&gt;You're making perfect the enemy of good.

You tell me: what is the moral status of a man of only “moderate” integrity? 

You are rolling over for bad even though you know what the true good is, because you find fighting for the true good simply too ""unworkable"" and ""difficult."" It is not on the table, so oh well guess there is nothing we can do but abandon principle and settle for the bad. That is far more morally abhorrent to me. ","1425168217"

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Hey there, I'm just going to respond here because my biggest gripe about looking for a tracker is similar to what /u/MrsSpice said (I really want to track my micronutrients).

Calories: The general population cares mainly about calories, and it seems that most the calculators only cater to this. That said this does seem like a requirement. I want to say MyFitnessPal lets you set up a caloric goal in the beginning setup, based on weight and activity.

Macros: Macros are important to a lot of people. To be honest, I don't really focus too much on percentages, other than making sure each meal has some of each. I know there are some communities that focus very heavily on this, especially with ""bulk"" and ""cut"" regimines. So, there are groups that will find this important, and you may want to ask those circles about what they'd like to see here.

Micros: This is the reason I only used MyFitnessPal two days. It was super shitty for gaining any knowledge about my micro nutrient intake. I think it showed Vitamins A, D, C...and Iron? It was an incredibly short list, and really disappointing. I'd really like to see all my micro nutrient %s based on my caloric intake. I would like if the app highlighted nutrients that were particularly low, and if I could tap on that nutrient to view detailed information, particularly to view what foods were good sources of this nutrient. Micronutrients are important to fewer people I think, and so it seems many of the calculators don't pay much attention to these. But hey, this could be where you have a niche market! 

I know a common feature is to be able to use a bar scanner to scan packages. I think most the people in this community eat few foods that come prepackaged like this, but I have seen other people comment that they like this feature.

A really important thing as you said is that it be easy to use. With MyFitnessPal, looking items up the first time was annoying, but it looked like it was pretty easy to copy over items that you had eaten previously. As I said, I didn't use it long, so maybe it wasn't as easy as it could be. I tend to make certain meals over and over again though, and eat from a set ""menu"" of foods for the most part. Being able to quickly add foods from ""My Menu"" would streamline the app.

Also, as you said, being able to categorize information to prevent information overload and to easily navigate between pages/tabs/menus is important. I'd come up with a draft that helps you organize the information and figure out how to present it before coding too much.","1425168223"

Nicaragua is not a common-law country as far as I know.  It *probably* follows civil law and the Roman-derived concept of property.  In some such countries (Mexico, notably) private land ownership isn't really possible.  You can own the right to occupy the land, and own the right to its ""fruits"", but the Mexican government owns the actual land itself and must be involved in any attempts to sell or transfer the other rights.

Maybe the explosion *reminded* him (???), but he suddenly had info about Bethany, and his 4B partner Mona ""found"" the tapes that sound *a lot like Mona's inner mind* (and Mona's a known voice imitator). But the ""duh"" moment for me is that A was hanging out with horse stable guy who juiced up the ""rich lady came out with crazy girl"". We KNOW (and have seen many times) A bribes TF out of locals to relate lies to the Liars, and they comply, whether through greed or fear.

So I think that whole Jessica-cheating thing was BS. And if **that's** the case, Ezra and Mona BOTH lied about Bethany. But I don't know why. I know Eddie Lamb's gone, and his last *known* contact was Ezra. (Of course, E Lamb may have taken a cash bribe and left, too.)

That got me thinking, *we don't know Bethany made those Jessica drawings.* Spencer noted that Bethany made regular art class drawings (vases, jars, etc), then started adding in some really strange stuff, **clearly out-of-order** (Marion's death from ..freakin 7 years ago, then the Jessica-is-evil drawings, the last one being the monster and Jessica watering the rose garden that Eddie delivered *to Ezra*)? Strange.

(Though we should surmise that **somebody** who hated Jessica on a personal level made those drawings.)

""*Bethany*"" is just a body dug up, autopsied, and identified as ""Bethany Young, Radley patient."" I'd ***guess*** she was A's friend she ""had"" to kill, and that Alison (the twin WE know) really doesn't know a Bethany. *Cece would.* A did. But Alison didn't; she didn't write about this girl in her diary, nothing — that should have been a clue, since Ezra/Mona had Ali's diary and, for a girl who *supposedly* played such a big part in Alison's psyche, why didn't she write ONE WORD about her?

It's odd.

So yeah sadly, I think Bethany is ""nobody"" -- nobody important to the story. I doubt *Alison* knows *the name*! (Maybe I've missed a scene, but I don't recall anyone asking Alison about Bethany *at all*, so I can't recall where to judge her reaction, if any.)

**tl/dr:** Bethany's a random friend of A's who Alison (twin) had never heard of her (any more than the rest of us lmao).","1425168227"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I agree with the rest of your post so I'll focus on this bit:

&gt;Why? Voluntary fighting or obligatory fighting? Did it make sense for voluntary combat to be sexist in the past? What about obligatory combat? What's technologies have eliminated the basis for that sexism?

Obligatory fighting exclusively. There is no ""fairness"" to be gained by restricting who can voluntarily join the military, at least not that I can see. But if women feel that increasing the number of women who join is necessary for their purposes (ie the same way they do in tech), that's fine with me too. Either way, really.

&gt;Did it make sense for voluntary combat to be sexist in the past? What about obligatory combat?

Yes, in large part because women were expected to stay home and care for the children. If women are no longer needed to stay home and care for the children, as you pointed out, that takes away a huge portion of the reason for sexist conscription laws.

&gt;What's technologies have eliminated the basis for that sexism?

As I said before, the same ones that erase women's need to stay home with children. Or, if you want to talk about a fear that too many women will die and we won't be able to reproduce anymore, then there's a different answer. An increase in weapons technology, particular nukes, has all but guaranteed that a war on the scale of WW1 or WW2 cannot happen again without nuclear apocalypse. This restricts us to small-scale, proxy wars, which won't become serious enough to make your concern an issue. Including women in any drafts for these wars, then, benefits society both in terms of equity, and in terms of motivating politicians to avoid such proxy wars in the first place, and loses us next to nothing.

In the highly unlikely case of such a war happening, again we wouldn't be sending pregnant women or women with young children to war. This would motivate a rise in pregnancies and keep the birth rate high anyway, while also assuring that our society isn't wiped out. 

A last factor is the increasing age we send people to war. If we don't send anyone under 18 to war, we have 18 years of conflict before we'd really start to feel a hit to the population. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, no serious conflict could last 18 years in modern times, so we'd always have a buffer we could use to replenish the population afterwards (even in this impossible apocalypse scenario).","1425168228"

"WhiteRights","t5_2rjto","&gt; Jewish Involvement in Shaping U.S. Immigration Policy 
Jewish Chronicle, the principle Jewish newspaper in England, opposed restriction on Commonwealth immigration in an editorial in the October 20, 1961 edition (p. 20). The editorial noted that Jews perceived the 1905 legislation as directed against them and stated, ""all restrictions on immigration are in principle retrogressive steps, particularly for this country, and a disappointment to those throughout the world who would like to see the limitations on the freedom of movement reduced rather than increased. The issue is one of moral principle."" 

&gt;**During the 1970s the Conservative Party opposed immigration into Britain because, in the words of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain was in danger of being ""swamped"" by peoples who lacked ""fundamental British characteristics"" (Alderman 1983, 148).** Conservative politicians attempted to obtain Jewish support on this issue, but the anti-immigration policy was condemned by official Jewish organizations, including the Board of Deputies, on the basis that ""Since all British Jews are, or are descended from, immigrant, it was unethical—even immoral, for a Jew to support immigration contml, or at least tighter immigration control"" (Alderman 1983, 148-149). (In its editorial of February 24, 1978 [p. 22] the Jewish Chronicle supported a non-restrictionist immigration policy, but was careful to avoid framing the issue as a Jewish issue, presumably because a Conservative Jewish Minister of Parliament, Keith Joseph, had appealed to Jews as Jews to support restriction. The Chronicle was most concerned to deny the existence of a Jewish vote.) Jews who did support the government policy did so out of fear that increased immigration would lead to a fascist backlash and therefore increased anti-Semitism

&gt; In the case of Canada, Abella (1990, 234-235) notes the important contribution of Jews in bringing about a multicultural Canada and, in particular, in lobbying for more liberal immigration policies. Reflecting this attitude, Arthur Roebuck, attorney general of Ontario, was greeted ""with thunderous applause"" at a 1935 convention for the Zionist Organization of Canada when he stated that he looked ""forward to the time when our economic conditions will be less severe than they are today and when we may open wide the gates, throw down the

However, the actual server software that is *generating* that HTML is certainly not *written* itself in HTML-- that would be far too clunky and slow to produce and execute.  Twitter for instance is mostly written using Ruby on Rails, which itself will generate HTML/JS when communicating with users via the browser, but when their own servers communicate with each other you can be certain they do not bother generating web pages to do it.

(This sort of system is why web development sucks so much.  No one should have to communicate using a language that was designed for *displaying documents*.)

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's not even the money, it's the pressure to *be something*. If someone says they want to run a store when they grow up people tell them that's not a dream, that's something they'll be settling for if their dreams don't work out. 

""You can be anything you want to be"" only applies if you want to be an astronaut or a scientist or the President. If someone wants to be a construction worker because they like doing things with their hands they're seen as either too lazy or too stupid to be anything ""better"".

That combined with the fact that schools don't really reflect anything that could be called the real world leads a lot of kids astray. I wanted to be an architect growing up, from like, age 8 that was my goal. When I got into High School and started taking drafting classes and found myself somewhat disheartened when the teacher (who I, in my youthful naivete believed, must have actually been an architect or civil engineer or *something* at one time if she was teaching it in high school) all but outright told us that if we wanted to be an architect we would have to be able to recite the building codes from memory, and would be considered a failure if we had to actually look anything up. That, plus being in the middle of the .boom sent me into computers where I graduated college in the middle of the .burst and have been working low level scrub jobs ever since.

Kind of a long way to put it but basically we shouldn't be encouraging kids to ""stay in school"" as if post-secondary education is the holy grail of success in life, we should be encouraging kids to figure out what they want to do with their futures and then help them figure out how much education (and of what kind) is appropriate for them to follow those dreams.","1425168231"

Today, any half decent military can deploy a ready made bridge in a matter of hours or even minutes depending on the size. 

Take the Han River for example in Seoul, South Korea. It's massive. Very wide, quite deep in the middle, and has a strong current.

"namenerds","t5_2xmrc","I didn't name my kid for nine weeks.

I had a few girls names in mind, but couldn't find a boys name I liked until the day before I gave birth, when I came across the perfect one.  Casimir.  It means ""bringer of peace"" and I could use the nickname Casey, which I've always loved.  And I had met Ernie Combs, aka [Mr. Dress-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Dressup), the day I conceived. It was PERFECT, (we'd eventually get a puppy and name it Finnegan, I had it all planned...).

And then she was a girl and none of the names I had suited her.  She was 6 weeks early, and we spent a month in hospital, and I decided I wasn't going to name her until we got out of there 

[I later learned that many people thought I was afraid to name her in case she didn't ""make it"", but she was really fine. If she'd been in any danger it would have been really important to name her right away, the difficulty was in choosing a name she'd have to grow up with.]

And then we got home and I still couldn't figure it out.  It's a lot of pressure.  Whenever I asked anyone how they chose, they'd say ""it was the only one we could agree on"".  It was honestly one of the only times I've regretted being a single mom - it was all up to me.  So many choices.

People would just say names at me.  And one day one of those names sort of echoed in my ear, and I said it to a dear friend who said ""ooh, I like *that*"".  It's a classic name and I realised that if I altered the spelling ever so slightly (nothing weird)  it became a reference to a favourite book as well.  So there it was.

I always knew I'd have to meet a child before I could choose a name.  On the other hand, I know people who chose a name when they first started dating - a unisex choice picked years before they conceived.  So there are certainly different possibilities.  :)

Again though. You can isolate what you can't see, and you can stick a number on it, but in the end, I don't see how you can say the world looks grayer when there is no point of reference.

We see all the colors available to us, and have no real way of seeing the ones we don't as far as I know. The same way someone with full spectrum can't see infrared or ultraviolet and would have no way to imagine what a world looks like with it.

1. Have your domain's EPP Code (Security Key) handy so you can provide it to your new registrar/host. Your domain's EPP Code can be obtained from your current registrar/host, simply ask for it. When you order a domain transfer, you will be asked for the domain's EPP code. The transfer can NOT be initiated without this security key, so make sure you have access to it!


2. Unlock the domain. Make sure your domain name is UNLOCKED before you initiate a transfer. This can be done from your current registrar's domain control panel. If your domain name is locked, the transfer will fail.


3. Don't have WHOIS protection (Domain Privacy) enabled. Make sure to DISABLE WHOIS protection on your domain name before initiating a transfer. This can be done from your current registrar's domain control panel, or by asking your current registrar/host to do it for you. If your domain name has WHOIS protection enabled, the transfer will fail.


4. Make sure the domain's Administrative Contact Details or WHOIS Information (email, address, phone, ect..) MATCHES your own personal info with your new registrar/host. This can be changed from your current registrar's domain control panel. If your domain name's contact details DO NOT match with the new registrar/host, the transfer will fail.


Once you have taken care of these steps and initiated the transfer process, your new registrar/host will then send a transfer request approval notice to the email address listed in the WHOIS details for that domain (your email address). The request MUST be approved by the domain name holder/owner. 

Once approved, your new registrar/host will then send the request to your current registrar/host so they release the domain name over to them (this can take several days). If your current registrar/host does NOT release the domain, it will NOT be transfered. Make sure you can contact your current registrar/host for assistance.","1425168235"

I'm just going off of federal here as I do not know your province.

Because it doesn't sound like you're doing the same amount of work as your bf, or at least not earning as much as he is. I can see why you say you that two kinda/sorta/somewhat worked through this issue -- you did not work through it at all. 

Things will only be equal when you are contributing as much time, effort, and work into supporting the relationship as he is. You don't get to live in someone else's house, let them pay more money then you, insist that the housekeeping must be equally split, and call that ""equal."" That is not equal, that is one person supporting the other person without reciprocation.

I'm not trying to insult you, but it sounds like is literally putting more --an unequal amount of-- work in then you are. This is probably why some of the things your sister said to you really hit you so hard: on some of those points, she's right. You can change your circumstances by stepping up and equally contributing, rather than letting your bf support the both of you. Another approach you could take would be to live a lifestyle and a budget that you can both contribute to, equally, instead of living above your own means because of his greater earning power.","1425168240"

The (mostly eastern communist) Jews are made to work for the war effort and give you a fighting chance or you don't work them and lose for sure with all your people getting sent to the Gulag to die horribly. To me its an easy decision.  And yes they lost so at the end of the war the supply lines were cut and food and medical supplies evaporated at the camps causing hunger and disease (typhus: the piles of emaciated bodies) to spread leaving them in terrible conditions (and perfect for atrocity propaganda) when they were discovered by the allies. The Nazis didn't try to exterminate anyone. They worked a people they had reasonable grounds to hold   to task for bringing the war on in the first place. Not pleasant.

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","That's true, I hadn't considered that. But if Dementors are not constructs with a set pattern of molecules, as would be necessary for them to survive being transfigured, then how would it be possible to transfigure them?

I'm not sure that's a clear explanation of what I mean. Basically, there are 2 possibilities I consider likely to various degrees, and one that I consider impossible:

1. Dementors are made of matter in a certain pattern, like all other creatures. They can be transfigured, but this kills them. Unlikely because of the 'Dementors are unkillable' idea that is prevalent until Patronus 2.0.

2. Dementors are not made of matter in a certain pattern, like ghosts. They cannot be transfigured. Likely, as otherwise they could be transfigured and then maintained as a transfiguration as a way to deal with Dementors in a temporary manner.

3. Dementors are not made of matter in a certain pattern, like ghosts. They can be transfigured. This seems impossible given what we know of transfiguration, but I think this is what you meant.","1425168243"

Players don't like playing under the franchise tag, even if it is nearly $27 million . . . he will probably get double that (or more) in guarantees on a five- or six-year deal.  The tag is really more of a stall tactic in this case, making sure another team can't step in and sign him.  Both sides are going to want to get a long-term deal done, Suh because it ultimately means more money and the Lions because obviously it keeps him here longer and reduces the cap burden from $27 million to something more reasonable.  It gives us more time to negotiate a deal without having to worry about anyone else outbidding us, that's all.","1425168243"

When the female passed at 15, her brother mourned her for nearly 9 months, crying for her and visiting her fave places around the house, seemingly inconsolable when she never answered his call. The plus side of this is that he wanted more attention than he used to need, and his final 3 1/2 years with us created an even greater bond of affection we will never forget. After that there was no doubt for us that we again needed siblings, which we soon adopted from the local shelter.

It's not hard to get a gun or go shooting at all.  I did it many times, no issues whatsoever.  Unless you have an issue with background checks, you really don't have to go thru a lot to buy a gun.  No, it's not like here where you can buy a gun like you're buying a burger but it's not tough, unless you have a record.  And the whole building a fire on the beach?  Well, that's because: 1. a lot of people don't clean up after themselves, 2. there's a goddamned drought and not every beach is as big as the one in Santa Monica.  Smoking on the beach?  Most people don't want to go to beach and see cigarette butts all over the place not to mention breathe the shitty secondhand smoke.  Hell, why Oklahoma doesn't have a ban on smoking in bars is beyond me.  And the plastic bag ban?  Litter.  Plastic bags fly around all over the place and they end up in the ocean which kills wildlife like sea turtles that mistake them for jellyfish.  
And no, you aren't free in Oklahoma.  From stupid draconian alcohol laws, unreasonably restrictive anti-abortion laws, and education funding bullshit to the absolute INSANE laws and punishments on marijuana, the batshit bills that get pushed through that try to limit who one can love.

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","On iron man you're gonna need teleports to farm copious amounts of xp, even 500k coins won't buy you enough laws to get pass 65 farm which means less than 60 herb unless you are getting herbs somewhere else. My point being you need law runes which means you need to rc or have them from monster drops.

As for seeds you have options; 1. you can do slayer of course 2. Nests from mole, trees, and kingdom 3. Pick pocketing farmers 

Farmers are your best bet for consistent seeds especially for the lower level seeds. Currently I have 70 thief from only farmers and a resulting farm of 64 / herb of 59 (after quest xp) this gives you an idea of what you're in for if you pursue seed collecting without combat

Slayer will provide you with better seeds but much more inconsistently and depends severely on your combat abilities.

If you're after nest then I would do throne of misc. (quest) and you can also kill mole for skins to trade for potential tree seeds.

Now if you've got the law runes that's swell because you're gonna use a lot (50 con and mounted glory would be advisable) ironmen need ALL the farm xp they can get so don't be afraid grow everything from bushes to belladonna except hops. Most things you grow you can use for something else later on so be sure to harvest fruit trees even if you aren't planting an actual seed.

Farming EFFICIENTLY requires quite a good amount of progress on ironmen but that shouldn't discourage you from figuring out methods that best suit what you have access to.

I've always said that it's a hell of a lot easier to approach learning drawing from structured methods if you haven't done it extensively before, but this is still quite impressive.

There's only one thing that I'd like to draw your attention to. The funnel ellipse exercise could be done better. The ellipses themselves are good, but their degrees don't really vary much until you reach the middle. They should be gradually getting smaller as you get to the middle.

Anyway, all of these exercises make great warm ups so you'll be able to practice the funnels and everything else more in the future. When you sit down to draw, be sure to pick one or two exercises and do them for like five minutes before starting on a lesson or a drawing.

About the staedtler pens - their ink flow is definitely not the greatest (the faber castells tend to be better), though I've always seen it as more of a feature than a bug. I insist that people use felt tip pens because they're not terribly forgiving, but I found that the staedtler pens' shitty flow helped me cheat a little, laying in forms and shapes without 100% dark lines.

With the staedlters, my instructor did say that you'd get the best ink flow if you held the pens upright while drawing (so they'd touch the page at a 90 degree angle). Might want to give that a shot.

Anyway- feel free to move onto the next lesson!","1425168255"

"halifax","t5_2r77k","Of the local places, Mattress Mart and Sleep Country are the only real mattress stores. Then there's the furniture stores such as Leons, Sears in Bayers Lake and the Atrium (houses Ashley, The Brick, World Wide Furniture and Gallery 1, owned by Joe Ramia, the guy behind that huge convention centre being built).

Sleep Country's staff are generally quite ignorant, mainly due to a ridiculously high level of turnover. Most furniture store staff know about as much as is written in a marketing pamphlet given to them by a company rep (assuming they bother to read them). Mattress Mart aggressively push Kingsdown because they get an additional spiff for them. 

I really can't recommend any one store and if I had to shop for one I'd probably check out all the offerings at the assorted stores in the Atrium, if only for the convenience of selection. But I'd of course be relying on my knowledge, not the sales guy. Staff there tend to push whatever is currently on sale. It's just the way the company trains its staff.

One thing to make sure of is the store needs to have a 'trial period'. Some stores use silly nonsense names for it like ""Sleep Guarantee"" or ""Comfort Warranty"". It's a return policy, straight up. In short, only buy from a store that will give you 2-3 months to try the bed and then exchange it if it doesn't work for you with **no hassles**. That last part might seem obvious but sales people are really good at saying ""oh sure, we'll gladly take that back"" only to make it a pain in the ass when it actually has to happen. 

Anyone that is actually knowledgeable and good at their job with mattresses will genuinely encourage you to take advantage of being able to return the mattress because if they're doing their job properly, they likely won't have to see you again to try out a new bed. 

Oh, and if someone tells you that you need to buy the store's mattress cover/pad in order to do an exchange, know that it is entirely an unjustifiable cash grab. You may already have one, thus not requiring another one. They have no way of proving that you'd actually use one if you did get it. It's just a bullshit tactic to force an $80 add-on. That was actually a reason I turned down the recent job offer, the company is extremely aggressive about their staff selling add-ons like mattress pads and stain-protection-plans other stuff that is distinctly not what a person actually came in to shop for.

Also, our star player needs to calm down with the hero ball.

"de","t5_22i0","Es werden immer wieder die selben Wahrheiten genannt, OHNE die übrigen mit aufzuzählen.

Richtig ist, dass spätere Verse die früheren aufheben (bei widersürpchen)

Falsch ist, dass der Koran die Verse in ihrer ""Veröffentlichten"" reihenfolge aufgeschrieben worden ist.

Die Suren sind alle nach einander entstanden, teilweise auch parallel. Das bedeutet, dass bevor die Sure ""Bakara"" beendet war, kamen schon die ersten Verse von ""Yasin"". Die Anordnung der Suren erfolgte nach deren Länge. Die erste Sure nach der ""Einleitungs-Sure El-Fatiha"" ist ""Bakara"". Letztere ist auch die längste Sure im Koran.

Bei der Auslegung der einzelnen Verse muss man auch den historischen Kontext berücksichtigen. Als die ersten Verse niedergeschrieben wurden, die zum Krieg aufrufen, so war dies zu einem Zeitpunkt, als die Muslime von Mekka nach Medina geflohen waren und mehrere Karawanen der Muslime von den Nicht-Muslimen aus Mekka angegriffen wurden. Dieser Vers, der zum Krieg aufruft, und davon redet, die ungläubigen zu töten, ist die Erlaubnis sich zu wehren.

Jahre später, als die Muslime aus Medina loszogen gen Mekka, um ihre Heimat aus der sie vertrieben wurden zurück zu holen, gab es strikte regeln. Die Bewohner in Mekka, die sich in ihren Häusern aufhielten, die nicht die Waffen streckten, die die Muslime nicht davon abhielten zurück zukehren, denen durfte kein Leid angetan werden. Bei Missachtung hatte ma mit großen Strafen zu rechnen.","1425168255"

Do they not realize that a great game with a shitty server/launcher/app will hurt sales (especially with the reputation they are getting) just as much as having a bad game. Developers need to start turning down offers from Ubi and go with a company that can properly support their games. Whats that? i should get a refund and download a cracked copy? your making it tempting UBI
Edit: Got it working, took i think 4 days for support to respond with a generic solution that just told me to uninstall the game but it never downloaded so can't uninstall, the next day or 2 i got another 6 step troubleshooting e-mail and that fixed it. ","1425168257"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Usually marriages are arranged (parents pick someone, and see if you are compatible, if BOTH agree to it then marriage is on, otherwise rinse and repeat). 
The man or woman can send someone they trust (family member etc)of the right gender to see if they are compatible. For intents of marriage the man and woman can meet (with a mahram present).


According to the story narrated by Ebu Humaid Prophet Mohammad (sallahu alayhi wa sallam) has told:
 “When one of you wants to get married with a woman, there is no inconvenience in looking at her. It is permissible only with the purpose of marrying her. The rule does not change even if the woman he is looking at does not know his intentions. ”


We even see that Prophet Mohammad (sallahu alayhi wa sallam) encourages this method as in:
Muire bin Shûbe wanted to marry a woman. Prophet Mohammad (sallahu alayhi wa sallam) told him, “Go and see her, for seeing her in person is much better for having the harmony between the two of you.”


Only in intents of marriage does the ruling change, thus allowing for harmonious marriage. 

Of course I can be wrong, Allahu Alim. If I did please correct me. Peace be with you.

I actually don't have a problem with FG. I think it's great and what it offers: quick and dirty matches. If I want lots a quick matches so I can practice a technique against a live opponent, I go to FG. For competitive play I go to anthers.

Obviously the type of camping you see on FG breaks down in competitive play and it's obviously a very bad strategy. No will debate that. I think my real issue is simply that the game rewards defense disproportionately generally. This is true of all levels of play, not just on FG.

The basic strategy of camping is that you force your opponent to assume all the risk in the game by making them approach you, then you punish them. It's a boring and simplistic strategy that is heavily rewarded in smash. It's not exclusive to FG though. On FG it looks like Link shooting arrows from a fixed position. 

On anther's ladder it looks like Mario moving around the stage, zoning with fire balls, trying to bait attacks so he can punish the end lag while never throwing out serious approaches himself. I've played plenty of 1300+ ELO players that employ this strategy. It looks different than the FG link, but it's still the same strategy as camping: Stay safe and don't do anything until your opponent presents you with an opportunity to strike.

That, to me, is not good. Fight games should be about creating opportunities, not waiting for them.","1425168272"

If you guy's **DO** stay together a few things need to be made clear a be agreed upon before commencing with the relationship once more:

1: She needs to be upfront and transparent about her coworkers. No more shady behaviour or sneaking around. 

2: She needs to be 100% upfront specifically about her ""friend"" and then after that it's up to you to decide if you comfortable with them being friends. 

3: She needs to accept/ acknowledge that you can ask her to drop contact with this friend at any time within reason. And any resistance will be met with the end of your relationship.

I got this game quite awhile ago and only played an hour or so.  Lately I've been finishing up some other games so I decided to go back and play through it.  It's been really fun; it's a funny game and the combat is simple yet satisfying.  It's fun learning new abilities and the completionist in me is definitely backtracking all over the place so I can get everything.  I haven't finished the game yet; but what I've played has been memorable.

**GTA V**

I still play online occasionally with a couple friends and we usually just do a bunch of jobs in a row until we get bored and then eventually end up on the run with a 5 star wanted level and record whatever crazy shit happens.  The most ridiculous stuff happens in that game and being able to record it instantly with the XB1 is great.  [Here's a vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfPiIvkF4HU&amp;list=UUhKVEXOVQyd3mqOor74bdzg) of a couple random funny instances if anyone is interested.

**Battlefield 4**  

I played the shit out of this game for awhile on 360, up to level 96 or so.  I finally got it the other week for XB1 when it was on sale and have been enjoying the DLC maps I hadn't played yet and the bigger maps.  Sometimes it almost feels like too many players though because there's always somebody behind you.  It's a lot of fun and I think once I get back into the groove of the game and learn the new maps I'll be having even more fun.","1425168275"

Now imagine growing up as one of these children. Your entire formative years were plagued by the deaths of those you love and destruction in your very backyard. And you are taught that the perpetrator of these crimes against you is Israel. Now I am not saying it is wholly Israel's part, because it certainly isn't, but it doesn't change the fact that those are Israeli soldiers manning the wall holding you in and Israeli soldiers knocking on your doors. Do you really think you could grow up with this and only this perspective, and not hate Israel?

Now I am not excusing the actions of Hamas. I believe you and I agree that they do not have the interests of the Palestinian people at heart.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","So first of all the Perisan Gulf reached far further inland in 3000BCE. Ur would have been on the gulf and was one of if the largest port in the region. 

Mesopotamia is largely a vast alluvial plane bordered to the west by the sands of the Syrian Desert and in the east by the Zagros mountains and their strip of woodlands. In the south it was marshland like today or at least until the modern draining programs got to them. Think tall grass, reeds, a myriad of waterways and a generally rich environment.   

The alluvial plane proper was and is fairly dry getting getting around 200 milliliters per year of rain. So imagine dry scrub land, brown loamy earth from the flooding and lots of date palms. Every few years Mesopotamia gets enough water for rain fed agriculture but it isn't predictable and often comes at the wrong time. Due to the lack and unpredictability of rain, irrigation was the only sure method for supporting water intensive agriculture and so the alluvial plane was dense with irrigation canals and where irrigated was rich with gardens and fields of barley, wheat, leeks, lettuce and palm groves.  

Flooding occurs once every spring as the snow melts in the mountains of south eastern Turkey. Generally was not enough to top the river banks. Every 3 or 4 years though the water did break the banks and covered a huge amount of the region. During this time it deposited the sediment that made Mesopotamia so productive. Unlike in Egypt though this flooding happened just before the harvest season so it could be highly damaging to the agriculture of the region.     

I'm afraid I don't really have time to go deeper into to it but I hope I gave you some idea. I'll leave you with a passage from William Kennet Loftus from 1857 which I think captures something of what it might have been like.

""In the former days the vast plains of Babylonia we nourished by the complicated system of canals and watercourses, which spread over the surface of the country like net-work. The wants of a teeming population were supplies by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands, rising from a golden sea of wavering corn, stood frequent groves of palms and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or the traveler their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and vine."" ","1425168280"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","The trade off for short term leases is stability on your end.  Locking someone in for a year means that you've got a year's worth of income practically guaranteed, so if you sign someone up for three months there's no guarantee that they'll resign three more times after that.  If they leave then you've got a period of turnover to find someone to replace them, which could be anywhere from a week to potentially months of no income for you.

Again, which is fine because you're not hurting for money and can cover the mortgage and can afford to weather out the period of no income from the tenant.

And just because someone is looking for short term leases doesn't mean that they're less desirable tenants.  There are plenty of people who are new in town and need a moment to get their bearings, some people might have lost their previous living space (maybe they broke up with their SO) could be the nicest people in a bad situation.  Heck, maybe they just want to make sure *you* are alright and not some crazy person before signing on for a longer term.  These are all questions you can bring up in an interview.  Best case is that they're a good person and worst case you can either evict them or you're only living with them for a short period of time.

&gt; How am I supposed to figure out if a total stranger is going to be able to live compatibly with me?

There's no guarantee that you'll love living with anyone in particular.  That's a fact.  Your SO could move back in three years and turns out you hate living together, such is life.  Which is why in this situation you make it really easy to get rid of someone you don't like or just make the best of what you've got since you're in complete control of the conditions of them being there.  They're just a tenant, you can either be friends with them or just live with an understanding that they keep to themselves and you'll keep to yourself.  Neither of you get in the way of the other and you're both happy with that.  If they're not all that and a bag of chips you either gather enough evidence to evict or wait out a short term lease.

Ultimately if you're just honest with the situation you could take in people on a one month lease with the understanding that if you both like each other then you can extend it out farther.  Most people aren't dicks and just want a stable living situation and would agree to modest rules.  I don't even think most people would be opposed to a ""trial month"" then sign onto something longer after that.  Whoever you take on is probably just as paranoid as you are with who they live with.  Just make sure they're working a stable job with a couple references and talk with them face to face and odds are they'll be just fine.","1425168280"

En el caso de los tributos propios, lo que hay que hacer es mejorar las instituciones de control propias de la Junta.

En el caso de la participación en tributos cedidos, el órgano de gestión, recaudación e inspección es la AEAT. La única manera de mejorar aquí la participación de la Junta es haciendo parte del trabajo que debiera hacer la AEAT: identificar las áreas de fraude y cuantificarlo.

Also, a lot of what you said can easily be applied to people who are atheists. God knows I've run into enough atheists who display the same apathy, ignorance, and intellectual laziness as those people you describe that I'm pretty sure those are just human characteristics, not things limited to religious people. 

1) People can't care about everything, so there are somethings they just don't give a shit about. Climate change is a big, inconvenient thing, that many people just don't want to deal with because it means they have to change, and we don't like change. Religion might be used as an excuse, but that doesn't make it the sole reason. After all, there are plenty of religious people who say that God left earth in the hands of humans, so humans should take care of it to the best of our abilities. 

2) People don't like people who break the norms of their culture, regardless of what religion they are part of. It makes them uncomfortable. Also, people are perfectly capable of being hateful assholes without the cover of religion, just go look at the comments of any news article about politics or race. People will vilify other people for anything, religion isn't required. 

3) That's not religion replacing the desire to know, it's people not wanting to deal with difficult things that will force them to rethink their world view. That can be very difficult intellectually and emotionally for some people to do, so they just avoid the things that make them do it. Ignorance is bliss because not being ignorant means asking uncomfortable questions. It's like atheists who think that religion is why we are all so awful to each other, and that it's caused a lot of wars. That's not religion, thats just humanity, but blaming religion is easier. 

And I'm saying all of this as someone who is agnostic and not religious at all. I just cannot stand people scapegoating religion for things that are just part of being human. ","1425168285"

It wound up being one of the biggest mistakes of my entire life, because I wasn't prepared. I went into it alone. What's even worse, I used a vape. For my first time using a mind altering substance, I went overboard, and at one point something happened. I remember going from feeling incredible, to having a sudden sharp pain in my chest.

I'd never experienced real anxiety until everything just started to unravel. I wound up going to the ER because the pain was so vivid, I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. I remember being alone for what felt like hours, pacing in circles with an overwhelming feeling of dread coupled on top of what felt like a complete loss of control. It wound up scarring me, and instigated a panic disorder in me that I've struggled to keep in check ever since. 

I'm not against the legalization of pot, in fact I'm all for it, but, I wish so much that more people would take the time to explain that you shouldn't just dive in because it's ""fun"" or ""awesome"" or ""cool"" and has all these amazing benefits. You should be careful. Enjoy it, but don't wind up like me. Prepare yourself. Don't under estimate what can happen to you. One bad trip is all it takes.

I'm sure many of you are racking your brain trying to figure out why the average American citizen isn't ready to revolt every time news like this break, so I'll save you some time. Criminals don't play fair, and in many cases play extremely dirty. Those who are responsible with mitigating criminal activity, especially in cities infamous for their high crime, are often pressured to do something about it. As a result, sometimes they push the envelope of legality to meet their objectives. It may be illegal, and it may be hitting a moral gray area, but in the end most people are willing to chalk it up to the ends justifying the means. Until I personally am not comfortable with what I'm seeing, I'm not going to take to the streets. This goes for most everyone else, including those here bitching on Reddit.

"California","t5_2qhsz","California is a beautiful state, as you already know. My girlfriend and I last summer took a road trip around California, mostly south of SF. I'm from San Diego, so of course there's plenty to do here.

I'll make a small list of my favorite places in California, by region:

* Southern California: San Diego
 * La Jolla Shores / Scripps Pier: a rather touristy beach, but still very nice. There are many other beaches that you may want to check out (like Mission Beach).
  * The Zoo / Balboa Park: If you're visiting San Diego, you should definitely check out the zoo. It's in Balboa Park, which has tons of museums as well.  
 * Take a hike along the beaches (this applies to all of California though)
* Orange County area
 * Venice Beach / Newport Beach: I've only been there a few times, but they're fun beaches to go to.
* San Francisco, find everything you can do in SF, it's an amazing city.
* Northern California has a ton of great scenery.
* Yosemite, tons to do here. Check out all the waterfalls and take as many hikes as you can, you wont regret it.
 
 * A lot of people focus on the valley, but I recommend checking out Tuolumne Meadows, which is about an hour's drive East of the valley.

There is so much to see in California that I can't think of right now. Obviously the Redwoods. I would recommend not focusing on hitting every tourist attraction, and instead finding a place you like and sticking around until you want to go somewhere. Enjoy yourself!

Me: ""Hey, fuckwit, buckle up!""

Him: ""Nah, I don't want to!""

Me: ""It's my car, put your seat belt on."" 

Him: ""No, it's uncomfortable.""

It was a nice, sunny day. I checked the road behind us, and it was a long stretch clear as far as I could see. We were doing about 50.

I slammed on the brakes. 

My belt locked, so did the other passengers. He went face first into the back of the seat in front of him, putting up one of his hands. He managed to punch himself in the face and bite his lip to the point where he drew blood.

Me: ""One - I'm not risking a ticket because of you. Two - if we get into an accident, you'll become a projectile. Now, you can either put on your fucking seat belt and keep it on, or you can get the hell out of my car and walk home.""

We were 20 miles from anywhere and he didn't have a cell phone.

He glared at me, but buckled up. He also called me a ""fucking asshole bastard"", but since that's actually pretty accurate I didn't care. ","1425168299"

Numbers don't lie, so long as you use the correct formulas and algorithms.

I've seen (and participated in, admittedly) a few of the left-right Anarchist fights and it seems like the main sticking points are Cold War era propaganda against communal property and the strange notion where everyone assumes that every last person must be forced to accept one way or the other.

Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people. I know that's not right. But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option.

But just as an example here might be some secondary goals for extra optimal results that might not be obvious instantly. I''m sure the thread could generate more

- Is snape in the group? Should he be saved? Pros and cons of his potential as house reformer etc
- Can we capture or knock out or kill the death eaters in a manner which their criminal nature can be proved to the ministry (ie ensure all evil wizards and their conspirators are purged from the system)
- Is Lucius in the group? should he be saved? Pros and cons as it relates to government of magical britain / Impact on Malfoy
- Prevent QUirrel escaping into a horcrux - how important is this goal? Critical? Secondary? Maybe we could split this goal into several potential goals, each of which could prevent Quirrel achieving this (eg goal 1, brain damage, goal 2, cut him off from magical action etc...)
- Extract useful knowledge from Quirrel? What useful knowledge should we aim to retrieve?

It's incredible that you care so little about the own content of your writing yet you criticise that of others. Learn to use apostrophes and capital letters. 

&gt;i was going on what you said, no idea if we do have the same set of drug laws.

It's incredibly close.

&gt;but let's say we do. what does that indicate?

It indicates that a woman was imprisoned for stepping on weed, my original point. Do you have any long term memory available?

&gt;what does it indicate that US has the same set of gun laws as a third world country like pakistan?

It indicates that Pakistan has better gun laws than most of Southeast Asia, which is a statistical fact. Also, gun laws in the US are not akin to Asian gun laws due to gun culture being highly prevalent in the US.

&gt;precisely nothing

Don't answer my question for me. 

&gt;because the application of the law rather than the law in itself is the critical issue.

No it isn’t, at least, not in this case. The same conclusion is apparent, making the application the same anyway.

&gt; i have no beef against severe drug laws

Of course you don't, you don't care that people should have the freedom to do what they want to their own body without a barbaric police state killing them for it. However, do you care about the massive Asian trades and black markets it creates, which is more detriment than the actual use of drugs itself? Drug use isn't the problem, its gang violence. 

&gt; i have a beef against the gender-discriminative application of neutral federal law in Sharia courts and territories.

That has nothing to do with the drug laws of which we speak, stop changing the topic just because you're loss is clearly inevitable.

&gt;again, bye, enjoy what you probably call your freedom fries

I don’t come from the US, I come from the UK, which has shit views on freedom of speech, but at least I don’t lack any freedom like you do. Poor soul, raised like cattle to irrationally respect the barbaric nature of your shit nation. I really do feel sorry for people like you who don’t have the intelligence to analyse anything themselves.

But, if the process to pick the winner is really as fair and transparent as you claim (no I'm not going to bother to check) then personally I'll be indifferent to it. If these idiots want to throw money at each other than whatever, let 'em.

I wonder if the $6000 winner realizes he needs to pay taxes on that.","1425168312"

I came out on my 23rd birthday, and that was my first gay bar experience EVER. I tried my best to drag him to gay bars as I really wanted to experience them but he acted like a homophobic cunt scared to turn gay. So I went out by myself two nights in a row and had a blast. It was actually pretty fun. I met a bunch of pretty cool guys the first night and danced and made out all night with a very cute guy the next one. People are usually curious to see you dancing alone and will often inquire why. My response was I was in Chicago travelling with no gay friends and I didn't want that fact to stop me from having fun. Somehow they admired me for having the guts to just say fuck it and go out alone. I'm now back in my shitty town with a boring gay life, eager to experience more of the bar scene and I now know I won't hesitate a second if no one wants to accompany me. ","1425168312"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The Moscow times still being in business doesn't say much about the level of freedom in Russia's press today. They are indeed a privately owned and openly critical newspaper, but as it is exclusively an English language newspaper, they have little to no readership among actual Russians. It's mostly an expat and business newspaper, which is why the regime can safely ignore it, no matter what they write. 

I can assure you that when it comes to actual Russian language media, almost all of the TV and newspaper channels are now solidly in the pro-Kremlin camp. It is impotant to note though that they are probably not directly under the government's control. I believe a lot of what is happening in Russia's media landscape today is owing to self-censorship and blind fanaticism just as much as it may be less overt government direction. ","1425168312"

Okay, so this wasn't ""evil,"" per se. It was just... grotesque.

One of my players is an ex-prostitute turned mercenary, turned wanderer. The party served as guards on a caravan, because it was going in the same direction they were, and they got jumped by bandits at one point.

They decided to go after the bandits and wipe them out once and for all. The ex-prostitute (Let's call her Jade) was the star of the show here. The other PCs and guards waited, watching, in the woods while...

Jade pretended to be lost, a merchant separated from the caravan when it was attacked. Obviously, the bandits were keen to, ah, take advantage of the situation. She maneuvered them into gathering around her, essentially to gang-rape her. She knelt to suck the leader's cock, while jerking off two others at the same time.

Right before she did so, she cried out, ""I have to take... *nine of you?!*"" This was the signal to the people in waiting, that she'd give them heads up on how many, and that they'd be distracted.

As soon as she heard her allies approaching, she bit off the cock of the leader, and used the grip on the other two to throw them, wrenching their cocks with all her (rather impressive) strength.

Let's just say that a pissed off woman with the blood of their leader's penis dripping from her mouth demoralized the other bandits.

It was... painful to witness, even as players.

She's now a small legend, because no one who witnessed the event is willing to tell anyone else what happened, so all the guards who didn't come are fascinated by what it could possibly be.","1425168313"

* Tex spent the afternoon playing Oregon Trail.  Unfortunately, he was so focused on hunting buffalo, that his party died of dysentery.
  
* Godner ran to his car so fast that he didn't get wet.  Sadly, though, he couldn't fish his keys out of his pocket with his mitten on, so he got soaked, anyway.
  
* Brendan Ryan injured himself picking up an umbrella.  He laughed it off, commenting that he wasn't going to leave the bench, anyway.
  
* CC Sabathia sent a clubbie out for a light snack.  Coincidently, an hour later, a General Mills truck packed with Cap'n Crunch backed up to the clubhouse.
  
* Brian McCann's uniform is at the drycleaners, after he mean-mugged the clouds for twenty minutes, trying to intimidate them.  He fully expects to be able to take care of business any day now, however.
  

* Michael Pineda walked through a mud puddle before he threw his bullpen session, which wouldn't have drawn such attention, had he not kept trying to wipe the mud off his neck between pitches.

I think that to fully characterize addiction as physiological, it would make sense to only consider addiction which has an effect on the whole body. Drugs like alcohol and heroin have serious withdrawal symptoms which effect the whole body. Even coffee and other stimulants have more severe withdrawal symptoms than marijuana. I don't disagree with you, I just think that, since neither of us are scientists studying the brain's chemistry, neither of us have the required clout to decide where the line stands as far as what can be defined as physiological and psychological addiction.

"Cleveland","t5_2qkh0","I moved here from Massachusetts last September and I'm not loving cleveland so far.  The cost of living is cheaper than boston for sure, but now that I've been here awhile I realize all of the amenities that came with the high COL.  

It's true, the transportation is pretty spotty and busses that run often enough to be useful serve a small portion of the metro area.  I miss the mbta so much.  

There are great parts of cleveland but they're very fragmented and spread, especially if you're on foot or public transit.  You will have to pass though some terrifying parts of town to get to good neighborhoods unless you stay in the suburbs.  

 Also, fyi, my state and municipal tax burden was about twice as high in cleveland than it was in Massachusetts.

Walking around as a woman sucks here.  It's a good weekend if I don't get cat called and I've started carrying pepper spray as a result of a physical assault while waiting for a bus.

"ftlgame","t5_2tnu1","Yeah, I think all you could have done would have been to have immediately moved your Zoltan out of the weapons room at 1:10 (when the first solar flare hit) and into the engines room to help put out the fire faster, and maybe get level 2 engines online so you could jump away sooner.

For the second battle, you basically should have moved the Zoltan out of the weapons room as soon as it was clear the hacking drone was going to hack weapons, so that you could immediately go into damage-mitigation and have him available to help repair stuff.

Sadly, unlike shields and engines, ion damage to weapons will immediately take all the power of a weapon out of the system the first frame the weapon is depowered, so it wouldn't have been possible to, say, keep the Zoltan in engines and then run him into the weapons room to re-power the Glaive Beam. (You can do that with one-power weapons but not with two, three or four-power weapons.)

The only other thing I could mention is that it's possible you might have wanted to go to the distress beacon; there was a tiny chance that could have been a civilian being chased by pirates that would then have a tiny chance of repairing your hull after you saved them. Or it could have been some non-combat encounter like a ship wanting fuel or the malfunctioning satellite defense or something like that. It wouldn't have been any worse than running into that ship with the mini-beam.

So, yeah, that was an awful, awful first sector and even if you survived it it would be unlikely you'd survive sector 2 without the game suddenly turning nice.","1425168327"

"MiddleEastHistory","t5_2xt69","It seems to me that the Tigris and Euphrates were actually closer together around that time period. It was likely that both flood plains were hydrologically manipulated for agriculture, so I would expect the settlements to be based off of the respective flood plains with some semi-arid land in between, albeit much less than today. Most places in the general alluvial fan of the river system receives enough nutrients and sediment from flooding to support animal husbandry if not agriculture.

A good way to go about it is not to try to force a completely unnecessary and unnatural language change, but to approach English teaching better. Make it clear that English and Konglish are two different things, explain that writing out English words in hangeul is not possible, stress the existence of English loanwords which have shifted in meaning and become [false friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend), etc. This way you could improve the English skills of Korean learners and not mess with an evolving Korean vernacular.","1425168329"

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","Speaking as a psychic/medium myself, I am inclined to agree with you. This is not the place for self promotion. It is a forum intended to discuss the paranormal, not to promote a business or show off your abilities. 

I am sure the person who posted the thread meant well, though there are better ways to exercise your abilities than reading anonymous, faceless strangers over the internet. Read for friends and family. Look at someone in the grocery store and feel what your intuition tells you about that person. You're doing yourself no favors reading through the internet. The energy of the person you're reading is everything, and you're depriving yourself of that by trying to read someone through screen name only. I've offered free readings to people in distress on this very forum, asked for relevant photos, and was never thanked nor acknowledged for my help, so to save myself the frustration I put an end to it. 

Distance reading can be done but most effectively with a medium such as Skype or Facetime which allows some modicum of face to face interaction. I have been at this for most of my life and would find it next to impossible to read anyone without at least a photograph. One cannot read a book without seeing the pages, nor can a medium or psychic read a person without seeing them or being in their company.  

To end, I wholeheartedly agree. Disallow self promotion of psychics/mediums on this subreddit. It is for ghosts, not sales.

Since men are ""dominant"" in everything,  bringing women up to their level would make everyone equal.

1. Borrowing more than  I could afford taking I to account changing circumstances that happened just round the corner. 

2. Not enough research has into neighbour hood and resale potential.  I bought the house with aim of living in it while at uni (22) and paying it off with rent from lodgers.  The area was poor and and I got into arrears.  And when I had to resell the house was worth less than I'd paid.  There were clues all around,  boarded up shops,  more crime,  mor unemployment etc etc.  I just ignored it all.  When I came to sell I made a loss of 100k usd in my investment just get rid of the weight of th debt. It took me until my mid thirties to recover fro. Debt is bad. Boys and girls.  Look for signs of prosperity in an area.  Sell if you start seeing signs of prosperity decline. 

3. Burying my head in the sand when things needed to be fixed went wrong.  As I ran out of money,  just scraping enough to pay the mortgage,  I should have cut my losses and paid a professional to come in and do it up and sold at a smaller loss.  I didn't I just held on with the property getting worse and worse.  At one point I went back to live with my parents and ignore the property for months.  I came back to find  that local builder shad dumped tons of crap I the back garden and my bathroom leaked into the kitchen collapsing the ceiling.

"PrettyLittleLiars","t5_2sdxf","Here's the convo Aria hears while in the box

guy- you lied to me, we can't do this

girl- push, damnit

guy- no... i can't.

girl- shut up. come back here... push.

Then Aria stabs the guy

Then in the video Mona has Wilden says ""it's not gonna happen. listen to me, just leave her. plans have changed. garrets gonna tell them everything. we can't let that happen.""

All that doesn't make it sound like Melissa is trying to save Aria at all. It sounds like Melissa lied to Wilden about something and thats making him rethink the plan to push the box out of the train. But Melissa still wants to push it out and is yelling at Wilden to keep helping. Until Wilden finally says 'It's not gonna happen, just leave her' as in 'stop trying to push her out of the train.' The video is confusing though bc of the way Wilden says they can't let Garret talk. It makes it sound like Garret isn't dead yet. Even though he is dead and in the box with Aria. So it really looks as though Melissa is just trying to kill Aria even when Wilden doesn't want to anymore. Yet the girls don't seem to think that's a big deal for some reason.","1425168335"

The money comes in, the money goes out, one person has it, then another person, but it returns in some form or another.  Or at least some type of value returns; I doubt I'll ever win this drawing, because I'm realistic and understand some maths, but I got the feel-good value of thinking that I played a part, however small, in helping improve GumMice's life in some way.

but hey if you wanna talk about it, a couple arguments could be made that the you can account for that by reacting appropriately as well. The skill and reaction (them getting a star won't kill you instantly, so anticipation isn't a huge factor in avoiding dying because of a star) of the other player just a big of a check for it as much as it would be for game and watch. See how Ken avoided that final smash? Pretty sexy. Anyways, couldn't I say that you can't really account for being downthrown into a true combo judgment (if that's one at low percents, I'm not sure) at any given time? Or not being hit, literally at all because any touch could mean death?

I mean, in the end, you're saying that G&amp;W is good RNG because people can avoid the attack for the entire game, but like 15 seconds of invulnerability (is that it?) is bad RNG because people can't avoid attacks for the duration of the item.","1425168338"

It's the same issue, Isreal is dragging the US into a war by proxy. Why does the US give them so much military hardware? Do we think it's a legitimate cause? If so why don't we join the battle and send people? If we want to stand on the sidelines and watch, then do that, and I don't really have a problem selling defensive weapons. But our tax money should not be spent on a war we are not involved in, if we want to lend a hand to some country with a war send in our military directly, war should be worth the political shitstorm that would cause.

The fact that we are not sending our military in just shows that it's not something the US population wants.","1425168339"

Less than 1 year of experience? Yes, almost one year of experience in something that requires a lot of skill and little else. Also, some of them are paid beer money while they use all their time on something that isn't really marketable anywhere else. They call this thing an e-career, because it's like a career-e xcept it's not a real job with a future. They take this thing very seriously, in fact, when one of them was caught cheating, everyone was like: your e-career is over! You're done! You'll never find another career now that you're...

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","The key to avoiding stereotypes is growing the character three-dimensionally such that they are not defined by just a couple of traits. You can have a black character growing up in the hood, or an Asian character who's shy and nerdy. You can let that be one aspect of their character, but don't let that aspect overshadow the character itself. Ultimately, they're going to have a personality and attitude that can be understood by audiences from all different walks of life. A well-written character doesn't need to pander to the majority in order to be relatable. By the same token, don't be afraid to address the differences between your minority character and a typical white character. Otherwise, you risk running into another stereotype: that minorities really just want to be white.  

It's very general advice, but it's something to keep in mind.  

Edit: Also, if you're writing about a background or culture that you don't know very well, DO YOUR RESEARCH. ","1425168343"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

That means the work he put in before he got injured was good enough to keep his stats up there with the rest of the elite guys through the end of the season.

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","as a matter of fact, I only recently got into fantasy rpgs. the whole fantasy thing never appealed to me in any form (books, movies, games) but there aren't that many scifi rpgs (not that I have played the fallout, deus ex or mass effect series, they've been in my backlog for years), so recently I tried out all the fantasy rpgs I could hunt down demos for but haven't played any of the full versions yet. except fable and jade empire, both last year, and both were great bargain purchases.

so I've been trying out these demos recently, looking for anything that's good but more importantly anything that's similar to fable, and divinity 2 had that with the colorful world and the funny npc dialog, and even though drakensang plays like dragon age, the vibe I got from it was similar to fable. so I'm looking forward to playing those, among other titles, such as the witcher and two worlds 2 (the first was a pretty bad experience but I'm gonna give it another shot, and I've yet to try the amalur demo, that's the last one on the list but got distracted by other games).

I also tried the early divinity games (divine and beyond) and while they were better than I'd expected, even had some humor, I didn't really enjoy playing them, the interface/controls/something didn't feel right. kinda the same boat as with the first two worlds game or the gothic/risen series. risen 2 was the closest to something I'd enjoy from that bunch but ended up not wishlisting any of them.","1425168347"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The first and probably most important thing to understand here is that *torque* and *power* (horsepower) of an engine are not specific *values*. They are *functions* of engine RPM, i.e. they are *curves*. You can find many examples of these curves if you search for it on Google images, like [this one](http://www.seriouswheels.com/pics-2007/2007-Koenigsegg-CCXR-Power-and-Torque-Curve-1280x960.jpg). In other words, torque can be described as a function `T` of engine RPM `r`:  `T(r)`. Exactly the same is true for power `P` as a function of engine RPM `r`: `P(r)`.

Now, once you know that torque and power are *functions*, you are ready to know that these functions are tied by strict pre-determined relationship

    P(r) = T(r) * r * C

where `C` is just a unit-conversion constant, which depends on what units the torque and power are expressed in. 

And this is the first thing that you have to understand: torque and power are not independent at all. Moreover, torque and power are just two different ways to look *at the same thing*. You can always calculate power curve from torque curve and you can always calculate torque curve from power curve. Two engines with the same torque curve will always have exactly the same power curve and vice versa.

It is correct so say that torque is a fundamental characteristic of the engine. It describes the *force* that the engine generates at each RPM point (torque is a rotational version of the concept of force). Power is just an alternative, derivative way to express the same thing. Power is more convenient to use in some contexts. But, again, as functions of engine RPM, torque and power are equivalent things.

Comparing momentary torque and power values to each other only makes sense if they are taken at the same RPM value. And torque and power values at the same RPM will be tied to each other by the above formula.

When you look at published engine characteristic on the Net or in printed materials, you can often see torque and power expresses as specific values. This is actually a misnomer. The values you see are not torque and power (since these are functions, not values, as I said above). These are actually *maximum*, peak values of torque and power curves. So the proper nomenclature requires these materials to say ""max torque"" and ""max power"" and additionally state at which RPM these maximum values were achieved. Instead they often shorten these terms to just ""torque"" and ""power"", thus promoting confusion.

The value of max torque and the value of max power depends on the shape of the torque curve. Without seeing the actual curve, there's no way to describe any relationship between max torque and max power values. There's simply no such relationship. The only thing that can be said is that max power is always achieved at higher RPM than max torque (this immediately follows from the above formula).","1425168347"

You would not want to kind out that he has some sort of charm on him to make him explode when a gun shot is fired at him. Harry is in a very bad spot, it is reasonable that Voldemort fears the prophesied ""unknown power"" more than he fears Harry doing some impossible death-defying action within 60 seconds. Thus reasonable that Voldemort makes every attempt to discover unknown powers. 

The one mistake may be that Voldemort explained how Harry was going to die before interrogating him. Better to interrogate first, then just kill him.","1425168347"

Wel 30% is a pretty big minority, hard to oppress  , stop voting for shit politicians and  increase the level of the political class to work in your favor. I don't like either Ali Ahmeti or Menduh Thaci even though i'm not very familiar with the political situation , i don't think they've used their citizens votes for anything else but personal profit , they strike me as the typical albanian politician and i usually wonder , when did the nationalism fade away in these guys? is it just an electoral act?. 

Oh and they also seem to support religious people when it's is obvious for a well-educated politician that islam isn't well perceived in the west and you should tone down the religious feeling of your people if you wish a good future for them , otherwise you just gave your enemies the opportunity to portray you as the ""extremist"" , ""terrorist"" or whatever you name it , we all know that such a portrayal is pretty easy in the current situation .

"DeadOrAlive","t5_2tfjy","My tip is that you should fight with/against other characters to learn their strings. You can also watch top players fight on youtube to get an idea what the other person will do. I know that it isn't really a solution but there are 2 other options, one being very n00bish and seen as a bad player but it works a good portion of the time:

Low counter. Counter low during a stun. Simple as that, very annoying and people will call you bad. BUT! it works a good portion of the time. It dodges highs and throws. It works because sooner or later they will use a throw or a high punch/kick.
Or,

Slow-escape. This is part of wait you do when being stuck in a stun and don't know what to counter. The way you do it is hold the block button (X for xbox, square for PS for default controls) and move the analog stick or d-pad in a circle very fast(in puts 12369874,12369874 etc. it's full circle). It will allow you to get out of the stun faster and you will be able to block the next move.

There is more, i could give you more advice just ask :P","1425168353"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","That's kinda sorta the point but also not really.

To start, federal law ""trumps"" state laws. That means that if the two sets of laws conflict then the federal law comes out on top.

In the pot example: pot is **not legal** anywhere. Federal law says that pot is illegal everywhere; that conflicts with state law; therefore, federal law wins and pot is illegal everywhere.

But the federal government has *chosen* to make a policy decision to not enforce some of the pot laws. They still could, it is still the law, but their policy decision has been to not enforce that law.

I don't know of any other instances where that's happened? I'm sure that it has happened or is happening, but I can't think of another example.

Like I said, it's a policy decision. The federal government has decided that given their limited resources, given their priorities, given the nature of pot, given changing public opinion (including respecting the fact that the citizens of the state have voted to make it legal), that it's best to have a policy of not enforcing certain pot laws.","1425168354"

Yet because the Western media never bothered to research them they look like saints to the average redditor. Mean while the real opposition in Russia is starved of money, publicity and protection. They are the former communist party apparatchiks who are trying to build up local movements against corruption, abuse of power and arbitrary arrests. But having a communist, gay hating neo nazi, or fire and brimstone priest, is not a narrative that would go well in the West.

After everything they went through with the rebellion Cat isn't about to have a major tanty or have her family meddle in that because they could have put pressure on Ned to remove Jon from winterfell. Ned Sark and family went to war to together. No one is in the political position to question Ned's decisions re having a bastard fostered along side his siblings even though it's unusual and highlighting a dishonor. 


As far as their personal relationship goes, Ned and Cat married, she described his lovemaking as dutiful. Ned spends a week with her and goes to war. He's a perfect stranger. She was meant to marry his brother whom she loved. He comes back with this child and she sees a man who's lost everything including his sister, and she doesn't have the influence with Ned to demand Jon leave. 

Time passes and she learns to love him because he's gentle, loving, thoughtful, and he treats her respectfully. She tries to bring up Ashara Dayne to Ned and he puts her on blast, he's got a powerful anger in him and it's scares her. He never does that. If you love your husband, you don't keep bringing up something you know will cause conflict and put your otherwise mild tempered husband in a rage.

When Ned finally leaves was the only time she can assert herself, even later she reflects on how she probably was harsh. She's projecting all her worries about Ned leaving and scapegoating Jon. ","1425168356"

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","&gt; I know if I were interviewing I would be so bored if every single person coming in for interviews wore gray/navy/black suits. Where is the individuality?

This is the problem with so many people on this sub giving interview advice when they have never hired anyone. I promise you, if you were an interviewer, you would not be ""bored"" by seeing people dressed similarly. And you would know how to get information about someone's personality and professional skills through interviewing them. Unless you were a profoundly shitty interviewer, you would not conclude an interview thinking ""wow, that was a great forty-five minute conversation and she seems highly qualified, but she wasn't wearing a colorful belt and that makes me concerned about what her personality might be like.""

I don't mean to pick on you specifically, and I am ambivalent about whether people should wear suits to teacher interviews, but can everyone who has no hiring experience please restrain themselves from these strong yet totally uninformed hunches about what they would think if they were hiring?

"rocketbeans","t5_2zn9o","PS: Ich habe mir jetzt im betrunken Zustand 30 Minuten Mühe gegeben einen sinnvollen Text zu schreiben, bis mein Handy (Akku leer) ausgegangen ist. Darum jetzt die Kurzfassung der Kurzfassung: Ich bin jetzt ehrlich gesagt zu faul um mir unter den mittlerweile mehr als 200 Comments den richtigen raus zu suchen. Was ich aber ansprechen will ist die Aussage, dass die Bohnen sich selber nicht an ihren Kodex von ""Kein Sexismus, kein Rassismus..."" halten. Differenziert das bitte. Ich bringe immer gerne drastische Beispiele. Das ist so meine Art, so versteht es nunmal jeder. Es gibt Witze, die kratzen gerade an der inneren Grenze des Rassismus. Dann gibt es z.B. ""Witze"" über Genozid an irgendwelchen Völkern. Solche Sachen kann und darf man m.M.n. nicht vergleichen. 
Nagelt mich nicht auf die exakte Quelle fest, aber ich weiß, dass schonmal ein Witz über Asiaten gemacht wurde und Budi dabei angeschielt wurde. Und er hat selber gelacht. Mag sein aus Verlegenheit oder um zu überspielen, dass er sich verletzt fühlt, mag sein weil es verdammt nochmal lustig war. ICH möchte mich nicht immer benehmen müssen als stände unser Pastor neben mir. Ich stehe aber auch nicht im öffentlichen Leben. 
Meine eigentliche Kernaussage ist folgende: Rassismus? Nein. Sexismus? Nein.
Aber muss ich über jedes einzelne Wort, dass ich in einer Situation in der ich mit Freunden zusammen bin (auch wenn es hier beobachtet und ausgestrahlt wird) sage nachdenken? Bitte nicht. Wenn unsere Bohnen über alles und jede Äußerung drei mal nachdenken müssen, bevor Sie sie tätigen, wo bleibt dann der Spaß an dem was sie tun? Wenn sich jemand durch unbedachte Aussagen angegriffen fühlt, ist das ein anderes Level. In dem Fall MUSS man über jedes Wort nachdenken! Aber zu sagen, dass Leute aus der Community entfernt werden die beispielsweise sexistische Sachen von sich geben, obwohl die Bohnen es selber machen, ist so nicht vergleichbar. 
Wenn ich dir (Leser fühle dich angesprochen)sage, dass ich dich nicht mag, ist das eine Sache. Wenn ich dir sage, dass mir deine Fresse nicht passt, ist es eine andere. Wenn mir deine Fresse nicht passt weil ich der Meinung bin, dass du, mit dem ich noch nie im Leben ein Wort gewechselt habe, ein dummes Arschloch bist, ist es wieder was anderes. Beleidigend sind alle drei Aussagen. Trotzdem unterscheiden sie sich erheblich. 
Berücksichtigt das bitte, wenn ihr davon sprecht, dass die Bohnen sich nicht an das halten, wofür in Zukunft Leute aus der Community entfernt werden.","1425168361"

Or at least, recognised as one by everyone in the new world regardless if he wants to be or not.

I think it's necessary for him since he needs to eventually reach that level if he's going to be able to fight Blackbeard, Akainu, Kaido, Big mom, and the moment we all know is coming the friendly fight with Shanks to prove to him he's surpassed him. Shanks won't go easy on him after all.

I don't see Kaido as the one Luffy gets his title from, Luffy hasn't got any intense hatred towards him as far as I know, Kaido hasn't done anything too evil to warrant Luffy kicking his ass with a vengeance.  

Big mom, Maybe. Although there are the pretty well thought out and presented theories she'll end up being a slight ally or at least on good terms with Luffy because she's Lolas mother, and almost as Likely bonneys too. 

Although who knows with Oda? Kaido could pull some monstrous act of cruelty that'll get Luffy fired up for the kill. He's certainly nowhere near strong enough to take him out, but we'll see what plot weaponry he learns when we eventually get to him. ","1425168362"

Claro que não! Porquê? O peixe também não é um animal? Ahhh os mamíferos podem ser coitadinhos porque são fofinhos, os outros animais não, que se fodam os outros animais, é na boa.

Em Portugal a caça é legal desde que tenhas a licença de caça e os animais de caça são mortos e de forma semelhante são mortos os animais de onde vem a carne que é posta nas francesinhas que vocês tanto gostam, mas aí já não vos preocupa pois não? Não têm de ver que o animal sofreu antes de chegar ao prato, no supermercado já vem tudo embalado, é como se não tivesse vindo de um animal que alguma vez já esteve vivo, que teve sensações e sentimentos, que já sentiu prazer e já sentiu dor.

Mas um homem que mata um animal que provavelmente viveu em melhores condições do que aqueles que são criados em cativeiro já é um ""covarde"", um ""filho da puta"".

Para aqueles que não comem carne eu entendo a revolta, é a vossa ideologia, é a vossa forma de pensar e respeito apesar de não concordar mas para os demais só tenho a dizer isto: Hipócritas de merda.","1425168364"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The history of Christianity is one of discernment. We are constantly trying to understand what the right answers are, and there's not always agreement. I'm not sure God intended for us to have all the right answers to everything, nor am I certain we need them. I am very appreciative of Augustine of Hippo, who wrote, ""In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity."" There are things we should be united on, such as salvation being through Christ alone. But there are many things that aren't essential, and we should be understanding of disagreements on them, all the while loving one another, because that is the fulfillment of the whole law.

Of course, that still leaves you in a potential pickle: who do I trust?  
I think the answer to that is that there are many whom you can trust, and those many won't agree on everything. And that's okay. Find those who love God and Jesus and love their neighbor. That's probably the most crucial matter. Beyond that, God's not likely to be furious at you for thinking the wrong thing about speaking in tongues or infant baptism or ecclesial authority.","1425168366"

The real problem with the set is it's a melee spec and you get into a lot of trouble in melee. IK with the Wrath of the Berserker pants gives you basically a permanent 50% damage bubble (and damage bonus, and healing/fury spent).

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","That was also the only time he received a cross inside the box. Or a pass inside the box even. The rest of the game he was meeting passes with his back to the goal.

That's the problem. We don't play passes behind the defense and we don't hit early crosses into the box. At all.

When our wingers get the ball out wide they **always** delay the cross. That means the strikers either have to delay their movement into the box, or they will be stationary, and then only Fellaini will have the height to score. Or a second wave of midfielders have to arrive to meet the cross, which rarely happens. And it won't make Falcao score more goals.

Falcao should be running towards the goal, receiving through balls and meeting crosses. He doesn't. And it's not just Falcao. RvP and Rooney are much the same. Today Rooney scored from a penalty and a return from the goalie. We play slow buildup football and pass the ball from side to side and backwards.

I thought it was funny listening to the interview with Van Gaal on MotD today. He said he didn't hear the booing from the stands when we played the ball back to De Gea when we had a corner. He must be deaf. I still support him to succeed, but he's trying my patience.

Taking off Falcao just as he had won a penalty and a sending off for the opposing team is just horrible man management in my opinion. If strikers need confidence in order to excel, then that was the perfect opportunity for Falcao to kick on and get a goal or two at the end of the match. Instead he's taken off for Fellaini who came on and did nothing.

Atrocious.","1425168371"

Just set that film in the middle ages, with a small village, a few horses, a dozen period costumes, two or three period interiors, and a burning castle in the end. Really nothing big. Pulling that off only slightly convincingly would immediately set you back by a six-figure amount of money, on the smallest possible scale, with practical *or* visual effects.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","you actually got all the points of the analogy (first one in the replies I guess) but draw the wrong conclusion. notice that I am not stating anything about my judgement about the bread being wrong or right

there is no controversy in this, because, as you say  
  
&gt;taste through 'development' as you said is highly subjective.  
  
the point is the judgement in this case falls into the same category  as the guy watching a dota game makes about a player.  
  
&gt;Also, the art of making bread, and the art of tasting bread are two different things. they fill two different shoes,

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","I'm actually not entirely sure how it works, and here's why. I think all of the confusion comes from differences between the three types of haki. The thing about busoshoku haki is that it generally *does* nullify the defensive abilities of a devil fruit. We see this with Logia's losing their intangibility, but I think we also see it with Luffy taking considerably more damage from haki-imbued punches, or other haki-imbued blunt attacks that he normally can resist better. This is shaky however, because haki always makes attacks stronger so they would obviously do more damage regardless. Additionally, opponents skilled in armament haki generally throw hard punches even without it, as certain skill is required to use haki in the first place. I'm not entirely sure myself to what extent busoshoku haki strengthens attacks. However, it is an offensive use of haki. I'm confident in saying that defensive haki does not nullify devil fruit abilities inherently. Some may be nullified or resisted but that is a battle of haki and not an inherent effect. So that's my understanding on it. I don't have time nor memory to pick out pages that support this theory, at least not now. I'd like for this issue to be entirely fleshed out, assuming it hasn't already. I love to see any screen grabs proving something one way or the other.","1425168382"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I had this problem at that age (from about 8-15. Yikes!) and my parents never did anything about it. That really sucked for me because I went years without brushing my teeth regularly and ended up needing a ton of fillings.

I would just try to enforce it as part of her daily routine. She has to do homework, chores, eat, go to school. She also has to bathe and brush her teeth. Non-negotiable. Maybe even consider withholding something of value everyday until she's cleaned up - no tv until she's showered or something.

Additionally/alternatively, maybe you could get her engaged in some activity that would pretty much require her to clean up afterward. Like swimming or gardening. Something where she gets really sweaty and dirty on a regular basis. This would give her some awesome exercise and make hygiene a regular part of her day. 


EDIT: Also, you should check her out for depression. I fell into my habits because I was dealing with a lot of emotional anguish and past abuse. I felt vulnerable in the shower and would wallow in my filth and self-loathing for days (weeks?) before eventually bathing. This behavior could be driven by more than just thoughtlessness...","1425168382"

No, seriously, its expensive as fuck. For one, the programs that you need to analyze radar are generally not pirateable and meant for storm chasers.

"DebateFascism","t5_2v642","Not only has prohibition shown to be nearly useless in actual regulation, but for my country it's been (IMHO) the source of our immigration 'problem'. Because of weaker laws in surrounding countries, drug cartels set up the base of their operations there, and then smuggle their products into the US. Now the most level headed, intelligent and polite people aren't exactly the type running illegal business empires, so it's putting the absolute worst people in de facto control over many regions South. This creates a legitimate humanitarian issue, that results in people having to flee regions under control of said cartel leaders because it's dangerous, or incredibly difficult to live where they normally are. I put the word 'problem' in quotations though, because as far as I'm concerned illegals/latin immigrants are what's making the economy run in my state (Florida). Simply put, they're filling the economic gap for any degree-less job that most people don't want, which is kinda beneficial for the economy.


So it's certainly a humanitarian issue, and makes things difficult for countries like the US when (IMHO) we should be focusing more on improving relations, economy and quality of life of our half of the world so we can go back to being a regional player. Contrary to what's currently happening; making the Southern half of the continent so corrupt and unstable we have to outsource nearly all basic manufacturing to China, which may tie us economically to a competing superpower, but also makes them a competing superpower. 


But there are added benefits, tax revenue! At first it may not sound like much, but every penny really counts for public schooling in my state, which is without much argument, the worst in the country. If the [money made in taxes by the state of Colorado](http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/12/news/economy/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue) was divided evenly and put into [every public high school in Florida](http://florida.educationbug.org/public-schools/), each school would get over $140,000 in yearly tax revenue, which could certainly help the teachers my county lays off or cuts salary (usually by 50%) yearly. And that's assuming the numbers don't scale up, we have four times the population of Colorado, and blacks and Mexicans smoke a hell of a lot more weed! Also I strongly believe that an economy's strength is determined by the liquidity of currency. Any usable drugs help strengthen a country's currency by keeping it in circulation and keeping the average person working. 


More powerful drugs, I still support the regulation of. It would reduce the amount of people in prison and greatly save money for the state, earn more in taxes and appease the average worker. Alcohol has been a drug consumed by man for thousands of years and while it certainly has plenty of negative effects, most people still use it. As with other drugs, if it makes people happy and ends up net contributing to the greater good, I'm willing to accept a slight change in culture. ","1425168389"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;We take more than we give back to this planet

This planet is a ball floating through space. It's not alive. Anthropomorphizing it is probably not the best approach given the point you are trying to make.

&gt;We farm the shit out of it, deplete resources, strip land of its worth and nourishment.

Animals would and often do do the exact same thing if given the chance- that is in fact partly what causes our damage to some ecosystems, as we accidentally introduce new species to areas they aren't native to, decimating the local ecosystem. They don't seem to feel bad about it. 

&gt;We alter and destroy ecosystems on a whim, and don't offer a balance to the harm we do on this planet.

a lot of things alter and destroy ecosystems, and ecosystems change due to numerous outside influences over time, and this can include species, including our own. And again- the planet's only relevance is that we can live on it. It's not alive.

&gt;How much longer do you think we can continue dumping trash into our ocean, poisoning our water supply, farming crops? How much longer do you think before we pollute the planet beyond saving? I'm just as guilty as the next guy. 

How much longer can people make idiotic rhetorical questions? The Planet doesn't need ""saving""- if anything does, it would be humanity itself.

&gt;Humanity IS a stain on this planet. We are no longer in balance with nature.

The reason animals seem to ""naturally"" balance ecosystems is because they have limited capabilities, and upheavals appear either very slowly (eg one species slowly goes extinct) or instantly (mass extinctions). The reason we are not entire subject to it is because we don't rely on nature to provide for us- that is, I mean, we don't sit around waiting for wild plants and animals to wander onto our plates, we culture and work the land to fill that requirement. Unlike humans, Rabbits don't grow fields of grass, they breed to populations sustainable by their food supply until that food supply dwindles and the population goes down because they start to starve to death. You're pointing out things being unfair, but somehow have more empathy for a ball of rock than African children starving to death, because in your idea it's ""balance"". 

&gt; We look for ways to live longer, outlast and outsmart disease. Maybe those diseases were a way to cull the herd, wipe out the weak.

Bacteria and Viruses evolve to. That's all new diseases are- they aren't ""designed"" for any purpose. New diseases appear because populations of pathogens change over time based on changes in their environments, just as with any population. 

Also- to suggest there are two 'sides'- eg, Humanity versus Nature- perhaps ignores a rather critical point, which is that we got the tools with which to do all the things you mentioned- our intelligence- through completely natural processes. It's not Man versus nature, it's Nature versus itself, since we are, by definition, natural.

&gt;We altered and changed that. We are unethical beings, it is our core and motivation. I don't see an argument against that. Eating meat? That's the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unethical things we do. 

If you want to go to the logical conclusion, than Humanity is not the Earth's worst enemy. The sun is. We may be a ""stain"" on this planet, but we are neither capable nor have the inclination to incinerate it to a crisp, stripping it of it's atmosphere and killing every single living thing on it (because we're one of them), turning it into a molten ball of rock orbiting a red giant. No, the Sun is going to do that. What is that ""for""? 

Earth is a planet orbiting a main sequence star which will incinerate it in 4.5 billion years regardless of whether we decide to all eat hummus. It is the only place we know of that we can live on, that is why we should preserve it- so it can remain habitable for future generations. Not because we can invent rhetoric that villianizes humanity while anthropomorphizing natural processes. Not because our intelligence has allowed us to cultivate and control the land. You may as well say nature is angry during a thunderstorm.

&gt; The pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions. In the one recent comparative study of pregnancy morbidity in the United States, pregnancy-related complications were more common with childbirth than with abortion.

The real question isn't why you WOULD need more than 15 rounds, since when we involve ""would"" the whole argument becomes pretty pointless. Anything *would* happen in the right conditions. I'd like to see some actual empirical evidence, like a study or some statistics, on what DOES happen - how many legitimate uses of a gun have been hindered by round-capacity bans, and how many of these were life-or-death? Has anyone ever been killed while switching magazines, trying to defend their property?

If it only wipes out 99% of the bats, then we'd expect to perhaps see a resistance develop and recolonization of impacted caves eventually, if they aren't extirpated from the area completely. And some of those caves which were devastated have shown an increase in bats since the populations plummeted when WNS hit them, but it was an increase of tens to hundreds out of tens of thousands of bats that were there previously. Since bats only have one pup at a time and we've lost 6 million bats so far, it will take quite a long time for those populations to reach their previous size, even without threats like wind turbines, pesticides, and increasingly fragmented habitats.

I hold that the definition of continents is artificial, and therefore subject to interpretation based on differing assumptions (including your assumptions). You hold that the definition of Europe and Asia is a geographical absolute, a hard fact, and that the definition that you have chosen to accept is the only possible definition. We're clearly approaching this question based on two fundamentally different and incompatible sets of assumptions about the nature of continents. That to me is an impasse that we can argue about until the cows come home without resolution.

No its not, The FFEL was closed in 2010. The FFEL was the indirect loan program where federal guarantees to loans were made to private institutions (this includes making the loans undischarable in bankruptcy). When this facility ended in 2010 the entire third party lending market dried up (because the protection from bankruptcy discharability was removed). 

So no, you are incorrect. While there are loans that are managed by third parties (as a cost saving measure to the government), all principal was initially lent by the US government for virtually all loans after 2010 and all interest (minus a loan maintenance fee charged by the third party, which in a lot of cases is a non-profit) is paid to the US Government. In the state of Michigan this entity is called ""Great Lakes Borrowing Services"".

I agree with this: although a bike's less dangerous than a car, it's still dangerous, and as such, comes with responsibilities.

&gt; This means lights and visible indicators

It does now, and i don't particularly disagree with your position -- the road rules are kind of what society's agreed on.  They're not totally mad rules, they're pragmatic, and probably optimal in one way or another.

&gt; If you're on the road, then it is you responsibility ... to ensure that you are well seen.

This makes sense in that we've decided that the roads are a dangerous place.  [It wasn't always that way](http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history).  My sympathy for the hardline view is hopelessly idealistic: the streets should be safe, and if you want the benefits of speed, you have to take full responsibility for that.  This means not demanding others go out of their way to help you go faster.

I'm happy to live by the rules as they are -- they're practical after all -- but i think they should be viewed as a compromise, rather than ""the way things ought to be"".","1425168403"

Please carefully read [this article](http://money.howstuffworks.com/socialism.htm), beginning to end.  One salient quote:

&gt; ""True socialists advocate a completely classless society, where the government controls all **means of production and distribution of goods**.""

Socialism is the midpoint on the economic scale from communism to capitalism.  It has nothing to do with allowing guns or marijuana, both of which are socially liberal positions by the way.  (Socially conservative means that the government should legislate morality and potentially anti-social behavior; socially liberal means that people should be allowed to do as they like).","1425168405"

"pagan","t5_2rmnm","I don't understand why you have to practice magic to practice a pagan religion, so I'm not really sure I understand the question. I mean, I offer sacrifice to my Gods and then they give me the gifts they want to dole out in return. They might not be the gifts I asked for, but they're *something*. Sometimes it can be difficult to discern what those gifts are, certainly.

I guess I don't understand why, if you want a tangible experience, you would even bother with magic at all. Magic is often a metaphysical thing, I think. I think those that have a worldviews which allow them to perceive more metaphysical things can tap into that...whatever that stuff is. So I think magic can be both psychologically self-helping and also a physical thing, depending on perception. I can't say there is a definitive answer on the subject.

I do think that we should rely more on the practical and physical means we have to accomplish things though. I mean, magic could work physically or not, but we know for a fact that if we lock the front door we will be safer in our homes than if we placed a rune of protection on the door but did *not* lock it. Maybe if we did both, we'd be even safer. 

I do think that if you're trying to work magic and you don't like the results, you should probably stop. And furthermore, develop a religious ritual that does not involve casting spells or working magic. I'm very happy with Heathenism because it is a gift exchange, rather than a manipulation of magical/metaphysical energy, so it makes more sense to me.","1425168414"

"minecraftsuggestions","t5_2s3oo","Yeah I know. :) I was thinking more along the lines of having it be a separate controllable entity which would allow for better camera angles in single player situations.

For example, if you were in a single player world and you wanted to take a picture of yourself with your creation without taking up the entire middle of the picture (say you wanted to put yourself on the bottom right third). It basically would give the player much more control over camera angles.

Although, like sidben mentioned, I think this would shine the most in map making situations and youtubing scenarios of people that didn't have alts or a second computer.","1425168417"

... That's... Huh. What if it isn't about him? Could harry request Voldemort take him to the hall of Prophecy to hear the prophecy himself? He could offer to help Voldemort in preventing its passing, if he knew the exact wording, and Voldemort would want to prevent it. I don't see how Harry would want the prophecy to pass, so they should be in mutual agreement over heading there in order to work together to prevent it.

And if it wasn't about Harry, Voldemort would have no reason to kill him, or at least not over the prophecy alone, which would buy Harry some time. And being in the Hall of Prophecy should give Harry some time to think and give him a new avenue of attack.","1425168418"

Furthermore, America is printing money as a counter to China's predatory mercantilism strategies, and due to the way it is cheating all the trade and financial rules.  Being the reserve currency is not necessarily beneficial to a nation.  Indeed, crashing the dollar value will make American industrial products the cheapest in the world, and we will then wipe the floor with China and Germany.","1425168418"

Totally uncreepy and I was going to give him my number.

I was speechless and had no idea how to react. Oliver forced me to the ground, ripping off his suit and throwing it across the library. I looked up at him and saw his gigantic cock, now hard as a rock. I knew now why my boss had taken me to his beach house, it was to fuck me.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","That wasn't exactly what I meant. I meant more to elaborate on the fact that nicotine is adsorbed in definable quantities via the mouth and nose. As for if it is as well absorbed in the mouth as the lung, I do not know. For that we would need to know the pH level of the nicotine and whether it is unionized.

For example, cigarettes are traditionally flue cured, and have pH level of around 6, and there mucus absorption is very low because most of the nicotine is ionized. However Cigars that are air cured have a pH level of 6.5 or more and thus have more unionized nicotine and absorb within the mouth at a much faster rate.

As I said, I don't have all the information on pH levels of nicotine in vapor so I can't say how the tobacco studies would translate. However [this](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/general-e-liquid-discussion/3204-ph-values-harshness-eliquid.html) post sheds some possible light that the pH levels of nicotine in e-liquid is between 7.8 - 8.5

Generally words won't do it but when you stand up, it can be interpreted as action stepping toward the realm of a battery. Like maybe you hopped off the stool and he really thought you were going to swing. 

""Your honor, it didn't look like my friend really wanted to be bothered anymore so I stepped in between them. I was a little rude but then he shot back 'fuck off' and got off his stool quickly. I really thought he was going to attack me so I hit him.""

The narrative really isn't in your favor. Especially since the area was littered with his friends and that was who gave statements. My advice: I doubt THEY will press charges (for what, a bruised hand?). You don't need a defense attorney in any way. Suing them will be tough as the witnesses are in their favor. If the police call you or you get any paperwork in the mail then call an attorney. ","1425168432"

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","Well, that's easy. If you're defining ""selfish act"" purely as something that brings the actor some benefit, and if you leave the definition of ""benefit"" to be decided on a case-by-case basis, you will always find a way to show that every action brings benefit to the actor. You need a more solid definition of benefit. 


But, that's ok, let's assume we have such a definition. This definition is solid and makes it possible to show that every action brings some benefit to the actor of said action. We can still change the definition of ""selfish"" act. Imagine this, let's define ""selfish act"" as an act that is based on the intention of bringing the actor more benefits than any other party involved in the action. Then, let's define ""unselfish act"" to be the negation of ""selfish act"", that is, any act that is based on the intention of bringing more benefits to others than to yourself. Then it's easier to imagine an unselfish act.

And there's also the fact that, if you define that every action brings some benefit to the actor, then there's no reason to argue that no action brings no benefits to its actor, simply because you just defined that every action does. ","1425168433"
"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","I get where you're coming from.. people who think philosophy is just speculation are very annoying, but on the other side of things there are people who misunderstand that not everything philosophical falls under formal philosophy... Speculative thinking for example can be considered philosophical,  but its certainly not what formal philosophers practice.  

The point here as I said is, that given the context I think it was obvious to assume that the author of the post didn't claim that this was formal philosophy, but that it contained some philosophical content.  Considering what a broad spectrum that covers I think it's pretty hard to disagree with that point.. 

And the fact that people confuse the two is not the fault of people who post things under the title of philosophical,  but the fault of those people who generalize the concept into something so much narrower than it really is.","1425168433"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","All matter has positive mass and energy. Anything that crosses the event horizon will add positive mass to the system. Even antiparticles have positive mass and energy. A black hole will never spit anything back out as that is impossible.

Now when it comes to Hawking radiation it gets more complicated. All around you particle/antiparticle pairs are being created and near instantaneously annihilated. My understanding of this is fuzzy at best but as I understand it they essentially borrow this energy from the space around them but since they quickly annihilate each other this doesn't break the conservation of energy. Now when a pair is created near the event horizon and one of them falls within it and the other shoots off away a real particle is created. This is a problem because those particles where supposed to destroy each other to give back the energy they borrowed. Because of the conservation of energy real particles cannot be created from nothing. So where does this energy come from? Well in this case it is hypothesized that it is stealing it from the black hole.","1425168434"

In Japanese, text is written from right to left. Why not confuse the reader more by writing from top to bottom, from bottom to top, or even developing its own shape- squares, circles, a spiral, or a complete image, or even origami. There are limitless ways in which to encrypt a message.

But do you think that stops them or even worries them? Successful companies know what it takes and get the job done. Internet marketing is a two way street, and expecting it to be rosey is frankly naive. Everything in life comes with a cost, and dealing with morons in the cost of utilizing the internet. And they're making a game to tap a **niche** **enthusiast** market, do they not realize what level of crazy that exposes them to?

Yet somehow, the gaijin team manages to sound indignant. Its a grown-up world. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Cynically, its a smart move on their part, because they can't control the discussion.

Lest any of us feel like Gaijin is the wounded party here. Remember they are first and foremost a business, and they've been jackanapes to us. From using dicks like Scarper to moderate the chat, to obvious game breaking bugs that survive weeks to months. And the grind has been shown, mathematically, to have gone up several fold since last year. And the icing on the cake, they can't even be bothered to get the english spelling or grammar in the game correct. 

So, I'm sorry, but I can't feel sympathy for a business that can't stay on message, market its product properly, or control the story. Its not our job to have a long debate over whether boosters are better than X2s, it's *their* job convince us. And I can't see this move as anything but a cold, calculated decision to leave an avenue that fails to profit them.","1425168436"

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

The thing is, I think your whole argument is based on the idea that ""gay"" meaning homosexual and ""gay"" as an insult are two different things.

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","Two points. First, so the dude below can have a little visibility, I will mention Wukong as an archetypal example of a strong early bruiser whose late game team-fight potential never falls off. There are others (Vi stands for Viable) but the point should be made that not all bruisers trade a weak late game for early dueling power.

Secondly, I think your picks are interesting but I'm not sure about Fiddlesticks specifically. Amumu has a lot of straightforward power that's hard to deny, especially late game, and he's only been waiting for the meta to reach a place where he can be picked competitively without a guaranteed fight for lvl 1 blue. 

EDIT: end of reply got cut off. Picking up: 

Fiddlesticks, however, is more situational. Rarely will a pro team get the opportunity to land a flawless Fiddlesticks ult when the other team knows to expect it. Not that I think he's bad; even at top level, Fiddle has a place in solo play. It's just that the window in which to make plays is smallest at the competitive level and Fiddle requires the enemy to get out of position and stay there for at least a second or so. Amumu, by contrast, can initiate the same way but does so nigh instantly. ","1425168440"

Ao Kuang is powerful, but nowhere near the level he was at, his base damage has been reduced and is in a much better place now.

Loki, in the time that I've played the game has never been overpowered, he was easily countered by Aegis and not getting caught out alone.

Anubis was not considered very good (at least in the west) last season, because of his lack of escapes and the fact that he has to SIT STILL for his largest damage.

Hercules' nerfs to his AA damage and passive have taken him down to a place where he has to build more damage to deal more damage.

Apollo, while being IMO one of the most ridiculous gods last season has had his clear massively reduced, and now actually takes skill to play.

Freya, to be honest, I haven't payed enough attention to Freya to have anything to say here.

Not saying Bellona is OP but Ao Kuang isn't, at least not right now. I think that we need to give people time to learn to counter Bellona, instead of crying for nerfs immediately.","1425168441"

"japanlife","t5_2rg2o","Ideally, it would be best if the apartment was in your name. So you're better off staying somewhere for a week first and then finding a real estate agent in the area you want to stay in. Most real estate agents advertise the same properties in the same area. It's a pretty fast process to get the key to your place.

Some agents maybe iffy to rent out to you, especially if you don't have an income yet. So they may ask you to pay for the whole year, at a discounted rate, or they'll trust you. Depending on how much your monthly rent is, your initial down payment could be anywhere from 3x upwards to cover guarantor fee, insurance, cleaning fee, key fee, thank you fee, etc.

As per motorcycle/scooter, as it is a motor vehicle I'll assume the same laws apply as a motor vehicle. Can someone clarify please? You will need to rent a car space, without a car space you're not allowed to purchase a motor vehicle. Spots in Osaka, around Namba, cost about 20,000¥-30,000¥/month.

"HyruleWarriors","t5_30t9v","What I've found works for me on Adventure Mode G-7 (at least more consistently than the King Dodongo method with Hylian Sword Link):

[From this post by /u/HylianAngel](http://www.reddit.com/r/HyruleWarriors/comments/2wtnjw/max_rupee_glitch/):

&gt; 1. The Giant Boss will use a move that allows you to reveal its Weak Point.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Use the appropriate secondary weapon (Arrows / Bombs / Hookshot).
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Use C3.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. C3 is the Manhandla attack. When the Manhandla starts dropping seeds, dash-cancel out of the animation.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Use C1.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Immediately dash-cancel away from the Giant Boss. There should be a very obvious light ring, or halo, surrounding the Giant Boss.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Do not enter the halo as this will activate a Weak Point Smash.
&gt; 
&gt; 8. Spam C1 several times.
&gt; 
&gt; 9. If you summon Argorok, activate C5.
&gt; 
&gt; 10. Defeat the Giant Boss.

I try to kill as few of the surrounding enemies as possible while doing this. Once Gohma has the light ring around it, I run out of lock-on range from it, back next to the middle keep. Once there, I spam C1 until I get Argorok and ride it all the way back to Gohma and kill it.

As you're heading back towards Gohma on Argorok, you'll notice that the remaining enemies all run towards Gohma and group around it. When you kill Gohma, you'll also kill some of the other enemies as well, possibly at the same time Gohma dies. 

I've found that this appears to be the key to this glitch. It seems that both times I got it to work last night were times where I managed to kill enemies at the same time as Gohma. I also steered away from Gohma as soon as I killed it so that I did not prolong its death animation or kill any additional troops around it. Of course, it could've just been luck too.

Hope this helps!","1425168446"
"woahdude","t5_2r8tu","It is definitly real. They probably used an equally high suspended car plus a steadycam gimbal to keep the shot clean. The turn might not be too sharp because you can barely see his front wheels turn. It may just look like that because they used a wide angle lens with relatively short focal range while driving very close to each other, subsequently pushing the car away from the front and pulling the wire tower in (or at least that's what your brain thinks). And for the tires being so clean: If the sand as well as the air is really dry, it probably wouldn't really stick to the tires. Also these cars are driving with very high rpms because the low weight of the car and the sandy terrain cause a ridicolous amount of tire skit (the tires don't get a firm grip on the ground and therefore lose a lot of energy) wich also would remove the dirt.","1425168446"

"climatechange","t5_2rawx","&gt;there are far more cars than in the 1980s and far more and bigger coal plants.

Nobody ever said otherwise. What I said was that cars would have the same gas mileage they did in the 1980's and coal plants would have the same emissions. The models absolutely account for more cars and coal plants based on population growth, but the ""business as usual"" scenario assumes that those cars and coal plants would have the same Carbon output they did in the 80s. In reality, cars and coal plants have become more efficient. 

&gt; China (for example) has been just simply doubling and tripling and quadrupling these things at rates making it nearly THE story of the last 40 years.

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","Mostly off-topic, but...

&gt; I would like to add at this point that stoicism does not necessarily say that the only thing you can control is yourself.

Um, yes, it does. Irvine's popular modern presentation modifies it to say otherwise, but in historical Stoicism, the primary distinction is between ""internals"" and ""externals,"" and the ""in your control"" terminology is just a variation on this. (edit: and within ""internals"", ""virtue"" and ""vice"")

Note that this is not in any way intended as a criticism of your views on red pill, about which I know too little to comment, although it's a little inconvenient that they've hijacked a useful metaphor. In the original scene in the Matrix, it was about the choice between ""truth and pain"" and ""ignorance and bliss"". The plausibility that at least some people would choose the former is interesting evidence against the assertion that all human behaviour is essentially hedonistic, which is part of the long debate between Epicureanism and Stoicism. This other community doesn't seem to be about choosing pain at all, though, but something else entirely, and so the reference now has inconvenient baggage.","1425168448"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; is the indoctrination of children into a religion moral?

No you are teaching a child before the age of reason that they have to believe the world is like that, and not showing them what the world is really like. 

&gt; blatant propaganda and oversimplify the Bible, 

A lot of atheists I know became atheists because they really read the bible and see how horrible it really is. You could just cherry pick the best parts of Nazism and Stalin's rule and make it seem great also. 

&gt; How would atheist/secularist indoctrination compare on this arbitrary scale to religious indoctrination?

It doesn't there is no such thing. I think you are talking about teaching people to be scientific literacy, to think for themselves, and how to view evidence and how to evaluate evidence for it's legitimacy. 

&gt; How do other religions compare?

I remember in bible school the answers to a lot of my questions was just because or just side skipping the question. They don't have answers they just tell kids this is how it is over and over until the kid believes it. That is indoctrination.

Do you think indoctrination is necessary for the survival of religion? 
Very much so, why these major religious groups are trying so hard to get religion into school and going after kids.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I'm not sure how such a cult could ever be ""organic expressions of genuine support"" from below. Whatever about popular support for the Soviet regime (which remains a contentious topic), the organs through which the Stalin cult was propagated were always tightly controlled by the Party. That is, newspapers, party cells, rituals/parades, portraiture, theatre, congresses, literature, etc were never neutral conduits for popular sentiments to be aired in. Such media/channels existed to propagate the official discourse, not provide a platform for popular opinion. After all, this was a dictatorship.

Nor would the assumption of ""genuine support"" explain the evolution of the cult. Prior to 1933 it had tended to focused on the leadership as a whole, portraying Stalin as merely first-among-equals within this collective leadership. From 1933 onwards it quickly shifted so that Stalin's sun eclipsed all other Soviet leaders; it's only at this point that the more ridiculous sentiments, such as 'Stalin is love', begin to be aired and Stalin himself is imbued with superhuman powers. This was a response to the shifting political realities within the Communist Party, something that was not readily visible to ordinary workers or peasants.

What this doesn't mean, of course, is that the cult was planned and executed by a shadowy cabal of Soviet spin doctors at the very top of government. But those ""sections of the people"" who had a role in developing and encouraging the cult were the same writers, journalists, artists, etc, who relied on the state/Party for patronage and direction. Rather, it's worth speaking instead about the emergence of a Stalinist intelligentsia and how that shaped social discourse.

Which is not to forget the Party itself, naturally. A local Party report from 1936 gives a taste of the, slightly hysterical, role of that this played at all levels of society in pushing the cult's messages:

&gt; During agitation and propaganda in the press there must be more popularisation of the *vozhdi* [Party bosses]. Love for them must be fostered and inculcated in the masses and unlimited loyalty, especially by cultivating the utmost love for comrade Stalin and the other leaders amongst children and young people, inculcating Soviet patriotism and bringing them to fanaticism and love and defence of comrade Stalin and our socialist motherland.

This was after all one of the key purposes of the Party and its extensive apparatus: control. The messages that it, and the media, publicly distributed were dictated from above. This includes the personality cult.

Sources: See Sarah Davies' *Popular Opinion in Stalin's Russia* and Shelia Fitzpatrick's *Everyday Stalinism*.","1425168456"

Push/splash/scoop some of that onto the ice in your driveway on a warmer day. It also helps if you can chip away at the ice surface a bit. Increase the surface area and let the salt and warmer air penetrate deeper into the ice.

It won't clear away the packed ice instantly, but over a few days it will weaken the ice enough you can begin breaking off large chunks.","1425168463"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","I just fail to see what intent does - these monarchs were all quite ruthless in the service of various goals. 'Bloody Mary' was not significantly more bloody than the others - all of the reigns saw quite a bit of turmoil, political and religious, and plenty of persecution and execution on all fronts. Henry was pretty equal opportunity on killing both Catholics and too-protestant Protestants (like Luther*a*ns). Edward was pretty staunchly Protestant and really brought around the Church of England from Pope-Free Catholicism and specifically disinherited Mary in favor of his Protestant cousin - so I'm not sure how Elizabeth can be claimed to have killed Catholics in a better light as 'just protecting her throne' when the same could be said of Mary - Protestants quite clearly represented a threat to her reign. I mean, she was specifically disinherited for her Catholicism by her brother. She just got the epithet 'bloody' because she was bloody in service of a losing proposition, and the winners write the history. Had she lived a bit longer and been successful in bringing England back to Catholicism (which some historians believe she may have done with a longer reign), she'd have had a nicer name. When Elizabeth came in and solidified the Protestant faith in England, Mary got villianized in history as a Papist and a tyrant.","1425168465"

A 125 or 250 would be better.  Top end speed is a concern, and unless that 30 miles is ALL on inner city streets that have a 25-30 MPH limit, you're going to be slower than traffic. Added to that you'll have almost 0 acceleration, which is what you want to use to avoid traffic incidents.

Hell, buy one of the Symba SYM100's. It's a converted Honda C90, and multiple people have driven those on 1000-3000 mile tours. It'll hit 50+ pretty easily, and they cost 2300 or so brand new.","1425168467"

At first they financially supported my study/school but that was held over my head as a means of making me come home every week. I solved that by quitting the study and start working. I was just so pissed off and fed up that I would do whatever it took to get control over my own life. So pissed off that I no longer really cared what my parents thought or did. I've been NC for up to a year from my 18th until my 33rd birthday but I tend to call it LC because sometimes I would give contact a try for a few months. Needless to say that never went well. I went NC after my mother tried to mingle in my marriage and subsequent divorce, and taking the side of my ex. That was the final straw that proved beyond any lingering doubt that she would never be on my side. And it made my blood boil. Mainly because I spent 15 years giving it try after try. I decided then and there that it had become pointless to try and have a normal relationship with my parents. So I changed my phone number, moved away and simply never looked back.

I was simply exhausted and completely done with it. I think what took courage was building a life worth living after that. The breaking contact part was basically just blind rage.","1425168476"
"woahdude","t5_2r8tu","Let me first of say what I am not and what I am. I am not a political scientist, and I do not have any affiliation with FairVote beyond supporting them. So if you were expecting a formal analysis you're going to be disappointed.

I am a software engineer, and we're deep enough in the comments that I feel safe enough to confirm that [we are the worst](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090616165515AAdX3nm).  Also let me say I appreciate your questions, they're helping me think deeply about this subject.

That said, I'm not looking for ""change for change's sake"" and I'm also not a fan of ranked-choice voting for its intrinsic properties. I do believe that the current system is flawed because it makes for an inefficient marketplace of ideas, in that it forms 2 parties. The 2 parties are coalitions of ideas that challenge each other in primary elections, but support for voting is so weak that those are poorly attended. (making voting accessible is another platform of FairVote!)

The problems that I would like to see fixed are:

* Partisianship in the US is extremely high from my perspective. I hear stories from old politicians retiring saying that they used to be able to work across the aisle, but now can't. With the internet, we can pick and choose media outlets that agree with us which only amplifies partisanship.
* I'm frustrated with not being able to vote my conscience. Imagine I'm a generic hunter. I like gun rights and the environment. What party can I vote for? Parties are punishing their members for working outside the party, so it becomes harder to find a politician who will be pro-gun and pro-environment.
* It's difficult to make legislative progress on issues when there's gridlock. Same-sex marriage is happening through ballots and the courts, not through the legislature. By making third-parties viable, important issues can come from our representatives. When I think about weird ideas like universal basic income, even if it became an economic necessity (one of many futures) I couldn't see a way for it to progress given the direction the legislature is headed.

Now, again as a software engineer, I'm looking at the system that produced this situation and looking for a lever to apply. From my perspective a ranked choice voting system will push those things in the right direction.

All that said, we're pretty far from my original statement which was, to paraphrase, ""gerrymandering sucks, FairVote is a non-profit that is working on fixing that."" And you've offered me a lot to think about, but aside from positing that IRV is susceptible to tactical voting you haven't really taken a position. So what's your stance in general? What about on the priorities of ranked-choice voting, gerrymandering, and the problems in my bullet list?","1425168476"

Legalidade das cláusulas de acordo com que lei, a brasileira? Lembre-se que esses empréstimos são muito provavelmente condicionados à uma regulação internacional.

Fire b7 - its not that hard, as long as you counter the bombs, a maxed out Konamiya or Lulu is amazing here: Ahman, Belladeon, Arnold, succubus/vamp, konamiya would work well

Wind b7 - you have to counter the healling, Your Jokers, and Death Knights can do that! You also have some nice fire monsters already, should be a grea thelp DMG wise: Sath, Arnold, Raoq, Ahman, Jojo

Water - Just focus on dmg, personalyl I find b7 water to be the easiest of all b7s Aarang, wind pierette, Briand, ahman, belladeon would be an easy win

Light - Any DMG team would work her, you have to have high burst and anti buff, Megan (water mystic witch is great here)

Dark can be approached same as light, it just has more cont dmg, Konamiya/Lulu is a great addition.

Basically getting Ahman + Belladeon + Darion is a way to go for every single hall, then you could roatate last 2 monsters depending on need. If you think you have enough dmg to pull off a very speedy run just alter the groups depending on need/runes.","1425168479"

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","Howard Zinn did very good research, but his actual writing is honestly very hack-ish. He twists everything to fit into his one extremely simplistic narrative of history being all rich people conspiring together in a war against all poor people. He's particularly bad about acknowledging the existence of racism and anti-Native sentiment amongst poor whites.

The US did maintain slavery after the Revolutionary War... in large part because the South threatened to secede over the issue. Surprise, surprise. 

But the War for Independence was not a war fought *for* slavery.

&gt; Slavery had already been banned in pretty much every major nation on earth, except the U.S., well before the northern states did.

This is completely untrue.

&gt; The North banned slavery a few years before the South rebelled

If ~50 is ""a few."" And most Northern states had all but phased slavery out of existence shortly after Independence. There was a lot of anti-slavery sentiment across the nation during the Revolutionary War, although it died out in the South, especially with the rise of cotton.

&gt; Our forefathers foresaw such a day in the future and expressly validated a separation if and when such a day was necessary. The South took Mr. Jefferson up on the ideal he drew upon to declare independence from England.

The Revolutionary War's slogan was, ""No taxation without representation."" The South's slogan might as well have been, ""No taxation or representation if I can't get what I want.""

The South wasn't shut out of the electoral process. If anything, the 3/5 Compromise gave them undue weight, letting them count slaves towards their political power and against those slaves' own interests.

Rather, the South threw a tantrum and withdrew because they didn't like the results of a free and fair election.

Slavery issue aside, absolutely no democracy can survive that. Elections become a farce if the loser can just cry off and go home.","1425168481"

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","Sounds like you've got the mindset for success! Just a word of caution: naltrexone isn't free of side effects. Blocking all opioid receptors can cause irritability and sometimes rage. Can cause depression too because you aren't getting as much natural endorphins as you normally would. If you find yourself feeling bad, angry, or even anxious, it could very well be the implant so don't  only think it's you. That's the complication with using drugs to combat problems. You don't know what is causing what. Talk to others who've used naltrexone to get the real picture of what you will be dealing with. I remember the mod, /u/SheriffOfNoddinGram as someone who has been on the Vivitrol shot, which is basically the same thing. Pm him for advice. Naltrexone is great, but only if you work on all the other stuff too. Work with your doctor on getting you the right meds and make sure you are doing okay with the implant. There is no free lunch, unfortunately. It ain't gonna be easy. But that's life. Freedom is the prize here. Good luck, OP!","1425168486"

Overigens denk ik dat straffen wel een goed idee zijn en het collectieve welzijn bevorderen, maar dat kan ook in de vorm van rehabilitatie waar mogelijk en psychotherapeutische/psychiatrische behandeling waar nodig, en dat gebeurt ook wel in Nederland volgens mij. Het is meer in o.a. de V.S. waar gevangenisstraffen het recidivisme verhogen. Dat (zware) criminelen soms geïsoleerd worden van de maatschappij is noodzakelijk als je het potentieel gevaar voor de samenleving overweegt. Maar het lijkt me dat criminelen met elkaar in een gebouw opsluiten en onpersoonlijk en ruw behandelen juist mensen introduceert aan de onderwereld en kans op recidivisme verhoogt. Ik heb daar enkel rapportages over gelezen en geen peer-reviewed onderzoeken dus correcties zijn welkom.

Maar er is natuurlijk een budget en er zijn dingen die mensen belangrijker vinden dan het comfort van criminelen, en dat verwijdt ik ze niet.
Ik streef gelukkig ook naar een blijere samenleving en ik denk dat de sleutel daartoe ligt in innovatie en technologie als ik afga op de geschiedenis; zeker de afgelopen 300 jaar. Zo lang we de technologie in de toekomst maar verantwoord weten te gebruiken. Wellicht kunnen we ooit vrije wil realiseren in de zin dat onze ratio en bewustzijn de volledige controle over het lichaam en de rest van de hersenen heeft.

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","meringue is a foam consisting of [a gaseous phase as well as an aqueous phase.](https://books.google.com/books?id=1OhFPZ7tFz8C&amp;pg=PA382&amp;lpg=PA382&amp;dq=chemistry+meringue+and+salt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TihAoYvuBL&amp;sig=1X1mzJIBWIBNQRSiplqlPTc3Lwc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g07yVKCbENjXoATAjYGYDA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=meringue&amp;f=false) p 380

Foaming properties are determined by a few factors like pH, salts, sugars and lipds. 

**pH**

Foam stability at different pH will vary depending on the protein itself, and highest stability occurs around the isoelectric point(pI) or when the protein has no net charge. 

For egg whites foamability is actually good at two ranges, pH 8-9, slightly basic and its pI point pH 4-5, while more stable around the pI.

**salts**

With salts (NaCl), the egg white protein's foamability as well as the stability both increase with increasing concentration of the salt. 

note above i mentioned that egg white foams are most stable at the pI where proteins carry no charge. The charges from Na+ and Cl- interact with charges from the proteins that are denatured. And in egg whites, proteins that are salted out (came out of solution due to the addition of the salt), improve the foaming and the stability of the foam. 

An exception of this is whey proteins which gets salted IN (stays in solution) and performs the opposite way with the addition of the salt. 

**sugars**

The reason sugars are considered part of the structure of the meringue is because sugars are viscous in liquids and that add stability to the foam. 

**lipids**

Lipids like fats in egg yolks, never do well in foams due to it's tendency to aggregate on the surface of the bubbles and then end up popping, and in doing so, they also prevent proteins from forming the bubbles. 

So can you make a meringue using salt? yes. It improves the foamability as well as the stability. 

I would probably add it at whipping stage along with sugars if I were to do it. 

I may even do it without the sugar since you're looking for confusing taste.

But to be able to bend it at a 30 degree angle when you feel full mast is a slight concern. I would definitely look into blood flow. I'm glad it's never been an issue during sex bc from my experience if a woman is on top or man on top just a wrong move will bend the penis leading to terrible pain and loss of erection, if you can bend it that much without pain, raises questions. Has it always been this way? Say when you first discovered masturbation/erections? Side note: the more tissue around a penis, the softer it will seem even when HARD. I.e. thicker penis, more skin, less firmness. Kind of like fatty tissue surrounding the muscles.

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","Surveys aren't ""shoddy"". They're good for exploratory and qualitative research. Scientists and researchers make extensive use of surveys. These researchers chose to interview a group of people about the their perceptions of any video games they played. I fail to see how that's worse than comparing two characters in one game. Much more ground is covered if respondents use their entire experience.

The sample is the problem in this study, not the research design. University students are not the most representative sample.

&gt; I disagree that skin showing alone is indicative of sexualization, as described in the next sentence. Typical female clothing styles have more skin. If Video Games reflect female clothing preferences, then women would show ore skin.

You can't really dismiss it as ""typical female clothing styles show more skin"" without knowing which characters they were examining. Do typical women also show lots of cleavage?

&gt; But you can't prove sexualization just by looking at exposed skin.

A song is just like that.

So imagine that instead of using all the colours and different brushes and different styles they were limited to primary colours, a thick brush, and straight lines.

That's how cheap headphones make music sound. The sound of the bow strings breaking is just as much a part of the song as the sound the violin makes. The sound of the piano or drums bleeding into another instrument's microphone in an album is part of the entire experience.

Rumor has it papa shango kind of took the lead on the super-exclusive private sub or whatever, though I think he's skulking around here somewhere.

It seems BST's (I think it was him and OTTO) AMA on /r/fitness attracted a lot of uneducated subscribers, people who obviously wouldn't have come otherwise. That's the cost of education.

I know one prominent member has come back under a new account. The ladies are laying down the ban-hammer over on /r/steroidsxx, reveling in their new-found mod powers, despite most of the posts just being dudes who can't post on /r/steroids yet, so none of the threads are legit discussion. 

I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""migrated over here"", this is a new account of mine and most of the other faces on this sub seem new as well. Personally, I'm rather pleased with how most of this has turned out, some of the background dealing and chatter between the old /r/steroids members was a bit sketchy. This sub is openly sketchy, lol, plus some of the established dealers here seem pretty good. I didn't like the elitist vibe on the old /r/steroids very much, it was very difficult to get in on conversation if you weren't in the club.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","While the western media has a field day vilifying Putin, the situation is more nuanced. http://kushnirs.org/macroeconomics/gdp/gdp_russia.html should be obligatory reading. The executive summary is that '90s in Russia were a time of a great depression, the GDP cratered by a whooping 65%. Under Putin, Russia's GDP grew by a whooping 1000%. That's right, 10 times. These are plain economic facts and should explain pretty easily why Putin approval rate is 86%.

The political landscape is also quite interesting. The '90s were the time when a bunch of thugs got the mineral rights of huge swaths of Russia as essentially a free gift. Privatization was the name of the game, and was heavily pushed by Western institutions. Then said thugs rushed to sell said minerals to the West for pennies on the dollar. While this might sound like savvy business from a Western perspective, the Russians, who at the time saw their quality of life crater, see it more like the Great Rape of Russia's mineral wealth. Putin put an end to this, which should also explain pretty easily why Putin approval rate is 86%. Yes, there is a lot of venomous noise in the Western media of how Putin personally is making a personal fortune over it to the tune of $200 billion dollars, but if Putin were the CEO of Russia inc., turned it around and rose it's market value by $1900.9 billions, the same Western media would lionize him as a captain of industry, benefactor of the world, rightfully earning his pay check, yada yada yada. Of course, this is just speculation, nobody actually sniffed through Putin's alleged Swiss bank accounts and came out with any proof.

And now, Boris Nemtsov, rest in peace. Western media rushed to make him ""the"" Opposition leader to take another cheap shot at Putin. In fact, he was a top aide of Yeltsin during the dirty '90s, currently leading a party with, I remember reading earlier today, less than 1% of the votes. Essentially, somebody that the vast majority of Russia's people don't have a lot of sympathy for. His death is tragic, but claiming that Putin himself has anything to do with it is a big stretch. A more nuanced view is that Russia's atmosphere is very anti West, and that is something the West brought on itself by orchestrating and profiting from the Great Russia Depression in the '90s, and by the continuous policy of military expansion near Russia's borders. Being a pro-Western politician in this atmosphere, alas, is a risky business. There are people that very sadly get crushed by it, especially anti-corruption figures that look at the West for a model and a helping hand. But let's keep in mind that Boris Nemtsov has enough corruption skeletons in his closet due his role in Yeltsin administration.","1425168497"

NOVA doesn't do that anymore, but man, entirely worth it for the first year I was there, especially as I just planned to be there the one year. 

I found the other three places I lived in Japan (was there 6 years before moving back to the US) through friends and had my boss sign as a guarantor in one of the places. Which was a huge relief, as it spared me the trouble of trying to find someone else to be a guarantor for me. ","1425168497"

Thus it goes to the legal department to determine Target's liability about letting you come back.  How severe is it, how much risk does Target run by letting you back, etc.  

Target couldn't press any kind of charge against you since you didn't threaten Target, kidnap that dog of theirs, or anything like that.

24 characters and it seems to fit the bill pretty nicely.

The one thing that points out the leak is correct: It can't just be a random coincidence that this guy was able to guess that Kung Jin was in the game 11 days before the character was shown for the first time. Somebody at NRS is leaking. 

Also on the list: Takeda, Jacqui, Erron Black, and Mileena. They were all shown in the trailer yesterday alongside Kung Jin, more than likely the 5 characters Ed Boon was saying on Twitter were to be revealed.

It would make sense that Rain isn't playable because he doesn't sport a new look of any sort, but a complete ripoff of his Mortal Kombat Armageddon attire. On the other hand, Mileena has an entirely new costume which points out that she's most likely playable. 

Not sure about Shinnok, but his attire looks pretty fresh to. Maybe DLC.

James also strongly confirms the original Mortal Kombat 1 playable roster is in the game. Johnny Cage, Sonya, and Liu Kang will be returning.

Say what you want about rumors and leaks, but I'm pretty sure this is the final initial roster we'll be seeing in the game.

"knitting","t5_2qiu0","Open up a hank and spread it so that it looks like a loop. You could place it on a yarn swift, or just on a table. Grab hold of one section of the loop. Look at the section of the loop, and see which one fits.

If all the strings of yarn where your hand is are always the same colour, you've got variegated yarn. Colour changes are short. You should be able to see that specific sections of the yarn are specific colour. [Like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Opened_yarn_hank.JPG), or [this if it were opened](http://www.keep-on-knitting.com/images/hank.jpg).

If strands are of varying colours, the colour changes are either non-pooling short, or longer gradients. (Or the hank has been re-wound, this is rare though.) If you cake the yarn, and the colour changes gradually from one colour to another, it's a very long gradient yarn. [Like this](http://www.appletreeknits.com/uploads/1/1/1/0/11104650/99280.jpg). You can also tell relatively long colour changes from following one strand, and seeing if it goes all the way around the hank one or more times.

Then there's also the randomly dyed, non-pooling variegated yarns. [Like this](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7524/15609202844_f1780d470c_m.jpg).

Step 1: Transfigure nanowire looping around and about all the death eaters (heads and wand arms preferred)

Step 2: Ensure nanowire has a closed loop at the end around a tombstone

Step 3: Transfigure the nanowire to be *much* shorter (numerous ways of doing this, depends on specific mechanics)

Step 4: Watch everyone fall apart


Bonus points: Shape nanowire to close around Voldemort last, so any magical interaction doesn't have the effect of canceling the nanowire before it can cut everyone up. ","1425168509"

4) Feminism isn't just for ""man-hating lesbians with hairy legs"".

6) If a situation or person makes you feel weird and/or uncomfortable, trust your instinct and get out of there.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","/u/beleuchtung made a great point the other week about Snape perhaps being sent to Hogwarts because he was one of the few Death Eaters who wasn't categorically known to be a Death Eater.  

Of course, knowing Dumbledore and the company he kept, we can surmise that he *did* know that Severus was a Death Eater; but the key factor was that Voldemort seemed unaware that Severus was even remotely suspected by Dumbledore.  

So it could have had very little to do with what Severus' actions were, and more to do with the fact that he didn't have any family with links to Voldemort, which meant that Voldemort believed he was their best shot at gaining a foothold in Hogwarts.  

I can definitely see Severus surprising Voldemort.  I can imagine that Voldemort sent him to get a role as a teacher without his true mission being revealed (whether it was spy, assassin, or something more).  Severus then fails to get the position - but returns with the prophecy instead, which may have earned him a reprieve.  

And then I can see him going to Dumbledore with his fears over Lily, and Dumbledore deciding that Hogwarts is the safest place for him - so I can imagine Severus returning triumphantly to Voldemort, saying that he's got his position (albeit a year late)...and even taking punishment from Voldemort for getting the position without express permission...but Voldemort allowing him to take it because it's a way in.    

...so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to envisage that Voldemort let him take his post at Hogwarts, but still didn't clue him in to the true nature of his role - and before anything further could happen, Voldemort disappeared.  

In those circumstances, when Severus finally drags himself over to the Death Eaters following Voldemort's resurrection, I can see Voldemort being impressed.  Whilst I'm sure he was grateful for the likes of Bellatrix for standing by him and taking her place in Azkaban, Severus actually made himself useful.  

Gone was the 21 year old boy that he'd sent to kick his heels at the school, and in was a powerful 30something wizard - who had the sense not to blow his cover, and had spent his entire adult life ingratiating himself at Hogwarts, being seen as trustworthy, and even learning new skills.  

Given that Voldemort was now surrounded by cowards (who like Lucius had suggested they were imperiused to follow his command), people who'd been mentally tortured in Azkaban so they were slightly unhinged (e.g. Bellatrix, Crouch Jr etc) and followers who were merely weak and fearful (e.g. Pettigrew), it must've been a relief to see Severus standing there with his mind intact and professing to have been faithfully following orders all of this time - and now he was ready to serve once again.","1425168511"

Nietzsche, who is often miscategorized as a nihilist, in fact saw the will to power and his ""might is right"" philosophy as an objective morality, and considered nihilism as a disease. Sartre, another famous existentialist, wrote the famous essay ""Existentialism is a humanism"", proposes essentially that existence precedes essence. In other words, humans don't exist without meaning, but rather that meaning isn't divine and rather we are free to find our own meaning for life and destiny. 

I specifically mentioned only atheist existentialists. There were also Christian existentialists, but obviously, they could refute nihilism by appealing to God and religion.","1425168516"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","&gt; So instead of being bitter at the siblings, it should be more like jealousy (at the fact that his siblings had a better relationship with their father spoiler) since the MC's siblings are unaware of this?

""A man can raise another man's child as his own, but they can never be friends."" - or however Larry Niven put it. Lack of a blood relationship need not have have directly figured into how the father treated his son vs. his siblings - it depends entirely on the son's character. If he is the type to take offense easily, or is sensitive to criticism, or otherwise has a feeling of inadequacy about himself - then yes, his reaction to the knowledge could be a resentment of sorts toward his mother and siblings. But it's probably more a resentment and insecurity about himself, which fuels him lashing out or rejecting those he fears might reject him.

Again, there's ways to show this - a lot of people, when faced with difficult emotions, don't like to face things and set them in simple and direct terms. There is a process to facing your fears and other unpleasant situations, like coming to terms with grief (and I presume that the loss of the only father he's ever known is going to be a wollop in itself). Some people need to talk it through, some people need to write it out, there's usually at least one confrontation - or even a series of confrontations - that the individual dreads-but-longs-for. What ultimately drives his actions (and any transformation in his character) will be when a particular desire drives his resolve to actually meet his mother and say what he has to say - whether that be in two days or twenty years, on the doorstep of the house or on her deathbed, depends entirely on your writing.","1425168516"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No, you've made it dumb enough. You are just being a bit lazy. 

There are many aspects to the problem and I agree that poverty is a big one and perhaps even the biggest. School shootings are simply a good example of how our inability to handle mental health issues intersects with our fascination with guns, i.e. poorly. Mental health care (which includes remediating drug problems to the extent that they can be) helps pull folks out of poverty. If it has the added benefit of preventing another murder suicide like the recent one in Missouri by either getting the person the help they need to prevent that type of behavior or simply removing the weapons from the home until things have improved, more's the better. 

Well adjusted individuals do quite well with guns, just as they do with cars. But if someone is a danger to themselves or to others with guns or with cars we do need to step in to make certain that the risk they pose is minimized. Why do you think we take the keys away from aged folks? The same should apply to the guns owned by folks who have lost touch with reality.

It basically makes you pass more urine with more sodium in it, and also makes you hold on to more potassium. It does this because it blocks a group of steroid receptors from working, and among the many roles of your steroid hormones is regulation of salt and water.

It has, perhaps obviously, side effects on lots of stuff,  including producing breast tissue in men and reducing acne.

But which cluster of effects you get predominantly depends on your own unique cluster of receptors and how active each of your many steroid hormones are, and how their metabolism is going, and which other medications you're taking etc etc.

If you had heart failure and you wanted to feel better, you'd be annoyed if your spiro was not really doing much for your blood pressure, and instead fixing your acne. OP just has they other end of the stick.","1425168520"

Honestly, your benchmark for what constitutes a justifiable existence is completely arbitrary. What if we just as arbitrarily decided that any child who would be forced to live with a family income &lt;20k could not have a worthwhile life, what about &lt;30k, &lt;40k?

"breastfeeding","t5_2rdj4","So....this is my second go around with a nursling!  My daughter is 6, and weaned at 18 months.  I had two inverted nipple when she was born, and could not get her to latch! Her first meal was a bottle of formula, given by a nurse.  We started using a nipple shield, and only used it for two weeks before I took it away.  The only other problem I had was mild Reynaud's.  It resolved on its own 2 months pp.

With my boy, now 16 weeks, I went through hell!  He latched like a champ within 5 minutes of being born.  And he ate, and ate, and ate.  He was non stop nursing for his first two days! I was thrilled, especially as my right nipple was even more severely inverted than it had been with my daughter.  Then came the blisters.  I quickly realized his tiny mouth was only grabbing half my nipple. Ouch.  By day 4, even though I was trying for a good latch, I was cracked and bleeding on both sides.  I tried everything! Pumping first, a latch assist, different positions, and nothing helped for a while.  I was in so much pain I was swearing and crying every time he latched.  The constant back ache I had turned out to be referred pain from my damaged nipples, coupled with deep breast pain from an ugly, rearing return of Reynaud's.  It hurt to breath.  

By two weeks, I was using a shield off and on.  My son hated it.  His weight gain was good  though, so his pediatrician didn't look in his mouth too well.  Said he was fine.  I saw my midwife at this point, thinking I had an infection.  She said no infection, and recomended tea bags.  Within two more weeks, my right nipple developed a smile.  Yup. It smiled.  I am pretty positive I was looking at subcu tissue.  By this time, I could not use a nipple shield as my son rejected it.  My left one also had an extremely deep gouge, but maybe only 2 cm at the widest, and it hurt way less.

It took more work on latch, laid back nursing, and side lying position coupled with his now larger mouth to let me start healing.  We also had thrush around  10 weeks.  Now, we're 16 weeks, and doing way better!   My left has finally healed, and the smile on my right has half filled in.  I still can't get him to latch with his upper lip flipped out, and I think he might have a lip tie, I plan to have his pediatrician check at his next appointment.  Pics to follow in an edit after he eats, he's awake and hungry!

Edited to add photos!  Lefty is shown without me pinching it out.  Right is shown in the normal inverted position, and with me pinching it out. That scab will come off again next feed.  His latch is shallow, but I flipped his lip, he was kind of playing at that point.  [Pics] (http://m.imgur.com/L0QJkNj,HdJU87h,8zTFZHG,ocGxneU,kMhISTR)

Second edit: I took three rounds of nifidipine this time around, and still have Reynaud's, but vastly improved!","1425168521"

Building vultures piecemeal and sending them forward to fight is dumb, but building them piecemeal and sending them forward to lay minefields in advance is a strong strategy. By contrast, if you were to build marines and send them in piecemeal, they would be virtually worthless, doing virtually no damage as a group of Dragoons get a concave.

Games like Homeworld (And SC2: WoL) lack units like the Vulture (Mine Corvettes are joke). There are other good examples of units like the Siege Tanks, Firebats, Dark Templar, Arbiters, Defilers, Lurkers, High Templar, Shield Batteries, etc. that are most effective when your supply count is behind because they are exactly the type of untis that let you get back into games where you are slightly behind.

But now that you mention bruising I can say that my son bruises easily, and ~ 3 weeks ago I noticed some discoloration on my sons arm going toward is wrists. I brought it up with my Dr. and she called it a bruise, though I couldn't think of how he got it. He still has the discoloration, it hasn't healed, leading me to believe it is not a bruise. He is also borderline Anemic, his hemoglobin level wasn't below where it supposed to be, but it is at the minimum before they consider him anemic. also ~ 6 -8 weeks ago he had a high fever for 3 days straight and ear infection. Before that possibly in November 2014 he also a fever, and thats when I noticed the lymph node.

As for the BUN and creatine levels, I don't recall what the numbers were. The Dr said that he may be dehydrated. He was sick a few weeks before his initial blood work and didn't want to eat or drink very much. I am still struggling to get him eating and drinking water properly.

Regarding the RBC the Dr also did mention that it was low, and other Dr's might not have been concerned but she said she was, and didn't really explain too much, even when I asked questions. Maybe I'm not asking the proper questions. Do you have suggestions for other questions i should be asking? Should I look for a second opinion?

I don't know if I'm just making connections where i shouldn't be, I'm no Dr. But my gut tells me that they are valid connections. I hope I'm wrong.

Additionally in a true corporate environment (which is what I'm assuming you mean by ""job"") she'd most likely be wearing a suit jacket or blouse of some sort which will easily cover that up, and if not there's make up and cream you can use to blank out the missing parts.

"swtor","t5_2qxih","1. Check the buff / debuff on your companion to find out if they get damage reduction. I believe they do. Yes, amount of damage reduced by taunts goes to protection points. Yes, always use on cooldown in pvp (if there are foes around of course).

2. He is dumb. Guardians hardly ever were a dotm. There was a period when there was a surge of new guardian dps but that is because theu got patched up into being properly viable for both pvp and pve. And since it is the most iconic Star Wars class it is obvious there will probably be most players playing it but it was easier to claim its because of their ""opness"". 

3. Sages are powerfull. Guardians are indeed lower in terms of dps in operations / flashpoints. Balance sage should also destroy a guardian in 1 v 1 (fabled ""equal skill"" scenario) because of their cc capability. Also if left unharassed they will deal much more single and aoe damage.  Sages have much more potential but for it to be unleashed player must not have perception problems. :) stun, run and heal to full!

4.every dps has hard times getting into pugs for group finder. If you see someone looking for people, this someone will not turn you down because you are a guardian. More likely for not having gear or he might need a ranged dps. Those days are long gone and jugs dont suck so hard anymore.

5. No effects at all. Wont even lock you out from future romance / flirt with npcs.

6.  Good and comfy keybinding is key. Also try to treat vengeance as an aoe spec in pvp. Set bonuses are inportant. Dont bother with crit. Experiment with alacrity for pvp.

These people aren't politicians or ""holy men""; they are gangsters, thugs, organised criminals.

&gt; Zombie Hunter is set in a post-apocalyptic Zombie wasteland caused by the mysterious street drug ""Natas"". We follow one man who has nothing left other than a beat up Camaro and a trunk full of guns and booze. He runs down Flesh Eaters, hunting for sport and redemption, while also running from his past. After crashing into a small group of survivors, who are running low on resources, he decides to lend a hand. But a surprise attack by the Flesh Eaters forces them on the run and puts the Hunter's skills to the test.

Think about why you want to lose weight, what it will bring you, how your life will be in x years if you do it and if you don't do it and look at what changes you are willing to make.

I'd be psyched if someone sent me a totally non-aggressive heads up before someone says a bunch of hurtful shit.

No, if I don't want to listen to obnoxiously loud noise while playing the game, I can mute it. That is, after all, why people buy mics.

"beards","t5_2qn08","Hey bud, I think I can help. I have a pretty substantial beard and have had it for quite a while. The main consideration is what you're using a product for. I use Beard Oil, obviously, as a moisturizer. Beard Oil is going to help your skin, going to help your beard hairs, and it will provide a tiny bit of control. Beard Balms Will provide a considerable amount of hold and control but will also moisturize and condition. When you hear of a lot of people using both I think it's due to their length, in terms of their beard, and for what they want to do to their beard.  I will use both especially in the winter, I like to use a beard oil first mostly for the conditioning and moisturizing affect then what I like to do is use a little bit of beard balm to control stray hairs and give my face a little bit extra protection. Either way, both do a great job. The Balm I use is from Beardology. I like it and because I use it in conjunction with oil I actually don't use a lot, so I'm in the process of looking for a new one as well. If beardology still makes their balm I will probably buy it again.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Psychedelics definitely allow for me to see the bigger picture of pretty much everything, even in small doses. I'm very wary of trying to work out the secrets of the universe as of late, though I really can't help it a lot of the time, and to that extent I've definitely had some breakthrough moments on them. For me, psychs are more about going in with a clear mind and not trying to influence the experience, and it's during those experiences that I'm able to consolidate concepts and ideas that I consider in my sober state with more scope.
 
I've also experienced some breakthrough personal moments, there have been a few key lsd experiences on my own where I've turned my life around for the better, not to mention beginning the healing process of my body (I had a reasonably bad knee accident at age eleven, ten years ago, which really fucked up my hips and everything above them up until I got a knee reconstruction a few months back). 

Lsd put me through some hard times when I was tripping on my own, I wasn't in a good head space back then, but because it was only one tab, I was still able to work with the experience to come out of it a better person, this I know for certain. So if you're up for having really small trips on your own and believe in your own strength of mind and presence, I've not had a truly bad experience yet, they've all taught me at least something, and I count those experiences as some of the most important in my life, they've really spurred me on to better things. 

If you're looking for the answers in drugs, I can't help but feel that you could tamper with something, however, if you're only seeking to observe and take it as it comes, I feel that's when the altered perspective can be of most value. 
Respect the power of psychs, walk before you run. 

But to answer your question, yes, I had a few epiphanies, but never the ones I was looking for. Life is funny like that, you find things as soon as you stop looking for them. In regards to peace, I'm almost upon the genuine realisation that it's always there, I've just got to shut my mind off enough to truly understand it. Life is so joyous when you let it exist as it is.. You might deal with concepts today that you won't truly understand with genuine clarity for another year or five, it takes time for change.

Feel free to ask about anything, I hope my answer has helped, for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction, don't push too hard, all good things in moderation :p except for weed and boobies, those things kick eternal butt","1425168541"

It's likely that there is an underlying psychiatric condition such as ADD/ADHD present as well. All of these problems are classified as severe, evidenced by the fact that your life is being directly impacted by these problems.

My point is that no amount of magical thinking, pep talks or motivational techniques are going to help you. You cannot fix a chemical imbalance by simply trying hard. As such, it is imperative that you promptly seek medical treatment and begin to address these issues.

Start with a general practitioner, and get a referral to a psychiatrist/PNP. A psychiatrist is the specific person you need to speak with, and will work with you towards a diagnosis, and then from there you can explore treatment options.

Please seek the help you need and deserve, and sooner rather than later.

Then ISPs started blocking Napster and torrents.  

I remember having to hide file sharing programs on alternate ports just to get legal transfers done because the ISP would just put a big dumb block on everything that came through the default ports of the program.  

I've been using the Internet since I first got on prodigy in the late 80s.  The 90s was pretty stupid time and users brought that stupidity on themselves through the trading of illegal content.  

But when they started blocking entire sevices and sending warnings (even though the data was legal they just assumed)

To take it a step further, mobile networks started capping their data (illegally) just to prevent users from actually using what they paid for.  

Once the mobile companies got away with it comcast att tw all followed suit with caps and throttling. 

The point you don't seem to get is that ISPs have proven to push the limits of legality over the issue.  If they have the legal power to do something, they WILL do it.  What we have seen is them testing their limits; seeing just how far they can go.   Much like a toddler testing house rules.  

The crackdown on copyright infringement was hugely successful.  We went from almost everyone downloading illegal music to just a small few.  

We also had legal file trading get squelched.

There's no doubt that people have done plenty of fucked up things in the name of religion but you can't deny that it's produced a great deal of happiness and enlightenment for society at large. I do wonder whether or not it's still necessary in the modern world, and I tend to think it isn't, but it still has a beneficial impact on the world, even with the negative effects.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Low reps tend to cause myofibrillar hypertrophy whereas medium to high reps tend to cause a mixture of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic (the sarcoplasm being the fluids and organelles in a muscle cell that aren't contractile fibers) hypertrophy.

So if you take a cross section of a powerlifter muscle it will mostly be fibers of contractile proteins, whereas a bodybuilder's muscle will have a lot more mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, intracellular fluid containing dissolved glycogen, triglycerides, and a whole host of enzymes, and all other organelles having to do with supporting the energy demands of higher volume, higher rep bodybuilding training.

This is the theoretical reason why a powerlifter can train for a year to be a bodybuilder. They have maximized their potential for myofibrillar growth and when they go higher volume and higher rep they get ""beginners gains"" of sarcoplasmic factors and blow up seemingly overnight.

Source: got my degree in this crap.

Edit: also, powerlifters train far more on technique in their three big lifts than bodybuilders ever do. Economy of movement can be the difference between an Olympic athlete taking first place, or never even making the final. As athletes' economy of movement increases, there is even an observed tipping point where their physiological fitness can actually decrease while their performance increases simply because they do not have to expend as much effort to get the same result.

Champion runners have been found to have a paradoxical decrease in VO2max while maintaining or increasing their performance simply because their body had figured out the most energy efficient technique to achieve maximum performance and they are actually working less hard to achieve a superior performance. The same principle applies to the strength sports. For the same muscular effort, with slightly tweaked technique thanks to thousands of hours of repetition, will result in more weight on the bar lifted compared to an untrained individual.","1425168551"

Building vultures piecemeal and sending them forward to fight is dumb, but building them piecemeal and sending them forward to lay minefields in advance is a strong strategy. By contrast, if you were to build marines and send them in piecemeal, they would be virtually worthless, doing virtually no damage as a group of Dragoons get a concave.

Games like Homeworld (And SC2: WoL) lack units like the Vulture (Mine Corvettes are joke). There are other good examples of units like the Siege Tanks, Firebats, Dark Templar, Arbiters, Defilers, Lurkers, High Templar, Shield Batteries, etc. that are most effective when your supply count is behind because they are exactly the type of untis that let you get back into games where you are slightly behind.","1425168553"

Photos are .50 per photo, $10 minimum though I do cut deals for larger photo sets. Sets range from 10-100 photos so there is a big range lol. Premade photosets will never cost more than $30 an album regardless of number of photos.

"Diablo3Crusaders","t5_2y9pu","Assuming your 200b for a level 50 RG and 19b crits with 4b non-crits and 80% crit (that's 60% pre-judgment):

Level 60 boss would have 200b * 1.17^10 = 961b HP.

You'd hit for 0.8 * 19b + 0.2 * 4b = 16b damage on average.

That'd result in 60 hits, of which you could have almost doubled attack speed for 55 hits if you don't skip 6pc. This would also ensure you can keep up Critical because of the 2pc cooldown reduction.

I really don't see why you'd want to skip the bonus as long as you're not getting any crazy off set items instead. Of course 4pc bonus is the build enabling one for shield bash but 6pc is still very good compared to non-set items in general.","1425168555"

Maybe you're searching for something else that the social situation may provide that is different from what everyone else is doing: dancing.

Or your reason for dancing differs from everyone else's...

It's just really unlikely that in an apocalyptic situation you're going to have the time, resources, and inclination to set up complex booby-traps. 

It's a fun subject to think about, but the reality is that there's probably a flaw in every hypothetical decision we could make. It's such an unpredictable scenario that the most likely outcome is always going to be death. If you don't have an easily-reachable, totally impregnable bunker filled with replenishable supplies, you're probably going to die.

For example, perhaps ability levels are determined by the pedigree level of a bird?  If so, should I expect to start learning Choco Dash II at G4?  G5?  What about the ~~terrible~~ passive abilities that have five tiers, such as Heavy Resistance?

Sure, it doesn't work as well as Netflix or something similar, it's slow, clunky, has little in the way of search functions, but it's there.

He has also expanded the business pretty amazingly into a worldwide thing, they can go to so many countries and expect sellout crowds now, more than ever. The problem I suppose is the current content, or the way he sees modern times. He goes overboard with it all. The constant replays of things that happened two seconds ago, the desperate pandering to social media, it feels like he asked a focus group of elderly people how to structure a TV show to today's youth, and along with their exaggerations they somehow convinced him that three old men bickering for commentary was what people would like.

Only 0.1% of test takers score that high and I doubt many of them are 18. I am a 24 year old male and I think I might be a bit intimidated to talk to her lol (JK... kinda). I am guessing that age and maybe extracurriculars are at risk of holding the two of you back. Does she have clinical and volunteer experience? I am not sure how important these are for combined programs. Some medical schools also probably have age requirements. Nevertheless, both of you might want take some comfort in the fact that you two are miles ahead (in terms of age) of most students who go down the MD/PhD road. Why are you doing a postbach? Are you trying to raise your GPA? 

Considering your age, I would probably tell you to enjoy life a little bit (i.e. travel) before starting your MD/PhD. Gaining some unique life experiences might make you a more attractive applicant to medical schools who want a well rounded student. ADCOM's might look at someone your age applying to a program that will sign away at least the next 12 years of your life as a person who has a not lived enough to relate to patients. This might be completely unwarranted as I know nothing about you, but medical school are not unbiased observers and can absolutely jump to conclusions about their applicants based on superficial reasoning. I am sure you will accomplish great things in life and make a valuable contribution to the medical field! I am positive that even your lab director messed up a rat brain earlier in his career!

I'm taking 3321 with Fritz right now. I also really like him as a professor. He is more laid back than Bucci and more soft-spoken (less condescending) but I think he's also a good professor; I really enjoy that class. I didn't have him for 2221 though.

You'll need to find steering-head bearings to mate the XJ headstock to the new clamps, but that just needs persistence. :)

Another potential problem area is brakes. Make sure that if you do this, you use whatever master cylinder comes with the newer front end: don't use the XJ master with the newer calipers, unless you know that you aren't going to get a quick lesson in hydraulic ratios.

If you plan to use the same R1/R6 front wheel, you'll be going from a 2.15X18"" to the newer 3.5X17"". That, combined with the OEM 900 Seca's skinny rear wheel, will be your biggest stumbler.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","You're not wrong at all. There are a couple of factors at play, but two good reads are Legacy of Ashes (about the CIA) and The Sword and The Shield (about the KGB)

Essentially there were three things that made the KGB more efficient; history, ethnicity and citizen's rights. Russia, because they were a European power, had a long history of spycraft and intrigue that America, as a new power with (mostly) friendly neighbors, didn't have the same traditions. The USSR was also both the nation and a political party, and had an institutional memory of secrecy and oppression. Combined, this meant that the KGB was a much more seasoned and talented organization. The CIA was formed from the bones of the OSS during WWII, but with a few exceptions we basically started from scratch. If they had google, they would have googled ""How To Spy"".

Secondly, America is a nation of immigrants and Russia is not. This means that Russia could place Russian-born agents more easily on American soil. Nobody's going to notice a Russian guy in Brighton Beach, but Americans in Moscow were watched much more carefully. 

Finally, American citizens are afforded a number of rights (1st and 4th amendment, primarily) that prevents our government from bugging apartments and opening mail without ""reasonable"" cause. This wasn't the case in Russia, they didn't have to prove you were a spy to bug your apartment, they bugged your apartment to prove you were a spy.

Anyway, the early years of the CIA are fascinating and terrifying. Legacy of Ashes is an amazing read.","1425168567"

You can change my view if you refute any of the axioms that led to my conclusion. If you feel I'm being somewhat unresponsive in this debate, and am unwilling to listen to contrary opinions, I will attempt to rectify that. 1. Since the word Gay, when used as an insult, only applies to one meaning of the semantic shell, it does not necessarily insult every other meaning in the semantic shell. 2. If a request to stop is based on a false conclusion, you have no obligation to stop.
(Conclusion) If someone is offended by using the word Gay as an insult, and asks you to stop, you have no moral obligation to.

""If I went around saying ""stop walking like a curcleoflife"" you'd probably be offended when I told you it means walking like you have a stick up your ass.""

I find these posts somewhat amusing. We've got people who (rightfully) question the tools they use and look for alternatives. They then discover Make and have some kind of zen Unix moment that they want to share with the world.

If what you are doing in your flavor-of-the-month build tool translates to a roughly equivalent number of lines in Make, then yes, you should probably look at using Make. But the thing is, Make is stupid, it doesn't know a lot. Sometimes that is a good thing, sometimes it is not.

I mostly program in C++ and when I build my stuff I want a build tool that understands things like header dependencies, optimization levels, shared libraries etc. It's a bonus if my build files are portable.

My point is that these alternative tools often strive to raise the abstraction level and the reason people use them isn't necessarily because they haven't discovered Make.

IF this post did break any posting rules, it is on the mods to remove that content.  Since they didn't, then it is a post that meets the standard for the post.  Now, whether or not the /r/pics community LIKES that content is another mater.

This conversation can definitely get MUCH deeper, as well as broader when we start to debate the responsibilities of the content providers versus the mods that are supposed to oversee their sub.  And that wouldn't even be a bad debate / discussion to have, considering how in depth and large subs like this have become.  The original model used for these types of online forums sometimes reaches a critical mass where the simpler model we currently have in place loses a lot of it's function.

I mentioned in another reply that it would be interesting to see how something like this is fixed.  Would we work on this at more of a base layer, with a reconstruction of reddit in general?  I think that if there were serious efforts made to make the entire reddit community more aware of related subs, not just passively but actively when they are created, it would bypass a lot of the core problems around people simply not knowing.  An individual content contributor really isn't going to go TOO far out of their way in order to find a very specific sub.  There are those of us that take reddit a bit more serious and even take pride in the diversity of the different subs we are members of, but we have to remember that the scale of reddit as a whole is VAST, and a good portion of that community is what we would consider to be ""casual"" users.   

I think that if efforts were made, whether through a more advanced algorithm for related forums, or more of a manual approach through current sub mods, to road-map connections to other forums and communities, we wouldn't see nearly as much ""sort of related"" content.  I'm aware that a lot of sidebars of subs that have a strong mod base WILL post related subs, but again, that is more of an individual decision of a mod, and not something inherently built into the infrastructure of the reddit site.

Skitsnack!!! Vad då ""tar tid""? Belägg att det MÅSTE ta ett visst antal hundra år och att islam MÅSTE vara efter inte bara kristendomen, men att ni MÅSTE vänta med att inkludera bögar, kvinnor demokrati. Vad är det för jävla skitsnack. Varför MÅSTE det ta tid. Exakt HUR länge ska jag vänta på att ni ska sluta diskriminera mig och mina vänner.  Det är bara ett försvar du har -bevisa med vetenskapliga artiklar tex att ni inte har förmåga, enligt vetenskapen att öppna en inkluderande gaymoské som tar avstånd från sharia i Sverige. Vad är det för jävla förklaring. Du har inte tillstymmelse för bevis för det påståendet utan det är bara skitsnack. Inget MÅSTE ta tid. Det tar tid för att muslimer inte VILL ändra på sig, inte har lust att vara icke diskriminerande demokrater. Så - berätta i VETENSKAPLIG detalj, alltså inte dina egna teorier, varför det MÅSTE ta tid. Inte är det en naturlag jag har hört talats om. Om andra religioner och människor kan ändra på sig - varför inte islam? Berätta varför just ni inte kan ändra på er. Bor ni inte i Sverige? Vad hindrar er ? I vetenskaplig detalj förstås, inte en egen teori.

&gt;När har jag någonsin påstått att de existerat?

Så du bekräftar att det fullständigt saknas bevis för att liberal islam existerar? Att allt lika gärna kan vara fria fantasier från dig? Att du påstår saker men att du, till skillnad från mig, inte har några som helst bevis? Att jag har rätt i ALLT jag har påstått om islam faktamässigt? Erkänner du det (och att du följaktligen har ljugit när du sagt att jag har haft fel om islam).  

&gt;Jag är ledsen, men jag kan inte hjälpa dig om du antar att Islam är en ideologi. Det är ingen ideologi. Det är en tro. 

Det är båda (det finns politisk islam, förnekar du det?) men även om det bara är en tro  - är det enligt dig inte att stödja en tro att bekänna sig till den? Du VÄLJER ju att bekänna dig till en tro som är DJUPT homofobisk och DJUPT antidemokratiskt och diskriminerande. Vad är skillnaden mellan dig och någon som exempelvis väljer att bekänna sig till en djupt rasistisk tro, tex nazisternas och rasisternas. Och sen självklart använder exakt dina argument, att de är inte rasister och det tar tid att förändra. Samt - förklara för en ateist för mig varför just du ska få frikort att bekänna dig till en väldigt rasistisk tro/organisation - får vi alla det, eller gäller det bara folk med låtsaskompisar. Kan jag vara med i en ""hata blattar"" organisation och säga att jag inte tror på det riktigt för tro är individuellt men jag gillar fikat? Får alla frikort från exakt alla vidriga yttringar så länge man bara säger att man tar avstånd från dessa? Ger inte det tex alla i ISIS frikort så länge de säger att de tar avstånd från vidrigheterna? Alla i nazisternas kyrka? Vad är skillnaden mellan du som bekänner dig till en djup diskriminerande tro (och säger att du tar avstånd från diskrimineringen) och någon från ISIS som bekänner sig till ISIS version men säger att de tar avstånd från det dumma (som du gör) eller nazisternas tro/kyrka (och tar avstånd från det dumma). Ska man inte ha bevis? Eller är det ok att vara med i vad som helst så länge läpparnas bekännelse finns? 

&gt;Jag gör inget fel. Min familj gör inget fel. 

Så det är inte fel att bekänna sig till något djupt diskriminerande? 

&gt;Varför ska jag stå till svars för något jag inte stödjer?

Du stödjer ju en djupt diskriminerande tro, som bevisligen dagligen dödar och skadar tex bögar. I Sverige dödas de inte, men diskrimineras. Och du saknar bevis för att de liberala finns. 

&gt;Det är såna som du som stoppar kvinnor från att lyckas.

Hahaha- dina fördomar kommer fram. Du vet att jag är tjej va? Så du menar att jag diskriminerar mig själv? 

&gt;Jag är stolt över min syster som klättrat inom politiken i ett land där det existerar rasister som du, som ständigt nedvärderar henne p.g.a. att hon är muslim.

A) Muslimer är ingen ras. B) på grund att ni inte behandlar folk lika. Inte ens i Sverige har ni brytt er om att inkludera folk och ta avstånd från diskriminering. Därför avskyr jag er. 

Berätta - hur länge till ska jag och mina vänner bli diskriminerade av er? Hur många år enligt dig tills ni har hunnit anpassa er. Jag vill se en vetenskaplig uträkning efter du har lagt fram vetenskapliga bevis på att muslimer behöver längre tid än alla andra. Eller är det så att det inte finns bevis för att ni behöver det? Att du hittar på? Svara i extremt utförlig detalj till varför jag ska finna mig att diskrimineras en enda sekund till. Varför min bögkompis ska? 

&gt; Jag gillar att hålla en god ton på mina diskussioner men ditt beteende är vidrigt och du verkar vela att jag ska vara elak mot dig eftersom att jag annars är feg.

Jag har kallat dig för feg för att du inte har svarat. Svar och jag slutar kalla dig för feg och vi kan fortsätta diskussionen. Du verkar vara på god väg i alla fall vilket är ett fall framåt.

There's an argument to be made for casting race appropriate characters for minority roles simply because of how few of them there are in the mainstream, but I don't see any problem with casting minority actors as normally white characters.

Most white comic characters aren't white because their race is important to their overall arc as a character, they're white because when they were created 50-60 years ago, minorities weren't really considered people, and the idea of making a PoC a main character in a work marketed to white people was largely unheard of.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Not to mention i have seen plenty of female posters on forums talking about how they would fuck Ein/Hayate, Hyabusa and most of the other muscular pretty boys in that game.

--Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda: the author mentions a struggle to understand the Genesis as recommended he study it by his teacher. His teacher then gives him a very interesting summary of the creation story which gives food for thought. There is much mention of Christianity throughout the book and he even meets a Catholic saint.

--Inside the Yoga Sutras by Reverend Jaganath Carrera: there are multiple times the author mentions Jesus in his commentary on the Yoga Sutras, as well as the Buddha.

So having both sides I can say they keep on besting each other in very small steps. Nvidia adds streaming and recording, AMD adds streaming and recording. Stuff like that. IMO Gaming Evolved is better because it is less intrusive, isn't a resource hog, and offers better options for optimization. That is not to say it is at all good.

professionals (i.e., doctors, trainers, physical therapists, chiropractors, dentists, neuropsychologists)
to Players. Club Physicians shall perform complete and objective fitness to play examinations and
determinations on behalf of the Club subject to all professional and legal obligations vis-à-vis the
Player-patient. Disputes regarding such Medical Care provisions shall be referred to the Joint Health
and Safety Committee for discussion and potential resolution and not to the Impartial Arbitrator.

&gt; Each medical doctor hired or otherwise retained by the Club after the effective date of this
Agreement to treat its Players as part of the Club's primary medical team shall, in the United States
be board certified in their respective field(s) of medical expertise, and in Canada be certified by either
the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (for specialists) or the College of Family Practice of
Canada (for family physicians). Each Club medical doctor who is part of the primary medical
team hired or retained after the effective date of this Agreement, and any Head Team Physician
hired or promoted to such position after the effective date of this Agreement, shall have successfully
completed a fellowship in Sports Medicine or have other “sports medicine” qualifications as the
parties may agree.

&gt; Club requirement to have a minimum of two (2) Team Physicians in attendance at all games (at least
one of whom shall have hockey-specific trauma management training and Advanced Trauma Life
Support training during the previous three (3) years). Clubs shall also have consultant specialists at
each game to complement the skill set of the two Team Physicians (as between Team Physicians
and specialists, there will be mandatory attendance by: (a) an Orthopedist and (b) an Internal
Medicine, Emergency Medicine or Primary Care Sports Physician). At least one of the two Team
Physicians should have familiarity with NHL Modified SCAT2. Team Physicians in attendance at
games shall be seated in close proximity (within 50 feet) of the Players’ Bench, with immediate access to the bench area and ice surface.

&gt; Each Club shall employ at least two (2) full-time Athletic Trainers certified either by NATA or CATA,
or licensed physical therapists. At least one of the Athletic Trainers should have familiarity with NHL
Modified SCAT2. One Athletic Trainer must be available at bench at all times during games and
practices. Club must provide adequate athletic training services and treatment on the road if it does
not travel with both Athletic Trainers (to the extent reasonably necessary in the Club’s reasonable
discretion).
Clubs must provide massage therapist services at home and on the road (but do not have to hire a
full-time massage therapist), to the extent reasonably necessary in the Club’s reasonable discretion.

So yes, medical care is standardised. These teams spend a lot of money on these guys, so the goal is to have these guys recovered and fit for play in a timely and error-free manner.","1425168584"

"Vaping101","t5_2xcp6","Taste is an extremely subjective thing. If possible, I recommend you find your largest local vape shop and spend an hour or so inside testing flavors before you buy any. 

If that's not possible, I am also a big fan of fruit-type juices, and I'm willing to give you some suggestions.

Bombies: [Nana Cream](http://www.myvaporstore.com/ELiquid-Ejuice-Bombies-Nana-Cream-p/bb-nac.htm) and [Agent P](http://www.myvaporstore.com/ELiquid-Ejuice-Bombies-Agent-P-p/bb-agp.htm) are both excellent. Nana Cream is a banana cream pie type vape, very delicious and can easily become an all day vape. Agent P is strawberries and cream with a twist I can't quite put my finger on, but is also delicious. 

Jimmy the Juice Man: [Strawberry Astronaut](http://101vape.com/jimmy-the-juice-man/562-strawberry-astronaut.html) is my most treasured bottle of liquid at the moment. It's strawberry with peach and tropical fruit overtones and a very crisp exhale. Very delicious, and definitely worth the price.  They also offer a [Peachy Strawberry](http://101vape.com/jimmy-the-juice-man/563-peachy-strawberry.html) that is also very good. 

Space Jam: [Galactica](http://www.giantvapes.com/galactica/) is a strawberry(noticing a pattern yet? ha) and champagne liquid that is one of my absolute favorites. 

Cyclops: [Eros](http://www.giantvapes.com/eros/) and [Artemis](http://www.giantvapes.com/artemis/). Eros is a cranberry and citrus blend that is light and refreshing. Artemis is a berry cobbler dessert flavor.

Again, if experimenting at a local shop isn't an option, www.giantvapes.com has a HUGE selection of juices. Just browse them for awhile, and if you come across any that sound good, google up some reviews on them. ","1425168585"

(place wards, go roam if you have nothing better to do, etc.) I think mainly was my mentality though, if I was close to anything like Gold or diamond, I'd tilt whenever anything went wrong and keep spamming games while in a bad mood to try and make up for any losses. I fixed that this time around when I was trying to get master and instead took breaks between losses (mainly because I wasn't playing much in general but still...) and hit Master in just 87 games from plat 1.

If they ever gave someone a yellow card without checking the video review first they would soon be hung out to dry before you know what happened.

And a ref also has to have authority on the pitch so for him to just blow the whistle and say 'hold on, I don't know what just happened' would undermine him in my opinion. Unless he's doing it for just about everything like in American Football but no one wants that in real football.","1425168589"

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","That is essentially the thrust of my argument, but that a whole ton more people in the world don't give 2 shits about GamerGate as a topic in and of itself than those that do.  The limited neutrality is significantly larger than I think you perceive it as.


In my opinion it is important to remember that ambivalence and neutrality to a specific issue is important to define and remember.


You could walk up to someone on the street tomorrow and ask ""Do you know anything about GamerGate?  What's your thoughts?"" and they could be clueless.  ""I don't know what that is and have no opinion"" is a neutral position.  The moment you educate them on it, they may change their mind (for existing stances on related issues like sexism etcetc).  They will then stop being neutral, but they are then actually involved or invested somewhat in the discussion (YOU ARE INSERTING YOURSELF INTO THE DISCUSSION joke goes here).

I know this is all splitting hairs but I think it is important in understanding how this works from outside the bubble.  The external view is ""Look at all this noise, okay what is the outcome of all that noise?  Death threats, online harassment, someone had to pull from an even.""  They don't have an opinion on GamerGate as a THING, they have an opinion on what is happening surrounding it though.  So when people INSIDE the bubble of negatively react to what the external is reporting on, so for example"" MSM is aGG"" most of the external things respond with ""wat"" and rightly or wrongly then attribute the source of all the harassment to the people that covering the *outcomes of the GamerGate controversy to the movement in and of itself.

The context of someone that opposes all online harassment and that of someone that opposes all online harassment as well as GamerGate is not a huge gulf.  The latter probably has more interest in video games and probably has a bit more of a negative association with Five Guys, Burgers and Fries now.

While that gap in context is tiny, if you want to talk the difference in scale between those things?  Well 5,773 vs what I assume we both hope is a huge body of people is pretty significant.

Just like I don't want GamerGate to speak for all Gamers and drag them all in to their little corner of the internet and throw shit and mud all over everything, I also don't want to speak for every feminist on the planet.","1425168591"

We were doing such good business we were getting into distributing a tequila. I was working part time and my partner worked nights. For being only 20yo business was good... Then shit started going south. My partner started getting real flaky and not answering the phone. I was getting real frustrated and started putting the business on the back burner cause I didn't want to do it by myself.  My biggest life mistake.

Now to my second point. It was a simple Analogy, wich I used to showcase a scenario, where you get the chance to save ur loved ones (princes in Aldnoha, family in my example) multiple times (in both cases they get literally invited to kill the villain), they then proceed to do nothing (actually Slaine is even worse then the guy in my example because he even helps the villain) and only after the villain already killed (in Aldnoah case obviously shot into coma but assumed death) does the character(Slaine in Aldnoah, in my example someone random) kill the villain. And the only reason they didn't kill them before even tough they knew that the villain would kill the loved one/s is because of a retarded reasoning (Slaine: some debt that his father had towards Cruhteo, Example: gave money for taxi).

This is called an Analogy and was in no way used as a Strawman and copying half a line that states nothing, wont make it one. 

Also pls if you already want to argue, then explain why all this things that I stated before doesn't make him a bad or rather not competent character and why he actually is one.","1425168594"

I don't know exactly what the details are, but I'm pretty sure that it doesn't matter what status he has at the moment.  Being married to a US citizen is, in principle, sufficient to be eligible for a GC.  Once his wife files appropriate forms (including I485), and the USCIS sends the receipt note for the I485, he would be legally allowed to stay as long as it takes for the I485 to go through.  If his wife applied for a GC while he was out of the country, he could be unable to come back to the US until his petition is completed.  I strongly suggest that they consult with a lawyer to make sure that all the details are worked out, but it seems like they should be able to start the GC process immediately.","1425168595"

I'll likely be commuting with my motorcycle to the UCSD campus and my parents are selling me their decade old, but in excellent shape honda civic which should be relatively cheap to insure. I know boring and very ""suburban"" but I'm not saying wanting stuff more walkable and local is a bad thing. I'm just indifferent to it. 

Where I live in Vancouver is ""walkable"" but because I'm so busy and am a broke grad student so I can't afford to go to restaurants or bars, it really doesn't matter to me. Although having good reliable public transit is nice. Maybe I'm just ""Vancouvering"" wrong as some people have pointed out... too bad I don't like loafing around, being underemployed, and smoking a lot of pot while going on about how awesome it is yet another hipster microbrewery opened down the street and there's another raw food vegan place my burning man friends are opening but at the same time being too god damn broke to really reasonably afford any of that.

Let it be known I think this is also very much a ""dark souls"" thing, that works well for it, I'm not bringing it down for it!), whereas that doesn't really happen in MH, they'll typically just do whatever.

And I did mean with your weapon sheathed in monster hunter, there's not really an equivalent in dark souls. I feel like the rolls have less recovery time in MH then in dark souls, but I admit I've been playing a heavy armor character lately, so that may be skewing my perception.

&gt;on Hunt’s and Lipo’s book about Easter Island, which claims to show how those authors’ recent archaeological studies overturned orthodox conclusions derived from a century of previous extensive archaeological research by many scholars.  Among Hunt’s and Lipo’s main conclusions, they say that Easter Island was deforested by rats, not by Polynesian settlers; that settlement was not until AD 1200 rather than earlier as widely assumed; that the tall stone statues of up to 90 tons were not transported horizontally, but were “walked” upright; that the collapse of Easter society was due to European impact, rather than to impacts of the settlers themselves before European arrival; and that the view of Easter society’s collapse as a self-inflicted ecological catastrophe is flawed.

&gt;Unfortunately, the web postings don’t recognize the compelling reasons why Hunt’s and Lipo’s conclusions are considered transparently wrong by essentially all other archaeologists with active programs on Easter Island.

Good post sir. however point M really hits the hammer on the nail: ""M. Logging out or exiting the Game during live game-play. Riot Games’ automated Leaverbuster® system tracks this data overtime and issues a temporary ban when a user is determined to have left mid-game too many times. The length of the temporary ban will increase over time if a particular Account continues to leave live game play.""

Its an automated process, that cannot take any situational factors into account. especially since they also make this statement ""C. Harassing, stalking, or threatening any other users in the Game;""

I think its a double standard if i have to agree not to horass anyone but also agree to passivley take it if people harass me.

Im just calling for an option to justify your leaveing, and it to be handled in a similar manner as a report, where there is some sort of inquiry not just a robot that cannot make judgement calls.. where you just have to accept your punishment without beeing able to make your case in any format. Dont missunderstand me, im all about punishing people that go AFK, but i am not about accused people not beeing able to defend themselves.. Thats abit to medieval for my tastes.","1425168603"

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","https://tcg.konami-europe.com/coverage/ycs-prague-overall-deck-breakdown/

They've given us the numbers for YCS Prague:

Nekroz 30.59%

Qliphort 22.53%

Satellarknight 9.2%

Burning Abyss 7.89%

Yosenju 4.77%

Shaddoll 4.28%

HERO 4.11%

Volcanic 2.63%

Ritual Beast 2.30%

Other 11.68%

Now, it's going to be very interesting to see the Top 32.

Edit:

Going by the percentage of tops we've had previously (http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2xbv8x/rejoice_oh_haters_of_the_tier_lists_volcanic/)

and dividing those percentages by the percentage in attendance we get the following ""scores"" for decks:

Nekroz: 1.83

Qliphort: 0.95

Satellarknight: 0.54

Burning Abyss: 1.39

I think it's important to note though that we might get completely different answers when we look at the tops at this YCS. Perhaps the attendance here is drastically different to tournaments previously. For example, you would expect there to be far fewer BA players at this tournament than at previous ones, due to the fact that people are giving up on BA. 

Anyway, we'll see!","1425168609"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Teaching someone that something is ""the truth"" and not allowing questioning or looking at other forms of belief is a very negative form of indoctrination. 

well I never said I endorsed that type did I?

You also have to realize that your child is going to be ""influenced"" for lack of a better term by whatever they are exposed to in those tender years. If the parents do not provide guidance, the children will invariably latch onto the behavior and morals promulgated by the media/popular culture they are exposed to. It is *impossible* to raise a completely neutral child.

Which is why I consider the approach my parents took to be ideal. They never explicitly indoctrinated me, as any good parent should, but they were never ashamed of their worldview and presented it to me because they believed it would build a good foundation in me when it comes to worldview/religious view/political view/etc. As I said, they never hid any opposing viewpoints, which I think is the crucial element for preventing any kind of pointless reaction against the ideas your parents try to inculcate you.","1425168610"

"LongDistance","t5_2s6ky","This is an experience she's not going to have again, and she's trying to make the most of it. She may really love you, but you can't have the same communication that you did when she was home. If you look at this like ""I'm less important to her than clubbing"" then you are going to be really resentful. Spending a semester abroad is an immersive experience. For her to spend 40 minutes in a Skype call with you is not insignificant. She really is busy, you know; her life in Ireland is very different, very temporary, very intense, and something she really needs to take full advantage of for the experience to be worth the time and cost. I really think you should try to understand her perspective here. It's extremely difficult to balance all of these things at once, and yes, usually the relationship back home is the one to suffer most.

The part that bothers me the most is that you don't have her full attention during Skype calls. I think you should try to come to a compromise with her on this; maybe calls could be shorter or less frequent, but tell her that you really want to spend quality time with her, and texting with other people during that time makes you feel neglected. It's important to have ""just us"" time, even though you will need to accept that there will simply be less of it.

This situation right now, although temporary, is just never going to be ideal for a relationship. Your ability to roll with the punches will be a big factor in how well you succeed in relationships in general.","1425168616"

You're correct not to. Being attracted to young WOMEN has been a natural desire from men for hundreds and thousands of years, it wasn't until recent feminists hate movements that marrying a 16yo women became illegal and demonized.

&gt;People can't help how they feel

Irrelevant derailing. Transparent and ineffective.

&gt;As a person who is currently in therapy for childhood sexual trauma, I can definitively say it is not okay. 

Your personal testimony means nothing here, and your false equivalency of comparing a consensual relationship and sexual assault fails.

&gt;Pedophiles manipulate people who cannot consent.

Citation needed. Anyone of any age can consent to anything. Saying someone physically cannot consent is a disingenuous lie.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I've had *really* good responses for stuff like 'lets work together instead of fighting, we'll win this', instead of trivialising how they feel when a dude dies, it encourages team work. 

Another thing you can do is to call out the dude talking shit, 'hey man, do you think that talking shit'll make this guy play better?'. Most of the time the dude will stop talking shit, not realizing that what he was doing was a dick move.

All you can do at that point is agreeing that his score sucks, but it's only going to get worse unless we play well as a team.

Socialism just means putting the means of production back in the hands of the worker. Head on over to /r/socialism if you'd like to hear from socialists themselves.

Being able to take taxes doesn't mean you own something.

If the state really own things the way you think it does, why doesn't is just seize everything?

&gt;That fact that you believe the state isn't socialist in nature, is evidence enough that socialists believe themselves to be the rebels.

I've already stated elsewhere that I favor a massive build out of renewables and public transportation. 

And yet by any reasonable analysis we will have to dial back our consumptive lifestyles. If you look closely at the studies that show how it'd be possible to develop a green infrastructure, there is always a component for ""efficiency gains"" or conservation. Of course most of these studies have been criticized on other grounds as well. 

Just as a start you can't fly passenger jets on electricity nor is it likely that you ever will.

 * Rounding up homeless people and drunks and then selling their unconscious bodies to dark, underground cults in the city for profit.
 * While the city was under siege and dead were piling up outside the walls, rather than seek out a way to mass consecrate the ground so that the dead could not be raised against the city, instead made a deal with another bunch of necromancers for them to get rid of the problem by raising them and taking their new army elsewhere.
 * Rounded up the lost souls of innocent victims of a massacre in a building he recently bought, and had them enslaved to him by a demonic house he'd also acquired, both paid for with his hobo-sacrifice money.
 * Betrayed the Church of Pelor, tricking them into treating him as a hero whilst all the while sending their initiates to fight good-aligned members his own party under the auspices of them 'working for the enemy', then, when everything goes to hell, turning up to 'save the day' and rescue the very party he'd tried to get killed.","1425168637"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","A lot of that is still up for debate and I kind of feel that the whole ""nofap/noporn"" thing is the new ""video games/rock and roll are evil"".

The only thing that is true is that yes porn spikes your dopamine, and that after awhile of seeing the same pics and videos you become desensitized and need see something else, or something more exciting. But that applies to everything else in the world too.

If I listen to music I like that will spike my dopamine. If I listen to it over and over it gets boring and I find something else to listen to. If I eat delicious sugary treats or fast food those spike my dopamine as well and I will continue seek it out.

Bottomline is there's no proof that porn is physically addicting. It isn't like a drug or alcohol that you can ingest and there's actual chemical reactions happening. It's literally just pixels on a screen. You're watching people fuck and you're touching your dick until cum comes out, that's it. The other reason people bring up is that can affect your real life sex life. Well yeah! If you're jerking it 20 times a day to porn of course you won't be in the mood for sex. Most people only have sex a few times a week as it is. Take more breaks and you're good.

Now you could argue that people use porn as a form of escape. Trouble in their relationship, stress at work or at home, etc etc and it becomes a feedback loop. Feel like shit, use porn, feel better temporarily, end up feeling worse cause still looking at porn and nothing's changed. But people can do that with anything not just porn but gambling, video games, food, etc etc. But those are just  symptoms of a bigger underlying problem, not THE problem. And there's plenty of people who can watch porn and are just fine, or use it to enhance their own sex life. So it's not so black and white that porn = DOPAMINE = everything goes to shit until porn is gone.","1425168637"

if I didn't post, poor op would go back on his almost full blue geared rshaman, get rolled, and feel hopeless because reddit told him his class is just bad and there's nothing he can do.

OP, rshamans scale crazy good with gear. get like 645-650 ilvl out of PvP (almost full conq, maybe 4 or 5 blue pieces) and you'll see a world of difference

resto shaman strength comes from abusing natures guardian ala being trained all game and seeming like youre going to die, leading enemies on a reckless mongoloid goose chase, whole your partners pick them off and kill them before they kill you. 


also, you NEED to be good at juking to play an rshaman. eventually you will need to get a big heal off when you're low, and you can't do this if there's 2 kicks off cool down

They are digging things up that the police/City Hall/'The Man' doesn't want to come to light pretty regularly. 

I don't know that the Guardian story comes off as ""white noise"" but there is this idea that the abuses alleged are common-ish in Chicago and the hype around ""CIA style black site"" is overblown. Not saying it isn't important and isnt worth covering - i bet Chicago media is going to be changing pace on this story next week - but it seems to me that the black site angle is being way overhyped to get people to care about this.

Oh and of course gossiping about so-and-so's (lack of) spirituality. Sometimes the men would circle around and try to throw around philosophical ideas but as soon as the topics got deeper, they'd all back away because uh, Jdawg will figure it out.

Engines have a ""power band"" where they operate at peak efficiency and generally produce the most horsepower.

In these situations the torque vs hp difference isn't as striking. Although engines with higher torque will be better exiting corners or in situations where your forced to let the engines RPM drop lower. 

In a regular street driving situation where you don't always keep the engine in its power band an engine with higher torque is definitely going to seem like it accelerates harder because more of the ""power"" is available at a lower RPM. ","1425168644"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","When explaining HP vs torque, I like to compare a bicycle to my small motorcycle (250cc). If the average man weighs 150 lbs. and the length of the pedal is roughly 1 ft, he can generate about 150 ft-lbs of torque on the down stroke by standing on the pedal. By comparison, the peak torque on my motorcycle is a whopping 15 ft-lbs. Just looking at the torque, the bicycle should be much faster than the motorcycle and faster than a lot of small cars. But of course, it's not. Why?

Torque is not a very useful metric for answering how fast something is. Usually, when someone talks about how *fast* something is, they're really asking how long it takes to do something: miles per hour, how many seconds does it take to go a quarter mile. From pure unit analysis, torque has two components: force and distance (Ex. foot-pound, Newton-meter). To be able to talk about time or speed, we have to introduce time: revolutions per minute. The result is HP or simply torque X RPM.

Back to the bicycle comparison, the reason a motorcycle is much faster than a bicycle is because a bicycle can only generate that 150 ft-lb of torque at very low rpm in the neighborhood of 50-60 RPM where the motorcycle can generate its 15 ft-lb at over 13,000 RPM. To complicate issues further, the rear wheel needs to rotate at a specific speed proportional to the speed you want to travel at, which is independent of the speed of the operational range of the engine. This is accomplished through gearing. Gear ratio acts as a torque multiplier on the output shaft (wheel). 

On a bicycle, the rear wheel typically rotates faster than your pedals. If the wheel is rotating 2x as fast as the input shaft (pedals), then the torque at the output shaft will be 1/2 that of the torque on the input shaft. Using our sample numbers, that 150 ft-lb of torque on the pedals becomes 75 ft-lb at the wheel.

With the motorcycle, the rear wheel is rotating much slower than the drive shaft. This results in a torque multiplier--the torque on the output shaft is much higher than the torque on the input shaft. The overall gear ratio on my motorcycle is around 25:1. That 15 ft-lb on the input shaft becomes 15 * 25 = 375 ft-lb on the output shaft.

TL;DR is that torque does not say anything about how fast something is; the unit does not have a time component. To talk about how fast something is, we have to use HP.

"harvestmoon","t5_2s3kr","I picked it up during the Black Friday/Boxing Day (forgot which one) sale for only $11.99 CAD, I don't know what it is in the eShop right now though. Anyways, let me compare ToTT with ANB. Here's a long read.


The Tale of Two Towns, unlike A New Beginning, doesn't have a start that tests your patience -- meaning the beginning doesn't feel slow at all. It doesn't feel lonely either because both towns are lively and full of people, unlike ANB. In ToTT, you will pick which town you'll live in: Konohana, a plant-biased town, or Bluebell, an animal-biased town, and your choice will affect how you'll live. However, that doesn't mean you are stuck in the town you chose forever, you can always move to another town for a fee before the end of the month. You can also just walk into the other town and befriend the folks there and buy things there and such. Heck, you can even use the farm on the other side with some restrictions. However, between the two opposing towns is a *huge* mountain, and by huge, I mean *bigger* than the one in ANB, at least I think so. But no worries, ToTT allows you to ride a horse through the mountains in your first season of the year (after it recovers, which is only a few days; it gets injured at the beginning of the game) and have it drag a cart around with you for more space (if you run out of space in your rucksack/bag). What's more is that the horse *doesn't* need to be taken care of because it's never hungry or dirty, which is a plus. Fishing, you can go fishing without the rod, and it's called hand fishing.  However, obviously, you only get low quality fishes. Cooking, oh boy, for certain recipes, you need a certain cooking utensils, but you can cook without the need of buying Hana's Recipe (lol). Moving on, in the central area of both the two towns stands a Request Board, which contains, well, requests that you can do to get awards or useful things from upon doing one. Think of it as the Blueprints, but instead it's the villagers looking for specific items and the requests aren't that hard and they don't take long to do either, and requests expire within a set amount of days. Furthermore, ToTT has very *cute* bachelorettes in the game (looking at you, Georgia and Reina), and I think this game has the most cute characters out of all the ones I've played. The relationships are not measured by Hearts, but instead are measured with Flowers, but they are still factored through Friendship Points, and having people fall in love with you/like you is quite easy if you know what you're doing. Also, customization, customization is a bit more of a challenge here, you can only customize your clothing and you get the clothings when you get friendly with a specific character and she requests it in the Request Board. You *cannot* customize how the town looks and all those things. Tunnels, you can unlock the tunnel slowly as you go through the game. Completely unlocking the tunnel will allow you to go to one town from the other faster, it also allows other villagers/townsfolk to visit the other town, even triggering seemingly ""rival"" or ""jealousy"" events for the bachelor/ettes.

**Here are some notable cons of ToTT from my experience:**

* You cannot save during the day or anytime you want, but rather, you are only allowed to save when you go to bed. Meaning you have to go through the whole day in order to save. And… if you have the physical version and you have done a lot during the middle of the day and it crashes/freezes on you… then that sucks for you.
* Just like ANB, the shipping bin is not beside your house, but rather in the upper (Konohana) or lower (Bluebell) part of the town.
* You can only ship twelve items at a time. Meaning if you have more than twelve items to ship, you have to ship the first twelve, then press A on the shipping bin again in order to ship another batch of twelve items. Shipping in this game isn't like ANB's where it ships instantly upon choosing. Here, you have to put 12 in the Bin and ship them, then follow up with the remaining if you have more to ship.
* Item/Food “freshness” is a jarring feature in this game, especially when you depend on the item/food to give as a gift to a desired bachelor/bachelorette every day. Think of ""freshness"" as an expiry date.
* You can only buy pets once you’ve purchased animals that certain pets can handle. Meaning that if you buy a chick or a chicken, you’ll be allowed to buy a cat (which handles the chicken), if you buy a cow, you'll then be finally be allowed to buy a big dog, etc.
* Unlike the previous Harvest Moon games, stores only have up to 5 items (general store) or 2 items (food store) sold at a time. Also, you cannot buy Wonderfuls in this game, but rather, you must get them from the 'cracks' or other places such as the tunnel.

However, if I were to compare and contrast ToTT and ANB, I would say that A New Beginning is the better game simply because you have a *lot* more to do in the game and there are a lot more challenges (when you get far) in comparison to Tale of Two Towns.

Overall, I would still recommend it to anybody who wants a dose of the good ol' Harvest Moon feeling. if I were to rate this game out of 10, I would rate it 7/10, with A New Beginning leading at 8.5/10.

Edit: How could I forget about the dating feature! Essentially, once a girl likes you more and more, she will ask you if you want to go out on a date if you talk to her in the right place in the right time. You get to pick where you guys go on your date and the amount FP you get from it depends on your choice.","1425168647"

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

- I'm experimenting with the Kiko Night Treatment Lash Booster, which is supposed to give me stronger, longer, and thicker lashes in thirty nights.  I've used it for three so far and will keep you posted because it'll be interesting to see how it performs compared to the other, considerably more expensive lash treatments I've tried like Revitalash and Rapidlash. 
- I also got two lipsticks from Kiko, my first ones from the brand.  I chose the Luscious Cream Lipstick in 520 Mauve and the Velvet Mat Lipstick in 612 Strawberry Pink.  I really love both in terms of colour and formula. 

- I used up my vitamin C serum and bought a new kind to try, Insta Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It's early days but I'm liking it. 



**Next week:**


- I need to trim my fringe again.  How does it grow so fast?!  At least now I can deal with it myself, thanks to some very helpful folks here! 

- I've not been using eyeliner, like at all, so I kinda want to make an effort to incorporate it into my routine next week. ","1425168650"

You however, fall short of the grace of all that is good because you don't love others the way I love others, but I can play humble because I feel bad about jerking off the other day.""","1425168654"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","There is most definitely a right and wrong way to drink whiskey. And I don't mean tradition/ritual/manly right/wrong way either, I mean right as in ""if you drink it this way you'll have a better time as a beginner"" and wrong as in ""if you drink it this way you'll have a bad time"".

Once you get the hang of things you can drink it however the fuck you want but when you're just starting with whiskey you can easily make it way more unpleasant than it needs to be. 

First, don't be afraid to cut it with a little water. Yes this will change the drink slightly. No it won't ruin it. Even a few drops of distilled water in a small glass of whiskey can be enough to cut it. Don't be afraid to add a little more distilled water.

You'll lower the proof of the drink and in the process you'll be able to taste more of the drink without getting overwhelmed by the alcohol. 

Second, *don't* actively try to sniff the glass. There's a *reason* traditional whiskey glasses are narrow and with a small opening and not bulbous and wide like a wine glass or brandy snifter. You're not supposed to huff the shit out of your whiskey because the alcohol vapors are way stronger than lighter liquors and wines.

It'll burn your nose and make the drinking experience less enjoyable. This doesn't mean you shouldn't move the glass around and get a faint smell of it, but you really don't want to get a big old huff of the vapor directly out of the glass. 

Third, if you're really trying to expand your palette and enjoy the flavor profile you need to condition your tongue. Here's a trick I picked up at a whiskey taste testing years ago that I've found very useful. I'm almost positive it's So-and-so's trick but I can't recall the whiskey guy who promotes it (if anyone else reading knows, do chime in).

Most people either just slam their alcohol or they start out of the gate right away with slugs of it out of the glass. Too much alcohol in your mouth is overwhelming and it's easy to sort of back draft the vapors up into the rear of your nasal cavity where it burns like hell (this happens to even experienced drinkers on occasion). 

Instead, take a tiny little sip (remember not to breath in while you're drinking because you'll get a big noseful of those vapors). I'm talking *little* like 2-3ml. Move it around your mouth and try to coat your tongue. Swallow it, but try to swallow it in more than one swallow and in a slow and controlled fashion. Do this anywhere from 1-3 times (with a new sip each time, that is). *Then* once you've acclimated your tongue and senses to the drink, start taking normal sips. You'll be shocked at how different it tastes and how you taste less alcohol punch and more subtle flavors. 

If after trying out some different whiskeys you find you don't like them, then you don't like them and well fuck it. Life's too short to drink booze you don't like. 

All that said, do try whiskeys that have some cultural connection to either where you live now, where your ancestors lived, or both. If you're an American, for example, you really should try some quality bourbons just to have tried them simply because, spirit-wise, bourbon is America's gift to the world on par with the musical contribution of Jazz.

While Edison wanted to improve the size of his bank account with his inventions. 
I don't think Edison was a vile human, he was American trying to make a buck.  
But I think that is why people may come across as hateful. It's not hateful for who Edison was, it's for what he represents. 
Edison represents big corporation (the 1%), and in people's minds Tesla represents the common man (or underdog) who looks out for his fellow common man, and thumbs his nose at big corporation. ","1425168660"

The dress is actually blue/black. What you're seeing is an effect known as Colour Constancy which is where your brain automatically adjusts for lighting conditions so that you'd see the true colour of objects. Think of it like the white balance on a camera. If a scene has yellow light, your brain will subtract the yellow from the object's seen colour to get what its actual colour is.

The problem with that dress is that the photo is firstly potato quality and secondly lacking sufficient context for your brain to know what the lighting conditions are. So you brain makes a guess. Some people guess the lighting is yellow and see the blue/black, while others guess the lighting is blue and see the white/gold.

(I joke) :p I like the idea though, and I prefer your nerfed version to  /u/ThePoshFart’s (well I would wouldn’t I) but I still think it needs … something ‘unique’ about it so to  speak.

The reason I came up with the strength de-buff was because I imagined the Cestus’ as being the sort of thing one would wear if a normal person were planning on going toe–to-toe with people with cybernetics, something that ‘makes them weaker’ rather than ‘making yourself stronger’. Also, I wanted something that matches up with the other weapons. Bladed weapons can ‘cleave', blunt weapons can deal non-lethal damage and electric weapons do their zappy stuff, to say nothing of the Ranged Weapons, and so something that debuffs the enemy in combat suited what I was aiming for in terms of an ‘unarmed’ effect that made sense … it was either that or something that would let me execute a ‘ranged punch’ but that seemed a little *too* fantastical. I’ll brain storm a couple of ideas and get back to ya’ll on it.

That's not to say that you won't notice your losses, because you'll definitely continue getting smaller. It's just that you'll still have some fat left that masks any loose skin you may have.

Outside of that, you probably have a lot of unique and compelling content to create with this concept. This should more or less simplify any link building strategy you might have to undertake. Outreach should be fairly simple.

Since I'm not sure what your target market is, German specific or international, I won't speak to local SEO or citation building type stuff.  

After a quick look at CPC for what I thought would be relevant keywords it appears that ad-words might also be a viable way to generate traffic ($1-5 bids per click). However, if you aren't familiar with Adwords you might want to look into an experienced manager to make sure you'd be driving relevant traffic. If you can grab the converters and not knowledge seekers you might have a pretty good shot at a decent ROI. Just guessing that visiting North Korea would be relatively expensive and greatly offset the adspend.

Probably the best guy to have in your corner, you'd think, but no, we only know about JP Morgan and it only exists as on of the biggest investment banks in the world because of Edison's inventions.

Edison was much more of a genius than Tesla. Tesla invented a better form of conducting electricity, in retrospect, but Edison gave us nitrate film and phonograph records.  For the entirety of human history until Edison, you couldn't record music or light, visuals, then Edison created the technology to do both. Recorded audio and video are huge parts of our culture today . And this was just part of what he did.  JP Morgan was the douche bag, Edison was just a very eccentric, self-centered, genius scientist. He was all technology, no business, he was not a thief, and he was not a bully.  Tesla had his own guy, Westinghouse, who practiced predatory capitalism.  He took all Tesla's patents for free in a desperate bid to take down JP Morgan (it failed) with Tesla's superior technology, when in reality, JP Morgan would have paid Tesla a shitload  for those patents within a couple years, and Westinghouse knew that. It was Westinghouse who fucked Tesla the  most.  Westinghouse and Morgan profited most from the inventions of Tesla and Edison.  Westinghouse is gone, but it survived long after Tesla lost his last penny, and profited off of television manufacturing. GE is still almost a monopoly.  It's fruitless to pit them against each other: both were great engineers, but Edison was the greatest. He changed the world more and in more different ways.  

Edison wasn't in bed with JP Morgan, JP Morgan had him by the balls. JP Morgan created GE out of the shells of Edison's companies, whose share prices he dropped through shady dealings with Tesla and Westinghouse. He then placed McKinley in the oval office, invaded Cuba and the Philippines, and was generally a terrible person.  So go after JP Morgan, JD Rockefeller, whomever, but going after the engineers who actually create the technology is ridiculous. It's sad how uninformed people are about the Tesla/Edison rivalry, and this thread won't do much good I'm afraid. 

I do agree, it's sad that Tesla wasn't able to profit as much as Edison was. But this is to do with the financial people he aligned himself with. And as the father of film, Edison had some of the worst business ideas in history, basically making him responsible for the film industry moving to Hollywood, as far from him as possible.  But you can't take away that he was a genius inventor on a different level from Tesla, who was also a brilliant inventor but in a much more restricted set of fields. ","1425168669"

Now when you separate variables and integrate you will get the right answer.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; But the human body doesn't wait to tell us to eat until we're eating less than is healthy for a normal sized person, or until we're eating too little to stay alive. It tells us when we are getting less energy from our food than we are using.

So all it takes to lose weight is to just wait until you feel hungry to eat.  That and count calories.

&gt; Regardless of your calorie requirements, if you're eating a substantial proportion less than that value, you feel things that make you want to eat.

Untrue.  Those ten cheeseburgers (one per 90 waking minutes) have as many calories as *thirty* bananas (A banana every half hour) which have as many calories as *seventeen and a half pounds of carrots* (Damn it nature!  WTF?) which is one large carrot (72g) every 8 minutes 30 seconds that you're awake.

The feelings you have from delicious food are stuff like dopamine, which is why eating chocolate releases the same chemicals in your brain as when you're in love.  But the kicker is that what happens to junkies who shoot heroin, happens to people who overeat.  It is 100% an addiction to food and you aren't a bad person for being an addict, but the feelings OP and a lot of people have are along the lines of ""Fat acceptance is the equivalent of an anti-[truth](http://www.thetruth.com/) campaign.  We can scold people from smoking and restrict who gets to smoke and where, but we can't do that for fat people eating cheeseburgers.""

&gt; That's the context I'm working in when I say that a healthy body doesn't want you to eat that little. I don't mean that eating 2700 calories instead of 3200 is a low amount for a properly sized person, and that their bodies want them to stuff themselves full of burgers at every opportunity. I also don't mean that you have to eat amounts that are unhealthily low for people of healthy weights.

I figured that's what you meant and if I could just get you to stop thinking in terms of 

&gt; If you're even 20 pounds overweight, that comes to around 5 months of constantly not eating as much as any healthy body would really wants you to.

then I can spend the rest of my night happy.  Being 20 pounds overweight is fine (barring things like being 10 years old or whatever) and fat acceptance should begin and end with ""There is nothing wrong with [Meghan Trainor](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2014/red-carpet/cma/news/meghan-trainor-768.jpg) she isn't skinny, but she looks fine."" and if it stopped there, where do I sign up?

And the reactionaries who turn into Kevin Spacey from Se7en aren't okay either, but 

[Fundamental Arguing Point]:  Why is it okay to have whole ad campaigns against things like smoking and social acceptance of shaming smoking but not unhealthy eating.  Stripping away specifics, it's okay to say ""Oh my god, how can you put that in your body!  Don't you know that you're killing yourself right now?"" to one person and not another.

&gt;  When you have a calorie deficit, your body will say 'hey, I don't really want to burn this fat, maybe go grab a sandwich instead'. 

At best, a healthy body will say ""Hey, I'm at a calorie deficit.  Feed me."" and your brain goes ""Well fried Twinkies make us feel awesome!""  

&gt; It will tell you that every single day, for however long it takes to lose the weight.

Now you're just describing an abusive relationship.  With food.  And, again, that doesn't make you a bad person.  And, again, that's perfectly normal coming from an addict.

Look- I used to be 5 foot nothing and 260 pounds in fifth grade.  Then puberty happened and I became 6""1' and 260 pounds.  Then I got sick and tired of being made fun of and not having a girlfriend and not being able to do normal kid shit like run or bike or skateboard or even swim for too long.  So I did something about it.  

And you're wrong- your body will eventually stop telling you that you aren't good enough to quit.  And what it comes down to is a question they ask in A.A.-  Who's in charge?  You, or the addiction?

It's harmful thinking, and even on a few eating disorder sites, to say ""Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels."" And while [Jennifer Lawrence may disagree,](http://i.imgur.com/nqcyIjK.jpg) she's never been fat so what the fuck does she know?  But that one-liner is right.  I'd rather give up pizza or Chinese or soda for the rest of my life than go back to feeling the way I felt about myself.

It's not about starving yourself, it's about making the right decisions.  And you keep talking about diets as if they were something you just go on and then quit when you lose weight, but that's why 90% of diets fail.  A diet is a lifestyle, not a vacation.  It's about waking up and making the right, sometimes tough, choices throughout the day, every day.

Look, I'm not saying it isn't hard to lose weight.  But if you were right and it was normal to constantly overeat and choose garbage over real food... why isn't everyone fat?  Why isn't everyone since the industrial revolution morbidly obese?

Telling you that it's okay that you're fat would be the same as telling you that it's okay you smoke.  But it's not.  And that doesn't mean you're scum or a hamplanet or even deserve to be bullied.  But it doesn't make it okay.

You're an addict who hasn't hit rock bottom yet.

You ever see someone so fat [they need a special tool just to wipe their ass?](http://bottombuddy.com/) (btw, *super* fucked up choice of hand model there- she doesn't use those.)  Maybe that's rock bottom for you.

Or who knows?  Some people never reach bottom and their addiction eventually consumes them and then kills them.

And that's sad because they died a horrible, painful death, and it's totally avoidable.","1425168673"

For instance, picking up a girl in a loud nightclub is pretty damn rare for me, and I can't command attention like a taller guy could.

It hasn't impacted my life that badly, I've had less girlfriends than I probably would've if i was 6'2 (mostly because i'd be a lot more confident), but I can't say i'm spending that much time going ""Why god! Why did you have to make me so short!""

But SRD automatically counter-jerks into thinking there's no disadvantage to being short whatsoever since /r/short blows it out of proportion. I've even seen some people arguing that women don't care about height at all, which is definitely a minority opinion IMO. I've met some girls who don't care at all, sure, and I also meet some guys who are really into girls with small boobs. It's just not as prevalent as this thread seems to be implying.

I don't know about the victims since I haven't seen anything from them, but I'm mainly referring to the other fans. They are trying to dictate what she posts. Just like when she retweeted Nash Grier (who Imo is an incredible twat) and they called her out for it so hard that she eventually unretweeted. The fans (not the victims) are literally treating this situation as if Taylor hasn't had any firsthand issues with bullying before. Taylor is a forgive &amp;amp; forget person. They're looking at this situation as if she's rewarding him for bullying when she might be rewarding him for apologizing (who knows what's going on in her head, it's just a thought)

This is like the Kanye thing. He humiliated her in front of the whole world, he apologized (even though he probably didn't even mean it) but she forgave him and now they're friends.

**G**:  Make sure that your B-stem letters (B, Ch, D, F, G, H) show at least 3/4 of the circle. These are only 1/2 circles which makes it a T-stem.  
**A**:  Make sure your letters don't overlap the sentence circle. This is where punctuation goes.  
**LL**:  You did the double circle for a double letter right, but forgot the dots that mark it as an 'L' and it should be completely inside the word circle.  
**I**:  Your 'I' is fine, just remember when you move the 'LL' to move the 'I' too.  
**F**:  Same as 'G'.  
**R**:  You just forgot the dots.  
**E**:  is fine.  
**Y**:  Forgot the dots.

**Falls**: The 'F' and 'LL' have the same issues as above, the 'A' and 'S' are fine.

Another was when I had to scrap my first 3 episodes of Condemned because I thought I had the game resolution set correctly but evidently was wrong.

The three most important things to judge a skill by are its damage output, where it can be used, and where it can hit.  Generally, attacks which can be used from, and attack into, a lot of different positions are slightly weaker (judge the Highwayman's pistol shot against his wicked slice), but not always.

How much it costs depends on a lot of factors. If it doesn't have silver Team Info cards, and if they don't have anyone who got a gold card (so they aren't in packs anymore) you could probably do them for like, at most 4k?

The toughest one other than Erie was Barrie, Ekblad cost me 8k, which was irritating.

If you want to start doing them, and you're trade pile isn't full, I recommend opening a TON of Bronze packs. Contracts always sell if you put them up at 50-100 for an hour, and when you start getting duplicate players and you're selling them for 100 or 200 pucks, you can start actually making coins on the 600 packs. There are enought 3 game durations and +2 all skaters that you can sell for 400-700 pucks in there too.

Why would her attorney feel so safe in that number when he and my wife already stated to the judge that they both felt $500 was a reasonable amount?

Or the fact that the law states at my income with deductions due to parenting time it should be $881 for child-support. But the judge is saying that is not enough that 1000 is the minimum?
Please enlighten me.
How is it she first told the judge that her monthly expenses, due to no bills besides $40 for her phone and food, is $850 including the kids? But now since the first court date with the lawyers it jumped up $900?","1425168680"

Either way, Edison did routinely kill animals as ""demonstrations"" in his fearmongering, and also developed the electric chair, which are the reason the incident here happened.

I've long held the opinion that Edison clearly knew the electric chair was a disgustingly brutal method of execution less humane than the method that the state of New York wanted to replace (hanging), since he was so insistent that it be referred to as ""Westinghousing"" instead of an electrocution.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","If he has the balls to drop him he maybe has the balls to criticise him. Yes if one where to say who's better, falcao or di maria, they are obviously going to go with di maria. He plays midfield for a start and is the main player one would look to for creativity and pace and he has shown glimpses of it. To me he hasn't done either very good since christmas time. People will say ""but at least he tries"" but I'm fairly certain falcao tries the best he can too. 

Where was LVG when the papers were cutting into falcao and making him out to be the next torres? it still happens regularly yet he says nothing. mentions nothing. di maria has a ""dip in form"" and he runs straight to his rescue even after subbing him at half time. Don't understand how that couldn't affect a players confidence. ""boss, why do you protect him but not me?""

I'm not asking for the team to fit falcao mate, I just want the team to regain a bit of identity and play like they're known for. A playing style which was easier to help accommodate strikers. Has ANYONE been clinical and consistent this season up front? I wouldn't say so, so it only furthers my point, I feel. 

Yeah he missed against everton but he scored the winner? after another atrocious shot from di maria outside the box. i'll agree with spurs and burnley but even at that they're half chances at best. I'm talking about golden chances that every striker should be scoring, one on ones etc. I don't think stretching your leg out and missing the ball by a couple of inches merits being called a ""chance"".

I'm honestly not trying to be a dick to you, I appreciate you taking time to have this conversation..honestly. Just answer me this though, do you believe with every fibre of your being that our football is justified and that falcao is the next torres? or do you believe a shift in dynamic to help strikers make better runs and create better chances could lead to a falcao/RVP/wilson goal haul?","1425168681"

I made a quick doodle to better explain my crit so have this open as you read it http://i.imgur.com/AvPxtQz.jpg

So let's start with what this image is all about - The figure. This image is all about this girl hanging there and when not a lot is going on, getting what is there correct becomes way more important. Without a convincing figure, this image looses its potential. To counteract the lack of ""stuff"" in this image more emphasis on gesture is needed. 

Pick between two more extreme ideas. Either she's suffocating and fighting for her life or she's resigned and dying. Going half way is rarely a good idea so pick something and go with it. If she's fighting it, have her arms clutching the rope in desperation, if she has accepted her ""fate"", design the gesture with a top heavy hanging design where no effort is put on fighting the hanging.

The figure is seen from the side. Sometimes this works. The artist Brom does profile shots extremely well however their selling point is often design and solid composition rather than some greater narrative. Drawing a figure from the side often has to do with a lack of ability to think in 3D space. Contrary to popular belief, this is a trained ability and has nothing to do with ""talent"" (take this from a guy that struggled with it a lot early on). Do your best to break this habit and fully realise the figure in 3D space and animate it accordingly. 

The rhythm of the figure is almost non existent. This is most likely because you've never studies it and that's understandable. It's often overlooked in when first learning about drawing but it's vital for both figure drawing but also design. Glenn Vilppu does a great job of explaining this in his ""drawing manual"" book. 

Proportions are fairly off with no real underlying structure. All I think I should say is to consider studying figure drawing a little more seriously through books or courses. Loomis, Bridgman, Hogarth and a bunch of other people teach this well and their books are fairly easy to come across. 

Shape design and composition is something to think about. At the bottom you have some wibbly wobbly shapes and at the top you have straighter shapes. These are contrasting shape designs and should be handled with care. The transitions between these two designs is the figure and it can be used to lead these shapes into each other. 

The longer the ""rope"", the heavier she's going to hang. It implies distance and weight. Long vertical lines are heavy, stoic, still and any straight line leader the eye. A straight, unbroken eye is a highway fro the eye when looking at composition. Use it as you see fit. 

The shape of your canvas matters. Square images tend to be centred and symmetrical and the more vertical or horizontal they go, the more fun you can have with the composition. Basic rules start to break down at more extremes so it requires a bit more of an understanding of composition but it also gives you a lot of opportunity to mess with different paths. When your focal point is centred, try and make every shape lead to it. The wobble cloth leads up along her body, the stuff that's hanging her  can be shooting down like an arrow so it clashes with the shape design of her body. 

When drawing a single figure in an image with little going on, look for good inspirations. I already mentioned the artist Brom but also look up James Jean and Alphonse Mucha. They do this well and you can learn a lot from their work. 

When later adding values to this- consider making the high points of contrast where you want the eye to go. You probably don't want the first thing you see to be the complex shapes above so have them in low contras. High detail demands attention and so does contras. You can fight one with another but work best when they're together. 

I'm probably missing out on some points but I'm at that point where spelling becomes more difficult because of sleepiness. Anyway, I hope this helps, I hope you consider this constructive feedback and good night! ","1425168682"

As a German, yes. But the U.S. deserves the same treatment for their involvement in the same war. They gave the Dresden treatment to every major Japanese city, followed that up with two nukes and then contributed to the Japanese denial of war crimes by absolving the royal family of all responsibility (including a prince that was present for the Rape of Nanking) and pinning all blame on a single chief of government that acted on the emperors behalf after the war had already been declared. I'd actually say Germany and Japan deserved a harsher treatment still, but the treatment of Germany would have been perfect for the U.S., which let Franco buy his right to continue his fascist regime until his death in exchange for military bases in Europe instead of finishing off the axis for good.

I don't know if a higher power is necessary for sobriety (not doubtful, just uncertain). I think you'll find some people who are adamant that you need some sort of higher power while you'll find others who manage their sobriety successfully without one.

De todos modos yo pienso que sólo con cambiar la forma de elegir a los miembros del Consejo del Poder Judicial y quitarles a los partidos de gobierno poder sobre determinadas instituciones que tendrían que ser organismos independientes como el Tribunal de Cuentas y muchos otros. Sólo con esto avanzaríamos mucho en este sentido.

Yo creo que eso lo podemos hacer perfectamente, por supuesto poco a poco, no se pueden tomar todas las medidas de golpe, eso no es posible, hay que preparar el terreno, eso por supuesto, las medidas de calado no se ponen en marcha de la noche a la mañana y  menos partiendo de donde partimos. Hay que ser prudentes, somos un nuevo partido sin experiencia de gobierno, por supuesto que en eso tienes toda la razón.

Yo hablo radicalismo en el sentido de tener claro qué país queremos y ser coherentes en tomar las decisiones adecuadas para conseguir nuestro objetivo.

In a three or four way fight for the WDC Nico would have come off very badly indeed. 

Basically Lewis's racecraft, speed, and driving ability were clearly superior. So I don't buy the idea that you could just replace Hamilton with any other driver a get the same results. 

Equally Lewis is a global brand with 11% name recognition in the US and 69% in the rest of the world, Vettel is the only other driver even in the [top 10](http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/the_scores_are_in_how_our_athletes_fare_on_repucoms_dbi_index). Hamilton's image rights alone are worth $50 - 100 million in a 5 year deal depending on the terms.

So the marketing opportunity Lewis represents for the Mercedes brand is quite impressive - and not something you could even achieve with any other driver on the grid. This is why he'll end up with a larger pay deal than Alonso or Vettel.","1425168685"

Off my head, I can already think of a bunch of memorable feuds: Cena vs Big Show, then vs Carlito, Benoit vs Booker T, Lashley vs King Booker's Court, MVP vs Matt Hardy.

They actually used it to hype up the soon-to-be new WWE champion or WH champ or challengers. Cena was feuding with JBL when he lost his U.S. to Orlando Jordan. I think Guerrero was the U.S. title a couple of months before beating Brock. Although Lashly didn't win the WHC, he did feud with King Booker(WHC champ at the time) while as the US champ. 

While all of that was happening with the U.S. title, the I.C. title was completely buried on Raw. ","1425168686"

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","Its okay to not be ready. I'm in my mid-20's and I am still waiting to get my divorce settled. For now, I am in nursing school and pushing through life with it. I have those thoughts still. Its awful, I know how it feels like leaving the house and throwing yourself out there. Its scary sometimes. It also does not help that most of my classmates in my program are in long term relationships or engaged, while I am the only one with a D looming over my head. I have gotten over it and focus on acing my theory classes and clinicals. A friend of mine once told me, love does not feed the stomach. 

I do have amazing and supportive friends that help me through it when time gets tough. It does get better everyday and I promise you, you will be back to when those emotions do not run rampant in your everyday life. Its crazy to think of life without someone else but we were born into the world by ourselves right? Sometimes, all it takes is your mind to focus on something else.

My goal I know for my own self-esteem/self-confidence is that I am in a program for a career I absolute love. I just started nursing school when my marriage fall apart, it was the hardest time of my life but at the same time, I knew that if I had decided to give up this career again for the SECOND time, I would be stuck in limbo with my life. Do not give up on your own long term goals when stuff gets tough, I learned it the hard way the first time but was given an opportunity the second time. 

With dating, give yourself plenty of time to evaluate yourself before you start dating a lot of people. I think one of the blessings about being in a serious relationship before is that you know exactly what you're looking for and do not have time for games whatsoever. I have been very confident with saying no to things and not letting dates that do not pan out make me sad. 

Take care, dear!","1425168689"

Tigrex Vambraces S  
Artian Coil S  
Tetsucabra Greaves S (Torso Up)
2x Attack Jewel 2, 1x Attack Jewel

Gives Attack Up (L) and Sharpness+1 without a Talisman.  I have a Rook Talisman with Attack+4 and 1 slot, which lets me turn it into Attack Up XL.  

It's also fairly easy to make, with the only real sticklers being Ancient Fragments (you only need 5, and there are plenty of other Torso Pieces that can replace the Artian Coil); the Diablos Mats, which are time consuming to unlock; or the Firecell Stones and Dragonbone Relics, which aren't too bad all things considered and replace the Diablos Mats completely.

Also of note, It is ugly as sin, though this is mostly due to the fact that the Velociprey mail clashes with the rest of the set. Unfortunately, I have yet to find anything that replaces it and grants an equally good boost. Something Red might be nice.","1425168691"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I would strongly recommend going with your pride on the not cheating part, especially if there is a writing component to the class. A good professor can ID cheating if they notice that writing style has changed. Cheating probably isn't worth the potential consequences of getting caught.

I personally chose to forgo taking a class the semester I was due (this one), but it's not the last in my degree, and I already have a job in my field. The summer class is, at best, a gamble, because you have no way of predicting how your birth and post partum recovery will go. But you're right that a 100 level course isn't exactly the end of the world, especially is you have help with the baby.

I think, in your shoes, whether or not I'd take that gamble would depend a lot on the type of job the degree is supposed to help me get. Is a degree required for professional certification that you have to complete before applying for jobs? Are entry level jobs in your field thin on the ground, or is it more of a job seeker's market? Is your portfolio more important than your degree? Are your connections a big factor in employment? Bottom line: will it substantially harm your chances of getting interviews if you put ""BA in X Major, expected Dec 2015"" instead of ""BA in X Major August 2015?"" As long as you are properly qualified (and yes, actually having the degree may count) and capable of a job, your potential employers probably aren't going to care about a gen ED requirement that you are still committed to completing.

I barely understand any of the equation especially how the superscript and subscript works, but it makes sense to say it progressively from start to end.

The fact is, prior to legalization, possession, consumption and sale of marijuana was a crime. They knowingly broke the law and were caught doing so. You can't whine about going to jail for a crime you intentionally committed. It's like not paying your electric bill then complaining that the lights went out. It may have been a retarded law, but that doesn't mean you won't be prosecuted for it.","1425168701"

Shortly before she was diagnosed with a malignant tumor, doctors took a sample of her tumor and sent it to a lab.  She tried to treat her cancer but eventually died.  

Scientists noticed something about her cells that was different:  they would not die after a few days, like all other human cell samples.  This became the first known human immortal cell line, meaning that the cells kept growing, never dying out completely.

What did this do?

It allowed researchers to study cells with much more efficiency.  Samples were grown and sent all over the globe for study; as a matter of fact, to date, 20 tons of her cells have been grown.  They were used to develop the polio vaccine, and are being used to research cancer, radiation, toxic substances, gene mapping, sensitivity to tape, glue, and other cosmetic items.  

They were the first human cells ever cloned, as well.

There are around 11,000 patents involving her cells.

So basically, this is the woman responsible for one of the most massive leaps forward in scientific research the world has ever seen.","1425168702"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Whenever you are safe to do so. The ADC needs to learn to auto attack when he is close to the bush so he can duck into it to immediately drop minion aggro.

One of the best times to auto them is when they go to CS a ranged minion. That tends to put them closer to you, and if you attack them at the moment they attack a creep, they can't retaliate without losing out hard.

I'll graciously accept even trades when I'm ahead in hp as well. 

Auto attacking is a major part of an ADC's harass, but you need to know when it's smart to do. Dropping minion aggro with the bush is the biggest part of it. You can't be taking tons of minion hits, or getting hit by support skill shots when you do it.

My support and I tend to play fairly aggressive as well, but it tends to be quite methodical. One moment I may dash in for a skill shot combo and autos, other moments I may just throw a skill shot with nothing else. 

It seems like you're still figuring out where that fine line is. Keep up the aggression, and tune it as needed. You'll find the right spot soon enough where you can consistently be aggressive, but not put yourself into too much danger.","1425168703"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; You seem to be trying to convince people in here mostly by being deliberately offensive. An (admittedly quick) look at your comment history shows that this is a common thing.

You realize that this is a public forum, right? Real discussions don't happen here. If you think that one's credentials are hurt by not really caring about being aggressive, you are yet again confirming a bias as opposed to looking at facts.

&gt; I begun typing a response, but I'm 40% sure you're just a kid lying to bolster your argument ...

Like I said - I am a senior engineer. I work on radiation transport for medical and shielding applications in multiple industries (so the related regulators are FDA and NRC); I am a former nuclear reactor operator. I worked as both a consultant within industry, and as a researcher in academia under both industrial and federal contracts. So no, it's been quite a while since I've been a kid. Feel free to not believe this, of course.

You can absolutely change my mind, *if* you provide some sort of actual data that confirms yours, and denies mine. So far, you haven't done anything at all that would be remotely close. See below.

&gt; and even if you're not, I'm 100% sure I can't make you change your mind, so what's the point?

If there isn't one, why did you even type your post? Not to mention - are you implying that your position is somehow more prone to adjustment than mine?..

&gt; You go on working to institute institutions into government...

What the hell gave you an idea that this is something I do?.. The argument was ""This is a good idea, and worked in recent years"", not ""This is something I've been working on.""

&gt; ... and I'll go on working with grad students, showing the differences of what they've been taught vs what the industry needs them to do.

Several basic logical errors you've made:

1. Grad students in technical fields very rarely have industrial experience. Probably 2-3 out of 20, if that. Depends on the field, of course. So it makes sense that what they've been exposed to, and trained to do, cannot replace industrial experience... for industrial work. But this in no way says anything about faculty... which is what the original suggestion was for. Noone suggested recruiting fresh graduates for top regulatory posts.

2. What was suggested, was getting academics - aka, only the best experienced and qualified professors - into regulatory positions. Even if 95 out of 100 grad students are in fact disconnected from reality - this (a) says very little about the professors that trained them, and more importantly (b) you can choose THE BEST, not the TYPICAL ones for top regulatory positions. And the best academics will often have decades of experience of either close work side by side with industry, or even flat out work IN industry. Ever heard of the notion of ""Professor of the Practice""? That's who it's for.

3. A regulator is not a product provider. The issues you mentioned - i.e., how project scheduling, ""real-world problems"" (which, by the way, is exactly what industrial-academic partnerships are designed to address), etc., work - are issues for the industry to tackle, not for the regulator. Should the regulator be aware of them? Absolutely. But to quote a recent statement by an NRC commissioner - ""Making the nuclear industry profitable is not our job."" And every regulator should recognize that this, and only this, is the right attitude for regulation, as opposed to compromising only to increase profits of already vastly profitable industries. And then again - technical expertise can exist along the vertical of the regulating body; a conflict of interest at the top is a MUCH more pressing issue than a lack of technical expertise.

4. Can you give examples of academics placed into regulatory positions that demonstrated this ""recipe for disaster"" prediction? Because I can give at least two examples of the exact opposite.

a. Steven Chu for DOE (not a regulator, but a lot of control over research funding and regulations).

b. Apostolakis for NRC (easily the best and most qualified commissioner for many years).

And your examples and data - not from fresh grad students (who are irrelevant for this discussion), but from academics, actually placed into regulatory positions, and ""causing disaster"", are?..","1425168703"

The old, traditional programs they might be struggling with in certain countries but I can see how they might expand within 5 years with their productions, such as house of cards, lilyhammer, etc. Its a little like Steam, giving interesting concepts an opportunity to become reality.

Im not sure if it would be worth 8 bucks though but it could work.

That being said, this wont happen. They will continue to throw in highlights of other programs where they can. Its a matter of money. Some shows are worth spending that money and some are not.

* la massa al riposo di un sistema chiuso, oggi chiamata ""massa invariante"" è costante, nonostante le variazioni in energia del sistema

* la massa che cambia con l'energia del sistema veniva chiamata ""massa relativistica"" e [Einstein stesso la considerava priva di senso](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.205.5072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) perché senza corrispondente materiale.

* la massa al riposo si può misurare solo quando la particella o l'oggetto macroscopico sono fisse rispetto all'osservatore

* un oggetto è fisso rispetto all'osservatore solo quando ha la temperatura 0°K. Quando la temperatura aumenta, le particelle che lo compongono cominciano a muoversi. Il centro di massa dell'intero sistema si sta muovendo in piccole vibrazioni.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I have a couple of thoughts. 

I think the main thing in creating an extremely tanky character is a health balance between types of tank, and accounting for the situations they are useful in. 

For instance, armor, regen, and AA are all similarly very useful against small hits, but less good for big ones. This is also fairly true of Block and Dodge. Blocking 75% of 100 hits that do 100 damage is helpful, while having a 75% chance to block 1 big hit is scary and RNG dependent. 

On the other hand, IC, MoM, High Life, and high ele res protect reasonably well against bigger hits. 

Right now I feel like you are throwing a lot of different types of tank in there instead of really taking advantage of and fleshing out a few key tank ideas. 

Places you can go: 

1. Emphasize life/armor tank and block/spell block. This also fits well with self-cast Immortal/enduring Cry and Vaal Immortal Call. Could work well as a Hybrid build with Aegis. Getting some Aura nodes could boost defenses here a lot and let you run purities.

2. Use EB/MoM (probably from Cloak of Defiance) to create a large net health/mana pool. You would Utilize artic armor, for small hit mitigation. Adding a saffel's for ele resists works well here, and the spell block is nice. 

3. Cloak of Flame RotP RF. Righteous fire builds in general are pretty tanky. Cloak gives a lot of lovely physical mitigation. The regen needed for RF is quite high, so popping a ruby flask gives super high regen when you need it and with cloak increases mitigation more. Going pure tank RF frees up your mana, so you don't need to worry about pool size or regen too much. You can run a bunch of auras (+ the purity of fire you already need) relatively easily. And your damage scales from max health, so that is pretty cool, and encourages a high total life pool. You can even use a saffel's for better total res if you have good enough gear. ","1425168709"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","/u/gregnuckols does refute the ""hamstring activation"" theory in other articles on the subject. See: http://www.strengtheory.com/high-bar-and-low-bar-squatting-2-0/

&gt;Of course, this raises another interesting quandary.  With 10% more weight and a 10% shorter moment arm for the knee extensors (resulting in the same required torque from the quads), you wind up with a 6.5% longer moment arm for the hip extensors which, when combined with 10% more weight on the bar, means the hip extensors have to do about 17% more work.

&gt;I’ll pause right now for the sake of the less mathematically inclined reader to say, “Don’t worry too much about all these numbers.”  The main purpose they serve is to illustrate “more” and “less” and, to some degree, how much more or less.  The exact values aren’t very important.  As long as you understand at this point that low bar means more forward lean and hip flexion, the same amount of knee extension torque, and a fair amount more hip extension torque than high bar, we’re on the same page.

&gt;So, at this point, you may rightly be thinking, “17% more required hip extension torque?!  If that’s the case, then how the heck can people squat more low bar?”

&gt;Because low bar squats are probably less likely to be limited by back strength than high bar squats.","1425168716"

Those words both are used to compare ""bad"" things to historically oppressed groups of people. Using OCD to describe behavior that is mildly perfectionistic rather than the kind of thing something with an actual diagnosis would experience is, at  worst, uninformed and insulting. It's like someone who is having a bad day calling themselves depressed - inaccurate and annoying, but not purposefully offensive. Calling ""bad"" things ""gay"" or ""retarded"" is purposefully offensive in my book.","1425168717"

I get where this is coming from, but in all honesty I wouldn't even settle for this. As you mentioned, OP, there is no legal agreement in place, so you should have time with your child unsupervised. She is the furthest thing from a person able and allowed to make those kinds of decisions.

I would lawyer up quickly, and see what they have to say about it. If she is keeping your kid away from you like you're saying she is, you have a strong case in court.

Consult with the lawyer as to what to do or not to do as far as getting evidence for a potential court date. I've seen it happen where dads just do what the mom says because she has custody of the child (non-court mandated) and the court will take that compliance as an admission of that situation being okay by the dad's standpoint. 

My dad had good experiences with James Tymchyshyn, he seems to know his stuff and was able to get a very good verdict in favor of the father instead of the mother. Too often many lawyers don't take on cases where the mother has custody simply because the courts usually favor on the mother's side. It's changing, but it still remains an issue.","1425168724"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Upvoted, if only for illustrating my point. A hot blonde doesn't become sexier for being a doctor, a famous actress, or a governor. Status has nothing to do with individual women's beauty. But collectively, men end up desiring women exhibiing traits correlating with high status, be it tan/fair skin or slim/curvy stomachs, depending on what kind of society you live in.

And yeah, I do think body standards as set by our society are fairly unhealthy, but it doesn't take a genius to figure that much out. Keeping the ideal body type in a society along the BMI of 20-25 or so would be much better for the mental and physical health of young women than the current way of using anorexic skeletons as models and adding photoshop on top. Then there's even more arbitrary beauty signs, be it body hair, hair colour, or eyebrow/eyelash shape, but altering those isn't as unhealthy as starving your hopeless ass.

As for your final point, certainly, women don't deserve to be treated better or worse for the ways they are born. I just wanted to point out how status affects male attraction in a subtle, indirect fashion, and how beauty standards can be arbitrary and harmful, though shaming and bullying men for that is just about the worst way to go about changing that.","1425168724"

When I started doing this I started noticing that the people that are having trouble in the classes I was doing well in weren't necessarily dumb, I mean they could be, but that they hadn't prepared well enough before class to be successful.

Yes, of course a few musicians do, but they are almost always exceptionally talented in either production or marketing. It's nice to be able to think that you could make music production your career but reality is harsh (you don't need a random stranger to tell you that, of course).

I don't want to discourage you from making music but if you are truly passionate about doing it, you shouldn't quit just because it doesn't make enough money, or because your parents think it's ""retarded"". This goes for pretty much anything.

Make it a hobby, and be pleasantly surprised if you end up making enough money to support yourself.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The big problem in that study was that the handlers were told There is FOR SURE 100% SOMETHING your dog must alert on in those rooms. It just isn't accurate or fair. In the real world, in training scenarios and in civilian competitions (like nosework) the set up is that there may or may not be something for the dog to alert on. Having the handlers believe their dog missed a scent led them to not trust their dog in that scenario and in my mind creates a big inaccuracy in the study. I'd love to see it redone with everything the same but tell the handlers that a 'clean' room is possible. 

What if you sat down in class to take a multiple choice test and before the test the teacher said ""The answer to #2 is C"" and maybe the answer on C was kind of right but not really right and all the other questions looked wrong too... would you try your best or would you go up to your teacher and say ""This is all wrong!"" 

I know I wouldn't approach my teacher (maybe I didn't study as well as I thought...) OR tell a group of scientists trying to make my job seem like a lie that they were wrong...

I've done a little scent detection training with my dog and she has never once falsely alerted, sure I could ""make"" her alert, or read something she does as an informal alert. And I am SURE there are bad cops out there doing that, but I bet there are a lot of solid dogs out there with really high percentages of correct alerts. The other hard thing about real world searches (and competition) is that sometimes the dog 'false alerts' but the dog isn't really wrong because they can smell SO much better than us they can pick up if a bag of weed had been sitting somewhere recently. I use little metal tins to hide odor for my dog, a few times I have forgotten to replace the odor in a tin after a week of it being empty and she can still find the odor (she doesn't alert on new empty tins, I tried.)

TL;DR I think dogs are very good, accurate tools but like all tools it is really up to the person using them to do it right. ","1425168728"

Take something like high speed rail lines.  It might make sense to tax all the residents of a state to build it, then place the stops in places that make the most economic sense.  People in areas that don't receive stops might not want to pay in to it, even though the economy and state as a whole need it.  I think this is a serious danger of letting people individually or communities individualy opt out - you allow important programs to falter because people don't see their own immediate needs met.

&gt; But Jim Crow wouldn't have even been possible if autonomy was a valued thing in our society and if black people weren't disenfranchised by the state to begin with.

We still see large amounts of racism, even with Jim Crow laws officially off the books.  One advantage of our government structure is that we at least have, officially, an idea and goal toward treating all people equally before the law.

*In mathematics, the dimension of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the unit circle in the plane can be specified by two Cartesian coordinates, but a single polar coordinate (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This intrinsic notion of dimension is one of the chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.*","1425168733"

* 1/2 Tbsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp chipotle chile powder
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp Kosher salt

Coat 12oz mahi mahi fillets heavily with seasoning mix. Bake at 350... until it's done. 

Mango salsa: I don't use any measurements particularly on this, just put in however much of each part you want. 

* Cubed mango
* Cubed avocado
* Diced tomato
* chopped red onion
* jalapeno
* 1-2 T lime juice
*chopped fresh cilantro 

Chipotle lime Greek yogurt crema:

* 2T milk
* Splash of lime juice
Combine in a ramekin or small jar; let sit for about 5 minutes until it curdles

Then add 1/4c Greek yogurt and 1/2t chipotle powder and shake/stir

Once the fish is cooked, chunk it up and put atop tortillas- my husband prefers flour, but corn is good too, with a scoop of the mango salsa, some black beans, chopped red or green cabbage, and finally top with the crema!

"InternetIsBeautiful","t5_2ul7u","I understand what Marx thought, and cannot blame him for how some modern followers treat it like a religion. He never advocated blindly believing everything he ever said. And you are right, he wasnt anti-capitalist he just saw it as passing phase and one better than feudalism. It is like malthusianism. He predicted the world population could never go over 1 billion people, or so, or everyone would starve. He had solid logic but was wrong in many ways. 

I am not a marxist either but I am not anti-marxist. I am just being honest. I find marxist to be annoying and almost fanatical in their beliefs, similiar to libertarians. Anyway, he did have a good criticique of capitalism and was right that it did cause social problems but there is no historic precedent to support communism or Marxist socialism. 

There is a lot to be said of socialism in general. We are seeing a trend of the state increasingly becoming involved with markets and providing for its population. This is not Marxism and is not done by workers but by burueacracies and technocracies, and markets and inequality are not going way, just the downsides of poverty are curbed somewhat. Again this is not Marxism, although you could say Marx has had an influence on these type of systems. 

So I do hold Marx in high regard but his whole socialist to communist theory, and his definition of socialism have never happened, and if anything history shows that they are not inevitable, but the opposite. Impossible to implement, and result in autocratic command economies that perform even worse than  the system they sought to replace. That doesnt mean he was a failure, like I said his beliefs are very influential today, but not in the way he predicted. ","1425168734"

- Why AI is not allowed to be particularly autonomous and powerful ([the Mars tragedy](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/12977-News-Update-WILL-WE-NEVER-LEARN), although that one's follow-up reading).

- The circumstances behind the end of the Messer dynasty and the establishment of The Fair Chance Act of 2795 (spoiler: ^corporation ^with ^close ^ties ^to ^the ^Imperator ^attempts ^to ^cover ^up ^genociding ^an ^uncontacted ^sentient ^race ^and ^all ^native ^life ^in ^terraforming ^a ^planet ^for ^commercial ^gain)

- How humanity has handled first contact as we've gained experience with doing it, in changing conditions (the Vanduul have no time for diplomacy, for example).

Also, go through all of the ship commercials (except perhaps the 3xx series ones that are just flashy pans around each ship in a studio), those are all in-universe and set the tone for how humanity treats the stars, at least filtered through media and marketing.

[M] Sorry for summarizing things in meta, but nor the humans or angels fully understand what they actually are. God created the universe, but gradually sort of ""left"" as in deïsm. He was still visible in a lot of things he made, and this Undying Sovereign and his Archangels are the most powerful remnants, which still means that they are immortal. 8 immortal people should be fine, especially if they won't fight other players rulewise?

Anyway, in my storyline the creator did make the Urians at some point, maybe without noticing, because deism. Since the Undying Sovereign is his ""heir"" in some way, he retains memories of creating the world and a whole lot,of things, but not everything in this very old universe.

In the game/account of the screenshot I posted:

* Speed - random between 350 and 500 ms
* Time played - a little over 1 hour

These are perfectly reasonable for anyone that's good at the game. I could make it go slower and have the random intervals be more random and it wouldn't make a difference because you cap credit at around 70k satoshis.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","1. It seems to me that the only purpose moving the right AI to the left hand is to preserve the number of Auraxiumable weapons, totally ignoring the potential reasons people unlocked a right AI to begin with (such as synergy with the left hand).
2. Handheld melee weapons, in the big clunky hands of a MAX would be useless (I mean, just look at how the wrists and arms move in a MAX, totally not conducive to holding a melee weapon). If MAXes were to have melee weapons, they ought to be mounted on the weapon hardpoints, replacing the guns and launchers. Moreover, unless the MAX can melee with each arm separately, it's garbage that a melee hit doesn't OH. We have knives that already deal more damage than being punched by an powered exoskeleton.
3. Shield mechanics are problematic as they are, this adds nothing and potentially detracts from the NC. If you really want a shielding option, make them arm attachments like the guns. Left arm generates a half shield that wraps around to the left shoulder, right arm generates a half shield that wraps around to the right shoulder. Shields should be a more powerful version of Resist Shields with unlimited duration.
4. Give this to the VS.
5. This seems terribly broken.

"technology","t5_2qh16","At the risk of being ""that guy"" there's a bit of contention about the benevolence and efficacy of having a Federal Highway System. 

Militarily speaking, it's a great concept because it enables you to move troops a great distance with great ease. Of course, this being America, we're already pretty difficult to invade. This point is essentially moot, but worth mentioning.

The reason there's contention over the highways has to do a little with the tolls and how those projects don't tend to 'end' per se, and a LOT to do with how it made the US dependent on individual transportation, thus oil, and a lot of other things required for the auto industry.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'm seeing some good explanations as to how this applies to cars but I'm also seeing people that are giving misinformation about what torque and horsepower actually is. For those interested, here are the textbook definitions.

**Torque** (**τ**) is defined to be the product of a force (**F**) times the length of the lever arm (**r**) - that is, how far away the force is applied from the axis of rotation of an object - times the sine of the angle theta (**θ**) between the force (**F**) and the lever arm (**r**).

In equation form: **τ = rFsin(θ)**
The SI unit for torque is the **newton-meter** (**N-m**).The British unit for torque is the **foot-pound (ft-lb)**

**Horsepower** is a unit of power. **Power** (**P**) is defined to be work (**W**) divided by time (**t**). Another way define power is **the rate at which energy is converted from one form to another.**

Equation: **P = W/t**
The unit for Power in SI units is the **Watt (W)**. The British unit is **ft-lb/s** or more commonly known as **Horsepower**. 
In a vehicle, this means how fast the vehicle converts the potential energy in the fuel into the rotational kinetic energy that turns the motor (not a car guy so correct me if I'm wrong)

**Work** (**W**) has two definitions that are related to one another. Often the common way to define work (**W**) is the product of a force (**F**) times the distance over which it is applied (**d**) (i.e. pushing a box 5 meters) times the cosine of the angle theta (**θ**) between the force (**F**) and the distance (**d**). The more intuitive way of defining work is change in energy (**ΔE**)

Equation: **W = Fdcos(θ)**
or  **W = ΔE**. The SI unit for work is the **Joule** (**J**). The British unit is the **foot-pound** (**ft-lb**).

Edit: Greek letters added. 
Edit 2: Although Joules and Newton-Meters are the same thing it is convention to use Newton-Meters for torque in order to distinguish it from work and energy.","1425168741"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Ok, here it goes. 

1. It's not a fight against genetics. It's a fight against bad habits, bad choices, and an unhealthy lifestyle. Sure, some of us have a crappy metabolism, but that's not the reason why we're overweight. Your genetics are not the reason why YOU are overweight. You are overweight because you've made bad health choices. You're a big man now, own this up. That's the first step.

2. Smoking and using recreational drugs haven't worked because all you did was replace one bad habit for another. In any case, all of those habits will negatively impact your health, so they're all bad ideas. 

3. Insurances are shitty, sure, but not for not paying bariatric surgery to a person who is not morbidly obese. YOU can fix this, but you don't want to do the work, so obviously they won't help you take the easy road. That being said, if you do decide to pay for the surgery yourself, it is important that you're aware that if you do not change your eating habits, you will most likely regain all the weight you lose. Healthy eating is a lifestyle (and by this I don't mean eating only vegetables and fruits, I mean learning to give your body exactly what it needs), not just a way to lose weight and then go back to the old ways. People who undergo bariatric surgery usually also have to go through a psychological process, so they understand what loss weight means. However, private practices will be more flexible with this, as they are interested in having your money, whether you're ready for it or not. They don't really care about your success, it's a business.

4. Yes, losing weight is VERY WORTH IT. You will look better, you will feel better, you will be healthier, you will be happier, and it will give you a chance to work in some deeper issues... as... discipline, accountability, persistence, maturity. 

5. If you decide to take control of your life and your unhealthy habits, there's a community here that will support you and guide you. There's a lot of information in the FAQ, there's free digital tools you can use, there's people with experience and a lot of information. It is an empowering process, but you have to want it, and you have to be willing to change your life and change yourself, and to grow up.

Good luck.","1425168741"

So, because fans at the Garden cheer when the Celtics make a good play and go quiet when the Celtics make a bad play and the Knicks score it means that the Celtics are pumping in crowd noise?

"Diablo3Monks","t5_2v5x9","At 40-50 Gr your role in groups will be support no matter what. No class comes close to dps of a buffed DH. (as far as current meta of builds goes) - That being said the way that a monk provides high dps in groups at this level is solely through EPalm damage. Aside from that the best you can do is run support of debuffing mobs further.

If your ping is good, Go the max cdr on every piece route for perma serenity. 

Ancient Fist of az / ancient borns offhand 10% cdr on both 10% resource cost reduction is luxury if grouping more/ mandatory for solo high GR with this build.
Lightning Strong arms / cold gundgo for grouping depending.
Captain crimson boot+pants with EP damage rolled on boots 
8% vigilante belt
born chest
high roll leorics with FIdiamond 15% EP damage dex pref 
10/50/8cdr swk gloves
10/dex/cdr/socket swk ammy
8 cdr swk shoulder vit/dex/life/armor secondary resists on everything

There are many ways to set this build up depending on grift and group comp. If you find yourself dying too much with ""perma"" serenity build (there are specific cases where you can die) - you can run a more mitigation based build with alteration gem , sixth sense etc.

Those are the widely known methods of playing monk at a higher GR setting. 

There are a few other threads theorycrafting what invis is running with his GR 61 4 man group but I honestly have no clue. Not even close to attempting that GR level.

1) NPC allies are **really** useless. In Dynasty Warriors 8 they would attack much more frequently, did more damage, and often took objectives by themselves.  In this game, if the npcs ever split up you end up having to do their mission as well anyways.

2) A Legend mode more like Dynasty Warriors 8.  In Dynasty Warriors 8 every faction had their own ~14 mission campaign that also had objectives mid mission which would affect subsequent ones (stop an ambush and your ally will still be alive in later missions.)  If you did all the bonus objectives you'd unlock a branching path at mission 9 that lead to an alternate, hypothetical conclusion.  Moreover, each faction had 10 bonus missions not directly related to the main story.  Coming from DW8 I was really disappointed by the campaign.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","This game should seriously be remade. Bjergsen entered the game with the wrong runes and they remade champion select to fix the issue (Summer split, S4, NA LCS, Week 10, Day 2). Azingy paused and wanted a remake, yet was denied. This situation presents incredible inconsistency on Riot's part. I’m fairly certain that the bug occurs when the player selects a different rune page, but the change does not register, which would be very difficult for Riot to verify. Also, if I recall correctly, Piglet was offered a remade champion select after he told the referees about his own rune blunder. ","1425168747"

If you call it out on here, you're often yelled at to ""go back to tumblr"" simply for speaking out about how harmful and dangerous it is to make fun of transgendered lives.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I owned a 2BR/2BA singlewide trailer in college. (It was actually a pretty smart idea and I fixed it up nice) A friend of mine moved in as a tenant and things got weird fast. He cheated on his girlfriend with another friend of mine (who was also cheating, solid people overall...), would wear headphones and ignore me if I spoke to him, never once cleaned his room or bathroom and lost his shit when I threw his dirty laundry, that he just left all over the living room, onto his bed once when my mom was going to visit. Like, screamed at me for ""trying to be his mom"" and then stormed out and went to a mutual friends' party where everyone told me later that he had just ranted about me ""touching his clothes."" So it was bad. Then one night I get a call from another friend asking what living with the guy was like because he was about to sign a lease with him. I had NO idea he had been planning to move out. I asked him about it when he came home and he was like ""I don't have to tell you anything."" Nevermind our lease? But, whatever, it was finals time and, knowing he was going to split any day without warning, I bought and installed my own wireless router because we had been using his. I got up the next morning to log in to a class and print shit out only to find he had ripped everything out of the outlets and thrown in in the middle of the floor to plug his shit back in. I just decide to make breakfast and calm down and go into the kitchen and find one of my great-grandmother's china plates on the table with a note on it. Upon closer inspection, a toothpick was stabbed through the note... and into a still-alive roach. The note said ""YOU have roaches. this place is disgusting."" The plate had come from the collection in his bedroom. I lost my shit and went into his rooms and bathroom and found dirty dishes and food scraps, even in the bathroom. The roach had come from his incredible collection. I called his cell phone and left a voicemail telling him his ass had better be coming home with boxes, because he had 48 hrs to get out. He did come home with boxes and screamed at me calling me all sorts of names, then packed up the stuff he wanted and left the shit he didn't. At this point, he owed me 2 months rent, and I was keeping his security deposit to cover the cleaning and damages. He left a bunch of shit he didn't want of his mom's and girlfriend's but told them both I had ""stolen"" it. He refused to come clean the rest out, so under our state laws I had the rights to seize the remainder of his property and sell it to compensate for money owed. I tracked down his mom's number and called her because some of the furniture had been his dad's that had passed away and it was nice and I felt terrible about it, even though he left it behind like trash. She had no idea her son was acting that way, but wasn't surprised, and tried to pay me his missed rent. I wouldn't take it because it wasn't her fault her son was a douchebag.

TL;DR- Guy went nuts, yelled a lot, stabbed a roach in the kitchen, embarrassed his mom.","1425168750"

I actually have no idea. They are categorized as different languages, so my guess would be that some are more closely related than others, and some of them are completely different langauges. There is apparantly about 250 different ethnic groups nativly in Nigeria.

Pole vaulting friend suggested 10 sets of 2 rep - fast, explosive, shoulder to bar pull ups, 3-4 times a week. Within a month I could do 2 consecutive muscle ups, by the end of my track season I was doing 10 straight no sweat, great form.

Also it isn't necessarily how many pull ups you can do but mostly about form to get the muscle up - form trumps power any day (from my experience)

My suggestion is to continue whatever training regiment you already have but also try to add the 10x2 hard/fast/explosive/high pull ups into your work out.

Normally erythroid development happens in your axial bones and terminal ends of your long bones, but during sickle events your body goes into overdrive, pumping out as many cells as it can from other bones and organs (the spleen, liver, and the marrow in your skull included) to make up for the sickle cells short life span. Hairy-looking skulls are the result of this.

Personally, the eunuch argument for transgenderism speaks for itself. 

Getting Rid of Transphobia:

* Use the right pronouns.
* Use their preferred name.
* Don't try to ""convert"" them.
* Publicly announce your support for trans* people. If you believe it's right, stand up for it. That's what Jesus did.
* Just be supportive of any choice they make.

There's no valid reason to wear anything except a full face helmet. If you, for some reason, need to keep the helmet on but eat, talk, etc. you can get one of the 'flip style' helmets where the chin guard flips up, but I advise against those.

With a regular full face helmet you have the option of leaving the visor cracked for some ventilation, while maintaining full crash protection, and most of the eye protection from the actual visor.  With a flip up, you lose that.

I can tell you that while my pedigree as a USC graduate didn't do shit for me (people didn't just blindly hire me because I went to school there), the people I met and the opportunities I got from doing student films and then having those folks recommend me for stuff later on, etc. led DIRECTLY to my getting critical jobs in Hollywood and working steady union for 7+ years in prime time TV and big movies (I was a sound editor). Obviously it is different for writing, though considering how insanely competitive your program is, I hope it's more prestigious.

I honestly don't know what I would have done without my SC education and the opportunities it gave me in my career. I'm still reaping the benefits of it, both in the film school and outside of it. The Trojan Family is truly an amazing group to be a member of.

Of course that having been said, 60K is a metric crapton of money. I had mad financial aid and was thankfully able to graduate without debt, but I'm not sure I would have dropped 60K on it, even with all the amazing benefits.

"coloranalysis","t5_35s40","For analyzing what color is best suited to your body, realistically you should have nothing artificial in the image, not even the fabric of clothes. It's like starting with a blank canvas; you can only get a true reading from your purest state of being (what genetics gave you). 

On a side note, I can tell you right now that your current glasses do not suit you at all. In fact, you should try and avoid black whenever possible. I am just like you, skinny with dark blonde hair and blue eyes (though yours appear green, they are still light). Picking the wrong glasses is actually a VERY common problem. People tend to think that black goes with everything or that they can't go wrong with picking black frames. In actuality, black frames are the worst possible color of glasses for people like us. You should be go no darker than a medium brown. Tortoise-shell glasses are my personal pick for people with blonde hair and light eyes. 

If you are concerned with hiding the bags under your eyes and you are trying to do so using glasses, your current frames are not the best possible choice both in color and style. You should be using a frame that has a medium-to-thick bottom rim. This paired with a light brown or blonde color frame will not only bring out the color of your hair, skin, and eyes better, it will also make your bags appear unnoticeable.

Also, for when little one gets sick or colicky, get a bottle like playtex's vent-air so they can drink while sitting up more. Once my first got a little older, I switched to Avent natural bottles. They don't get suctioned in by the stronger sucking and they're still more like the nipples than most bottles. 

Honestly though, I would register for several small packs of different types of bottles. Some babies are really picky, and you'll find that you are too. For instance, everyone I knew raved about Dr. Browns bottles, but I personally hate them so my LO didn't get to use them.

Also, make sure the nipples are the lowest count right now and change them the higher count nipples as LO grows. If you get some Level 3 bottles, when LO is a newborn it can cause choking because it comes out MUCH faster than a Level 1 nipple.","1425168766"

From 10lb up to 65lb, I tie with 7 or 8 turns instead of the prescribed 4-6 and cinch it down way tight before trimming the tag end with a just a wee little bit sticking out as insurance. No issues really to report and judging by how hard I have to pull with the wrap-around-a-stick trick for stuck lures to either break/bend trebles or pop the knot to not leave line in the water, I'm retaining damn near most of my line strength, or at least certainly much much more overall strength than I would have had with equivalent diameter mono/fluoro.","1425168767"

Unless you are a freak of nature, if you are eating at a **consistent** deficit you will lose weight. 



You mention binging.  If you eat one meal a day for a week alternating with going off the rails and ingesting thousands of calories, that will affect weight loss.

Both seem to be user error, what's the difference and why the different rules?

&gt; Each team captain shall verify that every player on his/her team has finalized their intended game settings
(including runes, masteries, controls, and GUI settings) before GOR is established. Any error in verification is not grounds for a game restart **after GOR is established**.

&gt; A game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has **progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams**. Once a game attains GOR status, the period ends in which incidental restarts may be permitted and a game will be considered as “official” from that point onward.

He paused and noticed the error before it could officially be called a game of record, as there had been no meaningful interaction.

These are part of an image the WWE works very hard not to project.

That said, I think the main reasons A.J. will never main event are his age and his attitude (he's not particularly politic), plus, perhaps, a lack of desire on his part.","1425168772"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Culture is only a secondary point here; it speaks to intent. His intent was to discipline his child the same way he was as a kid, the same way all his friends were, the same way his community as a whole does. White or Black, that's the norm in Texas. It may not be in New Hampshire, or wherever you're from, but it is down there.

&gt; We should understand that someone's bad acts don't override the rest of their character and stop pretending that someone is either ""good"" or ""bad."" This isn't a damn comic book.

In that same exact vein, you seem to miss the fact that Corporal Punishment is legal in many states. 
There's an entire continuum at play here.

Slapping your child on the ass is not ""child abuse"". Hitting your child with a whip/paddle is not ""child abuse"". Hitting your child with a whip/paddle, hard enough to leave a mark, is not ""child abuse"". Hitting your child to with a whip/paddle, to the extent it causes some bleeding/abrasions is excessive corporal punishment, a misdemeanor in many states. Hitting your child etc etc until they're bleeding profusely, need emergency medical attention, etc is a felony and will get you thrown in prison.

What AP did was cause some light bleeding/marks, because he went too hard. The state agreed that his intent was good, but the outcome was bad - which is why they plead down instead of taking a hard line. Was was he did ""abuse""? I don't know...? Is telling someone they're ugly ""abuse""? It really depends on your definition of the word (/Clinton). Kind of like the phrase ""eye rape"" even existing. Oogling someone with a low-cut top and yoga pants, working out in a public gym, isn't ""eye rape""; being a legit peeping tom, staring in their bedroom while they're changing, *is* eye rape and you should go to jail for it. But I digress.

He was punished, but even that won't hold up. Because no matter how much Goodell wants to make it so, you can't punish a guy (or at least, punish without pay) before he has his day in court. All the NFL really cares about here is keeping the players off the field, they honestly don't even care if they ultimately lose in arbitration/court and have to pay the player the money.

This is what happens when 90% of your league is players from a working-class background, and all the league hierarchy is mostly Rich White Dudes. These disconnects are going to continually happen, and won't stop happening. I would hope that as fans we can see this for what it is - a power play, allowing for knee-jerk suspensions whenever the media/sponsors go into a tizzy - and not pretend for even 5 seconds that the NFL gives an actual fuck about justice or due process.","1425168772"

"NoSleepOOC","t5_2vy7p","So I'll start off with how I entered the project.

The Alan Goodtime event was started initially by some of the original Nosleep writers almost two years ago (it's between 1.5-2 years).

It was worked on and a lot was figured out, but it became increasingly complicated and didn't appear to have centralized leadership.

About 9 months ago a post popped up in the OOC referencing a secret sub and asking for new blood.

The sub was where the Alan Goodtime event had been planned. It was full of unfinished stories and outlines and concepts and conversations and ideas.

Entire story arcs were in there.

I was with the new batch and I was still sort of new to nosleep. So I sat around with the other newcomers.

I got involved with the /r/mysterymansion and a couple other things and kept my eye on the secret sub.

A few people posted about how it was going to die again, so I made a post asking if they would mind me taking over.

No one objected, so I sat down one day and read through the year worth of posts. I took notes and came away with an idea.

I would ask some of the bigger nosleep writers (who, by the way, were involved in the original Alan Goodtime prep - as in, from the beginning) if they would like to take on the role of lead writer.

My plan was to have one of them write a story based on the notes I had. I talked to Bloodworth about it and he was totally down. We exchanged opinions on the original ideas and story arcs that were bounced around and he had a lot of cool ideas and wanted to take it in a direction that I completely agreed with. The original idea was pretty complicated.

So we simplified it.

Bloodworth would write a three part story.

Then we'd bring other authors on board. Their rules were to write a story in the same world as the one Bloodworth wrote in. Then we gave them a list of things they could incorporate and the rules behind those things.

Pistachios meant something, the little store, Alan.

It totally centered around the first story, though.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","This is a problem that should be fixed through changes to the skill system and items (i.e. set and legendary effects that alter skills) though. Monster group diversity that requires target prioritization, both in terms of high-threat targets and varying toughness, is definitely a superior design.

The problem you mention is because D3's skill system has degenerated combat into ""spam your highest damage AOE"" 100% of the time. In D2, by contrast, you would use your AOE to clear out the riff-raff, then use your high damage single target skills to kill the tough guys. Or you would single-target the most threatening mobs first, then clean up with AOE. Or alternate between damage skills and crowd control skills on high-threat targets. D3's design is ""lol single-target? wtf is that?"", ""crowd control? why would i put something that doesn't deal more AOE damage on my bar? noob.""

Unfortunately, this is very difficult to fix in D3 because of the ultra-simplistic design they used for the core of the combat system with only 6 ability slots and no capability to change skills during combat. Some people love to cite that D3 is more complex because you have 6 active skill slots vs 2 in D2, but neglect to mention that you constantly hotkey swapped between 10+ abilities with the most interesting builds. You could actually have things like passive buffs that need to be maintained, utility spells, and single target spells, because they didn't directly compete for skill slots like in D3.

The closest we get in D3 is in 4-player groups, but it requires players to become highly specialized, and choose between dealing damage OR having utility. There is no middle ground where players have to make decisions during combat about ""should I be doing damage or using CC right now?"" and constantly making decisions about how to most effectively use their next spell cast/global cooldown.

There are some incremental changes they could make to improve the situation slightly for D3, but I think that ultimately the solution is ""don't design Diablo 4's skill system for consoles first"". They could go with a more complex initial design that could then be made to work on consoles, but it would definitely be a challenge to keep the combat depth with the limitations of a console controller vs. mouse and keyboard.","1425168778"

But I still do stand behind my general argument. It's definitely P2W (because balance), but it's not really enough to affect the average user's experience.

It's sort of analogous to CoD's progression system. Yeah there are definitely some guns that are better than others. And yes getting scopes/equipment is definitely helpful, but having nothing isn't so terrible that you don't want to play CoD anymore. The relative difference can be more or less overlooked when you're playing. And again, I believe it has to do mainly in part with how League chooses to design (clear cut roles so you can always find a champion to fit) as well in general less impactful spells compared to Dota.

However when I played Pokemon X last Christmas morning for the first time and had my first 3D battle with my Froakie I once again found the love for the Pokemon series. It was amazing and after a good 8-9 years I finally played Pokemon because I wanted to rather than having to force myself.

And I'm not the only old fart, as there are at least 20 people I have tagged as being ""Anime Fogeys"" for being over the age of 35, but I'd say only a few of us are active in this sub at any given time.

(See one of my previous ""old man yells at clouds"" moments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2p7uv7/any_adult_anime_fans_here_what_is_your_favorite/cmu94fh).)

It's often difficult being an older person in the anime community. For one thing, we have a completely different outlook on life and anime. We have more and broader experience sets, both in anime and in 3D, giving us a viewpoint that just can't be matched by the younger fans. And sometimes that outlook makes younger fans wonder if older folks like me even know what the hell I'm doing, like what happened to me earlier this week, because the difference in mindset can be very wide indeed.

Yet it lets me see something like 5 Centimeters Per Second and remember that long bus ride in the rain to see the girl that moved away in the middle of the fifth grade. It lets me see something like School Days or White Album and remember when something similar actually happened. It lets me see something like Myself;Yourself and remember walking in on a scene far too similar for my own sanity. It lets me watch title after title in a completely different point of view than just about everyone here.

It also keeps me out of the more prominent circlejerks-du-jour. Not the fun ones like the Best Girl debates (which, of course, is /u/Jordy56), but the rage-until-frothing-at-the-mouth type of circlejerk that is very stylish here. Glasslip wasn't even close to the worst anime of all time. DEEN hasn't ruined Log Horizon. The faerie parts of SAO aren't that bad at all. Slaine did nothing wrong. And so on. 

And that's just over the past three seasons. Multiply those examples over the last five years and you notice that I go off on a whole massive tangent away from many of the more popular opinions found here. 

It's a good thing that I don't require outside validation for my opinions. That's another good thing about being older, as we say pretty much what we want to and not concern ourselves that much with how it might clash with someone else. So I continue to put those unpopular viewpoints out there and let the [downvotes come as they may](http://i.imgur.com/Cnq7Uxb.gifv).

"borussiadortmund","t5_2svdo","At this point Miki is not a number 10, but a central midfielder. Kuba and Groskreutz can easily replace him, while both Gundogan and Sahin can play similar position. If you see him as attacking midfielder, Kagawa, Kampl, Kuba, and Reus is there; with Aubameyang could be there on a certain extent. Anybody remember Hoffmann? He is a decent young attacking midfielder that can gain playing time if Miki left the club. Heck, Durm is originally a winger and probably dying to play in that position. 

Just like /u/I_am_the_7th_letter said, I think Dortmund need a striker more than anything else. One with goals. ","1425168783"

"manga","t5_2ql0i","yeah Mangacow's translation skips over a few details like when he was prompted to enter a character name he cuts off the question part way in order to get past it faster but mangacow's translation doesn't deal with that at all. Mangacow also drops a lot of adjectives and glosses over to get the main point across instead.
One notable thing that mangacow did would be that they completely ignored the translation of 투지 and just said ""Your stats has increased"", and things like translating 교관 as Teacher instead of Instructor when Teacher is closer to 선생 instead, and just stuff like that.

tl;dr he's not kidding when he said ""inaccurate speed translation"" but it's still better than google translate","1425168783"

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","I've felt similar things recently.  I think part of it has been our decision (which I was fully in favour of) not to have children.  'The meaning of life' is often said to be to pass on one's genetic material to the next generation, and I think that realising I'm going to have to find something else has been hard. 

I'm an avowed atheist, and I've enjoyed going to the synagogue more recently.  I'm only half Jewish by birth, and the other half Catholic, but I've found most Catholic churches in LA are quite conservative and dominated by Latino people, who seem rather insular.  I've spoken to the Rabbi a few times now, explained that I don't believe in God and so on, and he's been remarkably friendly and kind.  He's never lectured me or told me I'm damned or whatever.  And I find a lot of what is said at religious institutions is about morality, about helping others and so on.  I think it's made me a kinder person.  

Like you, I think I know too much to go back.  I still enjoy books by Dawkins, read SciAm, donate a few dollars every year to American Atheists and so on, but I think religion (if not belief in God) can help provide some kind of meaning in life, so long as one does not cling to it too closely.

Exactly by the end of he series Sulu was a very capable captain in his own right commanding his own crew and working for Star Fleet separate from the Enterprise. Still he was alway loyal to his former crew mates. 

Also Uhura was a communications officer not a glorified secretary. She had to intercept and interpret information and determine whether the person or ship or culture was dangerous, if they needed help, if they wanted friendly relations etc. 

No seriously this annoys me so much. I love those characters. I have only been a Star Treck fan for a short time, but I have grown to love those characters and while there were some episodes that could be seen as sexist or racist they were still incredibly progressive.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Hmm I've been playing a bit more QE Invoker lately and I find it more successful than QW for me. IMO the first item u should always build on QE Invoker is Midas. He really needs the levels to be useful. Next item, it depends on how you are going in the game. I go Necronomicon because its synergy with Cold Snap/Forge Spirits is borderline OP, crazy pushing power along with some good stats. Blink/Force is a must have without much to explain for a hero like Invoker. Aghs is very good if u are good at casting combos (I'm not :P) I like to go items with disables/CC like Orchid and Sheepstick. Skadi is good for kiting melee carries. Euls is actually superb for QE since other than doing 'that flashy combo', it gives you everything you lack on going QE (mana regen and MS) plus a very useful purge/disable. BoTs can be acquired later on for great pushing and global pressure.

To end, Invoker's itemization is completely dependent on the game's situation. It really comes down to your own experience and game sense on what items are best against the enemy lineups, making Invoker one of, if not the, most flexible heroes in the game.","1425168788"

Lucky charm details: I got really depressed when I first got out of high school and was actually homeless for almost 6 months until I was able to get a decent paying job at a machine shop. I had always been fascinated by psychology, more specifically the way that successful people think, and I had read many times that successful people tend to think positively. They don't doubt themselves, they're happy, and most of all confident. At this point in my life I was trying to overcome my own psyche and think positively. This proved to be very difficult, because my brain just looooves to be negative, but nonetheless I was always thinking of ways to help myself without anti depressants and shit. One day at work I was machining a part and a piece of stock that I had removed resembled a tombstone. I thought hmm that's kinda cool and I considered making a key chain. I engraved the tombstone with the letters RIP and to me, that meant that my negativity had died that day. I stuck the small piece of metal in my pocket and have carried it ever since. Whenever I catch myself thinking unhappy thoughts I feel that tombstone in my pocket just to remind me how far I've come. 

That charm really helped me change the course of my life. 

I think that was the answer you may have been looking for. ","1425168794"

"Silverbugs","t5_2t1b5","well by the time I got there (had to check up on our new home being built) he had already sold out of everything he had, but I talked with him for quite a while and this is how he does business, he strictly sells at spot and makes his profit from the spread. All he had was several old ass Engelhard 1 oz wafers (again, selling for spot), which was boring to me because I'm sorta over the 1 oz wafers for the moment, but he did have a unique looking Engelhard 1 oz wafer that I did actually buy because it was different from the rest. I'll post a pic later.

So he's calling me on Monday because he has another shipment coming in and he said he'll have a bunch of Gold 1 oz Canadian Maples...again for sale at spot pricing...just blows my mind! 

He doesn't care how much numismatic value something has, he sells it at spot no matter what! And for those of you big into ""junk"" silver, this place would be like a candy store, he has so much junk silver and other world coins it's insane, he has this HUGE metal bowl just full of coins...all the customers I saw coming in were super old folks.

I strongly believe that this is where all the old folks in my city go (my city is a favorite among elder Canadians) when they're either about to retire or kick the bucket and want to cash out...

So he has this steady daily supply of precious metals that just walk through his door, but then he sells out of it all in a few hours because he has a list of customers who he calls when he gets new stock in, they then decide to buy it or not, if they do, he says he sits it aside and writes down the current spot price during the call so when you go in to pick it up, you've already locked in your price.

I can't wait for him to get some sweet Perth mint coins or some awesome semi-numis! This is the first time I've ever heard of this store and it's been around for like 20 to 30 years!!!  Needless to say I'll pretty much only buy my bullion and coins from him unless he just doesn't have what I want...but considering he only sells at spot, not a penny more, I'd be a fool to shop anywhere else for bullion!

TL;DR I bought an Engelhard bar at spot price, 1 oz...waiting till Monday when he'll have more stock.","1425168794"

Of course you are correct in that ""benefit"" might be a better word that ""selfish"".  But the real point is just that our minds can only make decisions based on some evaluation and we choose, unconsciously, the action with some benefit.

Naturally people are good-hearted and do things for others.  This observation is more about how our decision making is programmed.","1425168796"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","All beings in Star Wars merge with the Force when they're dead.

Jedi can come back as ghosts by basically keeping their consciousness separate from the Cosmic Force for a time, though eventually they must join it.

In canon, Sith cannot extend their consciousness past their death. In Legends, they can; either like Palpatine whose spirit survived Endor and took over a succession of clone bodies, or by binding their spirit to a location or object, something akin to a lich though without the physical body.","1425168796"

It's usually too cold to swim north of the city, but there's some shallow water to the east that is warmer.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","Its not a sublet. That is what the property manager and Adam wanted, since they ran my credit to qualify for the apartment and Adams is bad, but I definitely did not want that. 

I'm afraid if I gave him keys, and without doing any kind of inspection, he could 1) try to deduct unreasonable things from the security deposit, which is a substantial amount, or 2) damage the apartment between now and the inspection and try to blame it on me. I'm usually a pretty trusting person, but every interaction with him has thrown red flags left and right, so I want to do what you say and just let Adam/Tim/The landlord sort everything out.

I was just wondering if I have a legal obligation to give him the keys. I mean I don't even know if he's actually signed a lease, he certainly hasn't paid a security deposit, which is usually required before you move in right? ","1425168797"

They are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish banana. When ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is cream to light pink in color. They are also softer and sweeter than the yellow Cavendish varieties, with a slight raspberry flavor. Many red bananas are imported from producers in East Africa, Asia and South America. They are a favorite in Central America but are sold throughout the world.

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","&gt; isn't the jury's only job to decide if there is a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty?

No. The jury's job is to decide whether the prosecution has proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt -- after consideration of *all* of the prosecution's case. 

""Reasonable"" doubt is something that is rational in the context of all the evidence.  It does not mean ""any"" doubt, or ""all possible"" doubt, or doubt that arises from speculation without a factual or logical grounding. 

If the law followed a standard like described in the opening post, then no criminal could ever be convicted of anything. Generally in all cases that go to trial there is conflicting evidence and uncertainty about what happened -  if not, the case usually is going to be resolved before trial.   

I really don't think it's appropriate for anybody to talk about ""reasonable doubt"" when they haven't heard the entire case and testimony, as presented by the prosecution -- and of course including the defense's response to that case.   Certainly you can't purport to second guess a jury's decision under those circumstances.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Aye, which is why Charisma is such a huge stat for undead, especially incorporeal ones.

Charisma isn't interpersonal skills (not directly anyway), which is what most people default to thinking; it's linked to motivation, passion, dedication, confidence, etc. Those are all traits that contribute to likeability. 

Bards put a lot of passion into their music, and that appeals to people. Paladins can be grating on the nerves and have terrible interpersonal skills, but damn do they throw themselves into their cause. Cheerleaders are popular, shy/quiet kids are not. 

A character with 6 Charisma is going to be pretty passionless, possibly even apathetic. Their social skills will be dismal, but not necessarily abrasive (think Jersey Shore: douchebags yes, but douchebags with Charisma out the ass). They may know the best jokes or be able to perform music flawlessly, but both come out hollow. They can still have friends, but they're not going to be the centre of attention in the group.

Furthermore Reddit doesn't know balance, it has been proven before that the mass of players has no clue what is working and what is not. And matter of factly it is not absolutely obvious to me that Kassadin will stay down. Do I assume so? Yes, I did not really feel like he needed a hard nerf at all, but I am not certain, I have guessed wrong before. Time will tell.

Veigar on the other hand I consider a conceptual failure, where we got instead of a well thoughtout rework, a hurried bandaid that isn't coherent at all. I am quite curious how this will develop actually, I can't see a number buff to do much than bandaid the bandaid. Riot obviously didn't think so, else they wouldn't have released him in this state.

Great, and  plenty of reworks had trouble at the start. Xerath was struggling what I remember, Nidalee was struggling hard directly after her rework, ect. Having some examples were people figure the kit out faster isn't doing much, as long as it's not the rule. This doesn't mean those reworks were failures, just that it took people longer to get used to them. Bad winrates after release =/= bad champion (both bad/undertuned designs and difficult to play/adopt changes are going to have terrible winrates if you give them too little time)","1425168802"

Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder is a real disorder, but it defies probability to suppose that Harry just happens to be one of the ~100 sighted people with the disorder in the entire world, while also being the Boy-Who-Lived. Also, the precision and regularity with which it manifests in Harry doesn't sound like a natural disorder.

If it is a magical effect related to his link with Voldemort, then it may be that Voldemort suffers from it as well (although he probably treats it with potions or other magic, if he even sleeps at all). Now, I'm not going to rely on Voldemort suffering a sudden attack of narcolepsy in the midst of trying to murder Harry, but it might suggest that the best spell for attacking Voldemort, should the opportunity arise, is not *Avada Kedavra* or *Stupefy* or *Petrificus Totalus* or *Expelliarmus*, but *Somnium*, a spell that Harry is very good at from the Army games.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","As i said before, im not sure you are familiar with doing speed runs, but when you can easily clear T6 avoiding elite mechanics, but suddenly gets oneshot by a white monster, something is wrong. 

They dont start spinning until they are close, really? If you run Mystic ally they will be out fightning in a corner, where one of them could be spinning. On top of that, they start to spin fast sometimes. Having a mechanic that can instakill you while they have nerfed the reflect damage affix is just beyond retarded. 

How is this far to a new player? While he is doing his best killing stuff, then suddenly he gets one shot out of nowhere(because he doesnt know about it), and his character is gone if he plays hc? 

A comparison to Corrupted angels is not even close to being the same. Sure you did less damage, but they could still be killed. This is something that kills you because you have way more damage than you do health. 

Meanwhile a barb can charge into anything with Raekors without being punished? How about if a barb would get oneshot if he charged a spinning dervish?

On top of that, they are nerfing things like ""
Succubus
Bloodstar
Removed the armor debuff from this attack""
which just adds caution to gameplay if you happen to get hit, but being able to get one shot is fine? 

Getting one shot in any game when you are way beyond that level of play is just stupid, end of discussion. Im all for adding harder stuff, but having white mobs that are more dangerous than elite packs is not how the game should be.

But argueing with someone who doesnt like hard content being removed, while playing softcore is just too funny.","1425168807"

I'm a daily streamer just trying to have fun with the game who is looking into starting to really get into Youtube/Twitch. Currently i do not post youtube videos because i don't have a large enough following to put in the work to make videos that have a higher production quality. I do not like ever giving out something i think i could have done better on or done anything diffrently with in a positive way of course :D. 

So a little back round about myself, i took a year off from school to try a pursue a dream of hopefully doing something with video games (Not necessarily becoming a pro or anything, i'm no where near good enough for that haha) i started playing video games when i was extremely young and continue to play This and CS:GO mostly. I stream everyday once to twice a day. Normally around the hours of 5 P.M - 3 A.M Est. I dont wanna make this to lengthy so i'll wrap it up here and hope that some of you decide to come check out my stream and any critiques would be GREATLY appreciated. I know i'm far from a perfect person so any help will be super amazing :D

The main theme for it was about authenticity when it relates to performance. I started out in the main art building wearing a suit and a mask I designed and intentionally doing magic tricks that failed while acting nervous and a little clumsy. My final trick was to summon a god for aid with my magic which seemed like it didn't work until I removed my mask to show the same design on my face that I did with makeup. As this god (this was a few years ago and I think it was supposed to be like the Baron Samedi) , I then acted with conviction, changed my posture and my voice so that I seemed like the opposite of the mortal I acted like before. Then said that I will now use my ability to teleport.

This part was difficult and I'm so glad I pulled it off, but I had to practice getting onto the roof as fast as I could (using a hill behind the main building and various parts jutting out under the roof) that aided my ascent so that by the time the students and the professor came out, I already was on the roof as if I did teleport where I did this quick sermon with some props I left the night before when practicing.

"iphone","t5_2qh2b","Well those are settings and that's certainly a good time thing to try and improve your battery life. But if the total life is consistently dramatically under what you should expect it's more likely that you have an issue (software or hardware). At this point we haven't done any troubleshooting to determine what it could be yet - that's okay. 

In general basic troubleshooting goes like this: restart, reset (settings- general- reset- reset all settings) , restore backup, setup as new. 

Always make a backup before you do any troubleshooting. If you want to save your passwords and health data (and a couple of other things) backup to your computer and check off the ""encrypt backup"" button and backup now. 

Then go through those steps. Restart, then try and reset all settings. If those too don't work restore from backup (on your computer). If that doesn't get it try setup as new and call apple so they can run a diagnostics. It's possible your battery might be defective and apple will replace that no problem if you're under warranty. But there going to make you go through a restore most likely anyway so it'll save yourself the time. Plus if you do get it replaced you're going to want that encrypted backup. 

Oh just don't forget that encrypted backup password.

I know you probably think I am being ""pedantic"" but I really am not trying to I do honestly think this stuff is very important and angry Internet mobs have the power to do real harm. It has happened several times before and several times on reddit. 

As an aside have you ever served on a jury? I think your idea of what little evidence is required is perhaps a bit idealized. I was on a jury of a case involving a homeless man stealing some copper pipes. The evidence was someone saw him break into an abandoned apartments, all the copper was missing from the apartment, the police later caught him with a duffle bag full of copper pipes. Slam dunk right? That's what I thought listening to the case. Nope 3 of the 12 jurors wouldn't convict him of the highest charges because and I quote ""no one saw him actually stealing the pipe"" we argued for hours but eventually we had to settle for a much lower charge that the other jurors would agree we had enough evidence for. It really opened my eyes to exactly what it takes to get convicted. ","1425168816"

There are a lot of cantrip options in pauper and while it is tempting to just play them all, you still need to have actual cards in your deck. Most lists run 8-12 cantrips. It's hard to justify playing anything else before Ponder and Preordain, so the only lists with Probe are the ones running extra cantrips and even then Probe needs to compete with Brainstorm, Thought Scour, etc. Gitaxian Probe can be great, in fact I play a more control-oriented mono-U list that takes advantage of the information from Probe.

Why I don't build it?

* Most of the time, a Mikel's Crucible and 2 pink wards have greater value than Zz'Rot. 
* By the time I have finished my core items is the time I  should have a comfortable lead on the enemy to the point I don't need it. 

Why is it a good item?

* The Zz'Rots defensive stats goes well with Eclipse, and the damage from Zz'Rot is amplified by my entire built. 
* I am the teamfight initiator and the split pusher at the same time. I don't have to coordinate with other team members for it to work, which is the bane of playing as a dedicated splitpusher like Tryndamere. 
* Supports control vision, and if I know where the enemy are, then I can make informed decisions about where to go and where to plant my portal. My mobility boots allow me to do so quickly.

I didn't say everybody should own everything collectively. I endorse individual worker co-ops competing with one another.

&gt;Market Socialism is even more stupid that vanilla socialism.

No, you just don't understand either market socialism or socialism and you're redefining them to win an argument which isn't convincing to anybody.

It would be like if I just redefined capitalism to mean, ""child killers"" and then used that new inaccurate definition to argue with capitalists. It's dishonest and ineffective because even if you change the word, you're not changing what your opponent believes.

I don't believe in collective ownership, I believe in putting the means of production in the hands of the laborers. So the real question is, terms aside, what problem do you have with a worker co-op based economy where the workers control production rather than a private owner(s) and stockholders?","1425168819"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;Political parties are only one faction in that government. The military, economic elites, police, ect all have their own interests and exert considerable influence outside of the control of anybody. In order to effectively change anything political parties need to play by their rules. This is why you see politicians in this country routinely bow down before corporations and special interest groups.
At the end of the day their is no conceivable fucking way to make this system truly accountable. You have bought into a naive view of government and of politicians that ignores actual power imbalances in society and what makes it really click.

At the same time, all of these factions are stepping on each other's toes as the individual members of the factions look for their opportunities for leverage. There is no single party politicians bow down to. Each are working for slightly different masters. At the end of the day, there's numerous existing methods for correcting this problem of the marriage of money and state, however no method that involves you being able to say ""fuck you"" to the rest of the world and simply live out your life in isolation. They require real work, real cooperation, real cohesion. So, naturally, as an elitist, self righteous anarchist you eschew it. Which is a shame, because the more I read the more common ground I see we have. You have monsterized the government, so of course you can't see any way to rectify it.

&gt;On the contrary, anarchists understand it better then most. They understand these things only survive via violence and exploitation. Because they do. A government does not survive because of competence, it survives because it's capable of crushing all dissent. And if anything is a constant in human life it's dissent.

Unfortunately, that is narrow minded. At some point, cooperation and alliances will always play a role. A state that functions off of purely violence and exploitation would be one such as North Korea. Since not all nations have devolved to North Korea, clearly other elements are required to understand the nature of a government. There cannot exist a power balance where violence is not a factor, and to ignore or repress the violent part of our consciousness would lead to unhealthy ways of expressing it, and open you up to any who are willing to incorporate violence into their power structure.

&gt;You obviously have no idea what you're talking about if you think anarchists are Ayn Rand types. Quite the opposite, they want strong communities that are run with the consent and participation of as many people as possible. The idea is to create a political structure that is inherently opposed to any sort of hierarchy under the control of one or a few individuals. This has been done, it will be done again, and this current has existed for the whole of human history. Hell, anarchists aren't opposed to ""government"" even, which is another mistake you make. ""The state"" is something else, a monster born of political domination and capitalism. Government is simply a way of organizing society. And anarchists are totally cool with organization so long as it's consensual and under the control of regular people on their own terms, rather then the other way around. You're criticizing something you clearly know jacks shit about. As for ""destiny"", right now your entire world is in the hands of a small group of people who don't give a damn about you. Consider that, then continue to talk out your ass about what anarchists believe.

Strong communities run with the consent and participation of as many people as possible? So you mean *democracy*? The whole issue with democracy right now is the lack of participation, **which you are encouraging**. Do you want a participatory society **or not**? At some point you have to scale up. We no longer live in isolated spots far removed from each other. We have the internet, we have international trade, we have electric power. If we had no political structure at the national levels, we'd never be able to buy coffee at a high enough level to meet demand. We would have to keep track of EVERY SINGLE COOPERATIVES rules for coffee usage, trade, pricing, and weighs and measures. Everyone would eventually flow to the cooperative getting the best deals on coffee. As the population fluxes, that coop must now expand its territory, but gasp! It's already bordering another coop (oh hey! you have border! another tool of the state!), and they refuse to negotiate! One day, someone from the coffee co op won't take it anymore. Room's getting strained. Rent's increasing due to the high demand for living space. So coffee co op groups together some guys, they grab their guns, and they to go take it. Boom. War.

Now imagine this for EVERY PRODUCT AND SERVICE THAT EXISTS IN THE WORLD. That's hundreds of thousands of industries to account for, and you have to account for every co-op's rules for them.

We have everything you want already in place, but it's not perfect so you won't take it. You'd rather nuke it and start over...with you in charge of course. Get off your ass and help your democracy function.","1425168824"

"cosplay","t5_2qkju","Blue and yellow fabric (I suggest cotton , it's easy to work with), pink stretchy fabric (preferable smth thick), navy blue crewneck tshirt, and black/purple fabric paint for the designs. Since I'm assuming you've never patterned anything, find a simple jacket pattern and pants pattern (I suggest from Simplicity, google their website). For the pink, add strips on the sleeves, make a tube top that cuts off before your pecs(two rectangles sewn at the sides), and two strips that fit around your ankles. When you've got your pink pieces cut out (add about 2"" to the length of each sleeve piece, and about 6"" to the tube top), cut them into smaller strips. So e.g. you've now got three strips per sleeve right? Now sew those three strips together to kind of reconstruct your original pattern piece (basically make two seams). This should make it look like the photo. Alternatively, you could do smth with stuffing or piping but this is the easiest way. Anyway, do this technique for the other pink pieces. Cut out your jacket and pants pattern. For the jacket, I suggest painting on the designs before sewing it together. Sew it all together. Add the sleeve pieces. Sew your pants together, add the ankle pieces. The stomach tube top should hold itself up, since attaching it to the jacket wouldn't look right. For the yellow part, you don't need to make a whole sweater, just lay out a sweater you have and cut out one piece of yellow that looks like it (basically just the front + sleeves laid out flat horizontally, so the top is a straight line). Hem it, you can wrap it around yourself. Now with your navy shirt, hem it a lot shorter, a bit lower than where the top of your tube top hits, so you can tuck it in. I hope this helps!

Number 4, it is against Bruce's character to talk about how awesome the Hulk is. 

Bottom line, Iron Man 3 left Tony in a different place by the end, realizing that the person in the suit *does* matter, and that he really is Iron Man.

I'll always need to train new people to our standards whether they have past experience or not. I noticed that those that came from a decent shop tended to have more of a chip on their shoulder and believed that they knew everything already. It was annoying.

He just realized that, in the exhausted state he was in the fight would likely not go well. Especially considering the rest of the WB commanders were there as well.

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt; In regard to the former, there are realism and anti-realism which respectively argue for and against an objective reality.

This doesn't sound right to me.  Realism and anti-realism aren't really names of philosophical positions, but rather describe general sorts of attitudes one might have *about a particular thing*.  Thus one might be a realist or anti-realist about moral facts, or qualia, or mathematicals, or unobservables in scientific theories, and so on.  But if we're just talking about ""realist"" versus ""anti-realist"", my question is: realist versus anti-realist *about what*?

&gt;  I think objectivism and subjectivism can be used more or less as synonyms of them...

The same thing here: objectivism versus subjectivism *about what*?

You say something about ""objective reality"" here, so that we're talking about realism vs. anti-realism, or objectivism vs. subjectivism, *about objective reality*.  But I don't really know what this means.  I can't think of any significant philosopher who denies the reality of, well, *reality*; and I'm not sure I can think of any who denies the reality of *objectivity*; and likewise for permutations of these two terms.

Maybe you can clarify what specific philosophical positions you have in mind when you use this expression.

&gt; First of all, assuming I'm at least sort of correct about my definitions, it doesn't seem like anti-realism and physicalism are compatible.

Physicalists can be, and in significant cases are, anti-realists about a variety of things, e.g., qualia, mathematicals, moral facts, etc.  Though you seem again here to have in mind this anti-realism *about reality* which I'm not really clear about.

&gt; So reality is both objective, in the mind of God, and subjective, in the minds of every subject?

How are you using these words?

Normally, objective means something like this: the truth value of a proposition does not change depending on who is judging it; while subjective means the opposite.  For instance the proposition ""2+2=5"" is objective, since it's false no matter who is judging it, while the proposition ""my favorite ice cream is strawberry"" is subjective, since it's true for some people and false for other people.

""Objective"" reality exists for Berkeley because he understands there to be facts whose truth value is preserved regardless of who is judging them.  For instance ""there is a can of Coke on my desk"" is objectively true, both in terms of common sense and on Berkeley's understanding.  The point being made in the passage you quote is a correction of what would be a misunderstanding: someone might misunderstand his so-called ""subjective idealism"" as implying that there's no objective reality.

But that's not what the term means, rather it's referring to the fact that for Berkeley, we have no valid means of understanding anything in the world except to understand it as it is given in experience, i.e. as a subject experiences it.  This is a thesis about the nature of the things that populate objective reality, not a denial of there being an objective reality.

&gt; Then there is objective idealism, which says that mind and spirit are fundamental...

Not really.  ""Objective idealism"" and ""absolute idealism"" are references to the philosophical position that Schelling and Hegel (and others of their generation) developed in response to the ""transcendental idealism"" of Kant.  Whereas the transcendental idealists analyzed reality in terms of how it is presented to the subject (like Berkeley does, although Kant's and Berkeley's position are not entirely the same), the objective or absolute idealists thought that reality could (and must, to get an adequate picture of it) be analyzed also in terms of nature, understood here as a principle logically and metaphysically prior to experiencing subjects.

&gt; I'm also familiar with Plato's Theory of Forms, and Plato is variously described as an objective or transcendental (which I really don't understand) idealist...

One has to be somewhat wary about describing Plato in terms of the philosophical disputes of the 18th-19th centuries.

&gt; There are a bunch of other ""-isms"" too: according to the Wikipedia page on idealism...

Wikipedia is generally a very unreliable source for philosophy.  I think if you go by wikipedia on these issues, you're likely to be misled.  If you're looking for convenient online resources for philosophy, the best are the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Yeah, I have Anaheim and Vancouver as locks for the playoffs, and it's SJ, LA and CGY fighting for the 3rd spot. I Think Minnesota and Winnipeg take the wildcards, and I don't think San Jose can play well enough down the stretch to surpass either of those teams. Yes, Winnipeg's been in a bit of a slump, but still playing much better than we have been despite that slump. They have a slightly more difficult schedule in terms of there being less easier wins, but they're also facing less teams ranked higher than them in the standing than SJ. I think they have a much better shot at locking down that wildcard spot than SJ does, which means SJ would have to beat out LA (game and 2 pts in hand, stronger lineup, similar schedule) and CGY (much easier schedule, 2 pts up). We haven't shown the kind of consistency, especially lately, to keep up with those teams. I like seeing the team succeed, so I'd be happy to see them make the playoffs, I just don't think it's realistic. ","1425168836"

"youtubers","t5_2sj81","First off, kudos for getting that all in one shot!  I think the big things that stuck out to me were the camera focus, the angle/height of the camera, and the lighting.  

You were *just* out of focus, which was fairly distracting.  You used your voice effectively, and having a great visual would just build on that!

Personally, I prefer the camera to be at a height that has you looking directly at it or just looking up a little bit.  Not only is it flattering, but it will frame your head nicely and make your background more interesting

Lastly, the lighting.  It looked like you have one light shining directly on the right side of your face (from the viewer's perspective).  This is pretty harsh, and casts a dark shadow on the opposite side of your face.  To combat this I would either get another light source for the other side and then soften the light on both sources, or take your single source and bounce the light from behind the camera  to get a more even, soft lighting.

But I really enjoyed the video! You have a great presence, and I feel like if you had 100 more videos like this, I could get lost in your channel for a few hours!  Can't wait to see more of your content!

Another problem with steel framing is that it is such a thermal bridge that it makes it stupid to insulate between the studs at all. You need continuous exterior insulation, like rigid foam. This will be more expensive, will make window and door openings more complicated, and it will be hard to lime up the exterior wall plane with the existing upper floor. Sounds like a boondoggle to me. Maybe on a new house, but making a mishmash of an existing house just seems really problematic.","1425168841"

"csshelp","t5_2roaw","Using `transform` creates a new stacking context, so you'll run into issues like these. Unfortunately you can't just rotate everything and have it work as it once did.

    .title ~ .tagline,
    body &gt; .content {
        overflow: hidden;
    }

will address the two issues you mentioned.

What would make more sense would be to simply rotate the whole page, rather than apply a transform to every single element.

    html, body {
        -webkit-transform: rotate(.5deg);
        transform: rotate(.5deg);
    }

While that's not exactly equivalent, it has much the same effect. You can of course add some other elements into the mix to make it more pronounced.","1425168842"

All that being said, it's useless as an escape. Well, it does damage. How about that? Well, no, because it has a long chargeup time for some crappy damage, when you could have done more just using your auto attacks.  

So let's recap.

If you can stretch your budget a little, I recommend the [$439 (on sale) Panasonic FZ200] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009WS2NGK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009WS2NGK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=battleforthew-20) and a couple of [$70 Aspen HQ-SPK Stereo Lavalier Mics for iPhoneAndroid] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVK29BK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00MVK29BK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=battleforthew-20) [Referral Links].

Plug the mics into your actors'/talent's phones, record to the free [Rode Rec LE app for iOS] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r-de-rec-le/id590021166?mt=8), [Smart Voice Recorder for Android] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrwq.recorder&amp;hl=en) or [Skyro Voice Recorder for Android] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triveous.recorder&amp;hl=en) and sync your sound in post.

Here is how a lav/phone combo works (example is for the Rode SmartLav, but it makes the point for the entire lav/phone category):

http://youtu.be/P2RIFZOGMZo

Here is the video image quality the FZ200 can produce:

*Documentary*

- [The Young Dick Tiger] (http://player.vimeo.com/video/57346685)

*720/120fps Slow Motion*

- [Several] (http://player.vimeo.com/video/65307967)

- [Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ200 Beautiful 120fps High-Speed and Fantastic Effects] (http://youtu.be/Lp_pmgCsmco) (please watch at 1080p)

- [Freestyle Football isn't a Sport, it's a Lifestyle] (http://player.vimeo.com/video/82785006)

*Nature*

- [Camargue, paradise of birds] (http://player.vimeo.com/video/115814010)

And it's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/fz_200/

In my view, the FZ200 is the best 1080p still/video hybrid camera at this price point and a very good value for your money.

Good luck!

This is not what appears to have happened; it appears you swam up to THEM instead of letting them swim to YOU. This is not just about the money and tourism industry, or being a ""sour puss."" This is about disrupting their natural activities and respecting the regulations. 

If this is not the case, and the dolphins HAD swum up to you voluntarily, then the video doesn't show that at all (in fact it shoes the opposite of that) and you aren't explaining very well what was happening. 

I understand you are defending yourself because you seemed to have a great time here and whatnot. But it's just so important to become aware of these things regarding marine mammals and to stop contributing to their decline in health and population in the bigger picture. That's all. ","1425168845"

"opera","t5_2r8vy","Nice! I'm a die hard Sullivan fan -- not strictly Gilbert, but that's a large chunk of Sullivan's oeuvre. Make sure to get to know the rest of Sullivan's operas! The big three outside of Gilbert, and probably my three favorite of his, are The Beauty Stone (a semi-serious opera that was a failure at the Savoy because the audience was expecting a light comedy), Ivanhoe (his only grand opera, which Gilbert refused to write a libretto for because he figured it'd just lead to the same thing that made The Beauty Stone a failure), and The Rose Of Persia (his last opera, and a step back into comedy). Unfortunately, they're lesser known, and so there aren't many recordings of them. But they each have high quality BBC recordings from recent years, so that's enough to get to know and love them at least.

Diana Damrau is really terrific. Did you watch her Lucia that was streamed a couple weeks ago? (Also, did you watch any Lucias with Natalie Dessay?) She'll be playing Leila in *The Pearl Fishers* next season at the Met, and it's going to be broadcast Live in HD! So excited for that!","1425168846"

Not understanding why people post things like this every day and just sitting back and mocking them for being attention seeking whores is the horribly cynical.

If that's not happening, call your state's department of revenue and inquire about the legality of the arrangement.  You may have more leverage against your Nmom than you imagine.

edit: to further my point.  Back when I was a fan of this sport in the 90s and early 2000s, we didn't have to deal with ""going to the monitor"" for every little thing.  It sometimes screwed your team over, sometimes an advantage, usually inconsequential.  Besides, if you lose a game because of one single moment like this, you're discounting all the times where you could have made an easy shot, or a couple free throws.  I'm not a fan of thinking that a single moment loses you the game, so with that mentality I don't think every moment should be scrutinized so heavily.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I still hold that denying Christ (while believing that Christianity is the truth) is different than not believing in Christ. 

Edit: that is to say, there is a difference between-- 

accepting/rejecting Christ, and 

accepting/rejecting the need to accept or reject the offer in the first place. To the non-believer, the offer of salvation is a non-offer.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Yeah but what hurts his case is that Bogut and Dray are 1st and 6th overall respectively. Honestly I'm not even sure if I know what drpm is though. I read the description at the bottom and it says, ""Player's estimated on-court impact on team defensive performance, measured in points allowed per 100 defensive possessions."" That's makes sense but then Bogut is number one with a score of 5.96. It doesn't specify what that even means though... like does he allow 5.96 points per 100 possessions? Does is mean he allows 5.96 points less per 100 possessions than an average player? Is his team 5.96 points/possession better on defense while he plays rather than when he sits? It's clear that a higher score is better since every player below him has a smaller score but it's unclear what 5.96 even quantifies.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","You mentioned that they'll have fewer chances to demonstrate what they've learned because their grade is being based solely on assessments - a key part of SBG is that you implement more assessments, especially low stakes formative assessments that are designed to give feedback leading up to a bigger assessment later. 

Also, try to implement some kind of reassessment system, but be sure to attach strings to it. My students absolutely used to try to take advantage of the system and skate by without ever doing the practice, so I instituted a policy that retakes couldn't be attempted unless all of the practice had been completed. So kids basically had to get a perfect score on the assessments to make not doing the work pay off, which they learned after a few months. 

After 4 years with SBG, the students that cause the biggest problems are the high achieving students - the point grubbers. I've got a kid this year who is bright, but also has ZERO moral compass. He constantly googles answer keys to the work (I teach a pre-packaged curriculum) and tries to weasel out of taking quizzes because he already has high scores. He could care less about true learning and real understanding, he just wants an A and he'll pester me relentlessly until he gets it. The vast majority of my students have absolutely loved SBG.

The chief protects his clients. How can I incriminate this maniac? He beat a women to death because he suspected she was pulling a gun from her pocket. That is savage behavior, deserving of punishment, completely unprofessional, completely irrational, completely tragic. And someone needs to pay for that poor old woman's unnecessary death. I reviewed the case files with heavy concentration.

2:00 - THE HEARING.


JUDGE: Prosecution, you may begin with your first line of evidence to your certainty of Officer Rodriguez's responsibility for his actions.

PROSECUTOR: Yes, your honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Let me start off by explaining to you what exactly he did to this woman. The cop gave no signal that she was being apprehended. He merely saw her reaching into her purse. He followed this by tackling her to the floor and slamming her fragile head against the cement. It took one hit to end her life. Now I want you to tell me. If this woman was your grandmother, would you not be enraged? I will allow the defense to speak.

JUDGE: Thank you, sir. Chief Hicks, you may refute.

CHIEF: Thank you, your honor. Now, before we make any judgment upon this man, I'd like to state that evidence exists proving my client had reason to suspect the deceased woman was a threat. What she was pulling from her purse was in fact a pistol.

PROSECUTOR: NO IT WASN'T. I READ THE CASE FILE.

CHIEF: I have the pistol right here secured in a ziploc. She was preparing to kill my officer. I believe in a life or death situation, one must apprehend with full dedication to their own survival. There was not enough time for him to apprehend the situation in a way that resulted in a less violent result. Panic is human instinct.

PROSECUTOR: Objection. Your honor, the woman had no gun. His evidence is forged. The police department is its own circular protection unit. There is no way I will win this case. The system you allow is disgusting, and I won't put up with another second of this disgusting, vile corruption.

As it retreats, Aura jumps at the Hobgoblin, attempting hit its neck. The monster manages to avoid the attack, and swings at the ~~kung fu~~ panda, but only just misses the familiar.*

*Namika swings hard into the side of the Hobgoblin Basher, hoping to sweep through both of them. Unfortunately, she hits one of the armour plates of the Basher, so, instead of going through them, her powerful swing strikes the monster bluntly, knocking it hard into its comrade and causing them both to be knocked to the floor. She spins round from the momentum and lands to face them again, but both her opponents are on the floor.*

*Taygai activates her 5-hit skill, and launches an attack on the second Skirmisher. The Hobgoblin is hit by the first strike at its chest, but then avoids the second and parries the third. The first swing at its legs hits, however, impairing its movement. The last swing of the skill is then blocked by its comrade - the first Skirmisher, which tries to follow with a strike on Taygai, but misses.*

I think Ban takes this. His snatch + immortality combo is so overpowered. I don't think Law has a way to beat him and keep him down. He might take it in round 1, incapacitating him with Radio Knife and running away before he gets caught in snatch but that'll be Ban's first move in round 2 and Law will get weaker and slower by the second + the strain of using his powers would do quick work on Law until he can't even lift his sword or body.

you are dealing with so few data points you'd struggle to make any good judgements. 

I've been involved in commisioning and recommending designers and I've never heard anyone say 'these guys were in x journal last week why don't we speak to them'   I'd never take a recommendation from someone who hadn't dealt with the people personally. 

In some specialisms or niches you might be able to make a big enough splash with enough projects that you get on some lists but even then I expect you have to know someone, these also tend to be pretty small worlds. Perhaps you might amplify the networking efforts.  ""oh you did the x project, i did read about that""



to revert a bit to your original point. an irritatign thing inthe media is the lack of detailed critique and provision of sufficient info... too often is it a whitewash of 'isn't this lovely' while avoiding the fact that 'that staircase looks like a deathtrap and the acoustics were awful'

I do produce, but my music is actually kind of bad (go to my [youtube channel](http://youtube.com/jwokmuzik) to listen; the songs are mixed in with the other random videos i posted. sorry). I also have a gaming channel, but I haven't uploaded anything in weeks/months. 

Some of you may remember me from my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2tzczk/thank_you_monstercat_for_being_the_one_source_of/) about losing a good friend of mine. Since then, I went to the viewing and the funeral earlier this month, and the Thursday after the funeral I wore my suit to school in honor of him. I keep the pamphlet from the funeral with me at all times for remembrance. I do feel upset about it still, but for the most part I've been fine.

Anyways, the questions.

**Favorite sports team/person**: Don't have one.

**Favorite video game**: cliche, but Minecraft. I am a fan of Geometry Dash (mobile) and the Halo series.

**Most prized possession**: My music collection.

**Best childhood memory**: Spending time with friends.

**Best skills/talents**: I can sort of draw (pencil/paper), and I am fairly well with anything to do with technology and with video editing/creating.

**Relationship status**: I suppose single? I'm not really sure. But I am talking to someone that I have some feelings for.

**Worst life moment**: Losing an amazing friend too soon.

**What I want to be when I grow up**: I take interest in EDM production and making YouTube videos, and those are my top two things. Other than that, I can see myself as an IT person. I've also always wanted to be a dentist, for some reason.","1425168864"

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Still not providing any evidence on that anti-semite claim. Either pony up the evidence or stop talking shit.

Anita was not anything to do with Gamergate, it never focused on her until she decided to start making comments about it. It was not a personal issue about her, it was the way the press handled her. Anita is disliked because she's full of crap, she has been debunked countless times yet the gaming media completely ignores this and pushes her videos as factual evidence of what she says. Remember the week after she inserted herself into Gamergate and started shit stirring she put out a new video on youtube.. HMMM interesting time frame.

No, that's you making shit up. The example I gave was 100% what Brianna Wu did. She made a meme about Gamergate then got upset when Gamergate parodied her. She claimed they hated women and wanted to drive them out the industry because they made fun of her. 

Have you seen any of Anita's shit? It's constantly demonising men and racist against white people. Note the only time she has ever allowed comments on her work is when she was running her Kickstarter campaign and claiming she was under brutal harassment.. and then shut off comments the day the kickstarter ended.. Isn't that strange when she claims to be a victim of harassment?

You have confirmed that you haven't read the post. Eron did not start Gamergate, he made a personal blog post to vent his frustrations over a failed relationship with an abusive person. A third party from 4chan found the post and saw that it revealed corruption in the gaming media and then that snow balled from there. The evidence which you refuse to read is mostly made up of facebook screencaps, Quinn's own words are what prove she is a nasty person. The messages she sent him are not ""a disgruntled ex"", because he was not her ex at the time and he cannot put words in her mouth. The same way he didn't put words into her mouth when she spoke to one of the guy's wives on Twitter about the event. Did you forget about the guy who came out to say Zoe had sexually assaulted him then with drew his comment when Phil Fish bullied him for it?

There is no manufactured scandal, if you had been following the gaming community for the last few years you would of seen there was an increasing hostility between the press and the average gamer, Gamergate didn't get a name until recently because the spark hadn't been lit yet. It got lit by the Zoe post because the tension had got to breaking point and the moment any hard evidence was revealed the dam would break. In Gamergate's case it started by looking at game coverage of a no body and then asking ""who else did this apply to?"" which lead to a rabbit hold of nepotism and suspicious behaviour through out the entire industry from secret mailing lists leading to collusion between multiple ""competing"" outlets (this is a no no in any business BTW, it's not allowed) to awards being given to people connected (and often in the credits) to the judges. It even went as far as to have journalists being paid by and paying people they were supposed to keep a professional distance from on Patreon. I can't think of a single good reason why any game developer should ever be giving money to a games journalist and vice versa and then posting articles about their work without disclosing this financial relationship. That isn't even touching the games journalists covering people they're living with and not disclosing this in the articles (which have now been updated with the disclaimer thanks to... drum roll please. Gamer gate's demands for ethical behaviour).","1425168871"

If you can get your GP to prescribe it, then there shouldn't be too much of a problem prescribing it. Like, testosterone is testosterone, you know what I mean? If she'll prescribe Sustanon, then I don't think it would make sense that she wouldn't prescribe Nebido, especially since you're allergic to the peanut oil. 

I've heard that Nebido is actually better for keeping levels balanced, since it's a slow release, and also helps with the mood swings that can be associated with the weekly/biweekly injections. Personally, I haven't experienced out of the ordinary mood swings, and my levels are fine. 

With Nebido they sometimes do a loading phase, where it's every 6 weeks to start with and then onto every 3 months. But it's not really necessary if you don't want to do it.

*""If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums""*

The basic meaning is that the only hope to get out of poverty for lots of African Americans is either Rap (entertainment), wicked jump shot (basketball: sports), or crack rock (selling drugs).
This is because there are a lot of barriers faced by African Americans including over policing of inner cities, systemic racial discrimination, and being trapped in multi-generational cycles of poverty. For example a young black man is more likely to get arrested and convicted for a criminal offense then a young white man who might get caught, and having a criminal record prevents them from applying for most jobs. A history of racial discrimination such as the [Tulsa Anti-Black Riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot) or not being recognized for achievements such as [Elijah McCoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_McCoy), and cycles of long term poverty have all contributed to this.

If it's not too late, I'd suggest you put a spin on your opinions. For example, you're not high-maintenance for doing your own makeup; you want to be less things for the makeup artist to deal with so that he/she can maximize his/her time on the bride. It clearly won't need much to make the bride look perfect, but the makeup artist should be extra-sure, yeah?

Bring up your bad reactions to makeup, and that you know what works for you. Exaggerate it if you have to. They don't want you to have an allergic reaction and have a scene at the wedding, right?

but uh. You should match your makeup to the bridal party. They sound like they do their makeup differently than you do, and that's fine. It's their day.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","In France it's ""[le **beauf**](https://leparadigmedelelegance.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mon-beauf-cabu.jpg)"" (short for beau-frère, brother-in-law). At first it was used in the 60s by Cabu, a Charlie Hebdo cartoonist who got killed in january during the attack. And then it rapidly became used by everyone. 

A ""beauf"" is a vulgar, unintelligent, arrogant, uncaring, misogynist and chauvinistic man, without any taste for etiquette or good manners. He will typically be prompt to jump to conclusions and have strong views on complex social issues, based on an insufficient analysis of the facts, but presented as being plain common sense. Typically it's your dumb brother in law or uncle who says complete bullshit during the family reunion or at his local pub.

 It sums up /u/bravetype  pretty well ;) (he gave another answer on behalf of France in this thread). 

We also have ""**[Jacky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpwcTZkc-s)**"", which is a special kind of beauf: a fan of car tuning. Jacky is generally young, while the beauf tends to refer to middle aged men. (Women can be beaufs or Jackies of course, but generally the terms apply to men more).

""un **kéké**"" and ""un **cassos**"" (cas social) are also used.

""**[Régis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6yume-YiyM)**"" is another name that applies well to beaufs, but it's more general than that: Régis is just someone completely dumb, not so much  in what he says or how he looks, but because he just makes a fool of himself. It was created by a group of comedians in the 80s.","1425168874"

The photographer didn't show up.
The ""small, hand-tied bouquet"" I ordered turned up as a giant Miss-America sized club that looked as if someone had set Barney the Dinosaur on fire (and no, purple was not supposed to be one of my colors). 
One of the bridesmaid's bouquets had no ribbon on it.
The rest of them had the wrong color ribbon. 
One tux came in wrong, causing the largest groomsman to have to switch vest and bow tie with the Best Woman, who was so tiny she had ordered hers in Boys' sizes. 
The ring bearer alternately cried, slurped his empty juice bottle, and sang along with the vows (LALALALALALA) for the whole thing. 
The getaway vehicle broke down before we got away, meaning the groom had to get out and push. 
The groom and I never got to eat at the ceremony, but were given something like three to-go containers as we left. We thought it was food. It was the weird tasting cake.
I had to work that night (I was in a play). 

By contrast, the honeymoon was idyllic. It was calm, it was lovely, I was terrified. The wedding had gone *so* weird that something was *bound* to happen. Finally, I decided to stop being so paranoid, and joined my new husband in the B&amp;B's hot tub. After awhile, I needed a glass of water, and got out to go get it. 

An hour later, the ER discharged me - turns out that I'm not allergic to scorpion stings. Yay! 

EDIT to add: I say ""disaster"" for comedy effect, but frankly, I have heard so many worse stories. And I was exceptionally fortunate in that all involved family and friends were *wonderful* to us, and that the party members went over and above to keep my sorry insane ass happy and headed in the right direction. As we said on the day, ""Nobody dies, and I get to keep the groom."" Nobody died, fifteen years later and we're still married, and I get to use the story to karmawhore.  ","1425168875"

In addition to that the possibility of one hero being super fed and winning the game alone has been neglected which is really nice if you ask me, it really can only be done through big plays, but on the other hand, there's a lot of snowballing here which is a downside imo.

"mindcrack","t5_2to85","The issue with bringing up S19 into this whole thing is that the portal traps used there can be broken out of. There isn't a point in claiming that Vechs' decision not to leave the nether was due to portal traps being unbalanced and unfair.

Furthermore, if you want to bring up ""boring content"" as a result of UHC Portal traps, I would like to bring your attention to Chad escaping a portal trap, Etho escaping a portal trap, and I believe Kurt also escaped a portal trap. The portal traps CREATED entertaining content by throwing these Mindcrackers in a life/death situation and seeing them get out of it.

Banning the traps is 100% because of the 1.8 mechanics. Nebris even brought it up in his perspective when Team Yellow went back to the Nether to potentially chase down Arkas.

I hate to see a legitimate tactic being banned because 1 player was unwilling to try breaking a portal trap and became ""stuck"" in the Nether despite the viewers having 3 different players who produced entertaining content by breaking out of their portal traps in the past.","1425168876"

&gt;The __Freedom of Information Act__ (__FOIA__), [5 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_5_of_the_United_States_Code) [§ 552](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/552.html), is a federal [freedom of information law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_legislation) that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the [United States government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government). The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure procedures and grants nine exemptions to the statute.   It was originally signed into law by President [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson), despite his misgivings,   on July 4, 1966, and went into effect the following year.

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","I can agree that the website may come off not as intended, but I don't think that is the point they are trying to make. In theory eating less is the simple solution, but in reality the obesity rates in America attest that it isn't. Advancements in food availability have effectively eliminated the evolutionary process that have shaped our metabolism. Foods and nutrients that were once rare are now overwhelmingly available, putting many people's bodies in disarray. Even foods that pass themselves off as healthy, like juice or yogurt, is packed with as much sugar as some sodas. Any person has the potential to live a heathy lifestyle, but due to different economic factors, mentalities, this may not be probable for a good percentage of the population, as reflected by the obesity rate. One way we can combat this is to eliminate true fat logic (being fat isn't unhealthy, I don't have the ability to lose weight, etc), BUT ALSO to learn about how we get fat and evolutionary purpose that serves.

If we understand why those evolutionary beneficial adaptations worked in the first place, we can better tailor or diet, exercise, and pharmaceuticals to foster an environment where 55% of the country isn't overweight and 1/3 isn't obese.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt; I don't care what Kobe was like as a person I look at what he achieved in his career like I do with any player. 

I don't care what Kobe was like as a person, as I mentioned when I pointed out that I'm not penalizing Jordan for what he did in practice and Magic for what he did in the clubs. That I keep railing on how Kobe threw Shaq and Phil out of the Lakers has nothing to do with Kobe as a person and everything to do with ""You just told a MVP-caliber player (which Shaq was, as he promptly demonstrated next year) and Phil Jackson to get out and this is going to make the Lakers a lot worse."" Which it did. No one else ever did anything like this, and so I think Kobe should essentially lose points for this. The fact that he realized ""Oh shit, I screwed up"" with Phil helps alleviate things, but it's still a big mistake.

Intangibles matter when they help a team overachieve/perform greater than the sum of their expectation or when they do the opposite. What Kobe did with Shaq and Phil is a clear example of the latter.

And don't get me wrong. This is not the only reason I rate Kobe a lot lower than most people. But it's not a small factor.

&gt;Shit he didn't get along with his coach and STILL won 5 rings with the guy and you call that the worst thing a great player has ever done?

Rings mean very little to me in my player evaluations, as they are a team product. This is especially so in Kobe's case, given the high quality of teammates he played with. The three players I have above of Kobe? Combined, they won a grand total of 2 rings. ( Oscar, Karl, Garnett). I still think all three were better for various reasons.","1425168887"

&gt; lower mouse DPI means that your mouse doesn't track as accurately

No, it doesn't. DPI is literally just a measure of how far your cursor moves compared to how far you moved your mouse. It has nothing to do with accuracy. 

If you want to learn more on the topic you can watch [this talk with the Senior Engineer at Logitech.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7JVjcPzL0)

&gt;Things like lower display resolution, lower field of view

If you look at it that way it seems objectively worse, but you have to look at what you gain. By playing on stretched 4:3 the models will appear wider and aiming can feel easier. The poorer picture quality you get from the lower resolution has no real impact on your gameplay, and the lower FOV is negligible in most situations with proper positioning and game sense.

"MLPLounge","t5_2t403","&gt;Should prostitution be legal

If regulated, yes.

&gt;Do more attractive people get more brakes

Depends. But overall, not as much as people make it out to be.

&gt;Should we legalize assisted suicide

Within limit of reason, yes.

&gt;Should we really be compared to others

Yes and no. We should compare ourselves to others as it allows us to improve our own selves, whilst we should not compare ourselves to the degree where we see ourselves as inherently worse.

&gt;Why do people always feel the need to be right

Because being wrong is wrong and nobody likes being wrong.

&gt;should marijuana be legalized 

Yes (although personally I care more about the industrial uses of it, not the recreational ones)

&gt;is it wrong when a younger and older person are in a relationship

Contextually dependent.

&gt;was Hitler as bad as everyone thinks he is?

To be fair, Hitler did a shitload of good stuff. Such as banning vivisections on animals, animal conservation laws, extensive wellfare for citizens, the arts of Germany were supported, and their technology was astoundingly advanced, most citizens could afford wonderful cars (Volkswagen eh?), created what is now the IHS, and he led one of the best anti-tobacco campaigns out of any nation.

But his actions both in and leading up to World War 2 overshadow them. Although many historians aren't quite sure whether or not he was actually the one in charge, since he committed suicide before being captured, which is rather odd in history for figures such as Hitler.

He was a shitty war strategist.

"fatpeoplehate","t5_2x9xz","Its similar to that yeah, although theyve been together before i was actually born. He was fine with me until they had their first child together. Hes been a complete shithead ever since, but my mother chose him over me years ago already, so ive been actually living alone since i was like 15. I arrived back to this country about a month ago and i will only be staying here for a few more months and then returning to be with my boyfriend. I decided that while im here i might aswell try to help her life out as well as im already working on mine anyway already. 

Not going well at all. I approached my mother(we have never really had any mother-daughter relationship. More like person living in house somewhat getting along.) with the issue of my sisters weight again, showing concers. She decided to yell at me that SHE IS A CHILD. SHE CAN BE FAT IF SHE WANTS. I'm sorry but for me it is not right... Its a child. Its the mothers responsibility to keep it healthy if it is up to her. The child already gets all she wants, But i doubt beetus is something on her list. But if this goes on then she will have that. We have it running in our family, and her being the first fat child is increasing her chances of getting it earlier than it could already happen. 
I mean the whole stepdad issue is fine with me because i am used to it and i wont be in this country again after the summer. But he should really start showing her that life is not just being able to get whatever, whenever. 

Back when i still lived in this house, Even when i didnt anymore and had to come over often, I kinda had to raise the kids. Mother was too busy getting drunk at clubs and cheating on with random men she found. She literally does not give a fuck. She just wants them to shut up. She has honestly never been even a decent mother so i guess her and stepdad are a good pair. She hasnt worked in maybe 12 years because shes busy ""raising the children"" and ""taking care of the house"" while i was actually and still am the person to clean, to cook, to garden, to anything while she is getting her manicures and pedicures etc. The year that i did not even visit here once and now came back in beginning of february... the house was in a terrible condition. Some parts of it are getting moldy because 1) She does not know how to clean. 2) She does not want to clean. It kind of has been my job to raise them, to always watch them, to read to them, but my stepfather always taught them that i am more like a live in maid, than a sibling. If only i had gotten any money for it.  So i pretty much already did just pack up my stuff and leave lol.

I really am trying to just do some good and actually raise her. The smaller one turned out quite a tiny shitlord. The otherone is a fatty.. gah it bothers me quite a bit how parents let their children go.

Thank you so much for taking your time to give me advice! I really apprechiate it! I will definitely try to things to use!
And i am really sorry to hear you had multiple step parents. Must've been tough. Atleast i hope its all better now!","1425168891"

They have pretty frequently fleets so content isn't a huge issue.  BRAVE has some nice fights but I also disagree with a lot of their policies.  TEST is really cool and I'm with them now, and they have similar newbie programs to BRAVE; however BRAVE and TEST are both in Nullsec and if you don't want that, Eve Uni may be a better fit; or if you want to immediately jump in to fleet fights but not go to Nullsec or join Eve Uni, I hear RvB is great for that - though I've never been in their organization so I have no idea what the culture is like.

9.2.1 Any attack or ability is landed on minions, jungle creeps, structures, or
enemy Champions.

9.2.2 Line-of-sight is established between players on opposing teams.


9.2.3 Setting foot, establishing vision or targeting skillshot ability in
opponent’s jungle by either team, which includes either leaving the
river or entering brush connected to enemy jungle.

* Underestimating a pot cookie before an important college trip

* Crapping my pants (it happens to the best of us)

* Wrecking on my long board after underestimating a steep hill

* Most recently, [I did a stage dive at a Napalm Death show and nobody caught me]  (http://youtu.be/4Mso83d8sBg?t=2m)(I'm at 2:04 in the denim vest).


2. The coolest thing on my list is probably Monsturd. It's a movie about some monolithic crap monster going on a murderous rampage. I haven't watched it yet but the reviews are good and it looks fucking amazing.

9:00 - wake up, breakfast, **stretch**, pack my gym stuff

9:45 - **gym**

12:30 - **study(java)** 6 pomodoros + lunch

15:00 - **piano** 2h

17:30 - **study(physics)** 6 pomodoros + dinner

21:00 - **learn music production** 6 pomodoros

Music Prod: 2/6p

Piano: 1/2h

Study: 12/12p

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I kid you not, several years ago when Detroit was still towards the beginning stages of decline, I worked for a real estate firm bidding on houses.  I went to an auction up in Detroit where they were selling four houses.  Of the four, I was only really interested in one because it was in a neighborhood that was still pretty good and we could easily flip it to one of the locals.  The other three we would also sell to a local looking to buy a cheap house, but could care less if they made us profit or not.

I stood there as the auctioneer told everyone that the bank decided to sell all the houses together (because they knew that only the one would sell and they wanted to offload them all).  No one bid except for me.  I raised my hand and said ""$1,000"".  The guy said, ""Sold!"".

But then the bank called me the next day and told me that they wanted to negotiate with me on the buying price.  The lady said the houses were worth more than a grand.  I said, ""Look, lady, if the houses were worth more than a grand someone else would have bid on them.""  I told them to keep them and we terminated the agreement to purchase the houses.  I don't know if they ever sold any of them.  Probably not.

We'd try to buy houses dirt cheap and sell them to people at a very low price to make a quick profit, but it also helped people out that couldn't afford a house.  Sometimes we'd even go several states away just to bid on them.  There were several other firms doing this too, so there was plenty of competition, and you couldn't always get a great deal.  Unfortunately, the federal government stepped in and we weren't able to do this much anymore, because of bailouts keeping the housing market artificially inflated.  It made the banks less desperate to offload their houses, so they changed the rules to where all sales weren't final anymore.  Before that we made quite a few people happy owners of an affordable house.

 Hay que hacer el esfuerzo de componer discursos más frescos, derivados de las inquietudes que compartimos quienes trabajamos en una pescadería, quienes tenemos un negocio de prendas de moda, quienes tenemos que salir adelante con dos hijos adolescentes y los ingresos de una empleada de hogar...

Y hacer algo que nunca se hace en una campaña electoral, hay que valorar las cosas que funcionan, reconocer lo que se ha conseguido e ir a lo que se va a mejorar, combatir lo que mantiene a Andalucía en una economía del sector primario y de servicios.","1425168901"

The repo guy didn't lift the car from my house in the middle of the night. He straight up showed up at my work, and in front of all my coworkers, flat out stole my car. 

The truck was unlabeled, he wasn't in anything resembling a uniform, and according to those who witnessed it, he clearly knew what he was doing, because between the time someone said ""Hey, BendoverOR, they're towing your car,"" and the time I got outside, it was gone.

Okay, fine, call the finance company, they say its gonna be $1100 to get it out. Fine, I'll borrow a car for a couple of days until I can get that kind of money together. They provide me with an address that sends me to an un-named gravel lot behind a chain link fence in a warehouse district. Show up, I've got the money, and then they have the adacity to tell me that I also need $35 cash in order for them to return my own property to me, and they called it an ""inventory charge.""

Now, I'm sorry, but you've got to be clinically-speaking mentality challenged, Tuesdays Are Applesauce-And-Basic-Human-Dignity Day, definition of the word *retarded* for the process of inventorying the belongings of that car to cost $35. All that was in the car was a water bottle and our roadside emergency kit, which is already inventoried *with a checklist on the lid*.

As soon as I objected to such a ridiculous fee, from the back end of the 5th wheel trailer they called an office comes some big Hells Angel looking motherfucker with a throat tat that said ""DOG EAT DOG,"" who asked if everything was okay.

Yeah, ya know what, fine, I don't mind paying cash to get my own property back from someone who stole a car in broad daylight from my work when it would be the most embarrassing and inconvenient.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","I can't begin to speak about the rare air of $15k hats but the TF2 market for trades in general is illiquid as hell anymore. Nobody wants to trade because everyone's afraid the stuff they'll get is even harder to move so everyone demands a profit (e.g. ""pay in cash or overpay in first-gen unusuals only""). When both ends demand a profit, good luck making a trade.

Add to it that unusuals are more common now so Joe Average TF2 player has to jump through fewer hoops to get a cool looking low tier hat. And since he'll *never* have the opportunity to have high value items (old first-series effects, earbuds, Max heads, first round strange festives etc) he'll never crack the upper tier of trading without a significant amount of straight cash. But Joe Average doesn't want to do that. He's happy with his Kill-a-Watt hat and regular strange, or collector's item or killstreak or whatever.

The only people that are left with the resources and wherewithal to trade for high-end TF2 gear are the hat barons who just circulate this hypothetical wealth amongst each other, each of them trying to ride the inflation of arbitrarily priced aesthetic items and hoping they can cash out before it starts falling. It's anybody's guess when that'll actually happen but when the bottom falls out some people are gonna be left holding tons of digital items formerly worth tens of thousands.

I've sold all my high-dollar shit except for Scout because I still play that a lot and I feel a lot better. Good luck to whatever crazy-ass moneybags want to try to move that shit.

Source: Not a baron or professional trader. I've had like 9 or 10 unusuals over time and plenty of the high tier strange festives. I'm sure overall that puts me in the 1% of TF2 players but it's also miles apart from the pro traders and brokers you can find on outpost, sourceop, old Unusual Hat Club, etc. I've done enough trades and infinitely more attempted trades that I have a pretty good feel for what the market is like.","1425168904"

Take for example an interesting happening from the Ukraine war. The Kiev side sent pictures to the US senate of Russian soldiers as proof of Russian invasion to help the eastern Ukrainians and demanded US intervention. A simple google reverse image search showed these pictures of Russian soldiers were from 2008 and had nothing to do with the current conflict.


This makes me wonder, if Russians are so obviously all over eastern Ukraine as most of the media I follow eagerly states, then why did Kiev feel the need to send fabricated, poorly I might add, evidence.


My suggestion is simply to remain apolitical, because unless you are there on the ground seeing stuff for yourself, you will probably be fed lies or half-truths from both sides, so it is better to ignore the issue than to ignorantly 'grab the pitchforks' against an entire nation of people you might not know everything about, like Reddit tends to do.

Some parents are responsible enough to take their children to other countries and make that part of their education al experience (shit I'm 30 and parents did this when I was 9).

Please though, tell me how taking a child away from school for a few weeks automatically makes them irresponsible?

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;could you demonstrate that there is any benefit to knowing your philosophy of science?

I enjoy having an expanded framework to make sense of and connect all other frameworks I may use and integrate.

In understanding philosophy of science all the way up to Kuhn (science as consensus, not proof or falsification) and Nietzsche (phenomenology, importance of the ordering subconscious and conscious mind of the observer), I feel much more in touch with the process of science itself.  My mind feels expanded and unified, with fewer untied ends.

&gt;if we agree that physical theories are tools I don't see how you can maintain that they are merely descriptive

Because description is an important aspect of living.  It's actually essential—vital—in the most literal of senses.  So important to us and so much a part of us that it happens at the subconscious level, through direct processing of sensory phenomena and the construction of it into a stationary world we may act in.

Don't take my position here to be the diminution of science.  Science is one of the most important things conscious man does.  It is his most cerebral will to power.

But, it's important to understand that it *is* a will to power, not a will to 'Truth'.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Here's the definition of riot on google;

&gt; a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd.

It is in no way necessarily connected to anything political.  

What I objected to is your continual failure to differentiate between the handful of violent actions with the majority who were nonviolent.  The peaceful protesters had no connection to the people destroying property.

You said they were irresponsible.  According to what standard?  The one that says they are required to live under a racist regime of police violence as long as some white person's mom and pop shop isn't harmed in the process?

Yes.  It is racist to make reductive comments about the actions of desperate people in desperate situations while doing lip service to the root causes of why they're rioting.  And yes it is indicative of privilege to tell disenfranchised people that they are not reacting to their disenfranchisement properly.  It's easy to tell people to act differently about the right to move about their communities unmolested by police harassment when you don't have to fight for it.  

And yes, you can disagree with the actions of rioters, looters, etc. and not be racist when you do not simultaneously engage in low-brow, sanctimonious condemnations of the poor innocents who suffered while remaining completely oblivious to the suffering (which is far greater) that is wrought upon those who are rioting.

Do timeturner's not count certain information as breaking the 6 hr limit (eg Amelia telling Dumbledore that she had information)

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Why don't they say the same about Israeli military action?


&gt;Why is there sympathy towards Hamas for violently reacting against IDF actions


There isn't. There exists sympathy for the *people* of Gaza, because the *people* of Gaza aren't allowed to *leave* Gaza.  
They are, for all intents and purposes, trapped inside with Hamas, who are essentially an ever-present street gang who control the overwhelmingly vast majority of the guns, and are the only large scale (relatively speaking, anyway) source of smuggled ammunition and building materials, and self appointed distributor of the Israeli food, water, and medicine which is provided in accordance with the fourth Geneva Convention.

In short, if you want even the *slightest* chance of surviving in Gaza, you *will* play ball with Gaza. There is quite literally no alternative whatsoever, which is exactly the way Hamas leadership in the region like it, because they would personally lose virtually all power the moment people or goods are permitted to come and go as they please.

The men in charge want Israel to be threatened enough to keep the blockade surrounding Gaza in tact, but *not* so much that Israel resumes exchanging mortar and rocket fire, because then they're going to be personally targeted the moment it's possible. 

&gt;but no sympathy towards Israel for reacting against Palestinian terror attacks?

Because Israeli suffers so little casualties, civilian and military alike, in comparison to Gaza that to even call it a comparison is *almost* kind of like a distasteful joke that isn't a joke.

Hrmm, how do I put this into words... I guess it's *kind of* like bringing up the death tolls of German soldiers during the second World War in a discussion about Holocaust figures. It's not *technically incorrect*, but it's still, you know, just wrong.  
For clarity, no comparison between the Holocaust and this situation is intended or implied.  
They're both wholly separate things, the former is simply being brought up in an attempt to illustrate that there is still a difference between a solider and a civilian who has no choice other than to fight or die.


These guys here have pretty good sourcing in their statistics (which I've included all of purely for the sake of context, it's really only the latter data that is relevant to recent events), simply click on a number and you'll be taken to a page with outlines each event they include in their numbers. 

[29 September 2000 - 26 December 2008](http://www.btselem.org/statistics/fatalities/before-cast-lead/by-date-of-event)

[27 December 2008 - 18 January 2009](http://www.btselem.org/statistics/fatalities/during-cast-lead/by-date-of-event)

[19 January 2009 - 31 January 2015](http://www.btselem.org/statistics/fatalities/after-cast-lead/by-date-of-event)

So yeah, it's the 25 combined Israeli military and civilian deaths which occurred in Gaza and Israel, held in contrast to the 496 Gazan deaths which occurred in Gaza and Israel, that's responsible for the greater news coverage of the latter.

Granted, these statistics do *not* include figures from 8 July 2014 through to 26 August 2014, which are still in their initial stages and therefore cannot be reliably sourced.  
Their current estimate is 1,767 Gazans to 64 IDF members and 2 Israeli civilians, but I personally refuse to put any stock in these kinds of things until they're entirely sourced.

What if they had convinced themselves that they were taking out their bullies? Seeing how psychos have pretty warped perspectives of authorities.

That quote is horrible. But the others were not sexist, they were saying that gender shouldn't matter, and to focus on the quality of the candidates, regardless of gender. Which seems a very egalitarian approach. For example,

&gt; Marlena [..] said she wants the ""best candidate -- male or female.""

The CNN headline also seems disingenuous. Aside from that one sexist jerk Barbara, none of the others are ""worried about a woman in the white house.""

When I was pregnant we talked about the baby - I had a book with amazing pictures of babies in utero that they liked looking through, etc - and we incorporated discussion of the family dynamics into that general, as-it-comes-up type of discussion. Not one big talk but just a general running commentary as we chatted and any possible questions came up. We talked about how their new brother would have the same daddy, but a different mommy, and how while they have two homes, the new baby would only have one (ours) and wouldn't get to go to their mom's house with them. They seemed to grasp it pretty intuitively. I think that kids, for better or worse, accept their surroundings and find ways to understand them - so if you are just open and not shy about talking to your step-kids, and act like there is nothing ""hard"" or ""weird"" or uncomfortable or anything, they will take you at your word and accept that the new baby has different relationships to people than they do and that that's okay.","1425168921"

I got this on the 3DS virtual console. I'm really surprised at the amount of content in this Game Boy Color game. It's a puzzle platformer that has 100 treasure to find. However, you only need 50 to fight the final boss. Each one takes about 5 to 10 minutes unless you get stumped, and almost all of them are pretty clever and really fun. Some involve mechanics you may have thought would never matter, like being able to kite enemies to a new location where they are useful. I've yet to unlock the time trial mode you get when you collect all of the treasures. Plus, I need to collect the 8 hidden music coins in each of the 25 levels in order to unlock unlimited access to the golf mini-game. I'm at almost 19 hours of play time with only 65/100 treasures. Like I said, 99% of the puzzles are pretty clever and I haven't really run into anything resembling padding. My only complaint is that since they removed death, they added in mechanics that replace it with back tracking. If you fall down a pit, you may have to climb back up a few levels. If you get hit by a boss, it might knock you out of the arena so you have to do a bit of platforming to get back and the fight is restarted. However, this complaint can pretty much be eliminated by using the restore point (save states) functionality that's built into the emulator. Right before doing a boss fight or some other hard point, you just make a restore point. None of the backtracking that you're skipping is difficult (it's more just an alternative to a death), so really you're just saving time and annoyance.

Overall, I'd highly recommend the game, especially since it's only about $5 USD.","1425168923"

&gt;You've been faced with my argument that what matters legally is not consent as verbalized but the actual mental state or consent

Yes, you did argue this.

&gt;Surely there has been enough to change your view, showing that legally and ethically charges can only be brought where there was not an actual state of consent...

Well, no. There isn't enought o change my view. You are right: charges can be brought when there was no consent. I never doubted that. I always knew and still believe that. 

I also think that when there was consent charges can be brought. Re-read my title. That view wasn't challenged beyond the safeword argument, which isn't that strong. I honestly do believe that the safeword argument is a tenuous defense, and the jury will prosecute the man.","1425168925"

"books","t5_2qh4i","I will admit that Zen an arduous read. However, I do think there is something to be said about the microscopic intricacy that he adopts in his analysis of the concept of quality. Whereas Coelho makes big sweeping statements about following paths in life and destinations, with very little substance to them, Pirsig does the opposite. He takes a relatively unquestioned concept (quality) and goes over it with a fine toothcomb.

Philosophy does't have to be about discovering something profound, sometimes it can be merely the exploration of something that we encounter everyday, but don't think to contemplate properly. It taught me a fair bit; namely, how to approach learning, and how to achieve quality in the tasks that I undertake. And that is through focusing on the details and putting care into the minutiae, which is paralleled in his compulsive care of his motorbike. 

And yes, it is a point that is laboured over many, many pages. But there is something to be said about reinforcing a point; a buddhist monk doesn't sit and meditate for one minute before getting up and being done with it - it's a process, and a long one that.

Just my two cents!","1425168927"

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","Hi there! Welcome to Monster Hunter, and glad to have you on board. You picked an amazing, but difficult to upgrade weapon. I'll do my best to answer your questions though. 

For your armor set I highly recommend Velociprey. You can craft it fairly easily once you do the expedition quest for the Velocidrome. Just press start, go to Guild Quests, and register the Velocidrome quest. Farm it until you can craft the set. This is an all around starter set for just about any blademaster weapon type.

On your insect glaive, do what you can to get by for now, and then farm Nerscylla when you get to her. The poison IG you can make off her will carry you through most of low-high rank. Focus on feeding your kinsect speed nectars for upgrades. When you reach Gore Magala I would suggest looking into his weapon. Lots of big monsters are weak to dragon and his IG looks really cool and gives you some serious bang for your buck.

On your last point, unfortunately wasting your materials on IG is kind of inevitable. You can't make a truly perfect IG until G-Rank and trying to hold to the progression path this early in the game is frustrating at the best of times. On the bright side, wasting mats in Monster Hunter isn't as big a deal as it is in other games. Most resources can be easily farmed later in the game and the demand for early game resources will mostly disappear as you continue to move up to high rank and beyond.

If you have any more questions or need clarification feel free to ask!","1425168928"

"math","t5_2qh0n","""Computational"" is overstated, I really just mean formulae. For example, the co-area formula lets you turn an integral over R^n into an integral over one variable and the (n-1)-dimensional level sets of a function. Specifically, you wind up with

`[; \int_{R^n} f(x,y) dy dx = \int_{R} \int_{g^{-1}(x)} \frac{f(x,y)}{|\nabla g(x,y)|} dS(y) dx ;]`

where dS is the surface measure on the level set of g. 

This can be used to, for example, write down a nice formula for the conditional expectation of a random variable X with respect to a random variable Y, by integrating only over the surface where Y is equal to some specified number z. This ""restriction"", when written as an integral over the whole space, involves a Dirac delta. The co-area formula lets you turn this into an integral which includes a surface integral on the surface where Y=z.","1425168929"

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","Carbs man. Carbs are the enemy. You have a disease that makes you allergic to carbs. I was in your same place 6 months ago. Only I knew about my diabetes much longer, just thought I was invincible. But my feet were on fire all the time, and to be perfectly frank, I couldn't get it up. People talk about losing feet, but losing the ability to get hard is what finally convinced me.

I took what could be considered drastic measures. I went on a full ketogenic diet thanks to /r/keto. I consumed less than 20 carbs a day. I went from a BG of 299 to 90 in the first week. I experimented and after a month had a large French fries from McDonald's and was at 210 an hour later. That proved to me it was carbs. 

I haven't been over 130 in 30 days. And am regularly in the 95-105 range. I have also dropped 45 lbs. I am now in the 20-30 Carbs a day range. I eat tacos with their shells when out with friends. I have a couple of beers, but switch to jack and diet coke if planning to get drunk. My feet still burn at night, but less and usually not during the day anymore. But best of all, I was hard enough to have actual sex with my wife.

I know its hard to admit there is a problem. It took me 12 years to admit it, but it is actually quite a simple solution. Not necessarily easy, but simple. Carbs cause the BG spikes. Cut the carbs, cut the spikes.","1425168938"

"CrazyHand","t5_33vle","As a falcon main, recognise his pattern. Its a frustrating match up but usually they'll just do that ball roll thing, hit you and then fiar/up air. 

Bait that, sheild and punish. Try and keep him in the air but close by for up airs and nairs. Once he's off the stage, remember his UP B is pretty readable. 

Don't bother trying to time a smash attack against his roll thing, they usually just cancel eachother out, and he has faster tilts. 

Try and bait his down air as well. down smash is pretty good against sonic.

if you're playing fox try and laser shoot him whenever you can.","1425168938"
