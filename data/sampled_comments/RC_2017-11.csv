"space","t5_2qh87","Keep in mind that there's a very non-linear relationship between radius and mass in the Saturn to red dwarf range of objects. This is because at those mass ranges the compressibility of gas is a big factor. More massive objects tend to just get denser and only a little larger. You can see this with our own gas giants. Saturn is about 60 megameters in radius, Jupiter is about 70 Mm, Jupiter has 73% more volume than Saturn but well over 3x the mass, resulting in Jupiter being about twice as dense. That same pattern continues through brown dwarfs up through red dwarf stars. The TRAPPIST-1 red dwarf star, for example, weighs in at 0.08 solar masses and a radius of 79 Mm, making it 84x the mass of Jupiter but only 46% larger in volume.

For reference, Jupiter is roughly a thousandth the mass of our Sun, while this planet is about 80% of Jupiter's mass, and the star is about 62% of our Sun's mass, so there is still a factor of *hundreds* in between the two.",1509494401

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

This is a naval tinker taylor story.

Emma, being the good friend that she is, decides to go wiyh taylor to summer camp after her mother died, and so misses her incident with the ABB and SS. Events progress pretty normally with taylor gradually rebuilding her relationship with her father (possibly due to some Barnes intervention ). 

But then everything changed when the Laviathan attacked . Taylor and Emma are in the end bringer shelter that Laviathan peeks his head into. The two of them are swept out to sea by the next tidal wave where Taylor triggers with the ability to craft naval machines (think anything from a sail boat to a submarine or a battleship, as long as it goes in the water) Emma could probably trigger too if you wanted with some kind of suplementary power. 

At this point I think it would be best if the girls parents died in the attack.
So now ""the Admiral "" vows revenge against the seamonster that destroyed her home .

Lucky for taylor there is an entire boat grave yard for her to make use of , constructing a fleet of tinker ships, maybe taking over the city ( let's be honest that map of brokton bay is like 60% water plus most of the city is underwater after laviathan so boats and ships would have an easy time of it. ) 

You could give taylor a cool laser cutlass and a cybernetic eyepatch  :)

Any way being the literature fiend that she is she could start giving Laviathan  the nickname ""the white whale"" or her ""white whale"" (also a great fic name) thus begins a Moby dick esq adventure sailing and trying  (maybe sometimes failing) to hunt him down and avenger her father and her city.",1509494402

If the area sees an increase in rain, enough of an increase that it will in a decade basically replenish itself, meaning you can no longer use it for hydroelectric power generation. And it would be a shame, as you'd be left with a large toxic lake. 

If you'd replenish all these lakes, then you don't want to water from either the Atlantic or Mediterranean, as these lakes won't really evaporate due to their massive size. Do take in mind that Lake Chad was about 1,000,000 km² in surface 7000 years ago. The Great Lakes only make up a 4th of that in size (244,106 km²)

Now do that for all the lakes, what you will create is toxic lakes that are just too salty for most fish to survive, covering an area 16 times the size of the Great Lakes.",1509494402

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

He has looked to be improving over time, is the same age now as Benjamin was when we drafted him, and is the same size as Benjamin, he will likely be the Panthers big target for years. 




The negative is if Samuel steps up as the deep threat and gets way more looks or if the Panthers draft someone next year to fill that slot. 




Pretty much Funchess is probably the WR1 on Panthers for ROS and should get solid points this year, but he likely becomes the WR2 eventually (if the Panthers are smart which admittedly they aren't so he may remain WR1 for longer than this year).

Once the port is written and the abstractions are in place, it's really not all that hard to maintain a port.  At least, that's been my own experience so far.  It's true that Linux gaming isn't going to be where huge profits are made, but it seems worthwhile to invest time and effort in your ENGINE, because that allows every game to be ported to Linux with very little effort.  It's a one-time investment which pays off better dividends the earlier you make the effort.

Even if you're moving 400 miles away, you just never really know if clients are going to come back in a few years, and then when they do, they're like ""Hey, where's that clock/picture/trinket/desk toy I gave you? Did you ever use it? Why isn't it on display?"" And as a therapist you had better remember what that client gave you and know where it is and ideally have it on display, or else they might think you didn't care about them, like them etc. So sometimes getting gifts is stressful! This is especially hard if you're working with kids, because they'll paint rocks or make something for you and then come back like 2 years later asking if you still have their rock.

The premise is wierd.

What on earth makes you think that won't continue? Do all elderly have the best availiable care? Is our environment pristine? Couldn't many of our basic services be even better with more hands on deck? Etc. Etc.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","There is quite a bit inherently wrong with this. I know I'm just joining the already-in-full-swing party here, but I'll add my voice anyway.
 
1. You are very young. 18 feels adult, but it's not. Your brain, particularly the part dealing with consequences, has not fully formed, and won't for another 6 or 7 years. You also lack experience, and therefore a firm footing in what is right, and appropriate, and how things should work. There just hasn't been enough time for you to learn those things. (which have nothing to do with intelligence, poise, social skills, perceptiveness, etc.) This leads to:

2. As someone who is 40, and has lived for 22 years longer than you, I can assure you that you and I could never have an equal relationship. This is because I have 22 years more experience than you. I have seen more, made more good and bad choices, and just been through so much more than you that I will think that, with few exceptions, I just know more than you. Even if I were a fool and you were brilliant, in almost every area of our lives, I would just have more experience.

3 So let's look at a person who is 29 years older than you, willing to date you. Let's only look at point 2 first. Why would he be okay with such an unequal power dynamic? Would he say that he does not value his opinion more than yours? If so, why? Did he waste the last 29 years? Did he experience and learn nothing? Then you could be equals...but then why would YOU want to be with someone who wasted 29 years? Or someone who devalues 29 years of his own experiences?

4. Let's say he knows perfectly well you two will have an unequal power dynamic (he does). And let's also acknowledge that he regularly chooses younger partners...And that he knows point 1 is also true, and you are too young to know better, or what is fair, and healthy (which he does)... 

It all adds up to something that just isn't good. There is NO WAY it can be good. Either he is taking advantage...or else he is someone who has wasted his life and hasn't grown up enough so that he's perfectly fine dating someone so young. And that's also not someone good enough for you. ",1509494408

"soloboardgaming","t5_31pu4","It's okay not to like **Friday**. Everyone likes different things. **Friday** didn't work for you or me, but maybe Sally and John loved it. That's fine. But whether you like or dislike a game, it is very helpful to consider *why* you do or don't like it (see below).

Yes, **Gloomhaven** MSRP is ~$100. The reprint should be hitting retail the end of this year/start of next year, so at the very least don't pay a gouger price right now.

But more importantly, I strongly recommend watching playthrough videos (rather than reviews) of **Gloomhaven** and all games you are interested in. These will give you a more clear sense of what the game is actually about, how the turns happen, what the actions are, and how the game play flows. Looking at these you can more easily judge, 'Yes, those game things look like something I would enjoy doing over and over for 2 hours' or 'No, that's not as interesting as I thought'. Reviews are not nearly as useful for this.


Of course, this is where having a sense of the the games you like/disklike and the reasons for that is what you are comparing the playthrough videos to; For example, **GH** is an RPG, but the video shows a lot of card choosing/hand management and maybe you know that you don't like that as much because of game XYZ that you played. Or it shows you the tactical combat play is the main focus which you love because it's like that other game UVW that you enjoyed. And so on.

You were asking for Christmas list ideas, but long term you may want to acquire your own games as well. Math Trades can be a pretty decent way to build a collection; even if you don't have a ton of great games to offer up, you're allowed to offer gift cards. There are also BGG and reddit exchanges and auctions, the GeekMarket on BGG etc. [boardgameprices.com](https://boardgameprices.com) and [spielboy.com](http://spielboy.com) are great tools to check the prices for games your interested in periodically to get a sense of the average price. That way you'll know if the supposed ''sale'' is really a good deal or not etc.  

Edit: Also, as a kindness to those who may view my Christmas list, I typically note a ''good'' price for a game just in case they go to Amazon at a bad time (stock is low) and see it listed for 3 x the normal price or something, they'll know to stay away.",1509494410

I can understand reserving judgement, I've been following this game like a hawk since its announcement to ensure that I never get burned on a Xeno purchase like that ever again. So far though, as I said, I'm extremely happy with what I see. Hopefully it continues down this path. ",1509494414

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","I think we're misunderstanding each other. I'm not treating it that way at all; I'm explaining that to her it *feels* inseparable. Even rationally knowing other people don't feel the same way and that's cool, even rationally knowing that he may value sex with intimacy with her while also wanting others. 

And while you may rationally understand that your partner feels differently — not better, not worse — love and feeling loved isn't based on rationalizing. If this were a fleeting mood or shallow discomfort, sure, but this isn't an incidental part of how some people experience intimacy. It's the core.

&gt; The part that is special and intimate may just not be the ""our genitals are touching"" part [...] It's the emotion and intimacy that goes with it.

Exactly. But we're talking about OP, not her bf. If you're someone who does experience sex and intimacy as inseparable, then the ""genitals touching"" *becomes* a deeply meaningful thing, and that feeling can't be willfully suspended or reversed. Not even when trying to truly understand a partner beyond rational acceptance.

&gt; I agree, but I also think we are capable of understanding and empathy without being identical beings.

That's a jump up to hyperbole from what I'm saying, though. You don't have to be identical. But you do need enough to communicate the *feeling* of love and being loved to each other in a romantic relationship, not just the knowledge of it. All of oneself doesn't have to be mirrored; just enough, and in the core places. Where it really counts. And that means different things for everyone.

&gt; That's why I suggested she ask him why he wants the things he does, and what value he attaches to different types of sex, as well as explain her feelings.

I do agree with this completely. Many couples are okay with the difference and are still capable of feeling loved and safe with each other. But not all, and it's worth trying to get to the bottom of their differences.",1509494415

Nephthys isn't really a highrolly deck unless you include Attendant of Night, Hell's Unleasher, or Twilight Queen. If you include those cards, then you can get some Liches or a double Mordecai off of playing Nephthys depending on your pulls and pull order.

You don't graduate in the original term you applied for, so you'd have to petition to graduate again and get out in the spring, and the F still stands, with an asterisk.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I'll stop short of absolute horror/NSFL (but still pretty gross) so as not to be a downer.

Important background information, when I was young I lived on a fairly straight, but steep hill. I'd say around a 20-30 degree incline, and maybe 200 yards long. I also lived near a man-made neighborhood lake, which had a 5 or 6' drainage pipe at one end to handle overflow.

One year, they did a replacement on the top 3 or 4' length of said pipe and just sort of tossed the original aside near the lake. I'm guesstimating on size since I was a kid, it was just about right for my 10-year-old self to climb inside comfortably though. So my buddy and I looked at the hill, looked at the pipe, and came up with the brilliantly fun plan to take the pipe up the hill and take turns riding down in it. I was chosen to go first because my friend ~~was an asshole and wanted to see if I'd die~~ thought it was a good idea and I was a passive sort.

So we roll the pipe up to the top of the hill, I get in and start my roll down. It was horrifying, frankly, and I was shocked I didn't break any bones being tossed around in there. Here's where it gets fun: the hill ended in a cul-de-sac with a storm drain. We didn't have any real plan for stopping, which only occurred to me as I hit the flatter ground of the cul-de-sac and realized what was about to happen.

So yeah, I hit that storm drain, and due to the momentum the pipe went flying over the drain, tossing me out where I landed in the drainage ditch the drain flowed into, which was full of sticks, leaves, and as I slowly regained coherence from the fall I realized one more thing.

It contained the decaying body of a full-grown Elk, and I was in the middle of it with its half-rotted skull about a foot from my face. The smell I'd originally taken as your normal drainage reek was actually about a thousand pounds of decaying flesh. I was inside the body of a massive, dead animal.

Later inquiries determined that the guy who lived at the foot of the hill had gone hunting a few weeks before, and wanted the skeleton but didn't want to bother with cleaning it. So he just tossed it in that ditch and waited for time and nature to take its course.

"Genealogy","t5_2qmdf","From my experience, once you get back this far, the most trustworthy sources are  wills, legal proceedings, and newspaper clippings. If you are lucky, the family is described in a book of ancestry for a certain last name. These books were commonly made and researched by individuals ~1900, so information should be relevant. Though they can be made at any time obviously. Also, if you find an untrustworthy source, such as someone's ancestry or wikitree page for your family, sometimes they might have listed their sources.  I usually try searching the person's name and birth or death date and see what comes up. If they included a satisfactory source, then I go ahead and browse the source. It's like using wikipedia for a research paper, you get an idea and then verify the actual facts from the direct source.

Since you don't have any paid resources, a good way is definitely to search for the person's wikitree page, and see what sources are listed there. Pretty much all of the old genealogy books for families are available online via a google search. Sometimes they are on archive.com, sometimes other sites. Also your local library might have some, doesn't hurt to check. Also, you can use ancestrylibrary version at the library for free, which might be useful to you. This is also available at most universities. ",1509494423

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","Uh... Probably an animal rights activist? 

Look, I respect vegans, vegetarians, or people who care about animals, I really do, but some of them, perhaps a vocal minority, are just looking to be provocative and in your face. PETA are just like that sometimes.

I'm not gonna justify eating meat or discuss the whole philosophy of the matter, that's not the point. What I do want to talk about is bad PR and dumb logic, here's a quote from a [PCgamer article:](http://www.pcgamer.com/how-peta-invaded-the-games-industry/)

&gt;March 2009 Irked by the killing of attack dogs in Call of Duty: World at War, PETA sends copies of Nintendogs to Activision’s HQ, along with invites to an “empathy for animals seminar”.
November 2011 Battlefield 3 is slammed by PETA’s German wing for letting players stab a rat. Apparently, this could have “a brutalising effect on the young male target audience”.
March 2013 PETA gives out leaflets at the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm event, reminding guests that “Zerglings have feelings, too”. Terran players aren’t amused.
February 2015 Evolve’s cast of carnivorous beasties attracts PETA’s wrath. According to one protester, “Vegan monsters are grossly underrepresented in the gaming industry.”

I get it, PETA, you don't want people becoming desensitized to violence, specifically animal cruelty. Thing is, studies have yet to find a link between violence and video games, and there are a lot of funded contradicting researches that prove nothing. 

So instead, PETA makes absurd claims about animals and straight up fictional creatures without understanding context and tries to vilify video game companies to promote their own agenda.

"bapccanada","t5_32smy","This system is.. I dunno, I wouldn't buy it.  The GTX 1050 is the very entry level for gaming GPUs, it'll be ""adequate"" for 1080p gaming, but that's about it.

You should try to find something with a GTX 1060 GPU, even if it has a lower processor (a Core i3 + GTX 1060 is better than a Core i5 + GTX 1050).  Unfortunately, it's rare for a pre-built brand-name system to be configured that way, because most of their customers are clueless about what is really needed for a gaming system, so they'll always be Core i5/i7-based.

/u/tigojones 's suggestion that you go to an actual computer shop is probably a better plan, as it'll let you get a lower-end CPU and a higher-end GPU, plus they'll be able to put in an SSD (I really recommend one) without blowing up the price too much.  Plus the 12GB of RAM is wonky.. there's almost no benefit to it, since most games won't take advantage of it, and those that do are going to be upset that 4GB of it is single-channel, either go with 8GB or 16GB.

As well, I understand why you might be reluctant to build your own PC, though most people around here will encourage you to in order to get the best pricing.  Building your own system requires knowing what to do, how to do it, time to do it, and then the ability to troubleshoot problems, plus there's the hassle of processing RMAs for individual components if anything goes wrong.",1509494423

Not to mention, with the faster Q (which is amazing by the way), hitting a max range Q isn't enough to get you into range of the E because of the pause before you dash, while still having the enemy be slowed (when you start pausing to dash usually the slow wears off). It's far stronger when you're in mid melee range, which is when you're doing W anyways. Of course when you buy Frozen Mallet this all becomes moot because you can just auto attack into E first, but I find using E during W is much stronger especially when 2~ ticks of W only hit for like one leg proc.",1509494423

"ibs","t5_2s3g1","With all the difficulties you’re describing in logistics, have you asked your doctor about doing both a colonoscopy and endoscopy at the same time? The prep sucks but then it will all be over in one day. Doing both at the same appointment would mean only having to find one ride on one day, and only dealing with one round of IVs/anesthesia.

It my experience it takes a long time to get these things scheduled (like, they book 2-3 months out) but maybe your doctor has better availability. My suggestion would be to, if possible, do it when you can have a friend/loved one be with you because that might reduce your anxiety. Yes, it’s inconvenient for everyone, but it’s a medical procedure to try to figure out ways to help you. There’s only so much GI specialists can identify through blood work and non-invasive testing and there are a lot of things they can only conclusively identify with endoscopes and colonoscopies (like h. Pylori infections and inflammatory bowel disease).

The other option, if you can afford it, is to see if you can get a home health aid who can drive you there and back and make sure you are okay at home afterward. Care.com has people with background checks and might have what you need. I would expect you’d have to shell out a decent amount per hour though, so if money is tight that might not be a good option.

The autopsy said:

&gt; At Bethesda, the autopsy report of the president, Warren Exhibit CE 387 described the back wound as being oval, 6 by 4 millimetres (0.24 in × 0.16 in), and located ""above the upper border of the scapula"" (shoulder blade) at a location 14 centimetres (5.5 in) from the tip of the right acromion process, and 14 centimetres (5.5 in) below the right mastoid process (the bony prominence behind the ear).

&gt; The concluding page of the Bethesda autopsy report states: ""The other missile [the bullet to the back] entered the right superior posterior thorax above the scapula, and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular and the supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck.""

Additionally, a panel of four physicians were asked to review the evidence by the US Attorney General in Feb 1968, and their conclusions were:

&gt; The decedent was wounded by two bullets, both of which entered his body from behind. One bullet struck the back of the decedent's head well above the external occipital protuberance. Based upon the observation that he was leaning forward with his head turned obliquely to the left when this bullet struck, the photographs and X-rays indicate that it came from a site above and slightly to his right.

Edit: What you describe is probably related to this:

&gt; The Sibert/O'Neill FBI autopsy report original made by two FBI agents (Special Agents James W. Sibert and Francis X. O'Neill) present at the autopsy preserves genuine confusion amongst medical doctors present during the autopsy, caused by apparent lack of an exit wound, which was cleared up later in the official report after new and more complete information became available (the exit had been hidden by a tracheotomy incision)",1509494426

Another thing I'd like to do is cache large JSONs I receive from the API so users don't have to wait the long time it takes to receive them.

Essentially, but not always. Many people rely on their family doctor, rather than consulting a specialist like the endocrinologist I work for. Family physicians quite often are in the practice of simply prescribing T4 and blaming the patient if it isn't working (""You must not be taking your medication properly."") There often are other factors and tests (such as the reverse T3) that only a specialist will consider. Granted, these patients are rare but they do exist and are definitely not imaginary.

I wanted to do several separate stories in a connected multiverse and have an awesome finale arc where all the main characters and their worlds merge into one crazy multi-genre epic.

But it was such a monumental task to create entire dimensions each with multiple cultures and dialects, it got stretched too thin.

I loved my characters though so I immortalised them and instead put their epic final arc into fables and history. I killed off one dimension and replaced it with our own reality, where the story takes place (kinda) and we have been secretly observed for 60 years so the other species can reference pop culture and speak modern English. The main characters all interact within the 'inbetween' dimension and therefore I don't need to overwhelm the reader with multi-world exposition.

Its a bit like how ASOIAF is huge, but most of the story is Westeros-centric (and not surprisingly, its original fanbase are western nerds who already get the jist of medieval european politics), while Yi-Ti remains a fun little mystery within the world. That's basically what I did.",1509494427

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Where did I say ""dark"" referred to the skin color?

This ""scarcity of information"" is undoubtedly true, and this is the very problem for the following reasons:

1.  This phrase was used (and helped propagate) the mystery and alleged savagery of, as they would say, ""the Negro race.""

2. The phrase came to be from Enlightenment-era European colonialists literally erasing geographical information about Africa off of popular maps so that Europeans could be credited with ""discoveries,"" despite many parts of the Middle East and Asia having known this information for millennia with it being readily available for Europeans to learn of. 

3. The phrase helped European settlers downplay the assistance of local African villagers, guides, and even slaves, in pursuit of fame back home--further perpetuating white, eurocentric conceptions of discovering the ""rest of the world"".

4. The phrase was popularized by European explorer Henry Morton Stanley, whose exploration and literature inspired other works and another similar popular phrase for the same interior, the ""Heart of Darkness."" A novella of this same name by Joseph Conrad was used to explain and justify the atrocious violence committed by Europeans, arguing that the cruel savagery of the native Africans brought out their own inner savagery. 

In conclusion, while yes one can make the technical argument that ""dark"" in ""the dark continent"" is not literally about their skin color, it seems unclear how one can separate the racist historicity of this term's origins, usage, and effects on Africans. I hope you will consider changing your mind on the term.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","But every other game (from 6 on) was really different and confusing ""compared to the other games"". 

* 6 introduced the idea that EVERY character can learn magic. And even fighters could eventually cast spells...the idea of character classes wouldn't really be abandoned til the next game though.  

* 7 had that crazy materia system and the idea that there were no ""designated character classes"" for each character (which would be a concept that would be revisted in many of the future FF titles)  

* 8 has a system where the monsters level with you and that weird junction system where you link your spells to your stats. And what's this...you can't buy new weapons and there is no armor?    

* 9 was a throwback to 6 and the old school FF games...and a return to character classes and 4 commands.    

* 10 had that crazy sphere board thing.  
  
* 11 was an MMO?    

* 12 had the completely novel gambit license system (which admittedly, I still don't quite understand).  


The last game I really played through was 9. I played a little bit of the others but I honestly haven't touched 13-14 at all, so I don't feel comfortable typing anything about them. But each one was rather revolutionary.

7 and 8 went on sale a few years ago on Steam, and I bought them and replayed them (first time playing it through since I moved out of my parents' house). I think the love for 7 is driven mostly by nostalgia. 8 is legit a great game though...even nearly two decades later. The story is so compelling and relatable (though it does get kinda asspully with the time travel at the end of there...) because it's about growing up, making friends, and finding love (even if there is a great sorceress war to try to distract you from all that).

"keto","t5_2rske","SEO/digital marketer here. The reason you see this with recipes? It increases rankings on search results (aka SERPs)

It is debated, but it seems like it is good for Google's algorithms to 
have longer content. The problem with recipes is that in itself, it's only a paragraph. By upping the word count, it makes it easier to insert more keywords (without keyword stuffing, since they are in context) and makes it ""look"" like its higher quality. Combine that with structured snippet coding for the recipe, and Google is more likely to throw it to the top of the SERPs.

Unfortunately, Google has been slow to discourage this type of recipe layout. Hopefully that will change in the future, especially with AMP pages becoming a thing.

As for the pop ups, while Google ""says"" they don't like it, it doesn't seem like they penalize it. As annoying as they are, there is evidence from experts that they increase conversions. (aka signing up for an email list) I hate this as much as everyone else and refuse to every put them on the websites I work with.

It wasn't my intention to make the case for doing so without reason. I'm not moving the goalposts from my perspective, rather it seems like you're trying to set them and doing so erroneously. 

&gt; No offense

None taken, again I try and separate positions from person.

&gt; your bit about ""mixture"" was rather loquacious.

This entire thing has gotten fairly loquacious. I think I was pretty clear in explaining why you were being vague, though if you have any questions feel free to ask. 

&gt; since your positions have changed a few times but I haven't seen any recognition of error or a changed mind from you.

What positions do you suppose have changed that I'm not acknowledging?

&gt; to be a red flag.

That is likely because you did not understand me. I can clarify if you ask a specific question. 

&gt; just saying that the perception of philosophy - or the humanities in general if you prefer - as something that is or ought to be open for anyone at all to waste the time of people who have devoted their lives to it is misguided at best, and derogatory at worst.

And I'm saying it's derogatory to view that interaction as a ""waste of time."" One wonders why anyone would even become a professor with such a view. 

I've bypassed most to again avoid repeating myself (which would lead to you repeating yourself and so on). Again, I understand your view completely, and really it's not very different from mine. I, like you, view authority as a useful heuristic in certain situations. I just don't view it as useful in most philosophical discussions (as they are relevant to every day people I should add, so for instance morality and free will aren't places for authoritarian arguments, whereas a specific subset, such as your symbol logic example, may be more reasonably so). I think I've been pretty clear as to why, but again if not or if you have any questions feel free to ask.",1509494430

"mattcolville","t5_3f0mp","Sure. 

[Geek &amp; Sundry has a line of GM Tipps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XikjjQok5Y&amp;list=PL7atuZxmT9570U87GhK_20NcbxM43vkom), first with Matt Mercer, then with Satine Phoenix. Matt had a more direct approach to the series with very to the point tipps brought by his own experiences, while Satine presents it in a more dramatic way, with different guest-DMs that all talk about their experiences, but always centered around a specific theme. I don't exactly know if they choose the DMs who appear on this show based on their specialty, or if it is just highly stylized, but I suspect the latter to be the case. XD

[Web DM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XFmdssWgaPzGyGbKk8GaQ/videos) is a channel where Jim Davis &amp; Jonathan Pruitt talk with each other about specific topics primarily on D&amp;D. Sometimes the Topic is a specific class or race, but most of the videos I've seen were about general dicussions on specific adventure types, or how one could approach specific problems that might come up. Like... how do you show your group that there might be traps in a dungeon, instead of telling them or letting them find out the hard way? One of the suggestions is to show a dead body with marks that make the trap evident, but there are a few options more, of course.

Cody, from [Taking 20](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCly0Thn_yZouwdJtg7Am62A/videos) is a bit more low key in his production than most others, and he doesn't seem to be as steady in his DM tipps as the others, but he has a very natural way about him... kinda like the GM from your local store that you sometimes talk with about the game, even though you don't really know each other, but you're both in the same boat of being DMs.... I don't know if you catch my drift with this, but maybe just give his show a try and see for yourself.

[Nerdarchy](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdarchy/videos) goes a bit into the same direction as Web DM, but they have up to 4 DMs (as far as I've seen) who talk about a specific topic. They tend to ramble a bit more than Jim and Jonathan, and I would advice to view their vids with a grain of salt, since I've noticed in more than one video misconceptions about the rules that they somehow all shared instead of at least one actually doing some research on the topic before the start of the recording.  
Now... don't get me wrong, I'm not a rules lawyer - probabbly that's why I still can send you their way if you're so inclined - but for me it's kinda a mark of quality to know your shit. I don't mind if you *decide* to ignore/change a rule, as long as you *understand* that this is not RAW. Their misconceptions are few and they tend to throw in a bunch of different concepts and outlooks on specific topics, that it kinda outweigths the flaws, but like I said... take it with a bit of salt.

[How to be a Great GM](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bon3zmann/playlists) has often some pretty solid in depth views of topics that the above mentioned channels spend only a few moments on while discussing a grander scale. For example: When Satine talks with her guest about what you can do to make your NPCs stick out, she talks about their motivation for maybe a minute within her under 20 minutes videos, while this guy spends over 20 minutes giving a deep inside view on what you can do to come up with the motivation of a NPC and how to translate this into the conversation the NPC has with the PCs, with examples on how to do it and all. Personally I think it's sometimes a bit overkill, but if you want to get a bit more into a specific topic, you can probabbly find something here.

I love to watch Joe from [Dungeon Dad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtPX8KiXi_hyMNTFxlHNAQ/videos) because even though I sometimes have already read the entries of the creatures he covers in his ""Monster of the Week"" series, it's a nice reminder that those creatures exist with stats in some older books. And he often covers interesting ways to include said monsters in more than the traditional ""let's kill it"" way, so that's a big plus for him from my perspective.

[The DMs Craft](https://www.youtube.com/user/theDMsCraft) covers a completely different field of DMing, namely how to craft tiles, dungeons, props, and templates (as well as other things) for the game by yourself without spending a buttload of cash to do so, so it's great if you're on a budget. I also think it's helpfull for your balance if you sit down and craft/paint something now and then, and if it's helpfull for a more community driven hobby at the same time, you can kill two birds with one stone.

For the sake of completeness I will include [Dawnforged Cast](https://www.youtube.com/user/DawnforgedCast/videos) in this list (even though I won't claim that this list is anywhere near to be extensive - only that those are all the channels that I know of from the top of my head) but I really can't give a recommendation nor a sign of approval for this channel. In fact, I would advice strongly against visiting it, because I feel like the guy hosting it is somewhat of a twitt. I've started to watch 3 to 5 of his videos and I never came near the middle of the video before I decided to have better things to do with my time (even though I was unemployed when I've watched him for the first time). One of his videos is about how to achieve damage in quadruple digits with a cantrip, in another he talks about how he doesn't understand what people don't like about the basic ranger rules of 5e, only to follow up with how he changed the class for his games himself... ymmv, but I would stay away from this one.",1509494431
"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Take your time and read the points that have been made. What was my original statement? It was that men earn more than women, savvy?

To only add to the spuriousness he disclaimed that there was no **overall** male privilege.

Now, you must appreciate that I have illustrated my point by rendering onto OP two credible sources- one being directly from the government- which clearly demonstrate my point which is, if you deign to read this time, that men earn more than women. And I can't remember the last time money didn't win you privilege especially in a market-oriented country like the US.

You kind of contradicted yourself there when you said that a large difference will matter but a small difference won't. 

With momentum the last hit difference widens. Also last hits are already easy enough past the halfway mark of the game so we don't need to lower the skill floor on it.

In all seriousness, I think it's best if they're subtle in their differences. Something that can only be noticed if you know the both of them a lot, you know? At least that's what I like.

I made my Fred just a bit more... thoughtless? Insensitive? I'm not really sure what word to use, because the former makes him appear dumber while the latter makes him look like a jerk. He just blurts things out in a blunt manner more so than George. They're still very alike, but George is a tiny bit more mature in dealing with his friends while Fred's thoughtlessness comes out in both his victims and those he cares about. He also has slightly more freckles. 

&gt;It paints a picture of them as being incredibly bright - possibly the smartest of the Weasley siblings

I agree. For all of their inventions, they were incredibly smart. They just didn't put their intelligence into schoolwork, but rather other things such as the shop. Sure, the other Weasleys all got more O.W.L.S. but I honestly don't think any of them attributed to the war more than the twins, or perhaps *could have* attributed.

This is a good chance to present a topic that is rarely explored (lying about sexual assault) because of the nature of the subject. It's doubtful that because of this you would be painted as someone who is insensitive towards sexual assault or someone who thinks that most women lie about their situation. I say go for it. If anything, it presents a different sort of ugly side to these situations, because sometimes that sort of thing does happen.

Maybe if you were to have her to go a sort of rape recovery clinic or something like that for some reason (possibly out of guilt, the fact that she's trying to lie to herself to get others to believe her, or because she wants to understand what someone who was raped really feels like after the fact and how they would cope.), you could show the side of the story that reveals the true nature of the suffering that a rape victim (male or woman) experiences despite the fact that your character was not actually raped.",1509494437

"anime","t5_2qh22","For a survival competition, you need look no further than **Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works** and **Fate/Zero**. Which should you watch first? No one seems to know, but UBW is probably the safer bet. Maybe. Anyway, the series is about seven mages summoning seven heroes from the past who duke it out in a battle royale to claim the Holy Grail. A bit dialogue heavy at times, but the action usually makes up for it.

If you want to go for a different kind of competition, there's always **Free!**. Technically a third season is forth-coming, but everything is tied off nicely at the end of season 2, so you can watch that and be pretty satisfied. I have a natural bias to this show having grown up a swimmer, but it's got some great character moments along the way to distract you from the rocking bods.

If you want to get really outside the competition box, **Girls und Panzer** is another one that isn't really finished, with a few movies coming out in the future, but it wraps up pretty cleanly after Girls und Panzer der Film, so you can watch it now and be satisfied. Essentially it's tank warfare as an after school activity. It really revels in it's own absurdity, and that makes for a great time.

Also, you enjoyed One Punch Man, so I might as well recommend **Mob Psycho 100**, which is written by the same author. The art style is a bit different, but it makes for some glorious fight scenes. It still has plenty of comedy, but I find it (at times) trends more towards character drama than One Punch Man ever does. Reigen is also a really fun character and makes the series worth it on his own.

I'll also throw out **My Hero Academia** which has One Punch Man's superhero themes, plus the studio behind Fullmetal Alchemist. It's a really fun show that has a big tournament in the second season, so that also fills out your competition request. It's not finished though, but it looks like it may get a full adaptation.

And finally, I think you might enjoy **Madoka Magica**. It's a bit on the girly side, but if you're willing to look past that it's got some of the most interesting characters out there, a compelling story, great music and some really interesting visuals. It's my favorite anime, so I figure I might as well throw it out there :P

"FFXV","t5_2uk8i","Hello! Thank you for posting in /r/FFXV. Unfortunately, your post was removed because it because it does not contain a spoiler title tag or contains a spoiler in the title. For future reference, our [spoiler policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/subrules#wiki_rule_2.3A_spoilers_.26amp.3B_nsfw) is as follows:

&gt; A spoiler is a piece of information from the Main Quest or Downloadable Content that, if a player has not reached that point, knowing could negatively impact a player's experience. Generally speaking, anything you do not learn in the first Chapter of the game should have a spoiler tag. Any plot points from and including Chapter 9 to the ending definitely should include spoiler tags.

&gt; Some generic spoilers are considered common knowledge, even by new players (although they may not understand its context or significance) such as the fall of Insomnia, photobombing Gentiana, summons, Royal Arms, and post-game content. However, discussing the details or context about these things should elicit spoiler tags.

&gt; Why do we enforce spoiler tags on a game that has been out since November? Each day, we gain several new players to FFXV, and others may not have completed the story yet or attempted the DLC. Nevertheless, players come here asking for help about game mechanics or clarification about the story up to a certain point. Please be considerate of others; it takes little effort to add spoiler tags.

&gt; Whether the post is a Text (also called Self) post or a Link Post, the post should at least contain `[ Spoiler ]` in the title; this type of spoiler tag is called a **spoiler title tag**. This automatically adds a spoiler tag to the post, which appears [similar to this](https://i.redd.it/b83kf6g5xisx.gif).

&gt; Ideally, the post should have the correct latest Chapter or DLC that is spoiled in the title. An example of the format is the following, where *n* is the latest spoiled Chapter: `[ Chapter n Spoiler ]`.


&gt; If you do not include the latest Chapter or DLC that is spoiled in the title, your title must be descriptive enough for people to understand what is being spoiled without reading the post.


&gt; Do not include spoilers (except spoiler title tags) in the title of posts. The post will be removed at the moderators' discretion and may result in a ban. If you accidentally include a spoiler in the post title, you cannot edit it (because of administrator restrictions). You will have to delete the post and repost the content with a new title.

Please re-post your submission after properly tagging spoilers.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/FFXV) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1509494439

I'll assume you're in the U.S., because our roads are filled with morons and trucks.  [Currently, the average gas price in the U.S.](http://gasprices.aaa.com/) is $2.47/gallon.  The most recent source I could find suggested [the average gas mileage of vehicles on the road in the U.S.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/12/13/cars-in-the-u-s-are-more-fuel-efficient-than-ever-heres-how-it-happened/) is 23.6 miles per gallon.

For your claim ""If I had a dollar for every time I saw...  I'd never have to buy gas again"" to be true, you would have to at least be able to pay for the gas that you use.  Just using the averages for the price of gas and vehicle gas mileage, that would mean that **you need to see about one incident for every 9.6 miles you travel.**

This is of course constrained by the assumptions I mentioned.  I suppose you could've spent a lot of time driving in [North Dakota, the state with the most fatal truck accidents](https://www.truckaccidentfirm.com/truck-accident-blog/2016/april/which-states-have-the-most-trucking-accidents-/) during a time when gas was very very cheap.  Or maybe you drive a [really high gas mileage hybrid](https://www.autotrader.com/best-cars/11-most-fuel-efficient-hybrids-222099), meaning you'd be able to go a little over 20 miles between observed instances.

Felony murder was originally intended to close a perceived loophole; if two thugs rob someone and the victim is shot to death there is strong evidence that one of them did it but sometimes not enough to get a murder conviction on the likely triggerman. So lawmakers created felony murder so any of them could be convicted with the death of a victim during a violent felony. Where this may be overbroad is when the police kill one of the robbers and the others are charged with felony murder, or someone dies of a heart attack. And in this case they used murder in the first degree (with premediation or lying in wait) and felony murder encompasses non-premeditated murders. 

Is life in prison for felony murder for supplying transport too harsh? Maybe. Unfortunately states have less consistent sentencing than the feds and access to criminal defense attorney services has a high correlation with better outcomes for the defendant. You can point to your favorite juxtaposition of a terrible crime only getting a few years of prison or even just probation, while a less severe crime gets decades.",1509494442

"programming","t5_2fwo","I have an irrational soft spot for C, but no, it has all kinds of major design flaws, even by early 70's standards — null-terminated strings and arrays decaying to pointers being the two biggest.

And, today's C is actually closer to early C++ than it is to how C was for the first 20 years of its existence. The changes ported from C++ are *major* improvements.

Do you like having type-checking when you're writing C? Thank Bjarne Stroustrup for that. As originally designed, C had *no type-checking at all.* `const`, variable declarations inside function bodies, `inline`, `// comments`: All Bjarne and C++.

This is how C was before C++:

Your readings are pretty clearly indicative of someone on the downward slope. Your PBT in the field is not admissible, but the results of the other tests are. 

The prosecutor could argue that you were .07 at the station, but that’s because it was falling and you were .08 at the time you were operating a vehicle. 

The other clues of impairment (such as how you performed the field sobriety tests) would be taken into consideration to determine your level of impairment. A conviction at .07 is indeed possible.

That's in the nature of these overviews. Read them but don't take them *too* seriously. So considering the kind of book Kenny's wants to be and the number of research programs denoted by the label ""continental philosophy"", it makes little sense to demand that an overview should do justice to them. 

As for biased authors, I say there's a good kind of bias and a bad kind of bias. The good kind of bias poses critical questions and thereby helps you better understand something. That's why I prefer authors that are straightforward with their opinions (it also makes for better reading when an author isn't scared of writing with a bit of gusto). The bad kind of bias is the one where someone dismisses a theory he know's nothing about (see: russell on hegel). As for Kenny's book, again, I don't either of these categories really apply because he only mentions continental philosophy in passing and barely says anything about it.

How many of the books of scripture that are known to exist or used to exist are accurate and how do we know that? The situations are very much comparable. What we call heresy from the past was sometimes very much caused by a misunderstanding about the veracity of scripture itself and even in the time of the Apostles there were epistles circulated that weren't by them and epistles that they wrote which we do not have (and sharp disagreement between apostles as well). 

So the first example is people falling into error as they don't know which apostles and successors of apostles to trust and/or which scriptures are true. 

In both cases the correct understanding of the origins of scripture (and what it means for something to be scripture) are in question.

2.) I don't think we should (or even functionally can) put emotional harm caused by words on the same level as physical violence. Especially when it comes to legal restraints. It is simple and objectively determined that throwing punches or hitting people with baseball bats causes bodily harm no matter if they are ""tough"" or not. It is easy to, across the board, say ""No one gets to hit anyone else without self-defense based provocation""

But words? There is no way, a priori, to tell if words will or won't cause psychological harm. If we start going down that road, we can't stop. It sets a godawful precedent. If some conservative Christian theocrat is genuinely offended by me labeling myself as ""atheist"" because it implies their god doesn't exist, can they demand that I not label myself as such? If I, being an atheist, don't like thinking about hell can I demand that a Christian not express their sincere belief in eternal damnation? 

*Any* attempt to demand speech of one sort or another be codified by law sets a dangerous precedent that is only invisible to those who are blinded by their pet ideology. ",1509494447

Not to mention - it wasn't simply Embiid outplaying him. Richaun Holmes MASSIVELY outplayed him last year and it seemed like the coaching / FO continued to play Okafor over Holmes based simply on either pumping up his trade value or because Okafor was the former #3 pick so he had ""potential""

I wish nothing but the best for him as he seems like a nice guy - but all this pity he's getting on here is brutal - he's failing because he is a bad basketball player

I loved the Process. It got us multiple top picks. The Process led to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and allowed the Sixers to get away with Okafor being a terrible pick. But make no mistake - Okafor was a terrible pick and he has been a bad NBA player - maybe the worst player in the entire NBA - through his 2+ years so far.

If Okafor wasn't a top pick and he impacted the team the way he did - he wouldn't have had so many chances to shine. That top pick label will get him one more chance - and if he doesn't succeed - don't be surprised if he's out of the NBA in 2 years",1509494447

""Here is the relevant exchange between Lindsey Graham and William Browder:

Graham: You believe that Fusion GPS should of registered under FARA, because they were acting on the behalf of the Russians?
 
Browder: That’s correct.
 
Graham: So, I just want to absorb that for a moment. The group that did the dossier on President Trump hired this British spy, wound up getting it to the FBI. You believe they were working for the Russians?
 
Browder: And in the Spring and Summer of 2016 they were receiving money indirectly from a senior Russian government official.
 
Graham: Okay. So, these are the people that were trying to undermine Donald Trump by showing the nefarious ties to Russia. Is that what you’re saying?
 
Browder: Well, what I’m saying with 100% certainty is that they were working to undermine the Magnitsky act and the timing of that.
 
Graham: But, the Fusion GPS products apparently as they hired a guy to look into Trump?
 
Browder: Yes.
 
Graham: Right.
 
Browder: Correct.""

""Veselnitskaya (Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet intelligence officer), through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act. He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistle-blower, and was instead a criminal. They also spread false information that my presentations to lawmakers around the world were untrue.""

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Hey, great question. In my experience and train of thought, there are a few things about adverbs and adjectives to be aware of.

Adverbs add a secondary layer of descriptive information about a verb, adjective, or another adverb. Information such as ""how, when, where, to what extent, why, etc.""

Adjectives are similar in that they modify nouns and other adjectives and add information like ""what kind, which one, how many.""

So to answer your question and not ramble off on something else, when would it be bad to attach more descriptive information onto a verb?

Sometimes a weak verb is just a weak verb, or a weak noun is just a weak noun. Adding an adverb or adjective onto these weak words won't make them any better.

&gt; The uniformed man approached me after I stopped my car.

Adjective = uniformed, noun = man.

Uniformed man is a little awkward and it doesn't really give you that much more information. Instead, you should use a better noun altogether, such as ""policeman, officer, soldier, parking attendant"" in place of ""uniformed man"". These are better nouns to use that don't need any adjectives. Everyone knows what a policeman is, so just call it that.

Same thing with adverbs. 

&gt; He thought very hard.

Adverbs = very, hard.

This sentence would actually be okay sometimes, especially if the narrator or character dialogue is simple. But sometimes in a story, you as the author will want a character or narrator to be more eloquent. So instead of ""he thought very hard,"" you might write, ""He concentrated"", or ""He meditated"", or ""He wondered.""

Concentrated, meditated, and wondered are all more powerful verbs than ""thought"". But they all mean different things because they have connotation. Concentrated means you are thinking so hard and focusing only on the problem or task at hand and nothing else. Wondered means something more like daydreaming or you're imagining several things at once. You can get lost in a daydream because your sense of wonder takes you to many different places. This is a much different meaning than to concentrate.

Try playing a little game. Try to modify the verb ""thought"" using adverbs in order to give it the same meaning as ""concentrate"". 

&gt; He thought very hard about his task.

&gt; He thought only of one thing.

&gt; He thought intensely.

&gt; He thought single pointedly.

&gt; He thought...

It's tough to use adverbs to give ""thought"" the same context as ""concentrate"". So in this case, if you want your character to do more than just ""think very hard"", you give them a more powerful verb that carries a stronger meaning with it. Or if your character has a larger vocabulary, he would say ""concentrate"" as opposed to ""think hard"".

Another reason why people will suggest trimming your adverbs and adjectives is because they can feel repetitive if you used them all the time. Readers will get bored of the same [adjective]+[noun] or [verb]+[adverb] sentence structure.

&gt; He jumped really high. He climbed fast once he reached the ladder. He yelled very loudly when he reached the finished line.

Those three sentences have the same structure.  

&gt; [Subject pronoun] [verb] [adverb].

It gets boring. People want some variety. One way you can do that is to trim the adverbs and use better verbs. Using different verbs will allow you to vary the sentence structure.

&gt; Lunging for the ladder, he grabbed hold of it and scaled to the top. He cheered his way across the finish line.

It's more entertaining to read a variety of sentences. They have different paces, different lengths, and therefore feel differently when you read them. It keeps the reader guessing and eager to read more because you aren't droning on with repetitive sounding sentences. The same reasoning applies to adjectives as well.

With practice, we all will be better able to determine when and where it's better to use adverbs and adjectives. In my opinion, avoiding them like the plague is just as ignorant as using them like a crutch. But it's tougher than it sounds. And if you're really skilled, you'll break the rules in order to create a specific effect in your writing. Sometimes you want characters to be unintelligible or ramble. Sometimes you want to make your prose more poetic so you create a specific rhythm, and therefore you MUST HAVE a fixed amount of syllables in a sentence. You might be forced to use an adjective or adverb if it gives you the rhythm you wanted.

Actually they don't. No one says anything except Cartman. 


&gt;Stan is angry at them because he disagrees with them so he responds to a family that only showed him love and compassion and niceness by berating them and yelling at them. 

And? It makes perfect sense for him to be angry when their worldview makes no sense. There is nothing wrong at all with being angry and honest about it. Stan is an authentic person who genuinely cares about other people. 

The mormon family is only nice on the surface. After Stan yells at them they act like nothing happened, because they didn't actually care about Stan or his feelings at all. If they actually cared they would be honest and genuine with him and talk to him about his concerns. Honestly those type of people give me the creeps. Being angry and sad is natural, and acting like everything is ok all the time is just what a cult does to get people to join it.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Let's say you see a person with a fantastic haircut. Let's even say you have a weakness for haircuts like Uma Thurman's in Pulp Fiction. So you walk over when she's not in the middle off talking and say ""I think your haircut is fantastic."" And the person will respond. 

Now, as long as you've complimented her on something that is both entirely within her control and not specifically sexual, you're fine. And there's some leeway depending on what it is specifically. For instance, if she has a generic tattoo on her breasts, commenting on liking the design **on her boobs"" is overtly sexual. But instead let's say the tattoo on her breast is a bird with ""poo-tee-weet"" under it, and you say ""I saw your Vonnegut tattoo, and I absolutely love Slaughterhouse Five too!"", you're fine. Or you comment on how her color coordination between her fingernail polish and her dress is striking. 

But most importantly, it can't be contrived. You saw some self expression that isn't overtly sexual, and you want to tell her that you appreciate how she's chosen to express herself.

Now, at this point, she's going to respond in someway. Whatever it is, LISTEN. Both to what she literally says **and** her body language. If she says ""thanks"" and *turns away*, then cool. You read that as ""not interested"" and go back to what you were doing. Maybe she *turns toward you* and compliments you in someway. You read that as ""yes, let's continue to say words at each other.""

Or maybe she doesn't respond at all, completely *ignoring you*. Above, when she responded with non-interest, you effectively reciprocated with non-interest. And when she responded with interest, you reciprocated with interest. So if she responds by completely ignoring you, you... completely ignore her too. Not pointedly, not angrily, I mean just walk away as if nothing had even happened. Act like you didn't compliment her, act like you had never approached her. Just undo the attempted interaction in your mind. 

Under no circumstances are you to ever get angry and call her a bitch. You are never to expect anything more than complete indifference. 

Congratulations, you just complimented her without being a creep. ",1509494460

Linking the account gives 3, so you'd just need to do one thing to get 4, or two for 5. Such as just completing two campaigns.

Some easy ones:

* The three campaigns in normal mode
* Black Moa or Black Widow Spider (both require going ~halfway through a campaign - Factions for Moa, any for Spider).
* Imperial Phoenix (requires completing Factions and leveling it to 20).
* M.O.X. (requires level 20 character, pretty easy).
* Sorrow's Furnace (easiest of elite mission statues - can bring heroes/hencmen).

If you don't care for anything but Heritage armor minus shoulders, I'd pop into Nightfall to get your first heroes, then at level 10 begin going through Eye of the North for the first tapestry (put it to Fellowship), farm until level 20 (not hard, just do Factions/Nightfall quests) and get M.O.X. and with him in the HoM you'd have 4 points.

If you have friends who've played GW1 for a long time, getting minis from them would be easier, but you'd still have to level to 10 then go through Eye of the North a tad to get that first tapestry (instead you'd put it to Devotion, not Fellowship).",1509494461

My inner asshole is telling me, he could be waiting for you to make the first move and to set the precedent. I've been in that situation once, and the only reason why was because the girl I was friends with was married. 

I had no intention of pursuing anything with her. There was always some attraction and sexual tension but our relationship for the most part started out as platonic, but with a lot of flirting. We met at the pool at our apartment complex and hit it off from the very beginning. I was the apprehensive one I had no intention of crossing the line, but she ended up taking the initiative and there wasn't really much else afterwards. The sexual chemistry was explosive, but that was literally it, for various reasons (there was no way we were going to work for obvious reasons). 

Not saying that you guys are in the same situation. He could just be waiting for you to take the lead so that he has an excuse to be comfortable moving forward from an intimate to a sexual relationship. This is just best guess by the way, it's speculation and conjecture, the only way to really know would be to talk to him about it.",1509494462

Any other simultaneous effects (which these are) are determined by initiative if theres one for each player.  If they both belong to the same player, that player determines the order.  So if Harpooned is resolved first, you splash, take a face-down damage, discard the card, then resolve tlt.

It sucks because when a listing is flooded, no one wins.  The price is driven down, and both new listers and incumbents lose.  This is great for the customer, btw.

What we've noticed is that new listers drop like flies after half a year, if not sooner - I gauge this by seeing if they have launched any new products or keep in stock.  We simply lower the price against the new listers and use our capital to ride it out.  After 2 years, it's only us and 2 other competitors for this item.

This is one of the major things gurus never point out in the midst of all the encouragement.  What new sellers don't anticipate when going against competition - the size of their competitor's bank accounts when waging a price war.",1509494463

Now that they've tasted the sweet, tantalizing sensation of ripping monopolized customers off while rubbing and twisting their nipples throughout the process, I fear there is no going back.  I'll never forget the sound of absolute bliss in the Cox representative's voice as they told me my plan was being ""retired"" - all while seemingly dialing in their own nipples, like some old wooden radio knobs.  The tone of their voice was one of both absolute satisfaction and utter disgust.  Like two tiny, unbuttoned towels flapping below two cloned pieces of canadian bacon with a chunk of ham glued on top, I listened as the Cox representative twisted and turned his own teat. 
 Noticeably just above the unbuttoned cloth flaps that normally cover his nips.  Smiling and laughing - clearly sexually aroused by virtue of his own stimulation.

You hate/dislike the whole of Islam when a Muslim does something horrific, but you hate/dislike only ***parts*** of the other religions when their adherents do something horrific.  Doesn't that seem like a double standard to you?

As for what difference it makes - it makes a difference because whether you accept the truth of the document or not, it's a real thing that has specific allegations in it. When supporters argue that is says things that it clearly doesn't, it causes them to loose credibility. I would think as supporters, you would also want to know if you are being manipulated with inflammatory claims, or if you are repeating things that aren't true. The examples I've seen recently on here are intentionally provocative things, which makes me question either the intention or the credibility of the person posting them. However, if a supporter were to read the claims that the document includes those details and take it as fact that those claims are in the document, it widens the confusion and divide between those who are looking into the dossier as a possible truth and those who discount it on principle. For example, one of the claims was that Trump yelled ""I hate black people"". A supporter, reading that and believing it, would take it as further proof that the dossier is ridiculous. But that doesn't appear anywhere in it, and muddies the conversation. 

I am not claiming the dossier is true, or that every word is true (although I lean towards believing it is). But I think it's important to know what's fact and what isn't, when discussing it, or to choose not to make claims about it.

Odwracając tę sprawę to tak jakby ateista poszedł na mszę do kościoła i się obrażał, że tam czczą Chrystusa. 

Ale gdyby Nergal zrobił to np. publicznie na placu w centrum miasta, to już by odpowiadał karnie bo miał co najmniej zamiar ewentualny tzn. godził się na to, że może to dotrzeć bezpośrednio do katolików bo mógł przewidywać że będą oni spacerować w centrum miasta. Zamiar bezpośredni by miał np. gdyby celowo zrobił taką manifestację pod kościołem po mszy.

Title: **Is this allowed in a contract?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I just want to know if this is legally enforceable—a contract that states that the individual will be fined if she interacts with another individual forever —like sending a message or going on a date. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Parents of a friend are being extremely controlling and advice in this may help her. Thank you.

Brady established that Goodell is God after an investigation per the CBA.

OP - don’t be so hard on yourself. Infertility and loss are unbelievably unfair, and the bitterness a lot of us feel is a product of that. Watching people not struggle, and especially watchIng them blissfully unaware of loss, is really hard. To me, it would be a normal and expected reaction with any other unfair life experience, so I shouldn’t feel guilty when I feel that way about pregnancies/babies. ",1509494472

i do sample everything through the 404, whether it ends up on the octatrack or the 404 - my sampling cable goes into the 404, the 404 goes into the octatrack. i turn on the external source on the 404, and i can either record the sample straight to the 404 or pass it through (with 404 onboard effects applied if i want) to the octatrack. :)

"UI_Design","t5_2vqtk","For native apps, it depends on which versions of the OS, and which generation of devices you want to support for your app. For iOS 11, the oldest supported device is the iPhone 5s ( [according to this list](http://www.techradar.com/news/ios-11-compatibility-list-does-it-work-with-your-iphone-and-ipad) ). To support that phone, your app would need to scale down to 320px width. Starting with the iPhone 6, the screen width for iPhones increased to 375px. Not sure about android device compatibility, but there is probably a list out there somewhere.

These numbers refer to the 1x (or mdpi for android) width. This seems kind of backward because the last non-retina (1x) iPhone was the 3Gs, but we still design @1x for a variety of reasons, [better explained here](https://medium.com/shyp-design/design-at-1x-its-a-fact-249c5b896536).

[You can see a big list of device metrics here.](https://material.io/devices/)

The important column there is 'Width x Height dp'. DP as a measurement stands for 'Device-independent Pixels', which you [can read more about here](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/units-measurements.html).

But yes, generally, you want to design at 360 or 375 width. For responsive web, I still design everything to support 320px because it is easier to scale things up than down. Height is more variable between devices, and for responsive web, it even varies on the same device depending on which app you are using to view a page.

And you should always look at the design on the device you are designing for. Text and other stuff looks different on a big monitor than it does on a phone.",1509494474

Jack was the charming, rogueish cad who was amazing when fed to us in smaller doses. 

But when Jack moved from the deuteragonist role to the protagonist role in the fourth movie, what was once charming and sly and witty about him suddenly became overbearing and obnoxious. Turns out, there really *is* such a thing as too much Captain Jack Sparrow! Too much focus on made him hammy. 

This is why I think the fifth movie was much better recieved. They made Jack the deuteragonist again and that made him tolerable again. Although I would like to just gripe for a moment: I’m REALLY disappointed with what they’ve done with Jack’s character as of late. He was silly at times in the beginning of the franchise, but he was also cunning as hell, charming, smooth, and wickedly witty. Now they’ve just turned him into this bumbling, drunken fool who doesn’t make things happen—he lets things happen *to* him. You don’t get the feeling that he’s clever or charming anymore...just kind of silly and over-the-top. The whole point of Dead Men Tell No Tales was that he was drunk and lost in the beginning, but he had found purpose and hope again in the end—so I’m crossing my fingers and praying that he will make a return to the charming rogue he once was in the next movie! I miss the Captain Jack that I fell in love with at age 10 or whatever, you know? 

Sorry for the length lol. I have a lot of feelings about the POTC movies. ",1509494477

Now, I will admit that Spacey's response is pretty weird, and that the accusations sound like they could be true. As such I would definitely not allow spacy around any 14 year olds until shown he is safe.  

But there is a difference between that and blacklisting him based on a single report, even one that sounds likely. It is not very morally satisfying to show restraint, but we need to.

So I guess I think it should work like this: we take all accusations seriously, but we make sure we have evidence before ruining lives. People tend to one extreme or the other, either excusing or ignoring sexual assault, or accepting immediately without discernment.

It is just a troubling trend.

(All that aside, I have not looked for evidence in this case as of yet, I have just not really seen it shown in these comments yet. Just people claiming it was an ""open secret.""

I had a friend who operated the lens grinding or cutting machines so I was going to say in that case where you already have the frame that you're cutting the glass to fit into, cutting the glass is like 99% of your production time. If it's custom frames, that could take a lot more time for sure.

You realize there's someone next to you who's laughing and talking extremely loudly and is making it hard for you to enjoy the movie. You watch the movie, and leave feeling disappointed because while you enjoyed the plot and acting, and the emotional moments, the movie was extremely short and seemed low-budget with cheesy effects and the camera wasn't working properly either, causing some frames to drop.

The productive discussion isn't whether or not colors matter.  They do.  They have an effect on the lives of every wrongfully-oppressed minority who has to shoulder the problems of constant negativity from the subtleties of being a minority.  In the case of the OP, they tell us all about dedication to something and how far one's willing to go to respect what they appreciate; if this were an adult, would we be okay with it?  How is it any different at the end of the day if this adult still thinks of Mr. T. as a role model/heroic figure?  If color didn't matter, the controversy honestly wouldn't exist. 

The productive discussion is not whether or not colors matter, but rather if we want them to, and what, if anything, we want such things to symbolize.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","But the driving change is the change in output, not input. Which is what is causing the weight gain. 

I'll put it this way - lets say somebody is consuming 2000 calories a day but only burns 1800 calories/day. If they start to exercise and burn off calories there, and add muscle mass which increases their basal metabolic rate they may start burning 2100 calories/day, but still only eats 2000 calories a day, then they will loose weight. Their input stays the same, but the output changes, which is what is driving the weight loss. If somebody did this you wouldn't say that diet is what altered their weight, since it remained constant - it was their caloric output that changed. They lost the weight due to exercise, not diet, since exercise was the variable that was changed. 

In this case we could say that, because their caloric intake is constant, the increase in metabolism is different. You yourself said that ""altering your CICO balance can change your weight"" - if one variable remains constant, and one changes, then it is the changing variable that is driving the change, right?

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","One of my cousin’s “wins” (she felt) was that she made it clear to everyone what he had done. He was embarrassed and it stopped him from controlling the narrative to friends and family. She basically cut him off at the knees. He thought she would be too ashamed to admit HIS affair but actually she had NO shame and broadcast it. To the mailman, to his mother, to their friends, to her colleagues...etc. 

He tried to humiliate her and he ended up screwing himself instead. Telling was the best thing she ever did.

LTI - Life time hull insurance.  Instead of paying a small fee to replace a lost ship, you get hull insurance for free.  LTI is offered on new concept sales only.  An upgrade from one of these LTI hulls to another ship will transfer the lifetime insurance to that ship.

CCU - An upgrade token. Some are free (e.g. to change a ship to another ship that has the same cost in dollars, pounds, etc - the Gladius to Hull-B is a good example of a $0 CCU), some cost the difference between the two ships (e.g. right now, an upgrade token to go from the Aquila to the Carrack cost the buyer $75).  Once purchased and held in your inventory, the token will always upgrade that ship for the original amount you paid to purchase the token, even if the cost of the two ships changes.  When you finally decide to use the token, you effectively replace the existing ship with the new ship.  Other items in the package remain there (e.g. if you have a particular bit of flair like a model 85X that came with the original ship purchase, using a CCU to change that ship will still mean the new ship has the original 85X model in the package).

CIG has announced that they'll be discontinuing $0 CCUs in the near future (if they haven't already), so you'll only be able to purchase CCUs where the ship you want to upgrade to costs more than the ship you're upgrading from.  There was talk of a $5 CCU ""fee"", but I'm not sure if that idea left the ground or not.",1509494492

&gt; I think taxation is neccesary to ensure there is no monetary barrier of entry for all students

Why? Look at how much your country spends per student and ask yourself: why wouldn't people be able to just as effectively spend this on alternatives and get just as good if not better results?

&gt; I think our society is greatly improved by having educated citizens.

I don't think this is disputed, but the means of achieving it and the costs associated matter.

&gt; I think a great deal of children would miss out on an education if the cost was placed solely on parents per semester and by having governments run schools, it incentivises parity across all schools, so small, regional and rural schools aren't left behind.

Yeah, definitely not the case in the US. I went to a rural school. It sucked. The amount that the government spent on me could have been much, much better spent elsewhere. Forcing me into a government school held back my education during my formative years. Too often people like to point at government schools being universal and proclaim it a success while ignoring the opportunity costs associated with making education a monopoly.",1509494492

With that out of the way,

&gt;Because the minimum recommended CPU (3.6 GHz x 2) is less powerful than the Xbox One CPU (1.75 GHz x 8)

Cool. What's the overhead of the Xbox system? How many cores are reserved for the Xbox UI? For the party system/voice chat? Are any of the cores reserved by the Xbox system for future functionality and unable to be utilized by the devs? Those 8 cores aren't really looking like 8 so much any more. Not to mention that you can't compare clock speeds across architectures like that.

Played and completed the game on steam earlier this year. Reposting a comment I made about how I got the game to run (almost) properly:

* Install ~~denuvo~~ Durazno to get rid of the horrendous dead zone that the pc version has (still has the dead zone for looking up/down however)
* Disable in-game Vsync as it makes game performance unplayable
* Force Vsync on in my graphics card manager to cap it at 60. If the game runs at any more than 60 FPS it causes a slew of problems including invisible walls, bodies that fly away randomly when enemies die and characters saying their lines at the wrong times.

With all these fixes the game ran very well for me. I had a single crash over 10ish hours of play.

This is where we have to agree to disagree, then. Also, you're making quite a lot of assumptions. 

My parents are African immigrants. They didn't have to deal with anti-black sentiment or racism in their country. Here, they are aware of it. I didn't know the word 'nigger' until I was 13. But when I understood the meaning behind it, I didn't start suddenly wanting to say it because 'I didn't know to be offended until I was told to be'. 

There's better reasons to not do blackface, than there are to do it. The past mistakes are in the past. We can learn from them, or choose to repeat them. 

In the end, if this is really something you're passionate about, go campaign for blackface awareness and acceptance. Nobody is stopping you.  But please don't waste any more of your time and energy trying to convince me or change my mind. There's a subreddit for that.",1509494501

If he's pardoned, his charges will immediately go to AG Schneiderman in NY, where barring a cooperation agreement he would certainly be convicted.

The real question is not whether Manafort should ""worry,"" it's whether Manafort would prefer life in prison and the financial destruction of his family, vs cooperation? The author's premise completely ignores this ultimate reality.",1509494504

Now this kid's father, is the definition of toxic masculinity and he was not impressed that his precious son was going to spar against a girl. And his son says ""coach, I don't want to fight against a gurrrl"". My little DD looks him square in the eyes and says ""I'm going to make you cry!"" And she did!

-Imperialist dipshit: Yes he is. Maher has this simplistic reductionist view of the Middle East where wars and foreign produced instability and causal explanations can't be taken into account for why the Middle East is fucked up.

Granted I'm also opposed to the other reductionists who claim that decades of Wahhabist propaganda hasn't made the Mid East hyper socially regressive. Or that the institutions developed out of hyper conservative Islam don't stand in the way of political pluralism. But Bill helps those ppl by giving the other knuckle dragging explanation.

And yes conservative Muslims should be stood up to just like we would to any white religious bigot, no matter the country. Punching down is one of those bs axioms.

-Democratic Party Shill: Fuck yes! But mostly in the past year or so. Back when Sanders was in the race Maher got behind him first in the primaries. Maher had Richard Wolff on and said that socialism gets too bad of a rap.

Now Maher basically wants ppl to vote for Establishment dems without getting anything in return.

He's said we shouldn't push policies constituents are actually concerned about and just need to get better at propaganda to make average ppl worry about Russia more than things that effect them.

Maher has proposed that the democrats should have their own Benghazi investigation. That comically fruitless goose chase that makes the Russia hysteria seem less stupid if nothing results from the investigations.

Maher has said that democrats should push more undocumented ppl out of the US to appear less 'weak' on illegal immigration. A panelist immediately shut his ass down by pointing out that Obama was the exact opposite too the point of committing mass civil liberties abuses. All Maher got out of that was that the dems are appearing weak even though they're acting like law enforcement shitkickers. Instead of not giving a fuck what repubs think and focus bc on doing the right thing and giving amnesty to millions of ppl.

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","Luthor, Sinestro, and Reverse Flash.

Luthor (Post Crisis): Dude could be one of the world's greatest heroes, instead he's a unfeeling, arrogant remorseless monster. The dude is so damn smart he could do just about anything and I'd believe it because ""he's Luthor"". He also does the most evil stuff in DC, highlights include him massacring thousands of super powered children on New Years just to get public support, and giving up an eternity of pure bliss for the universe for a shot at killing Superman.

Sinestro - Anti-hero as much as hero, Sinestro craves order. He's extremely powerful, super smart, and I think he's legit been truly beaten only once in the past 20 years or so. Every other time his losses have been planned in advance and used to fuel his schemes. He's one of the few Lanterns to be able to 1v1 an Entity. He's also great because how close to a hero he is. He does evil things for good reasons. Also hes usually 10 steps ahead of the heroes. 

Reverse Flash - This is probably the most psychotic villain in DC. Reverse Flash is a serial killer/stalker who can never truly be killed, knows every aspect of your life, knows exactly how to hurt you and who you care about, can appear anywhere or any when and is absolutely ruthless. He's stronger than Barry, he's faster than Barry. And he's obsessed with Barry. But he cant kill Barry. Thats his one weakness. So to get around this he messes with Barry's life as much as possible. And the worst part is that he will never go away. Barry legit cant stop him. The most recent arc where he messes up Batman and Kid Flash was great, and his line about Barry's mom's death ""not being in the top 10 worst things"" Reverse Flash does emphasizes the point that Thawne isnt going to go away. He's the one thing Barry cant outrun, cant permanently beat and cant ever leave behind. Also his fights are so damn violent, you can feel every punch. And he emotionally beats people while fighting them too, saying exactly what they don't want to hear.

Kamara was a perfect fit for what we do on offense, though.  Hindsight 20/20, he probably deserved most of the touches if the coaches weren't going to adjust things.


I still personally think that we should've been running 60% or more of our plays with Hurd, Kamara, and Dobbs on the field all at once though.  Those were our most dynamic guys.  Kamara could play RB and/or slot.  Hurd could play RB and HB/TE.  ",1509494512

Since she's so open about everything, I'm sure she'd appreciate you being open about this as well.


Otherwise, if she wants you to go, why wouldn't you? Since she's been hinting at it, maybe she wants to show you more about her past and all.
And if it helps with your concerns, that's a win-win.


If you don't go with her, I think it'd be fair to discuss it and set up certain boundaries and rules for her so that you can feel a bit more safe about all this.
That still only helps to a certain extent, so you'll still just kinda have to trust her, but it seems like the best solution if you don't go with her. ",1509494515

"startrek","t5_2qixm","One reason is that TNG's set was very brightly lit, compared to most shows which use spot lights against a dark background to make things pop. The TNG ship was more like a luxury flying office. It looked like a real workspace. I just watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lt6eciYsTw) which points out how there are always people working and collaborating in the background inside the ship. The typical darkly lit scifi ships, like in The Expanse, Star Wars or Discovery look less realistic as real workspaces.

The Enterprise reminds me a bit of the recently completed [Bloomberg European HQ](https://youtu.be/AKQ2WUbUpU8). It has the same kind of curvy, luxurious collaborative design. In the video, they even emphasize diversity, art and architecture, all TNG staples. 

TNG is inspired by a liberal enlightenment philosophy. It's all about collaborating and becoming better through art, science and learning. Kind of like a liberal arts college.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I'm all about fixing things but as someone who works with a lot of businesses of all sizes, I will tell you that culture is huge, and set from the top down. And this extends to every facet of life, look at Japan for instance. The problem with diversity is people self segregate for cultural identity..  punks, frat boys, businessmen, Farmers, construction, liberals, elites, church goers, hip hop culture, runners, bikers or those with healthy life styles. In a homogeneous culture with its own government resources you can set goals and they will be in line with most of society... Here you can't do that. Certain cultures here are to reject the main stream culture and think making people work for help is racist, even though it's not a race issue it's a poverty issue. But because of racial cultural differences the conversation breeds accusations of racism. That in itself is a very long conversation, but culture is everything in these conversations, and a giant elephant in the room that nobody wants to touch because it's volatile to civility. The reason doctors are from other countries are because we allow it, and perhaps shouldn't, I had a doctor from Nigeria that game me the worst most incompetent care I've ever received, and didn't seem like she had a clue what she was doing, and when I looked up her schooling it made sense. For profit colleges exist because some of them still guarantee you jobs if you go into a proper field like medicine and aren't a slob, asshole, or generally incompetent. Making college free will unfortunately just turn college into high school part two and will lower the value for a basic college degree from a community college and equate it to an extended high school diploma... So I'm not a huge fan of how they want to implement that. And the problem with those countries is that they do literally have death panels when it comes to serious illnesses and issues because resources are not unlimited and you can only take so much from the people working. Look up Canada death panels. Sorry Grandma, you had a good life, even though you've paid in more than everyone younger, the younger life has longer to pay in and is worth more to the state so the younger person takes precedent. I'm all for fixing things, but thinking emotionally and not logically ends in bad policies that lead to the exact problems we are trying to solve today.",1509494516

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","This is why some 31 year old men insist on dating women in their early 20s. Because they think they can pull games like this, and then when you ask them about it,  they can manipulate you into thinking you are being insecure and “crazy” and then just keep on going about what they are doing, all while you are apologizing for having done absolutely nothing wrong. It’s because you are less experienced than them, that they choose you. A 31 year old woman would likely have called him on the bullshit as soon as she saw how defensive he was getting and demanded to see the phone. 

He got snap chat so he could snap other women. If it was just his buddies from the gym he would have just showed you their hilarious snaps and the two of you would have had a laugh and continued on with the evening. 

He got defensive because he was snapping women, thought you were naive, and in a panic tried to deflect the “accusations”  And then he turned it all around on you. I know you weren’t accusing him of anything. If he wasn’t up to anything, he probably wouldn’t have thought you were accusing him of anything either. 

If he discovers he can successfully trick you into thinking you are wrong every time he betrays you, he will continue to push boundaries until he’s cheating. But if I could put money on it, I’d say he already is. 

Even more concerning is how he demands to know who you are talking to, and then makes it seem like you are the liar. Usually this is just simple projection. He lies to you, and then gets paranoid and accuses you of lying, but you aren’t the liar. He is. 

Going forward, keep those eyes open. If your gut tells you something is up, believe it. I’m positive he’s a manipulative lying cheater. But If you are anything like I was in my early 20s, you’ll defend him, stay with him, and unfortunately learn the hard way. 

It sucks, we’ve all been there. How much of this you put up with from him going forward is completely up to you. ",1509494517

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I’m not necessarily defending OP’s attitude towards this and of putting her wants before his, but I can definitely understand why this is frustrating. It sounds like his job would have been better for family happiness in the long run than working in a prison considering the high risk and high stress job environment with presumably fewer benefits and opportunities for advancement. Since they have young children, it’s important to consider what would be best for their futures (both in terms of family/career dynamics and financial security for their future needs). If it were a career that was either typically less stressful than his current job or on par benefits-wise, it would be a completely different story, but I don’t think he realizes the risks of what he is getting into.

I grew up in a household with a similar situation where one parent was in a financially secure job and decided to leave out of the blue years earlier than they should have left the position. They did this without approval from the other partner and did not have a strong back-up plan in place. It eventually killed my parents’ marriage and forced my entire family to make financial and eventually social sacrifices when we could no longer support our previous lifestyle and left some long-lasting emotional damage on my brother and I when the security we had previously had was pulled out from under us. OP’s kids are young enough to recover from a worst-case scenario at least, but it’s still worth considering.",1509494519

At which point the momentum of your car along with maybe bad tires or bad brakes means you cannot stop in time. I understand where you're coming from but at that speed it really is very hard to come to a complete and safe stop and I consider myself a decent driver.

I wouldn’t assume it isn’t load bearing though, I’d take the Sheetrock off the back side and make sure there isn’t a beam spanning the opening and sitting on the walls on either size. If you find a beam (lvl, 2x10, 2x12, etc.) I would either hire a contractor that works with a structural engineer or find a local engineer to come out and tell you for sure.

From High Plat to Masters, I had to carry harder in teamfights and play the heroes I am most effective with. For me those are warriors and solo laners. So I played (and now play) a lot of Muradin, Anub, Johanna, Malthael, Leoric, and so on.

My warrior / off-melee / melee assassin play is far better than my ranged assassin / support play, and at High Diamond - Masters it becomes very important to play your hero to high effectiveness.

Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions.

"DFO","t5_2s417","lib = Liberation weapon. Farmable through ancient dungeon dailies and eventually is guaranteed.

Terra = Terra: Reconstruction weapon. In the max level 90 area there is an NPC you can exchange purification stones for gear. Purification stones are farmed by doing the 90 special dungeon as well as a daily. 400 for the regular Reconstruction weapon and another 800 to upgrade it to Terra. The weapons and fish accessories are the only things worth it to get there but not on every character.

Epic = Epic gear. The highest grade available. You get them by doing Anton raid, Pandemonium Rift (special dunegeon has an epic drop change at the last boss), Heroic Anton (different and easier than raid for the most part), or by running Hell mode dungeons. Hell mode is forced onto any dungeon by using Demon Invities (or Demon Challenges after you convert them to invites). Each level area has a different cost, but you ONLY do them in the max level area. Anything besides that is a waste. Epic drops are random. WELCOME TO RNG.",1509494522

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","&gt; With the exception of a small number of surviving neocons and the occasional closeted Kristollite in the NYT, the overwhelming majority of Jewish leftists who support 'open borders' also do so for Israel. 

This is true, but when you look at the way our government responds to the incentives of Jewish ethnic activism, it ends up: supporting open borders form America, and supporting the exclusivist Israeli state to the point of pre-emptively declaring war on its geopolitical enemies.

Most Jewish-Americans aren't neoconservatives, but they've had an enormous effect on our recent history. 

Most neoconservatives are opposed to George Soros, but he's recently pouring *$18 billion* into into his [Open Society foundation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/george-soros-gives-18-billion-dollars-open-society-foundation).

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","I'm not saying he was or wasn't cheating but he pretty much doubled his previous year long ops over April, it's one thing to see a .200 increase and that's what I see as a player getting hot. He went up like .600-700 points on his ops. That doesn't just happen when a player gets hot. 

Billy Hamilton or Jabari Blash don't start putting up better than Babe Ruth level numbers when they get hot. It was a fundamental change and I don't think it's outlandish to have assumed that a player that was an extremely mediocre hitter 5 years ago then went overseas would be on something before realizing that he developed as a player over there instead of in the minors.

Pachydermata (from two Greek words παχύς pachys, ""thick"" and δερμα derma, ""skin"", meaning 'thick skin') is an obsolete order of mammals described by Gottlieb Storr, Georges Cuvier and others, at one time recognized by many systematists. Because it is polyphyletic, the order is no longer in use, but it is important in the history of systematics. Outside strict biological classification, the term ""pachyderm"" remains commonly used to describe elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses.

Cuvier's Pachydermata included the three families of mammals he called Proboscidiana, Pachydermata Ordinaria, and Solipedes, all herbivorous.

"MLBTheShow","t5_2tjde","Honestly, the biggest part of being a good hitter is being able to swing at good pitches. This is a skill that develops with time, pick a camera you are comfortable with and stick with it. If you constantly change your camera you're essentially making yourself better at a different task each time you hit  (the best camera is strike zone). The toughest games that I play are against guys who flat out don't chase. Here's some tips for discipline:

Learn the strike zone, learn to recognize pitches, DON'T SWING AT BALLS. The quickest way to screw yourself over on offense is to swing at pitches out of the zone. You will very rarely be rewarded for making contact on balls out of the zone regardless of timing or PCI placement. 

Get yourself into hitters counts where you know the pitcher is going to throw you a fastball. It is absolutely ok to take a breaking ball for a strike in a hitters count. Don't start being overly aggressive just because you're ahead. 

It's ok to take strikes. I'm not advocating taking the first pitch, I'm saying that it's ok to get fooled and just not swing. With how easy it is to put bat on ball in this game, taking a pitch that fools you is way better than hacking at it just because you might hit it. 

If your opponent is wild and throwing balls, let him walk you. If your opponent is throwing strikes every pitch, wait for something that you can handle and hit it. Just because your opponent is being aggressive in the zone doesn't mean you need to swing at every pitch they throw. There are more ways to score than hitting a 3 run homer or a double in the gap. Learn to manufacture runs here and there and the big inning will happen as your opponent gets frustrated. 

I know these tips sounds obvious, but these are the things that people will flat out stop doing when they get annoyed. I can't tell you how many times I've smoked a ball with a perfect swing, and then I'll swing at 2 bad pitches with my next two batters and end the inning.

"JoeRogan","t5_2s4tv","It doesn't help everyone though. Obviously it depends on the increase level and so on, but raising minimum wage can (and has) price low skilled workers out of the market and eliminate jobs (because employers won't pay the wage level for certain tasks if they think its too high). It also is an incentive for employers to cut their workforce to keep their payroll the same.

The problem is when you see a drop in employment or an average loss of income due to less hours etc. it is typically explained away by other factors by minimum wage advocates, and since minimum wage is good ""politics"", it's rarely challenged. Take the Seattle case, for example, which is gradually increasing its minimum wage to a goal of $15 an hour.

It's at $13 an hour now. Since it went to $13, two big studies came out on it, one from California that focused exclusively on the restaurant industry. It found that the minimum wage increase was mostly positive and that there was maybe a small loss of employment as a result. However, the University of Washington study, which was more broad, came to the conclusion that since the increase, lower paid workers have actually been paid less on average (less hours etc.). 

So how does the media handle this? Well, most gave more weight to the Cali study and those that did report on the Washington study tended to try to find any other economic factors to explain it away. I read one analysis from the New York Times a while back which claimed to consult ""minimum wage experts"" to explain it away, which made me laugh a little since minimum wage experts may as well be described as minimum wage advocates. 

Just google'd it found it: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/economy/seattle-minimum-wage.html

Obviously it's not very easy to measure, but it always seems to explained away as something other than raising the minimum wage. There's always ""other factors"" to blame when employment is hit or people's hours are slashed etc. 

It will be interesting to see what will happen with Seattle at $15 minimum wage over a period of a few years. ",1509494527

Title: **Grandfather's unclaimed property**

Original Post: 

&gt; My grandfather passed a while back, and I just noticed he has over 2 thousand dollars in unclaimed property. The only problem is both my mother and his wife live together and are heavy into prescription medication, so I'm pretty sure if I tell them then the money will go to no good use very soon. Is there anyway I can bypass them so that the rest of the family can handle this?

2. Even though Medivh's (same goes with Outland but fuck that server and its cash shop) back ported trinity-core is miles ahead of any TBC server out there, it doesn't have the pop NA times.
3. Medivh comes with Warmans reputation. That includes shitty CMs, shitty GMs, and shitty monetization practices that could pop up any day they decide to add a shop to Medivh.
4. Pop is dying on Medivh
5. Ares HAS the pop, but lets be serious here its just not a good server. I want it to be good. Everyone does as well. But it is just NOT.

Will ares improve over time? No one knows. Right now it just doesn't offer anything new to the table to the already sad state of TBC emulation.

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","I think that modern earth culture is a result of earth history. Even in earth cultures when communication was less developed, the technology didn't all rise at the same speed at the same time. Technology is developed based off of the values of urgency present in the culture; renaissance England had a vested interest in sea fare because of its island geography causing England to develop a better navy than landlocked European countries. So There aren't clear technological stages. 

Also, good stories are relatable. Even if, across the cosmos, there is a planet that happens to experience all the same technological chances at the same time so that there would be a tech level equivalent to modern day, why would a storyteller choose to set the story there rather than here?

This last question is, I think, the answer you're looking for. To not set the story in the most familiar setting of modern day, a good writer must have a feeling, meaning, or idea they are trying to communicate with the dissonance to us. What then, would be the difference between Planet Bob and Earth? How would this difference affect the story? If Planet Bob is the same as Earth in all but name, then just call it Earth and the audience will relate better.

&gt;The newfound anti-Kurdish line has made Erdoğan turn his back even on his one Kurdish ally, the president of the Kurdish Regional Government of Iraq, Massoud Barzani. 

I don't think that this can be wholly attributable to Erdoğan's anti-Kurd rhetoric.

I am pretty much the expert at most of our internal software, I've written half of it and literally know it inside and out. Anyone who knew me before respects me for this, asks for my advice, asks me questions, etc. It seems all the (male) developers who joined the company after I transitioned, so never knew me as male, won't ask me for advice and don't listen to me when I suggest things.

I also in my spare time run LAN parties and work networking/tech at large events. I've been tech lead on an event and had people working for me refuse to obey/listen to what I tell them to do, and only do it once the (male) MD of the company hiring us asked them to do it.",1509494540

P/B is one of the main signals I use, but I look at other things like growth rate, current ratio and DCF, etc. Although that said what signals you use  really depend on what kind of stocks you're looking to invest in. P/B and current ratio aren't always the most useful metrics, but I think they're great if you're looking for undervalued low-cap stocks to invest in like me.

Obviously I'll always do quite a bit of reading on companies before I invest in addition to looking at fundamentals, normally if a stock is undervalued it's for a good reason such a pending lawsuit or an uncertain future market.

"flatearth","t5_2v2qv","I think the answer for that would be ""Flat earth theory is a part of critical theory"". Just like modern feminism is too a part of it. 

Consider this, there's an object in front of us, you say it's red, I say it's green. So, to arrive at a conclusion and settle matters, we both measure the wavelength of color it emits, because our sense of sight can be at times flawed. But the wavelength value which we'll get from the wavelength measuring instrument will be right and that will be the acceptable evidence. 

So at the end, according to the instrument, the object is of color red. You are right, I am wrong. 

Now instead of accepting my mistake, I go on ranting that, wavelength of light is a hoax!!!!  It can't be proved!!! I am right, because I feel so !!! 

You realize whats happening????  When you make your claim, you have proper evidence by your side.  Whereas my whole case rests on an immature accusation, that I am right because you are wrong !!!! Now, in this case, would it be a good thing to give importance to the argument I'm making????? No. 

That's the thing with flat Earth theory, it only teaches you how globe earth is wrong, it will never teach you why flat Earth is right. In fact it has no answer for why flat Earth is right. 

And that's why it's a part of the Critical theory. 

Now, to give importance to flat Earth debates, and to the arguments, would only mean that we're actually putting flat Earth theory in a privileged position, right next to the globe earth, which it doesn't even deserve in the first place. That's why no one writes anything about it. ",1509494542

"news","t5_2qh3l","That is a massive oversimplification, this will sound preachy but bear with me and remember the OT is equally canonical for both Christianity and Islam, and the comparison between the two comes from them both being Abrahmic religions intrinsically related and being the largest faiths and cultures in the world today, that have begun to intermingle and clash 

Compare the ethics of the warlord Muhammad, who made his money off raiding caravans, and his forceful spread of Islam with that of the ascetic Jesus and the natural dissemination of Christianity you will see how easy it can be to normalize religious violence. There is a lot of scripture in the Medina Suras justifying conquest as a result of the history surrounding it's formation, whereas the New Testament is almost entirely concerned with appealing to the oppressed or lesser because that is who wrote it and tried to appeal to 

One such verse 
Quran (2:191-193) :""And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah [persecution,slander, very important and easy to reinterpret in modern power structures] is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.... And fight them until there is no more Fitnah and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)""

Quran (4:74): So let those fight in the cause of Allah who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter. And he who fights in the cause of Allah and is killed or achieves victory - We will bestow upon him a great reward.

There just isn't anything like this in the New Testament, so it becomes much harder to justify it, although it can be done obviously. There is a whole host of Hadiths that get twisted for the purpose of martyrdom, and act like the Gospel of Christianity in composition and purpose,but since they are not strictly canonical I won't go posting them 

So a lot of this comes from the odd equivalence of persecution (fitnah, idtihad ) and violence set forth unequivocally from Muhammad dictated by god. It can be fairly simple to twist modern discrimination into the same persecution poor Muhammad and his warriors faced from Meccans that drove them to Medina.

tldr Islam has a warrior culture so it is easier to justify religious violence than perhaps any monotheistic religion ever

One team could ban out all the main tanks, for example (Muradin, ETC, Anubarak, Garrosh, Diablo).  If they also got first pick, they could pick Johanna for themselves to further deny tanks from their opponents.  Then they could freely pick among the game's best tanks for themselves.  Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck with bruisers or wacky tanks like D.va.  

Or you could target ban all the burst healing and try to delete someone with a burst comp. 

That could be fine, of course.  The idea is to mix things up afterall.  It would lead to some wacky games though.  Which sounds fun to me.  I'm all for it.",1509494544

In my opinion it goes by pretty fast and loses alot of touches that I thought were nice and added to the story in the anime. Things like Trunks visitng Gohan in the present, His training session with Vegeta, Bulma being killed by Black, and Zamasu talking about how he killed ChiChi and Goten, Goku originally meeting Zamasu and fighting him in the present. That's not all but just an example of how a few of the changes make it feel less engaging.

Things can feel off putting . Zamasu suddenly has shadow clone jutsu near the end and out of nowhere Trunks is a healer. Latter seems kinda made for convenience while the former just caught me for a second.

Some changes in the manga are favorable. Cabba looks a bit more built and less like a string bean. The Battle Royal between the GoD was also nice (I like what they did in the anime too though).",1509494544

You tried to justify terrorist attacks against Yazidis. I'll remember what you said the next time Bengali Sunnis suffer retaliation for their terrorism.

The Myedu, Kamein and Hui are Sunni Muslims and citizens of Myanmar. The Hui Sunnis in Myanmar derogitarily call Indian Sunnis (all South Asian Sunnis in Myanmar) as Kala and refuse to marry their daughters to them and build separate Mosques to avoid praying with them and avoid listening to their preachers in Friday Prayer.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","When it comes to extracurricular stuff, a general rule of thumb is if you have a question of whether to include something or not, do it. Let adcoms make the determination of whether they care about something or not. If you put something that adcoms deem irrelevant, they'll just look over it and not care about it. No harm done. But if you leave something out, you run the risk of leaving something off that could make you more competitive. (Source: I work in admissions at a large university and I tell this to students all the time)

When it comes to high school stuff, this is where it gets a little more tricky. I'd say only put stuff that was completely life altering or relevant to the medical field. They probably don't want to know that you were the first chair bassoon player in your HS band. ",1509494548

You dont NEED to use LFG. That is my point. In Y1 of D1 people send messaged in tower. Some spammed invites but thats annoying as fuck dont do that. Type a message that says ""want to NF. Need 1. Looking for friends"" Send it to everyone in the tower then leave that tower and join a new one. Send the same message to everyone there ONCE then join a new tower. 

If you dont want to do that then use the LFG service just once twice or maybe three times. The issue with LFG is no one keeps playing with the people they meet there. They want to run a raid with randoms then never speak with them again. Next week they want to run a new raid with new randoms. WHY?! Why cant people run the raid with the same people they have already beat it with? Join LFG and FRIEND the people you beat the raid with them raid with them every time after. Its really easy to make friends that way.

If he never used his other name and it was mentioned on the radio, people might not make the connection that it was 'Tobi' and not Oluwatobi. 

Furthermore, Tobi isn't strictly a white person name. You just seem more upset that they didn't identify him as an immigrant than anything else. You even overlooked all the instances of them putting his name in the paper and on their site to the instance where they spelled his last name wrong and used that as 'evidence' they were 'white-washing' his name. You're still reaching. They use nicknames all the time when it comes to radio because that's how you identify people. 

I didn't listen to the broadcast of it so I can't say for sure, but the few times I've heard CBC announce stuff like this, they usually say the whole name at some point or will make a note of saying where they are originally from.

Yes, we should all continuously strive to be feminist, intersectional, and inclusive, but at the same time, we're human and make mistakes. As long as we learn from them, we're on the right track, and making these mistakes doesn't mean you're a ""bad feminist.""

"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","t5_3fmbm","Here are some nice tips:

When you get shot at, stay calm.

If you hear a shot in both your ears from one shot, as in the audio starts on one side and ends in the other ear, it is coming from your left or your right.

If you hear it in only one ear, it is coming from ahead or behind you. You will normally see dirt pop up in front of you if they are shooting from behind.

Normally if it is coming from your left and right, the ear that heard it first or the opposite side of the ear that heard it last is normally where it is coming from.

Watch for impact points on the ground and where the dust pops up.

The most important thing beyond staying calm when being shot at: Ignore the bullet sounds completely. The bullet sounds are an audio queue you are being shot at, not a directional locator typically. If someone is silenced or far away, use the tips above, otherwise keep reading.

The best thing you can do to find someone is listen for the pop.

Ignore the bullet sounds and listen for the pop, or the tat tat sound after the bullets.

This will tell you exactly where the enemies are.

Seriously. Listen for the pop. It's so important.

Our managers had every new member of staff set up a rewards card for themselves and then let the staff take the points for those that didn't have a card. If you were caught not asking customers for their card on every transaction then you were gone. But those that played fair got that added bonus.

Afterwards, I tried her costume on her, but it didn't seem to fit, so I rushed to Target. Got her a leopard costume in the next size up.

Manage to get her fed by a good time, even though dinner took a while longer than planned. Put her in the bigger costume. It was way too big and she was tripping. Tried the smaller one again and she just fit in! I think the problem was I tried arms first instead of legs first the first time.

She was super tired, because she hadn't napped. And confused by all the people and why are we going around all over the place. My husband ended up carrying her to a few of our neighbor's homes to say hi. And I gave away my spare cookies!

She was crazy overtired when we got home. Freaked out when we took the candy she was holding onto (she didn't want to/know she could eat it, she just wanted to hold it). And then I left her with husband while I sat on the porch with candy, and... hear I am!

I think the economic difference is an issue as well as it being a cultural shock if unification was to happen right away. I think if the kim regime ever collapses, south korea should help implement a democracy in north korea and help out as much as they can economically and culturally to advance north Korean society. But i believe this should be done with north korea being a different state first. South korea should implement some kind of 50-year plan for ultimate unification, because by then, we would hope north korea have closed the gap or at least close to it. 

But i reckon by that time, south koreans and North Koreans would not care whether unification happens or not since it will be a whole new generation.

The main point of my comment is that the loop is not a perfect simulation, the main example being the connection with other planes. They also have the soulkilled entities back in play, the marked people would evaluate risk differently, and they may also lose the brand when they exit the loop, which would open up other possibilities(can't think of anything helpful right now... maybe better relations with the Ghost Serpent).

&gt; HZ: It's in, twice.

&gt; JNH: Do your theme speech. Because I think it's really good.

&gt; HZ: It's something that occurred to me. I have a feeling that out there in the world, there are people waiting for James and me to ""come to our senses"" and stop this dark nonsense with the iconic two-note thing and write a happy jolly theme like the old Batman. You know, like the Danny Elfman one. It ain't gonna happen. Because this is not the world we're in. This is not the character we're doing. It's not the movies we're doing. They just need to get over that. For our Batman, it would just be wrong.

&gt; JNH: It would give you too much information about this character, which is not true. It would be misinformation. When you assign a heroic theme to something, some kind of a tune, you're giving away a lot of information that may or may not be true about this guy. We still don't really know who Batman is yet. Very complex, he's constantly evolving that character. He doesn't know who he is. We feel that it's much stronger to say less, musically, about him and let his character sort of speak for himself.

No. It depends on how they use their platform. Jenner has been willfully uninformed since day one and has used her platform to, among other things, outright legitimize transphobia towards trans women that don't pass.

&gt; My theory is, is that its about her wealth, privilege, and politics.

Her wealth is probably the reason that she is such a bad representative. She cares about that at the foremost. She's an ardent Republican, backing up Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. She doesn't meaningfully acknowledge how trans people are fucked over by society and given fewer chances or that its her party that is responsible for the majority of it. She is completely detached from the trans community because she's so wealthy that she is functionally invulnerable.

So now it's called Arkansas Nation. Each major city operates off some limited autonomy, and Kong-WalMart bought most of central Arkansas to form the their metroplex called the Allied Kong-WalMart Metroplex (everyone calls it Nu-Little Rock). If anyone wants the stuff I've built for it just let me know and I can put it somewhere. It's super fleshed out.

Short story is that Kong-WalMart is trying to get AAA status and thought, ""well if those other guys can do it so can we"". The problem is they had no real strategy other than to buy a large city. Their attempts at running the metroplex is basically a failure, as poverty is rampant and gangs run most of it. On top of that Arkansas left the CAS to escape all the corporate BS, so the Arkansas Federal Government is at odds with the AKWM. The WalMart owned Pinkerton security force keeps interfering with national police work and other mega corps are now taking an interest in this new nation as tension is at an all time high.

"StarWarsBattlefront","t5_2u9wz","Games are not inherently meant to be challenging. Look at the mario/kirby/lego games, they're fun but they're definitely not difficult. Games are an interactive medium, that's about the only thing connecting one game to the next. Multiplayer games also don't have to be challenging either. Battlefront (original) was never a super complex, adrenaline thrill ride of a shooter, it was a fairly basic but very competent shooter that had thematic classes and abilities and allowed you to point at someone and kill them. The newer EA releases (for all their gameplay design choices I don't necessarily agree with) are doing that in their own way. The point is, this is not your next MMO, this is not the next CS:GO, this is a game where you are supposed to play as your favourite star wars characters in your favourite star wars settings and everybody should be allowed to have fun doing that.

I have endless frustration playing against people who have far too much time than money and grind out to the highest level before I've had a chance to even unlock the first tier of upgrades. If DICE elected to release the ""shortcut"" unlocks from the Battlefield series, I would probably take them up on it in a heartbeat. I'm not saying that the paid lootbox system wasn't seriously flawed but microtransactions that allow someone to buy what they don't have time for is a perfectly acceptable decision if implemented correctly. I work full time and as such I only have a limited number of hours in a given week to play games. I don't want to play a game when I know one week into release I'm going to be stomped by people who were able to get to weapons/upgrades I won't access for a good month or so. I would much prefer that games came with everything out of the box, without endless leveling processes, but that isn't really an option these days. I definitely support the ability to pay to skip that process as long as it's not random, or available from day one.

Americans are far more racist than most libertarians think, and they will happily base their economic decisions on racism over rational self interest any day of the week.    ",1509494566

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","&gt; Tbh, this kind of shows you don't really know what you're talking about. The only reason users support the leggwork (re: verifying transactions and mining blocks) for blockchain technology is because of crypto. This is called ""cryptoeconomics"".

Part of the incentive for the use of the blockchain alone would be the security it would grant large financial institutions. The blockchain is the incentive, and I'm sure that they're willing, in return for the security, to make the necessary investment. Crypto is necessary for outright public adoption with no backing by larger groups who could take on the responsibility on their own.

I make no claims on my understanding of cryptocurrency as a whole, but I'm pretty damn sure that crypto and blockchain must always go hand in hand all the time always. I don't particularly care about the crypto part, just the power of a constantly-shared, rapidly updating ledger is valuable on its own.

&gt;You say you understand bitcoin from a cs level but blockchain without decentralization and cryptoeconomics is just a server or cloud service...

Permissioned blockchains are a thing, aren't they? Aren't they just as much a blockchain as any other? I brought up Ripple earlier, and AFAIK it's an example of a cryptocurrency that doesn't depend on mining. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt;You do know that you can buy things with it, right? Overstock.com accepts bitcoin (and a few other crypto) and while that is one example, there are more and more places that accept crypto. I can get paid in crypto, buy groceries, pay for rent, and exchange the rest for usd/euro/whatever. Ofc, this is not mass adoption but these kind of things take time.

And I'm sure that I can buy things with gold as well, but I don't. And just what percentage of those who own bitcoins buy something regularly, and not just as a one-off thing? Currencies need regular use. Sure, you can buy things, but it's not about the can. 

I get the point of cryptocurrencies as digital means of transferring capital, but they're simply not mature yet for use. I know I can't pay my rent with bitcoin yet, or buy groceries with Etherium. Partly because no vendor takes it, and also because if I actually had Bitcoin then I'd just sell it and stick to the almighty dollar. ",1509494567

The layman shouldn't use terms he can't distinguish, when they have entirely different legal and practical implications.

Yes, **it absolutely does matter that you aren't talking nonsense on this topic, it matters if you're an expert, it matters if you're a layman, it matters if you do it on the street, debating a Trumpster during a protest, it matters if you do it on social media, making an ass out of yourself and embarrassing this cause while doing so: if you get caught, and you will, you will damage the credibility of the case against Trump in the mind of both your opponents and any onlookers who might be on the fence.**

We can go over this several times more if you like, I don't care one whit if your father is a lawyer: the accusation that Trump is a treasonist is **completely and utterly without merit**. You can't simply waltz over this **fact** by handwaving it and trying to dictate what you deem is relevant, trying to excuse this idiotic error which makes anyone making the case for Trump's illegality look weak and uninformed.

"StarVStheForcesofEvil","t5_32uti","While *Star Comes to Earth* was good, it felt like the comedy, and the overall introduction of the characters was a bit too fast, therefore fast paced.  That is understandable though, trying to balance the dynamics of so many characters all at once with only a mere 11-minutes is difficult.

*Party with a Pony* was alright in terms of pacing, it gave an accurate representation of some of the dimensions and the types of people who inhabit them.  Although, logically, a lot of time was spent in the *Amethyst Arcade* than in the other areas, so that may be a small pacing error, (I think.)",1509494570

Horror, Thriller [[USA:R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings), 1 h 22 min]  
Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Quinn Lord, Lauren Lee Smith  
Director: Michael Dougherty

**IMDb rating:** [](#movieguide_stars)**&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;** **6.8**/10 (67,473 votes)

&gt; Five interwoven stories that occur on the same block, on the same night. A couple finds what happens when they blow a jack o' lantern out before midnight, a high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer, a college virgin might have met the right guy for her, a group of mean teens play a prank that they take too far, and a hermit is visited by a special trick or treater.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Despite only a handful of public screenings, the film has received critical acclaim. Based on 21 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall ""Fresh"" approval rating from critics of 86%, with an average score of 7\.4 out of 10 and a critical consensus that the ""deftly crafted tribute to Halloween legends, Trick 'r' Treat hits all the genre marks with gusto and old fashioned suspense."" Dread Central gave it 5 out of 5 stars, stating, ""Trick 'r Treat ranks alongside John Carpenter's Halloween as traditional October viewing and I can't imagine a single horror fan that won't fall head over heels in love with it."" The film earned 10 out of 10 from Ryan Rotten of ShockTilYouDrop.com. IGN called it a ""very well-crafted Halloween horror tribute"" and ""a scary blast"", rating it a score of 8 out of 10\. Bloody Disgusting ranked the film ninth in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', calling it ""so good that its lack of a theatrical release borders on the criminal.""

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","How the students are feeling can be a sensitive topic, so as far as their parents are concerned, I think it's safe to say that the parents don't identify with Japan.  They seriously identify with NK and the NK regime, and want their children to become like themselves.

One thing to note here is that this community is a minority among the Koreans living in Japan.

Using the numbers from Wikipedia, there are about 300,000 Zainichi today.  To this date, about 360,000 Koreans have naturalized and become Japanese citizens.  Among the 300,000 Zainichi, about 32,000 have the 'chosen' nationality, meaning not-affiliated-with-SK.  The number of students who attend the NK-affiliated schools (Chosen Gakkou) is estimated at about 6,400 as of 2015.

The majority of Korean parents let their children attend regular Japanese schools.  NK school is a choice with a clear purpose (there're also SK affiliated schools but their size is much smaller, like 1,000 students).

As for the last question, I think it is likely to get worse due to the NK situation and also frictions with SK.  The getting-worse part of this is mainly a reaction to what's been happening in N/S Korea, so I don't have any good ideas.

SK-affiliated organization Mindan has been protesting NK on the nuclear testing, and also issued statement on the comfort women statues.  Mindan has become actually forward-looking and has been trying to lessen the tension between Japan and N/S Korea imo.  This is good news.

As for Chongryon, I don't expect them to cave in as long as NK exists.

What dates things is the society’s view of it. Early 2000’s CGI doesn’t look dated because there are newer, better CGI in newer movies, but because the audience has determined that it looks older.

People love William’s theme, and still associate it with Superman as a property. Until the day comes when people start to see it as dated, it won’t be.

Self published, I don't see an issue. If the general public sees it as being unrealistic or insensitive, you may take a hit to your reputation. But if you use a pen name, I don't see any long lasting ill effects.

If you want to get an agent and get it published, there are additional concerns. The general climate in agency and publishing is very politically correct. The topic will need to be handled professionally, near-perfectly I would say. Perhaps a new pen name is wise in this case as well.

There's a fine line between brave and suicidal right now. Some firms are already advertising that they're primarily interested in female clients and perspectives. Just glancing at the agency databases, the manuscript wishlists, and what kind of projects are being greenlit at pitch events should give you some idea how tough it is.

What would increase your chances? I think changing the point of view to that of the daughter. That brings both the Young Adult market and the Female Perspectives market into play. Which, right now, is a massive shift in your favour.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","Sort of.

The main student director of Hillel on my campus lives at Chabad. (They have student apartments in their building.) Most people that come to Hillel go to Chabad as well. Chabad and Hillel both have Friday night dinners, and they're set at such a time that you could feasibly go to both in one night. They do coordinate events, and ΑΕΠ and ΣΑΜ go to both events (ΑΕΠ tends more toward Chabad, Sammy toward Hillel).

There are students that go to Hillel exclusively. I used to be one of those students. There aren't many, and even people look down on students who go to both, or go to exclusively Chabad.

But there are many adults that exclusively attend Hillel, and/or exclusively encourage their kids to go to Hillel and never Chabad. These adults run the synagogue I attend, and the one time I went to Chabad and told them about it, they looked shocked and insisted that I must never attend again. They are vocal about how much they dislike Chabad, and they view a lot of what Chabad does in the context of Hillel and they view anything Chabad does in the way of ""they are trying to steal kids away from Hillel!"" This phrase was actually said to me by our Shul Mom™ as she was giving me a ride back to campus and we passed Chabad. Chabad does do more outreach, more programs, and sends out more invitations to events to large groups like the fraternities. The Chabad rabbi walked around campus asking students if they're Jewish and want to shake the lulav and esrog this Sukkos. Chabad also has significantly more funding than Hillel.

There are also students that exclusively attend Chabad. Many of them do so because they are Orthodox and our Hillel is very Reform. But a significant number of them are not Orthodox, are not frum, but alienated from Hillel for one reason or another. One of them was the Hillel president last year. She quit and now attends and lives at Chabad, and is even friends with the rabbi's kid. I don't know why she quit, she's never told me; I do know that she was alienated from Hillel for some reason.

Our Hillel overall does not do a good job of supporting more observant students. Their Friday evening services are mostly English, and the last time I prayed there, a big donor to Hillel came and ""talked to me"" about praying in Hebrew and not sticking ""with the group"". Another student that attends both is getting some crap from other students about the fact that he is shomer shabbos, and told me about how one student came up to him, introduced herself, and went to shake his hand, he went to shake it back, but she pulled back, laughed, and said something along the lines of ""oh wait you can't touch me, I'm a woman"" in a mocking way. The friend that used to be on the board came to Hillel once, and after she had washed for hamotzi, students kept whispering about how terribly Orthodox of her not to talk until she actually made hamotzi. So there is bad blood on the sides of students towards Hillel. Also, this year, Hillel decided against doing High Holy Day Services, and encouraged some students to hand out anti-Israel pamphlets during Sukkos.

On the other hand, Chabad is very accepting of those things. It doesn't push anyone to do anything they are not ready to do. It is accepting of people who aren't Orthodox. Now, the official policy is that they are incorrect, but Chabad doesn't do anything about it, really. The community is very accepting of really anyone, and so is the Chabad rabbi. The services held there are much more my style, as well as the community. There is no judgment whether or not you want to do a certain mitzvah, whether or not you're frum, whether or not you converted through a different denomination. I even talked to the Chabad rabbi about being trans and Jewish. The Chabad rabbi is looking into the possibility of Orthodox conversion for me. He seems to think that it is certainly possible, and is talking to R. Chaim Rapoport about the possibility.

I will admit, I haven't been to Chabad nearly as long as Hillel, and haven't really experienced the inner politics, so Chabad may turn out to be really bad too. 

This is definitely a biased account lol. Long story short, yes and no, I like Chabad better.",1509494576

If he's willing to stay, he'll be our captain and best player for years to come once Brown retires in a few seasons.

Dembele is probably our other biggest talent but is far less likely to stay, Strikers of his pedigree at such a young age are demanded all over Europe and it's not as if he has the same connection to Celtic as Tierney. 

The other first team talents likely to stay for a few more years and develop are Simunovic (if he stays fit), Ntcham, Kouassi, and Ajer.

A lot of the 'older' players are still developing though, McGregor, Rogic and Armstrong have been great as of last season.

Anthony Ralston and Michael Johnston are youths currently in the mix for the first team, both are huge talents especially the latter.

For the far future, Karamoko Dembele is the biggest talent Celtic have had for decades alongside Kieran Tierney. If he keeps developing as he has over the last few years, he'll be one of the world's greatest players.

""Riot At Xavier's"" is a four-part storyline that ran from New X-Men #135-138 (2003). It was written by Grant Morrison and features artist Frank Quitely's last work on the title. The story centers on an original character of Morrison's, the teenage mutant Quentin Quire. According to Morrison, the storyline was inspired by a playground riot he witnessed in his youth.

"IreliaMains","t5_34n29","I'd say the main changes are, she went from an assassin diver to a fighter tank. You simply don't one shot squishies that easily, and you can't go AP anymore ( kinda wish she had good ap ratios on q and e while having the w one lowered ). New Poppy however, can peel for her team and has a much better early game.

Both could tank a lot, both have their iconic wall stun, both have their movespeed buffs, both are hard to kill late game, and both simply ""remove someone from the fight"". It was a pretty good rework in my opinion, but the playstyle is very different. You would play old Poppy full dmg, and your job was to delete enemy squishies yourself. You play new poppy as a tank, and your job is to peel your carries and tank the fight. Not saying new poppy doesnt do damage, it's just not as bursty as old poppy.

Old Poppy was basically ""do your best to not feed early game, farm all day to get items, one shot squishies with no counterplay late game"". we know poppy doesn't do that nowdays.

Anyway, makes me glad you guys are keeping her Q, since it's probably her most iconic feature. But hey, are you guys planning to keep full damage Irelia around? Most people go trinity into tank, but Irelia has fun damage builds, like full AD, full lethality, full AP and hybrid. I know it's kinda hard to keep all of those around, but I'd like to see some of them stay.",1509494581

"GGdiscussion","t5_3a3as","&gt; And every woman who's ever signed up to any sex or dating site is soliciting your dick pic spam, too, right?

Dating sites are usually structured, they have rules and such.  If you join a totally unmoderated, free for all hookup and dirty talk chat, and are surprised to see dick pics though...well that's a you problem.

&gt; Of course, we should be using some other term for involvement in sexual activity you don't like.

Perhaps we should be using a term that doesn't sound like being sent recordings of an actual rape, causing other users to assume you are alleging a crime was committed and suggest referring the matter to law enforcement.  Like ""rape FANTASY RP"".  Have you tried not being inflammatory?

&gt; Again, how is this not a justification for online harassment?

What makes harassment harassment, and thus illegal, is that you can't get the person to stop.  It follows you around and makes your life hell.  This causes psychological harm.  This is miles from that kind of situation.  Simply using your hearthstone ends the problem.  If a particular user continues looking for ways to follow you around, chasing you from zone to zone, switching to other characters after being /ignored, waiting for you to log back on, trying to figure out who your other characters are or how to contact you outside the game, etc, then it's harassment.  But what this article is describing is less harmful than someone camping you in a PVP zone, it's a non-issue.

&gt; Or randomly calling people up on the phone to tell them all your fantasies of raping and killing them. I mean they're ficticious fantasies, so it's all good! 

Random people, as in, people who did not join some sort of calling list about such fantasies, and thus did not solicit or volunteer themselves for hearing them.  Second obvious false equivalence in a single post.

&gt; Including following you around after you leave said chat and spamming you with content you've specifically asked them not to?

How far did they follow?  I mean if you actually want to leave a chat in WOW, running away on foot is hardly your best option.  Get on your flying mount, use your hearthstone or any other teleport item.  If you run away on foot, some people will interpret that as still playing along with the game and chase you.  This is true of PVP as well.  Honestly, why don't you go with that as a guideline?  Find an argument that doesn't describe normal world PVP if you substitute ""kill"" instead of ""rape"".

&gt; You're also consenting for porn sites to install adware that pops up all sorts of stuff you don't like all the time after you leave the site, too, yes? 

And we're up to false equivalence number three.  No, because that's not what a porn site claims to be doing.  A porn site claims to be providing you porn, but makes no promises you'll like all the porn you see.  That said, if you browse porn sites without an antivirus on....what were you *thinking*?",1509494581

I without a doubt just think you're making shit up for the sake of it, based on early footage, because if you've seen any recent gameplay, or have played the demo, thats completely made up.

Your other points are fair criticism, but the controls have 100% improved since the early demo builds.

If you think otherwise and are going off of old footage, I think you should check out the Japanese PS4 version.

Even people that have hated the game when they played the E3 builds have said the control of the characters have drastically changed for the better.

&gt;But if the price increases a bunch in the future - wouldn't that cause people to start converting it to other currencies? Therefore causing the economy to turn upside down?

We posted an updated today with several bug fixes, clarification on the tool tips, and the new Main Menu (with new music theme). We are currently overhauling the RTS system in preparation for Full Release. A preview of some of the new RTS features, such as the new Bunker model, are in this update.  We had some requests for clarification on the Tool Tips, which we did make.   The Hunter Mission to destroy the turret was confusing some people, so we made it clear that it had to be destroyed. The next update will include several new models, and a new map. The Biodome 24 Mission will be ready for release soon.  This map will be the last map we release for singleplayer before the full release on Steam.  During the time up until the full release, we will release hotfixes and patches at least once a month.  The custom key map system should be ready soon and will be part of a patch coming in November. The Full Release will have at least 4 singleplayer missions that can be played as either the IMI or Rebels.  Skirmish Mode will also be working for one vs one strat against the computer.   Multiplayer is currently in development and we plan on releasing it at the beginning of the 2nd quarter in 2018.

I never said other retailers were selling them for a loss but that they purchased them at $20 from Innova. I have not come across them for cheaper than that.  It is not uncommon for companies to sell something at cost to promote their business or in hopes of additional purchases and return business.  In the end 1010 was willing to lose $1.00 for my return business which they will get due to the awesome customer service. 

Here is their exact reply:

Thanks for your purchase! We have $20 into each of the Sexton Firebirds we've purchased. Innova wouldn't provide us retailers a discount on the USDGC Firebirds. We are curious how Infinite can charge less then the Innova Proshop does when we were told no dealer discounts? Anyway, maybe they are selling them at what they have into them in hopes the customers will buy some others. Most people don't realize dealers have to pay full price for the USDGC birds.  

We have $20pc into the Firebirds you purchased plus our shipping cost that is almost $5 with postage and the box cost. We are willing to take a $1 loss and match them. We beat Infinite Discs in overall pricing, so be sure to check back with us for any other disc needs you have. We have finished adding pictures of most of the discs we have in stock as well.

Phlebotomy is definitely going to be part of your life, especially at a smaller hospital as you say. It's just a matter of practice, though. It is very awkward at first, but when you get used to it, it gets progressively easier. After a point, you stop looking at hard sticks as a bad thing, but welcome the challenge instead.

"oculus","t5_2uni5","&gt;No one is criticising Sony or Nintendo for having exclusives on their systems.

They get plenty of criticism from PC gamers. I don't enjoy buying a crappier version of a PC for a couple of exclusives every few years. I like what Nintendo have done with the Switch though. They offer a portable system that is actually useful even if you own a PC or another console. Nintendo also tend to focus on games that are fun to play with real people in front of a TV. I'd love for their games to be available on the PC too though.

&gt;What do you guys and gals think? Can the rift survive for upwards of 4 years between refreshes like a traditional console generation?

It definitely seems to be the way they want to go. Oculus get a lot of crap for exclusives because it brings a lot of the negatives of console gaming to the PC platform. It's a questionable strategy too because the games aren't even exclusive and likely will never be as long as they stick to the PC platform.

I personally believe they're going to focus on their own platform in the future (Oculus GO, Santa Cruz and beyond) and either keep their PCVR presence (for their enthusiast/flagship hardware) or drop out of it completely.",1509494586

Also, you have to define what ""reasonably defending themselves"" actually means. In this scenario, if the cops see the guy with the gun before the guy with the knife, what do they do?

Hard Mode has always been a significantly harder raid with higher level loot drops and so on.  That is why they called this Prestige Mode, because it is something completely different, so don't try to be clever.

Destiny is in the worst place it has ever been.  I know that might be upsetting for you, but just look at how this place has been, how the player numbers have fallen off a cliff far faster than Destiny 1 or anyone expected, how LFG sites are remote compared to Destiny at any stage.

That said, a few elements of composition are fighting each other. The frame of the gas pump handle creates a frame within your frame and draws the eye back to the light post. This is a great effect, however, based on your title, I think you want me to spend more time looking at the pump than the light. The other strong point in the photo is the print ""made in the usa."" Having it parallel, and at the same level as the light, causes me to look back and forth between them a lot. This by itself is good, it creates energy in the shot. But having them stacked so closely together, and occupying largely the same space discourages me from using that motion to examine the rest of the photo.

2). I've been full-time and part-time while at Starbucks and it's been manageable for both periods. Of course I cut back on my work hours when I was full-time. Don't let work take a priority over school.

3.) I applied online, got a call back within maybe a week. I had one interview and got hired at the end of it. I was allowed to start working a few weeks later, since I wanted to finish my 2 weeks at my previous job.

The volume was only about 10% higher than on deadline day 2015 and that was 4 days after the televised debates, not 3 hours. That's hardly too ""exceptional"". Regardless of if the rumour was to re-register they were still highlighting the need to register to a young pro-remain demographic for the entirety of the campaign on the off chance it might help them crash the website for the last 3 hours of the registration period, even though they already have botnets that are capable of crashing it.

Seriously, it's impossible to say what it is just from a picture - both sprains and fractures can swell impressively or moderately. It could be sprained and an x-ray would be superfluous. Usually, a distorsion can be treated with rest, elevating, cooling etc., but considering that you had a previous injury and feel like it resembles the past nerve involvement, I see why you're worried. After all it could also be something worse than a sprain, and getting checked out is the safer choice. 

In the end, it is your health, and excluding a fracture isn't unreasonable. I would personally at least see the doc and get a manual examination, but I'm from a country where people don't have to worry about the costs of a doctor's visit (even a privately paid cash visit for examination and ankle x-ray cost me around 75 Euro a couple of years ago), so my viewpoint may be different from yours.

As long as you can walk and are stable, waiting would be fine assuming you don't put extraordinary stress on your foot. The trembling and motility issue could be related to local swelling and might be temporary, but again, no way of telling for sure without examining and at least doing an ultrasound (some orthopedics do that).

"tf2","t5_2qka0","&gt;Why is anybody going to watch an old game where players are competing for pizza and haribo,

Don't know. Why does WarCraft 3 have a bigger competitive scene than TF2 even though it's from 2002?

&gt;I honestly cannot fathom how you find both StarCraft and DotA2 easier to watch over a game that focuses it's gameplay around medics and choke points. 

Nice minimalism of two entire genres for the sake of a strawman argument.

&gt;Otherwise it follows exactly the same principle as CSGO with the bomb and choke points,

Come on man you don't have to treat me like an idiot. TF2 is not a game where every match is decided by two sequences of ~20 seconds of actions after ~1:20-1:40 minutes of waiting. You are *COMPLETELY* ignoring the entire aspect of pacing in gameplay. Please, at least pretend that you know what pacing is for the sake of the conversation.

&gt; there's an entire map in DotA2 with jungles and lanes and bushes and shops and items and ultimates and gold and waves and...

""He's farming the enemies for gold and experience or holding/pushing a line towards the his/their base."" Just described 99% of DOTA in less than it took you to explain just Uber.

&gt;I don't think you really understand the reasons why TF2 isn't watched

(Okay, I won't actually assign you homework, even though it's a good book especially if you like 19th century British lit.)

But I bring it up because one of the central stories in the book is between a young, intelligent woman and an older man who is a respected academic. A big part of her attraction to him his how much she respects his intelligence, and looks up to him, and thinks he's a perfect gentlemen and role model and overall aspirational figure.

On his part, he's very flattered by the attentions of this younger, attractive woman, and while he deems her intelligent and mature enough to not be a *bad* match for someone of his stature, he sees her as more of a blank slate and sounding board for himself than as a person on her own, with her own ideas. Their relationship eventually becomes strained because as she grows and develops her own opinions that aren't directly related to those that he's instilled in her, they both wonder what they got themselves into: her because she wanted a partner who would participate in an *exchange* of ideas with her, and him because he had valued having an acolyte and didn't like being questioned and challenged.

I'm not saying that is the inevitable path your relationship will take, but I see this dynamic in your comment. It's not even that your guy is a *bad guy*, but here, you don't come off like -- even from your perspective -- that you see yourself as his equal; it's more like he's a father figure. That's an unbalanced dynamic and one of the things that people talk about when they talk about power differentials and life experience. It starts in small ways, by him having a bunch of degrees and being impressive with his knowledge and educational experience, but that easily lends itself toward him being able to ""instruct"" you in other, less innocuous ways, because you're already used to him ""knowing better than you.""",1509494598

I’ve been wearing mine for about a year rotating once per week.

As to integration and communication etc., I think you just have to go ahead and start writing the thing and see where you wind up.

The real discipline anyway comes in refactoring the code after you have got it working. So get it working first, then after it have it working, try to have it working ""right"", if that makes sense.

Not that I do that myself of course. Although every once in a while when I either summon the willpower or (more usually)  have no choice but to refactor something I do find it immensely satisfying.

All the tips people gave you are pretty much it.

I'll also add to the list regarding your glory points. You're a new player so your best bet is to keep a weak Arena Defense and pretty much just farm the lower ranks. Every week you want to spend your glory points on devilmon. From what I can see in your box, Hwa is good for devilmon right off the bat. Also, considering you don't have a Veromos yet, I'd suggest you leave a couple slots on your friends list to add people who have the secret dungeons. Of course being low level isn't going to help, but you might get lucky. 

The next investment in glory points is increasing your energy storage and refresh rate. Many people choose different ways to go about this, but I personally say to get max energy (90) asap and then work on refresh rate.",1509494603

Exactly, even if every american would save $5 per year if we just killed everyone on death row in what moral universe do we decide who to kill based on how much its gonna save us.

It's also dumb to consider the fiscal impact here because paying to house your prisoners (the ones who really need to be there) is a non-negotiable cost of living in a civilized society. You think grade school should be personally funded? Fire fighters, libraries, and roads? Those are at least on the table. Prison isn't. We all need it to exist and if we were really worried about the cost maybe take a public health approach to drug addiction and implement programs known to reduce recidivism. 

It's depressing to me when people throw out that tired argument that we should kill criminals because it's cheaper. It's wrong on every conceivable level (factually, ethically) and I'm sad that people who put so little thought and intelligence into such an important issue are smart enough to find a voting booth.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It sounds a lot to me like she's financially insecure – if you say she's planning on going back to work in a couple of years, I'm assuming that means she'll have been out of the workforce for a decade? The last time she worked was when she was 25? That's terrifying for me. That means that since she was 25 she's relied on her husband for money.

I guess for me (although I don't ever plan on being a long-term SAHM) my big anxiety in this situation would be that being financially reliant on one person makes you incredibly vulnerable. Not that I'm saying you ever would, but if you decided to up and leave one day she'd be screwed, at least until after a potentially lengthy and expensive legal battle to sort out alimony/child support. That's a very very vulnerable position to be in.

Also, possibly, there's a feeling of inadequacy. Society is incredibly two-faced about SAHM, in that they're half viewed as women doing what's best for their children (and working mothers are callous harpies), half viewed as idiots leeching off their husbands. Maybe her refusal to spend more money than absolutely necessary is her way of going 'Look, I'm *not* leeching off my husband'. Kind of a way of maintaining some form of independence?

I don't know what the answer is, but have you spoken to her about maybe getting a part-time job before going back full-time in a few years? Have you talked about working from home options? I really think a lot of this is coming from a place of not having her own independent income.

**EDIT:** Also with the car and the phone, maybe it's about having some things that are *hers*. You're currently the one paying off the mortgage – she feels like she didn't earn that money, so therefore it isn't *hers*, so therefore the house feels like it isn't *hers*. 'Your' money pays for the kids schools, pays for food, electricity, clothing, heat etc. etc. etc. – what's *hers* in this house? *She* paid for *her* car. When she bought her shitty phone, did she maybe use money she had saved from before quitting work? Could that be the reason she's particularly attached to *her* phone?

You see getting a new phone and car as simply upgrading her phone and car to better models, but I bet for her this is losing ownership over two of the few things in her life that are undeniably *hers* at the moment – not hers and her husband's, not for her kids as well, but just *hers*. 

You say she definitely doesn't want to go back to work at the moment but your youngest is nearly in school. The longer she's out of work, the harder it's going to be for her to get back into it. Are you perhaps a bit resistant to the idea of her returning to work? If you said to her that *you* wanted her to go back to work (even part-time) once your youngest was in school, do you think she'd maybe be more likely to want to go back? Everything here about her actions screams someone who feels uncomfortable, vulnerable, and bored being a SAHM, I really really think having a job outside the home and an independent income is the solution.",1509494605

"OldSchoolCoolNSFW","t5_2u0bt","You don't necessarily need a large sample size to extrapolate. I've been at nude beaches, nude resorts and German saunas where there are fairly ""normal"" people with different body types. The trouble is that I wasn't around 30 years ago, so I can't compare based on a similar selection of people. However, there are lots of old pictures of nudists, back then I guess they weren't as scared of their pictures getting around and being shamed for it. Pointy breasts are not that rare in those pictures.

  Of course, I'm not a specialist of breast shapes, and did not conduct studies on the topic. However there is evidence (girls reaching earlier puberty) of hormonal changes over time, so I was suggesting a potential cause for breasts being different.

  I may be all wrong, but as you pointed out, the linked article doesn't provide any compelling evidence either, and is mostly a hypothesis based on what is fashionable. However, given that there are so many pictures of nude women online, where are all the ones with pointy breasts? Are they hiding due to their boobs not being fashionable?

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Safe words? BDSM? Aftercare?

What the hell reddit... Dude, you can still be respectful while you are being dominant. You are already dominant when you are on top of her or she is facing away from you (doggystyle, missionairy, etc). You can even be dominant by telling her to get on top of you and show her how she should move on top of you to make it feel good for you (and her). Our safe word is just ""stop"", ""wait"" or anything else that is commonly interpreted as stopping with what you are doing. Aftercare? We just cuddle up, smile like the happiest idiots and make her feel loved.

Dominance is basically nothing different than leading. What my girlfriend considers dominant is when I go to her, start massaging her neck, keep going from there if she is receptive, then see her typical ""You're making me horny"" look, so I start taking off her clothes, then slow down when she's starting to get really into it to tease her. Then I just get her naked, get on top of her and she's just begging for it while I fool around a bit. I tell her to turn around, or to move to the right, to keep it up like this or slower or faster. Otherwise I just hold her, go my own pace and see how she reacts vocally, verbally and my expression. Sometimes when she is on top of me I just wrap my arms around her body and arms so she can't do much and I do all the work as I like it.

Ofcourse I got to know her over the last weeks, so I know what she likes and what she doesn't, but the main point is that I know how to give her a good time while doing what she likes and I like aswell. She likes doggystyle, pronebone and cowgirl where she lies on top of me and I grab her around her body and arms. Then all I do is to just let my lust over her take over, make her feel how hot I think she is by fucking like animals.

There is nothing disrespectful or dehumanizing about that. We are each others hot piece of meat during sex, but we love each other after we are done, because she is the one that wants me to fuck her ballsdeep and hard, to be told what to do and how I like it, and I just do exactly that. At the end of it, she's the one shaking from her orgasm with the biggest grin on her face because I gave her what she wanted and I did whatever I wanted.

&gt; Or at least, I was assuming that your blocking-off radical improvements via artificial intelligence meant you were imposing the rule that AI mostly does not work, while also constraining away the scenario where AI works but works really harmfully.

I do think it is quite possible that technological improvements are a primary way, perhaps the only way, in the span of 100 years, to get major socio-political improvements. So I didn't really intend a pessimistic assumption about the state of technology; rather, I was just trying to focus on what would be a relatively ideal socio-political situation without relying on e.g. AI to fix it for us (but if you have ideas about better socio-political situations that AI or other tech could make possible, I'm interested to hear; in my ideal future scenario, for example, cryptocurrencies have made government control of money effectively impossible and embryo selection has made big chunks of population smarter and less conflict-prone than they would have been).

Depending on your tolerance level for heat, you can kind of get used to the heat. I know I have. You just sweat a lot, it can be difficult to breathe, especially when you're using a bicycle to commute, and your car gets toasting hot, but with tinted windows, steering wheel covers, and such, it's not an issue. Because of the heat, you pretty much avoid the dead middle of the day and go out at night. Yes, you're still breathing hair dryer air, but when it dips below 100 F, it's just OK. It's not more than 3 months -- I consider it the Southern's ""Winter"". That means you can definitely do outdoorsy stuff 9 months out of the year.

The Strip is honestly pretty nice, very clean, with tons of things to check out and explore. It's huge. Downtown as well (although very quiet in comparison). It's safe. But yes, when you go off the Strip, you're inviting trouble.

If we can consider Henderson as well, I would say Green Valley Ranch is also a very nice part of the Valley area. I live there and honestly wouldn't trade it up for anything else. The community rocks and it's super clean.

People are generally very nice here. People drive better here than most cities I've been to and lived in (i.e., Miami). People are conversational but I can tell that once that conversation is over, it's over. No follow up or interest to maintain contact. And that's understandable, especially if one has family already.

It's affordable to live here, at least when it comes to housing and food. But eating out is costly. My savings diminish quickly when I indiscriminately eat out. It sucks. But man, the food is just so good.",1509494610

The SECOND I see teams even coming close to SKT/SSG/Whoever's level of mid to late game prowess ON AN EVEN level I will agree that the gap is closing.

MSF and RNG did a great job at snowballing the early games against SKT, which is where SKT have struggled pretty much in all of their existence (and all Korean teams, for the most part) but none of these teams look even close to their level in mid-late game.

&gt;where the fuck does this narrative come from that teams are trying to copy Korea???

This is one of the funniest narratives ever imo. Korean teams don't even have the same ""style"". LZ and SKT play is like day and night. So is KT's and SSG's. 

CLG brought the ranged support meta and SKT adapted - and made it better.

MSF brought out Leona/Blitz and double fervor - SKT adapted and did it better.

That's their ""style"". They play what they play - and if there's something they struggle against they will take it from you and improve it.",1509494610

When you count a lot of the common combos (or even 5-cost cards) that already exist, it's not necessarily difficult to see a situation in which you could activate this on 8.

Keep in mind, you don't *have* to activate this on 8, either. I suppose I was a little too harsh on the activation condition before- it isn't necessarily difficult to activate, just... kinda up to the luck of what cards you draw. And if you're drawing well enough to curve out nicely, congrats, you get a cherry on top with a discounted legendary.

If you're not, though, this card is just a 7/7 for 8 that you'd probably rather replace with another high-value legendary like The Lich King.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't like that the upside only actually happens if you're already having good turns.

TF2 is a warzone in pub play. Take any iconic choke like badwater 1st's hallway to 2nd. At any given moment there are rockets and grenades flying through, Snipers picking people off, Blu likely has a level 3 watching the corner with a dispenser healing a bunch of people while Red has multiple sentries up on roof and on the floor attempting to block Blu, Pyros are spraying flames to spycheck, there's a lot of death, destruction, and yelling. 

Competitive on the other hand is quiet. There's spurts of action and an occasional scattergun pop or two on flank but overall it's very quiet. This fits fine for a sport-like setup but I don't really play pubs to play TF2 like a sport, I play it to play a war simulator. That's not even going into the toxic nature of lower playercount games and how unforgiving they are inherently and indirectly how unforgiving they make it's community.

Pos | Name
---|---
QB | R. Wilson / K. Cousins
WR | C. Hogan / T. Hill / D. Parker / S. Shepard / C. Kupp
RB | E. Elliott / M. Gordon / L. McCoy / J. White
TE | T. Kelce / O.J. Howard
K | Butker
DST | Cheifs / Steelers

I'm 7-1 in my league, 1st place, ~950 total points which is 200 above anyone else in the league.   
  

I'm in a great place so far, but with Gordon, Hogan, and now Elliott out this week I'm worried as fuck. Next week I lose Kelce/Hill too so it's looking rough out there. I have no clue what to do with my Bench. I don't have enough RBs to actually field a team, and since I'm 1st in a league I'm not getting any good waiver adds. Trying to pick up Darkwa but I have no idea if I'll be able to snag that. Here's what I'm thinking my lineup will be right now:

Pos | Name
---|---
QB | R. Wilson
WR | T. Hill
WR | D. Parker
RB | L. McCoy
RB | ~Waiver Add (Darkwa?)~
FLEX | C. Kupp / ~Waivers~
TE | T. Kelce
K | Butker
DST | ~Waiver Add (Texans/Rams/Wed. AM Drops)

Doesn't look like a great week. Some good matchups but I'm incredibly reliant on the Chiefs having a solid game and McCoy taking advantage of his matchup. Is there any RB2/3 tier player I could target for trade/waiver adds that has a stable matchup just for this week? Not sure what move to make here.",1509494613

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Those are the household names, so yes absolutely. They're very accessible. I read them as an undergraduate, but, as I said earlier, I had to go to other departments. 

Literally all of the Islamic thinkers have been translated for centuries now, and in fact some of the translations have been in circulation for so long as to have directly influenced European philosophy. The writings of ibn Rushd, for example, were not only translated into Latin, but were fundamental in the development of European scholasticism, so much so that a school of philosophy retrospectively called Averroism formed (ibn Rushd is latinized as Averroes.) The same goes for ibn Sina (latin: Avicenna), some of whose works were translated into Latin within 50 years of their publication, and were widely circulated throughout medieval universities. al Farabi's works were translated by 1200. ibn Khaldun's work had been translated fully by the mid-1800s, and his works were studied extensively in Europe throughout the century. Khayyam was also available and studied in European institutions by this time, and I believe translations of ibn Zafar's work were also made available by then too. 

Of course, we've come a long time since then. Translators are much better now. Each author has multiple modern, at least partial, translations in multiple languages, because, again, these are household names.

Chinese works have a more recent history of translation, but nonetheless accessibility is not an issue. The Xunzi has been translated into English since the early 1900s, and has had multiple new translations since then (the most recent being in 2014.) The same goes for the Han Feizi and the Mozi.

Charles Clay is out of the picture for at least a few more weeks too. With that being said, TyGod gets a bump because he has a better weapon and he's even more versatile now. Jimmy G gets a boost because he's actually playing, but I don't think I'd invest in him as a fantasy asset. I think Garcon gets a boost too because he has a better QB able to get him the ball. Hyde should do better too now that teams can't stack the box against him and Jimmy can dump off to him more often. Not to mention the Seahawks upgraded their O-line and Wilson should be protected longer to make more accurate throws. I wouldn't touch anyone in that backfield for the time being though - they're all just so bad.

Heh, no, his memories were complete enough.  The first time you can chalk up to disbelief, but not the second, and *definitely* not the third fucking time.

- You could ask your team commander to not be a fucking twat, and call commands and cadence like he/she is supposed to during practice.

- March at home, in your back yard, or really wherever as long as you don't care what people think. Cadence should be 120 steps per minute, so if you have a metronome, Youtube, or any way of finding one online, you're good. Mark-time and 12-inch-steps.

- Step off INSTANTLY when you hear forward march

I know that as a shooter, I can hit sub MOA repeatedly. With that info, you can apply it to another rifle. For my rifles, it they don’t shoot MOA, I can guarantee they aren’t an MOA gun, because I can grab another rifle and lay down MOA or better on command. 

So, be sure you have a gun that can measure your baseline levels. From there, a sub MOA ar is really just a good barrel and trigger with good ammo. My DD 16” mid government is a MOA/barely below MOA gun with any match ammo. ",1509494618

Did they consciously decide to make that platform a safe spot surrounded by death on all sides, and only accessible after a transition from low to mid tide? Probably not.

Now, would it be better if the basket was low enough to kill anyone standing on it in mid-tide? Probably, yeah. Or they could add a special kill trigger there if for some reason they can't simply lower it, but that can have its own problems.",1509494619

Congrats. Your prize is a comment like. 

&gt;There's also a large part of the population that aren't sure how to take you when you lead with humour

True. It's usually the older generation who don't like innuendos or strict religious people who find it offensive. Although, some others just find it uncomfortable to talk about. As you said, you got to know the person as people have different tastes. Yeah, you're right and there is a line. That would not be a good idea and you might even lose a friend doing it. 

&gt;I think there are a lot of us out there that are just missing the right person due to circumstance or them being outside of our area,

That is so true. It's so hard to get over it though. So many people think that now is the best things are going to get and procrastinate even the things they desire the most. Even knowing that, I still do that all the time. Maybe it's the fear of failure. I get my good days and bad days too. Today's been pretty good though. Also, what about dating sites. What would you like someone to say to you when they first meet you(apart from the size of their banana lol)

In low Earth orbit, the Hill sphere of any object (orbiting Earth) is smaller than the radius of the object itself. As an example, with the mass of the ISS the Hill sphere radius is about a meter. You would need ~20 times the density of lead or something like that to get orbits around objects in low Earth orbit.",1509494622

If the ""angry women"" poster comes back to read replies I would like to refer them to the time it was investigated in Britain, they included domestic assault and out of 117k cases 159 were provably false accusations. 5651 of the 117k cases were regarding rape so even if all 159 false accusations were for rape it would result in just 2.8% of cases. Also 8% of the false allegations were made by or on behalf of men, so were they ""angry men""?

I've had to remove your post because it counts as spam – see our Rule 4 “Don’t spam your blog, your product, your anything”.

A good measure of thumb is that 90% of your posts should be regular contribution, while no more than 10% is geared towards self-promotion. This does not appear to be the case with your account.

We'd like the users of our sub to be helpful and contribute to the discussion – not use the sub as a place for free publicity. That's why the 9:1 rule has been put in place. While I'm sure your intentions are good, and you probably weren't aware of this rule,  I'm asking you to be mindful of it in future. 

If you keep linking to or mentioning your site without participating in the sub as a normal user, we will have to ban you from participating in this subreddit.


In addition, our [spam policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_4._blogs_and_self_promotion.3A_don.2019t_spam_your_blog.2C_your_product.2C_your_anything.) also covers usernames. Your username can only contain your blog name if you make it clear that you're a redditor first, blogger second - and your account doesn't fit this requirement.

So if you want to continue posting on this subreddit you can, but you need to make a new account with a username that isn't related to your blog, and you need to abide by our 9:1 rule when sharing your own content.

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_4._blogs_and_self_promotion.3A_don.2019t_spam_your_blog.2C_your_product.2C_your_anything.). ",1509494624

But there's also users that have accounts that have no posts/comments for months and years, that suddenly went active in the last 2-3 weeks.

Basically, look for older accounts, put them through that website and look at the ""data available from"" date, that's when they made their first post or comment. Like this guy, his account is over 3 years old, but he didn't post until 14 months ago, and became a regular here and other subs https://snoopsnoo.com/u/Allinon72

Also pay close attention to the longest period between two consecutive posts, several I've found have gaps of 2-4 hours, which implies they don't sleep, over a long period of time. That guy didn't fail that aspect, that's why I didn't call him out.

But there's definitely a pattern of posts that are artificially upvoted to the front page.. if I could filter to only see posts that reach the 100-500 upvote range over the past 4 weeks, look at the most frequently occurring names, I think you'd find a pattern pretty quick.",1509494624

Excellent presentation, logical order and smooth transition of topics, high quality production and visuals, great voice work, and those explanations you provided are very easy to understand. No offense but I believe part of the reason it's so effective is that you aren't visibly in it, and you don't talk about price predictions, unlike most other YouTube crypto reviews. I see in comments someone on the Walton team is trying to get this added to the official twitter, which is really awesome. Even though I didn't learn anything new from the video, it really was a pleasure to watch and I will be sharing this some of my friends that are crypto noobs.

I really hope you do a more in depth video about things like the purpose of parent/child chains, how one company's data is still secure form another competitor's that also uses Walton, why the need for a coin, payments included in the chain, other other use cases for the Walton blockchain like temperature checks, small movements on the sales floor to see how many pick it up and try it on, etc. Maybe even a more in depth comparison of competitors and what makes them different could be a whole separate video. 

Keep up the great work man! Cheers!",1509494626

Often because it's just a wildly inappropriate thing your brain is doing which the medication settles. Anecdotally these people seem to get better much quicker.

I think the problem is because depression might have a lot of factors interwoven into it. Social stuff, alcohol abuse, chronic pain, bereavement, other conditions like PTSD so on.

I think bigger, badder boss battles always leave a little to be desired, that someone of a similar size as you but who is very fast, very precise, extremely defensive, unpredictable, etc. is a far more intimidating, challenging and interesting boss battle than the two+ story tall monster with very clear movement patterns.

As an aside, I also dislike when games, after completing them, drop you back into the world *before* the final boss fight. I find it unsatisfying. The game's world having an end state, especially in open world games, can offer a sense of closure and completion. Not being able to run around in a Ganon-free world is like having an itch that can't be scratched. Like, let us see what that world looks like, give us some extra quests, and see what Zelda is up to (and maybe even play as her) and how her and everyone else is moving on.  ",1509494626

Every single drug user can/will/has done something dumb because as a society we are not fully educated about these substances. We can practice harm reduction all we want but the fact of the matter is, because of their illegality and stigma, there just isn’t enough info out there and we end up being the guinea pigs. 

Adam makes a point to share his experiences but always says things like “Don’t do anything just because you saw it in a YouTube video” and “This is a story from my past, I’d never do this now” or “This was fucking stupid of me to do, don’t ever do this”.

While I feel BUNGIE has made questionable design decisions in past (both years ago and now) I cannot for the life of me understand why they would go the route of making one of the big selling points of a DLC either not on the location that is coming with it or tie it to another Raid.

Some of said questionable design decisions in the past and present I could *kinda* understand when thinking about and analyzing them. However, putting new Raid content behind an already existing Raid seems very strange and intuitive to me.

Of course, I'd be cool with them adding new areas to Leviathan perhaps in the future but considering this expansion is about Osiris and the Vex...putting that content in the Leviathan feels like shoehorning and irrelevant to that raid and what it's about.

I'm pretty busy and do homework pretty much all the time but I can do all work and study and still sleep 10 hours a day if I don't slack off (take off days, etc.). I haven't taken 313 yet, but from what I've heard, you don't need to spend that much time for that class (unless you're average/not good at math and need to spend a significant amount of time studying). For PHYS 214/213 (I took it last semester), you should be able to get by with less than 10 hours per week of time outside of class assuming you don't need to spend a lot of time studying. CS225 is a pretty big timesink (around 15 hours per week for MPs and labs) and ECE 385 is even more so, around 25 hours per week. Honestly though, how much time you need to spend on class depends on how smart you are. If you're really smart, you could probably cut my times by half.  Ultimately, it's on you to gauge how much you think you will be able to handle. Hope this helps.

What are you talking about? Most of the acid I have done has been done now or within the past few years. Where are you even getting this?

=

&gt;Drugs are FAR more refined now.

When it comes to chemistry, there is far less to improve. LSD made in the 70's is easily among the best acid ever made. Not saying its the best, but if you act like the stuff back then was shit and we have the best acid EVAR you are an idiot. 
 


=

Look how strong weed is now compared to then, just weed, then look at the purities on todays meth compared to 80's 

The more you use weed as a comparison, the more you show how little you know.

**Marijuana is not comparable. It is a plant that has benefited from selective breeding. Comparing it to CHEMISTRY is insane. Please stop.**



=

&gt;You have no idea how fuckin stupid you look to me right now cracking on like in 50 years NO ONE has managed to make good acid.

That isn't what I said. Ever. Please stop misrepresenting my argument and learn how to read. 


=

&gt;Drugs are made in fuckin factories by fucking chemists with A grade equipment now, 

So back in the 70's they didn't have access to grade A equipment? Are you fucking joking? They had even easier access to this shit back then. 


=

&gt;man you dont know shit, just another neverwasbeen living vicariously through google.

Si las elecciones fuesen hoy, un Cristina vs Macri, gana Macri.

O sea, su reeleccion depende de el y nada mas que de el. No hay nada que pueda hacer cristina (dentro de las reglas democraticas) para vencerlo en cantidad de votos.

El peronismo esta hecho mierda, casi no existe sin los K (o Unidad Ciudadana como prefieren llamarse ahora).

Y a los consejales, diputados y senadores electos por Unidad Ciudadana son muy debiles ideologicamente y poco fieles al partido, por lo que el panquequeo es bastante posible. No creo que vayan a hacer una oposicion seria como para que el oficialismo haga lo que quiera.

Lamento desilucionar a los kirchneristas, pero el ""no vuelven mas"" es ya casi una realidad. La unica forma de que vuelvan es que las ideas de Macri salgan espantosamente mal.

Asique analicemos las ideas macristas que mencionaste:

&gt; En este caso, hay muchos indicadores que dicen que se va todo a la mierda, deuda

**No es peligro ni ahora, ni en 2 años** (que es el periodo que estamos debatiendo, la reeleccion). Eso sera un peligro de aca a 5 años o mas. Asique si tenes laburo te recomiendo que vayas armando un fondito como para irte a la mierda cuando estalle.

&gt; deficit comercial

este es el mas serio de todos, pero **es emparchable con mas deuda.** Por eso vuelve el FMI y otros soretes mas.

&gt; deficit del estado (en u$S)

Dicen que los K les dejaron las cajas vacias lo cual es falso. Hay un ANSES fuerte y unas reservas nutridas gracias al primer periodo K (nestor sobre todo). **No creo que sea un problema en los proximos 2 años.**

&gt; un ninguneo a la industria y a las Pymes

No creo que los este ninguneando, quiza si estos 2 primeros años, pero ahora empieza distinto. La reforma impositiva y la flexibilizacion laboral son indicadores que de que no van a ser ninguneados. **Creo que macri, de todas formas, quiere cambiar industrias clasicas, por la ""industria del servicio""** (mas presente en paises desarrollados). 

&gt; mercado cada vez mas chico

de esto no se, ¿a que te referis? ¿a que la gente cada vez compra menos?

Creo que puede repuntar el indice de consumo en cualquier momento.

Ahora bien, analicemos las contrincantes actuales de Macri.

**De cristina ya hable**. Y no creo que jamas conquiste el voto de la izquierda. Ya que nadie que sea anticapitalista creyo que el kirchnerismo (o peronismo) se iba a sumar a eso del Socialismo del siglo XXI. Lo vimos como lo que fue, una mascara para capitalizar los votos del estallido del 2001. No fue algo serio como lo fue Evo Morales, Correa o Chavez. Solo se sumaron a la ""moda"". **El voto de derecha ya tiene dueño.**

**Massa:** El peronista que quiere mutar a la derecha, pero para derecha ya esta Macri. Quiere ocupar un espacio que ya esta ocupado. No tiene sentido su existencia.

**Randazzo**: no existe, el FIT casi le gana. Solo quiere ganar los votos Ks que estan indignados por la corrupcion y lo ven como una persona eficiente. A nadie le importa esas cualidades en una situacion de polaridad con una grieta tan enorme como la que hay. 

**el FIT**: en constante crecimiento, pero imposible que sea una competencia para Macri. En estos años va a jugar el rol de victima del Macrismo (pero victima REAL, o sea va a sufrir la represión como nunca la sufrio desde que fue creado el FIT). Esto le va a servir al kirchnerismo para señalar a macri de ""dictadura"", pero no le suma mucho eso. La mentalidad de la sociedad actual es represiva. El FIT va a cumplir un rol de Martyr. Va a sumar votos, pero va a seguir siendo minoria.

**Carrio:** No va a haber una interna de cambiemos mientras sigua existiendo el kirchnerismo. Carrio va a seguir fiel a este partido. No se va a separar.

**Vidal**: Ultra fiel, imposible que se separe o nada, ella existe gracias a cambiemos y asi lo entiende ella. Probablemente sea reelecta gobernadora a menos que el peronismo se una. E inclusive uniendose tiene grandes probabilidades de ser gobernadora.


**Golpe de estado:** No va a pasar, no hay fuerzas armadas desleales al estado. No hay peronistas armados ni nada de esas pelotudeces que decia la enfermita de Carrio (como que milagro sala estaba armando una guerrilla).

**Derrocamiento Civil** No estan dadas las condiciones para que, incluso encendiendo una mecha (organizado por el peronismo), se forme un derrocamiento civil como el de De la Rua. Para prender una mecha, tiene que haber una bomba y no la hay. POR AHORA. Este escenario lo veo mas probable para dentro de 5 años.


En resumen: el rol de derecha esta siendo ocupado por Macri, no hay otras propuestas de derecha, la imagen que propuso Duran Barba es TAN EXITOSA que todos los candidatos copiaron su imagen descontracturada y moderna, lejos de los clasicos nombres como ""frente para"" o esos nombres combativos.

Los competidores quieren ocupar ese espacio ya ocupado. No tiene sentido.





Bueno, eso es lo que opino. 

Va a haber Macri para rato por mas que no nos guste.

No va a haber grandes problemas economicos por lo menos en estos 2 años. No va a crecer el desempleo, creo que se va a mantener igual y creo que hasta puede llegar a reducirse si esta reforma impositiva le sale bien. Quiza con la flexiblizacion cambie desempleo por empleo precario. 

¿se va a ir todo al carajo? SI. ¿antes del 2019? NO. ¿Macri va a ser reelecto? SI.

En fin, eso es todo.

Contrast this with Luke's green lightsaber, which has a design more like Obi Wan's. It's hard to tell if this were to his preference, but it is the lightsaber *he* constructed which is an important and ceremonious moment for a Jedi.

So the way I've always seen it the blue blade is Anakin's true lightsaber, and the green from ROTJ is Luke's true lightsaber. I wouldn't say someone is wrong though for referring to Anakin's lightsaber as Luke's because there's at least an argument to be made.

Side note, I always thought it was cool how Luke had a hilt that was modeled after Obi Wan's, and the kyber crystal was green like Yoda's. I wonder if in-universe that was his way of paying homage to his two masters.",1509494639

Secondly for your accessories I'd focus more on variations or different compound lifts rather than machines. Eg frontsquats instead of leg press for quads.

My husband can find my mom overbearing, and bossy at times - and truthfully she is. But he knows it comes from a place of love and she'll back off when told to do so.

If you are worried about cards leaving play after rotation, you could get into non-rotating formats like Modern, Commander, Highlander, etc. Commander is fairly popular everywhere and is easy to get into with the pre-constructed decks made by WOTC.

... *entering as refugees and immigrants* ***until*** *we can find a better way to screen them. It would have never had anything to do with the ones who are currently here.

&gt;He is trying to ban transgender people from military service.

[Trump never had any intention to ban current active duty servicemembers](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/30/547258742/mattis-puts-hold-on-transgender-ban-for-current-military-service-members) and there was a reason they were barred from serving until *2016* when the Obama administration reversed it with an executive order.

&gt;He's supported Joe Arpaio who is frankly a total shitbag.

Who's only crime was upholding the law

&gt;And aligned himself with Breitbart and Steve Bannon.

So?

&gt;f you want to get into the Roosevelt quote that raises some interesting questions about the Confederate flag and the number of Trump voters for whom that comes second or possibly even joint first.

The confederate flag isn't a national flag that people rally behind as a nation. It is a symbol of southern unity and pride. It is the *Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia*, which was flown by *soldiers* who performed their duty as *soldiers* in an era where loyalty to the state was far above loyalty to the federal government. 

&gt;Absolutely a colour blind society that ignores race entirely would be ideal. I think the reality is that right now, we dont have that.

Because the democrats perpetuate the ideals of identity politics while metaphorically stomping on white people.

&gt;Take for example jobs and hiring quotas for minorities. In an ideal world you would just say 'fuck it, everyone gets to apply and we just pick the most qualified candidate, no need to try and fill some weird quota.' But in the real world multiple studies have shown you can submit identical resumes for the same job, and give one of them a typically white name and one a typically black or minority name and the white names resume gets the call back despite the listed experience and qualifications being identical.

1) Remove quotas entirely. 2) Remove race. 3) Remove names; call it applications one and two. Now you have a colorblind application process. Hell, take it a step further and remove sex as well.

*""I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history. [The only way to get rid of racism is to] stop talking about it. I'm going to stop calling you a white man, and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. I know you as Mike Wallace and you know me as Morgan Freeman.""* -- Morgan Freeman

"apple","t5_2qh1f","I mean if you don't think he's overly critical of Apple then consider this. In his same iPhone X review he wasted valuable time harping on how Apps aren't optimized for the new display yet, then took the time to mention how it could takes **years** for this to be rectified.

I'm going to go off the assumption that as a tech blogger he isn't ignorant.

But he makes no mention of the fact that this is a pre-release unit, expecting Apps to have updated for iPhone X optimization BEFORE the iPhone X is even in consumer hands is a bit silly. Yet he doesn't comment on that, and in fact suggests that it could take years for optimization to occur.

Anyone with intimate knowledge of the App store and iPhone knows this is bullshit. The vast majority of your apps will be updated on the day of release, and the rest within weeks.

Sure there will be some small fry stragglers that take longer, but to give the impression and offer this as a ""justified criticism"" of the iPhone X is insane. Toss that in with his insane attacks on FaceID, and yes I say attacks because if you watch the video he mentions how FaceID was inconsistent and gives the impression it failed a lot. He gives two instances, while walking with the sun in his face or when under flurescent lights.. but in the latter example he has the phone at waist level while attempting to unlock. I think his examples stink and are the reason people say he was looking for a problem.

He could have a) stopped walking to unlock his phone and b) not held his phone at waist level to unlock his phone

If he was giving ""justifiable criticisms"" maybe he was being fair but based on 15-20 other reviewers from a broad spectrum of sources the resounding opinion was that FaceID was flawless. So it's hard to accept that he was being justified here.",1509494646

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Ancient sites are often lost to history, and then rediscovered multiple times.

What's unique about Göbekli Tepe is it was purposely buried about 8000 years ago. So this massive structure was built 10,000 years ago by some unknown advanced ancient human civilization, stood for nearly 2,000 years, and was then buried and hidden.

It is in a contested region that's likely changed hands of many different countries over the past 8,000 years so who knows if its been previously unburied and reburied. They've barely excavated most of the structure, and we don't even know how big it is. They used radar to figure out its fairly large, but not much else is known.

The mainstream media recently ran some weird stories about it claiming it was some kind of skull cult but they seem to be trying to distract from the true history of the structure.

The existence of Göbekli Tepe alone pretty much discredits the official narrative of civilizations origins by nearly 5,000 years, and completes throws a wrench in what is commonly taught in text books.

The Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB) are a conservative Plain church, that emerged from a division among the German Baptist Brethren in 1881 being part of the Old Order Movement. Like the church they emerged from, they have roots both in Anabaptism and in Pietism. They reject baptism of infants as a biblically valid form of baptism. They are one of several Schwarzenau Brethren groups, that trace their roots to 1708, when eight believers founded a new church in Schwarzenau Germany.

Some hospitals are testing the NIPT test but it's fairly new, and I think never used to know sex, just to scan for anomalies.

Afterwards you've got a appointment every month with blood and urine tests either with a midwife, OB or your regular doctor, as you like it.

You also get 7 one hour pre birthing lessons, you can choose what type of courses you want.

You are offered an epidural if you want an have in any case to see an anesthesiologist during your 8th month in case of emergency csection.

All of these are free/reimbursed by national health insurance. And as soon as you're 6 months pregnant any medical procedure/appointment related or not with pregnancy is also totally free (you don't even have to give money in advance).

After we've got a visit from a midwife at home to see baby and pelvic reeducation is also provided.

"ColorizedHistory","t5_2voya","Looking at the gentleman in the foreground I can’t help imagine his story. I’d like to think that he was an American banker based in London called Robert  “Red” Lexington,  He picked up the nickname at Yale due to his strawberry blonde hair and much preferred it to his name Robert and always introduced himself as Red. 

Red was scheduled to travel on the Titanic’s maiden voyage to visit his family who were still living in the US. As he was travelling alone, Red decided to spare no cost and chose to travel in first class. He told friends that his decision was based on the people he would be able to try and promote his financial services to but deep down he knew that it was his own little reward for spending five years in London trying to convince land owning aristocrats that their future lay in stocks and shares. He was aware they always held him in slight contempt as a foreigner and due to his family’s Irish roots but nonetheless he had made a solid impact and was receiving a lot of praise from his board in New York. 

Red hadn’t seen his family  in 2 years and greatly missed them, especially his eldest son, George, who  had recently written to inform him that he was now engaged to be wed to his childhood sweetheart Nancy. Nancy was a lovely girl and her father owned an aspiring politician owned half of New Hampshire. More importantly Nancy’s father was willing to overlook the fact that George was a catholic. With Nancy’s family connections, Red was certain that his son would surpass his accomplishments and he did not feel even a tinge of envy, instead it left him full of pride 

Unfortunately due to slight mix up by his butler’s apprentice, his travel documents were placed in the wrong valise and he only realised half way to Waterloo station. With a rush he had hurried back to his town house  at 42 Eton Square to pick up the correct valise. A sheepish looking apprentice met him at the door - still sporting a red cheek from the strike he’d received from the butler. 

Quick as a shot Red rushed back to Waterloo, with just over 3 hours before the Titanic was due  to depart he knew he was cutting it very close. Thankfully he managed to board the next train and was confident that he would make it. He had also arranged for his butler to wire ahead to Southampton to arrange for a runner to inform the captain to hold the ship. 

Just five miles out of Southampton, disaster struck. An earlier carriage had detached itself from its  locomotive and was blocking the track. The delay was agonising and Red wasn’t sure whether his message to the ship would get there in time. 

Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the carriage was pulled away and the train set off again for Southampton. Upon his arrival a frantic Red rushed toward the harbour but the streets of Southampton were busy. The crowds had flocked to see the world’s greatest ship,  blocking his route to the terminal. 

As Red cursed and urged his driver to press ahead he finally caught a glimpse of the Titanic, and what a view it was. He could make out the funnels from a distance, clearly silhouetted against the sky in the  glow of the late afternoon sun.  Yet alas he realised he was too late, the vessel had already pulled away from her berth and was slowly steaming out of the harbour. Red felt an awe and crushed at the same time. 

He eventually made his way down towards the berth watching this marvel of engineering slowly move towards the Atlantic. How he wished he was on that ship, with a sigh he sat on the wet edge of the dock while thinking how long it might be until he would see his family again.

Even without that, the fact that CFB Halifax isn't too far away from the mouth of the St Lawrence means that if Canada wants to play hardball, and Quebec is saying no shipping gets through, then Canada can do the same to Quebec.

I really don't think things would have broken down to the degree that would have seen military force being used, because in every instance, Quebec would have lost, and Parizeau wasn't suicidal.",1509494654

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Put succinctly, if we have knowledge we must accept beliefs only because we understand them to be true; but if determinism is correct, then we automatically accept whatever beliefs that our constituent micro-particles impose on us, since as Searle says, scientific explanation works from the bottom up. It might be the case that those micro-particles coincidentally make me believe true things, but the truth would not be the ultimate causal agent acting upon me.

I take issue with this idea that in an undetermined world one believes things ‘only because we understand them to be true.’ If this is the case then why does anybody disagree? Whether we choose our beliefs or whether we are compelled to believe them, in either case we could be wrong. 

&gt;Determinism, then, leads to skepticism, the denial of the possibility of justified true belief. This is a controversial issue, but I hold that skepticism is necessarly [sic] false. For suppose we affirm skepticism. Then we may wonder if we know that skepticism is true. If we do know it, then at least one item of objective knowledge exists, which contradicts the premise. But if we don’t know that skepticism is true either, why should we accept it? To recap: Determinism implies skepticism; Skepticism is necessarily false; Hence determinism is false.

As outlined above the idea that one believes the world is determined in no way necessitates radical scepticism. I accept I could be wrong but do not believe I am. The fact I could not believe other than I do does phase me. If I see a football and believe it is round, the fact I cannot help believe otherwise does not undermine my confidence in my judgement. 

Furthermore the idea that scepticism is ‘necessarily’ false is a fairly bold claim. Why could a sceptic not simply say that they believe skepticism is true but are skeptical of that conclusion? In such an instance they would be entirely consistent. A skeptic does not need to maintain skepticism is true and in fact no real skeptic would for precisely the reason mentioned by the author. 

&gt;Third, I bring G. E. Moore to my defense. In his “Proof of the External World”, Moore refuted skepticism about physical objects merely by saying, “Here is a hand, and here is another hand.” Critics accused Moore of begging the question; and the critical reader of this paper might object that I am merely repeating my first argument. Both of these complaints simply miss Moore’s point, which was this: In order for any argument to work, it is necessary that the initial plausibility of its premises have greater initial plausibility than those of the denial of its conclusion. Since no premise has greater initial plausibility than “This is a hand,” said Moore, it is in principle impossible for that claim to be overturned. I think that the same is true of the existence of free will. Nothing has greater initial plausibility than the premise “I have free will”; no scientific or philosophical argument will ever have greater initial plausibility. So how is it even coherent to argue against free will? Any valid argument show- ing that free will does not exist serves merely as a reductio ad absurdum of that arguments’ premises, not a disproof of the freedom of the will.

So in the author’s view, Moore’s proof of the external world consists in showing someone the external world? That is transparently circular. The argument that everything in the Bible is true because it says so in the Bible is hardly any less obvious as a non-sequitur. 

Initial implausibility is important in establishing the burden of proof but is certainly not insurmountable. It seems to me initially implausible that a person standing on a moving train experiences time at a different rate from someone standing on the platform. My incredulity however does not disprove Einstein’s special theory of relativity. If something is implausible one should not believe it, *unless* one has a good reason. As there are good arguments to doubt the existence of free will one should do so unless said arguments can be shown to be flawed. 

&gt;As a side note, it is interesting that John Searle, a reluctant opponent of the doctrine of free will, says that he continues to believe in free will no matter how many arguments against it that he hears. This shows quite well that Searle finds the initial plausibility of “Searle has free will” to be greater than that of his arguments against free will; for if the arguments against free will were really that powerful, Searle would do what we usually do when overwhelmed by convincing arguments: namely, change his mind. Since he can’t change his mind, the initial plausibility of his free will must exceed the plausibility of the apparently conflicting scientific arguments. Given this, he should reexamine the propositions of science and his philosophy of mind and see if they are really harder to doubt than the existence of free will.

If John Searle were convinced by the arguments against free will he would cease to believe in its existence. The fact that he does not says no more to me then that he is not really convinced.

It is important to note that one can still *experience* free will without *believing* in it. When I get into an airplane I believe I am moving even when my subjective experience sitting in the chair is that I am not moving at all. I believe that the earth goes around the sun even though my subjective experience is that the sun moves across the sky. In exactly the same way, my subjective experience is that I have a free choice in my actions even while I understand and believe that my choice is ultimately pre-determined. There is no contradiction.  

&gt;Fourth, try the following thought experiment. Our brilliant neurophysiologists come up with an equation that they claim will predict all of our behavior. The equation is so good that it even incorporates our reaction to the equation, our reaction to knowing that it incorporates our reaction, and so on indefinitely. Suppose that the equation says that the next thing that you will do is raise your arm. Do you seriously believe that you couldn’t falsify this prediction by failing to raise your arm? But if you can falsify any prediction about your arm, and if the prediction is derived perfectly from a comprehensive knowledge of your body’s constituent micro-particles, then your mind must be free. In a crucial sense, then, the denial of free will is predicated on our ignorance of the very causal laws that supposedly show that free will is impossible. For once these allegedly binding laws of nature were compiled and capable of making falsifiable empirical predictions, it would be child’s play to falsify them forthwith. Surely if human behavior were unfree, then science could in theory at least predict when I am going to raise my hand. And why should the equations be unable to compensate for the subject’s knowledge of the prediction? And yet, it is very hard to believe that upon the proclamation of these alleged causal laws, that I would find it any harder to falsify them than I would find it to falsify e.g. the reader’s prediction about when I will raise my hand.

The author posits the existence of an equation which perfectly predicts behaviour and points out he can act inconsistently if told what the prediction is. All that proves is that if said equation/demon/computer existed they would be unable to disclose their predictions without impacting the result. That does not prove we have free will. 

Take the converse, if a machine were to print a sealed envelope which you opened at the end of a day only to find all of your choices had been perfectly predicted in advance one would rather doubt that one’s choices were as free as they subjectively appeared. ",1509494660

The users of the system have their justifications for using it and appeals to them to ""play fair"" have either fallen on deaf ears or been attacked.

If the RIOT system is killed, then another will rise to take its place, if you have a culture like this that is allowed to stay in the game.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","In general, as others have pointed out, this entirely depends on a fight to fight basis and involves a lot of memory and basic math. Here is a generalized progress on how I personally go into stuff.

I tend to get hit. A lot. Every time I see the boss use a cast bar, I pop any cooldown, and take a mental note of what hit me, and how hard, and reference that with the CD I just used. For example, I have used rampart, which reduces damage taken by 20%, and I got hit by 4000 Damage, I know that whatever hit me would usually deal 5000 damage. I take a mental note of the name of the attack and that it will hit me for 5000. After having done a fight so many times, I learn how often the boss does this particular attack, and, more importantly, WHEN he does them. And once I know when what will hit me I can use an appropriate cooldown to reduce the amount of damage I take. 

Of course, there are also telegraphed attacks or entirely untelegraphed. This is where the memorization of the what and when will help you anticipate and prepare.

You will find that almost every bigger fight in FFXIV will follow a strict pattern. Learning when you get hit, what hits you and how hard it hurts is the first step. ",1509494662

Either embrace the organic/tech (rock/scizzor) meta and introduce more support items (paper) for rebels NOW that will stop tech units similar to chopper ( buffing ray shield to 2 energy is a good start)or nerf the cards that support the At St like nerve gas. Adrenal needs to be looked too (yes,adrenal since nerve gas is what is keeping that and Anakin down). Then if At St is still an issue nerf it. Then if the hero remains an issue nerf him.

Why ruin a hero now because the meta suits him only for the meta to swap in 2 months for example, leaving him both nerfed and in an unfavourable meta?",1509494666

The biggest thing to give T a swift kick in the gonads is lack of sleep.  If you happened to sleep not as good the night before your test, it will be affected.  If you are finding you havn't been sleeping well for this past month, that most certainly can affect it.

Now things like exercise and weightlifting can cause excess stress in the body that the body has an inability to deal with.  End result is sleep usually suffers, and because that suffers, T suffers.  Cortisol and Testosterone have an inverse relationship.. as one goes up the other goes down.  Same as Prolactin and Testosterone, they also have an inverse relationship.

Although if you are weightlifting 3x a week, I highly doubt that is behind it.  This usually happens to people who do it 5-7x per week.",1509494667

Thanks for the compliment.  I've done quite a bit of tech support in my line of work, so I know the more details that can be given, the better! :-)

As for your questions:

--I have commented out the DirPortFrontPage line of the torrc file.  Thank you for that recommendation.
--Atlas Fingerprint: A8AF1B8DC0E1EB60813C9FCA7D506F5B975D796A
--Notices.log File: Link below to pastebin.  I see a lot of errors stating that the server has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable.  Any recommendations on how to remedy that?  It references the /etc/hosts file, so I also included a pastebin of that if it is useful.  I am not running any kind of IPv6 on the network and I see those options listed in the hosts file...would this cause any issue?  

Also, I noticed that there is a ""RunAsDaemon"" line that is commented out.  Should this be uncommented so that the service runs as a daemon, or is this not what I would be wanting done?  Sorry again for the newbie questions, and I really appreciate the help.

Indeed we have different views. I see this perspective -- which is the predominant attitude of our society -- as hindering the construction of a justice system that could rehabilitate offenders (or, at a minimum, simply sequester truly dangerous and irredeemable offenders).

The root of my view is the perspective that bad actors do not ultimately choose to be the people they are. They don't choose to have the impulses they do, and they don't choose to have insufficient willpower to resist those urges. At some foundational level, they are simply profoundly unlucky to have been born as who they are.

Hatred and vindictive punishment, then, I claim, are always misplaced. We should punish bad actors to discourage others from acting similarly, but the punishment needs to be with an eye on trying to reform the offender if possible. In those cases where the offender cannot be rehabilitated, we simply need to keep him away from others.",1509494669

What he did, on purpose to deliberately derail your campaign, so you would make a new one he like better? Fuck that. You're not a video game, and he didn't even pay $60 to play. He's a dick, that was a dick move, and there's no excuse for it. If he didn't want to keep playing in the campaign he should have said so; you had already asked for feedback! 

I wouldn't play with him again, unless he's real fucking sorry and understands how shitty he was.

As a learning opportunity for DMing; don't give them random plane shifting or teleporting devices if you aren't FULLY prepared for that. And the only way to be prepared for that is to have such ""randomness"" entirely on rails, where you already know where they're gonna go and it's all behind the screen. You can certainly try to improv an actually random effect like that but good luck with it.

Second lesson; yeah, a cash prize lacks a hook by itself. But the player needs to meet you halfway. You should give them an idea of what the campaign is about; winning this interplanar tournament. So WHY is your character getting involved in this? Make a adventurer who wants to go on adventures. I run a pirates campaign, so I told them during character creation ""Make a character who wants to be a pirate."" I set the expectation, and they met it. They didn't read the naval combat rules, but you can't have everything...Regardless. So a session 0 where you lay out the hook and they build their characters around that hook is always ideal. As for what the prize should be; I would go with something fantastic, because we're traveling the planes and seeing gods and fiends and the afterlife, all that stuff. It should be an *unlimited wish* or some crazy artifact, makes your dreams come true, all that jazz. Money is kind of pedestrian. And if you're plane jumping, I feel like you probably just go to the Plane of Earth at some point and visit the Infinite Fields Of F***ing Huge Diamonds and then boom, you're rich.

It was a good campaign, save it, run it for another group with a good Session 0 first, and without this guy.",1509494669

"FORTnITE","t5_2t7hh","Deadly Blade is one of the highest output melee Ninja's in the game (if not the highest output), the only problem is the low duration of Assassination (5 seconds) which forces you to melee hit a target every 5 seconds or lose some of your damage (this is obviously not an issue if you're hitting things with a lot of health, like a smasher).

***

You have two types of Shuriken Master

+ Those who will do nothing but spam Shurikens
+ Those that melee in between Shuriken attacks

&amp;nbsp;

The ones that melee in addition to Shurikens obviously do a lot more damage, but are a lot rarer.

***

It isn't a question of 'better', it's a question of necessity. Energy (like ammunition) needs to be replenished and there is no magical way to do this (Shuriken energy consumption cost is higher than generation rate, if you always use on cooldown).

***

If you're a **competent player** you will achieve better results with Deadly Blade because your damage output is not linked to a consumable resource. **In the majority of game content the husks do not have the health for it to matter at all**, they will die too quickly for it to make any difference. It is only after you get to content where the Husks have excessive amounts of HP that it actually matters.

&amp;nbsp;

The majority of the game modes where damage output will matter in any way, shape or form require you to 'protect an objective'. From that point it is simply a question of how much time do you need to actually protect the objective. How you go about protecting the objective is irrelevant.",1509494670

If he is to obey his destiny, he must find or invent within himself some hard and secret part that is indifferent to himself, to others, and even to the world that he is destined to remake, not to his own desire, but to a nature that he will discover in the process of remaking.""*

Tu te crois peut-être ""libre"" de choisir de le porter, mais le jour ou tout ton quartier va le porter, ce ne sera plus un choix. Ni pour toi, ni pour aucune de tes consoeurs.

&gt; Ou alors quand on parle de neutralité, on parle de neutralité pour qui? Les croix, kippa, turban, kirpan et hijab de ce monde sont-ils neutres, eux?

Comparons des pommes avec des pommes et des oranges avec des oranges.

Aucun de ses symbole religieux n'empêche l'identification d'une personne.

Aucun de ses symboles religieux est utilisé systématiquement dans d'autre pays comme moyens de controle sur la femme.

J'ai jamais entendu parlé d'un Sikh qui était obligé de porter son turban sous peine d'être ostracisé ou persécuté par ses semblables.

Et pour ton info, le kirpan à fait scandale aussi quand les jeunes ont commencé à les apporter à l'école. Y'à eu une polémique, un débat et personne est mort de racisme.

&gt; Ça me fait réagir, car comme l'a dit une de mes consoeurs, l'Arabie saoudite a enfin permis aux femmes d'obtenir un permis de conduire alors qu'ici, dans l'une des plus grandes démocraties, l'autobus leur est maintenant interdit.

Moi ça me fait réagir quand on cite des pays comme l'Arabie saoudite pour défendre un point. Les femmes on gagné le droit de conduire, wow! On est toute épaté.

Voici quelques petites choses anodines que les femmes ne peuvent pas faire en Arabie Saoudite, même si elles viennent d'avoir l'énorme privilège de pouvoir conduire (à condition d'être accompagné d'un homme):

* Prendre une décision ""majeure"" sans l'approbation d'un homme
* Intéragir avec des hommes (inconnus)
* Se baigner
* Faire un sport de compétition librement (ils ont quand même proposé des jeux Olympique sans femmes)
* Essayer du linge dans un magasin
* Se promener sans un tuteur (male) avant l'age de 45 ans

Mais labas t'es libre en sale de porter le niqab ou la burqa, t'es même ""fortement"" encouragée à le faire si tu veux pas de problèmes.

À scuse, tu voulais parler de droits et liberté ?

* In 2012, a 16 year old called Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested after taking part in a protest – and was sentenced to death by beheading and crucifixion.
* In 2014, a 17 year old was tortured and forced to sign a blank document – which was later edited to contain a ‘confession’ of spying. He was refused a lawyer, and sentenced to death by crucifixion.
* Again, in less than 10 weeks in 2016, 70 individuals were executed by the Saudi government.
* The grand mufti in charge of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Al Sheikh, has openly declared that he believes girls are ready for marriage at the age of 10 or 12.

If you were this low level volunteer to the trump campaign, where during the election you did all you could to try and get this supposed information on Clinton, because you thought it would move you up in the campaign and 6 months later the former head of the FBI is pressing you on all these questions, which they probably have proof of, would you flat out tell the truth? 

I've sat before FINRA auditors before questioning me about nuanced bullshit so they meet their quota of audits and even that made me nervous. It could just as reasonably be said that papadopoulos thought his engagements or intentions towards the professor and this supposed russian woman (the professor is saying the niece of putin introduction thing never happened) were totally fine, and later with the frenzy around Trump/Russia, he realizes he might be legally liable for crimes, and he lies under pressure. 

Now, I doubt they would have given this guy some plea deal if he didn't have some information to offer the special council, or it could be that the charge of lying to them was rather minor (I'm not versed on what punishment could follow that) and they'd just rather have him cooperate and confirm under oath all of his emails. 

I do find it interesting that the reason Papadopoulos was found as lying was because the Trump legal team gave documents that contradicted his statements. Again, looking at it reasonably that leads me to think the higher ups in the campaign weren't that involved with him. 

Let it all come out though, I'd be very surpised if these two indicments were all that comes from this. ",1509494677

"AskAnEscort","t5_35q1i","Having gone to a women's college in the middle of the uprising of leftist feminism in the US, all I'm willing to say on the subject is that modern feminism is not interested in equality, it's interested in cry bullying people into eventually misandry.  

A large part of it likely stems from the fact that women have it pretty good in America.  The wage gap doesn't exist, we don't live in a rape culture, (which is not to be confused with the statement ""rape cultures don't exist"") and men are actively discriminated against in the workforce thanks to affirmative action, which women benefit from, you have protection under the law in custody and property cases during divorce, you have asylum when fleeing from abusive spouses...the list goes on. 

Feminism has a place in the year 2017, but not in most of the first world countries.  It was a great thing to have around throughout the 1900s as women were actively oppressed, but the good news is that *feminism won.* 
 Winning also meant that there were a lot less demons for feminism to fight, so it started picking at the most minuscule things it could find.  (Manspreading?  Really?)  There is no such thing as a perfect equality, but what we have now is pretty close to it, if not maybe a little overboard on one side.  ",1509494677

But my mom is so loving and caring despite her many flaws. I wish with all my heart she would listen to me, leave my dad, and we could move in together into some cute apartment or something. When she asked me to come home more, she cried and said that just me being in the house with her was like having a candle in a dark room or something. It breaks my heart how lonely she is. She is such a strong person, I just wish she was strong enough to go.

I'm so sorry to hear about your past girlfriends, and thanks a million times over the concern for bf. Fingers in my ears screaming-- I would never dream of doing that to him. I really only have done that when I am trapped in a situation where my dad yells and screams and threatens because he is capable of saying very cruel things and I don't want to hear something that will give me more baggage. I have never raised my voice around my bf and I've never felt the desire to. When we have disagreements we talk them out calmly in bed, while cuddling or holding hands. I can't sleep until I know we're okay. I know my brother has inherited my father's abuse, but I feel I am a more passive, scared person like my mom and am much more likely to be abused than abuse (I don't feel like I've been abused in past relationships but definitely used, manipulated, lied to, etc). Current bf is a very strong, independent person who hates settling so I know he wouldn't tolerate any BS on my part (but I do try and check in regularly).

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","**Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution**

""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"" is a 1973 essay by the evolutionary biologist and Eastern Orthodox Christian Theodosius Dobzhansky, criticising anti-evolution creationism and espousing theistic evolution. The essay was first published in American Biology Teacher in 1973.

Dobzhansky first used the title statement, in a slight variation, in a 1964 presidential address to the American Society of Zoologists, ""Biology, Molecular and Organismic"", to assert the importance of organismic biology in response to the challenge of the rising field of molecular biology. The term ""light of evolution""—or sub specie evolutionis—had been used earlier by the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and then by the biologist Julian Huxley.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Intelligence doesn't matter, I've never once said that non-human animals are as intelligent as humans. Do you think it's ok to murder people with mental imparements because of lower IQ?

Most animals most definitely react to pain, and the smell of death in slaughter houses. Even if they didn't, this still isn't a reason to kill them. Same example as above.

&gt;As for slavery, it was harmful (to humans)

So? Why do you draw your line at a certain group of people people but not a certain group of animals?

&gt;As for the dog, an individual's pastime doesn't validate good or bad

Precisely my point, which also stands true to what you decide to eat. The action itself is immoral, regardless of the reason.

&gt;But as for my diet, eating meat is part of maintaining my health as a human being, a species of omnivores.

Omnivorous doesn't mean *must* eat both, but *can* eat both. Please tell me one nutrient you cannot get without animal products, and I will answer to the best of my knowledge.",1509494678

"CFL","t5_2qiwn","That's too bad. 

Maybe it's just been unlucky for the games you've seen but to me this season has had so many thrilling games so I can't agree with that. Tons of last minute or last play finishes, lead changes, big plays, etc. Best CFL season in years I think.

The refs are never going to be perfect but the move to only have one challenge has been huge for game flow. 

Otherwise it's a lot of subjective stuff. For example I love when they credit the crowd with causing a false start. To each their own.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","That's them being irrational. That's a good thing, it means they don't actually have a reason. However, you're making a mistake. When arguing with someone who has power over you (a teacher, your parents, your boss, etc), you need to be non-confrontational. Don't press the same point, but circumvent the obstacle they put in front of you. That's the trick. Whenever they try to put a wall in front of you, don't bang against it, go around it.

For example, if someone simply says *""no""* to you, try asking something like: *""Well, can't we discuss this first?""* Don't ask for a reason as if they owe it to you. They don't, because they have power over you. For example: *""Could you please elaborate on why I can't X, so that I know?""* Be sincere and open, not sarcastic or defiant, as if you truly want to learn why, not because you're anticipating a response in order to strike it down.

When someone says *""because I said so""*, what they're actually doing is trying to assert their power. They can tell they're losing the argument, so they try to remind you who's in charge. It means they're insecure. Instead of attacking that insecurity (which is something most people do reactively), you need to placate them. You need to reassure them and reframe the discussion. Something like: *""Of course! I'm not saying that I'm going to do it even though you're telling me not to. All I'm saying is that it would be useful for me to know why you oppose this.""* You could even use the self-improvement angle, like: *""Wouldn't it be better if you told me why you think it's such a bad idea, so that I know and learn from it?""* or *""Well, if you know something that I don't, shouldn't you explain it to me, so I can learn what I'm doing wrong?""*

If they still get mad and refuse to answer, then you actually do have your answer. That answer is: *""There is no reason. I'm just being a dick, but I can't admit it, so I'll just use my power to shut this conversation down, because I'm a petty asshole.""* You may keep trying to circumvent this wall, but they'll keep backtracking to playing the Power Card. You can't win.

On some people (who aren't assholes), it could work if you made an appeal to fairness or good parenting/leadership. For example: *""Don't you think it's unfair of you to forbid me from doing something without explaining the reasons behind it? How am I supposed to learn and better myself if you don't teach me things/guide me?""* Stuff like that.

Specifically with parents (who aren't assholes), you could make your own case, and explain how important this is to you. Express your emotions as articulate as you can. Tell them why this means so much to you.

But like I said, sometimes you have to let go of some battles, because you can't win them. Just be patient, and pay your dues. Your parents won't be the last assholes with power you'll meet in your life. Stoicism is a good skill.",1509494679

Some of the young girls that I was in charge of felt  the best way to approach things (i.e get out of work) was to try to seduce male co-workers and superiors. When it was found out that they were serial sleeping with everybody. They got called out for it.

 They were extremely thin-skinned about it. And often would complain to me about harassment and comments about their looks or how they conduct themselves. 

My approach generally was to tell them to ""go away"" in strong language. If they want to act like that that's theyre problem but you can't try and complain that's harassment.

I felt like Morgan grew a lot as a character because of his experience in “Clear.” He gained a profound reverence for life and he reached the conclusion that vengeance and violence only lead to more suffering. 

I understand his acceptance that maybe pure pacifism can’t always be the solution. There are some times that you will have to choose one life or many lives over the life of another, because if you don’t, you end up allowing more suffering than if you don’t act. (i.e. someone is going to take innocent lives and there’s no solution that avoids violence). However, to revert back to blood lust just doesn’t make sense.

If you're committed to this: I'd really suggest trialing this commute before you take the job, and keep in mind that you're going to have to do it on the coldest days of winter and rainiest days of the year too. Be prepared to need to invest in some solid rain gear at a minimum.

Anyway, the 1/2 mile or so on Old NB Rd would be the main issue as a cyclist, assuming you're reasonably comfortable riding in mixed traffic on lower-speed roads otherwise. Getting over the tracks is a narrow dirt path you'll probably have to walk the bike on and then you're just going to be riding on the side of a busy 40mph+ road.

Also, the alternate bicycle route suggested via Jarrard + Roma Blvd is not a viable route unless you're willing to probably break trespassing laws. That's a gated, semi-abandoned path crossing an active rail line and which I think has warning signs up to keep off of it.",1509494682

However, any news coverage on something I've been a part of has got nearly every concrete detail wrong.  So it's probably just that the reality differs from the details in the article.

&gt; The sailing around Hawaii for 10 years part does indeed mean shit. Did she skipper a yacht on long offshore passages? Or did she occasionally go out on dad's boat? 

Well, that's what I mean...  ""10 years experience"" doesn't mean anything.  She could be an expert that has 10 years of true sailing experience, or she could have sat on board and pulled lines for 10 years.  Even someone who just pulled lines could have paid attention and figured out how the actual systems interplay, rather than just which button or line on a particular boat needs tweaked a certain way.  Sadly many people can pull lines for 10 years, but never really know more than ""let it out till there's a bubble, pull it in until it goes away"". 

I see everyone claiming she's some sort of expert simply because of that line.  All that really means is that she knows what salt spray tastes like.

&gt;

I'm not sure what you mean to say with this bit. This seems like the typical challenges associated with any education, and with jobs too, mostly. 

&gt;The prof will sometimes be ambiguous and other times drone on about something you already understand. Everyone will have to wait while the prof converses with just one keener who has a barely related question.
&gt;

There are two concerns here, quality education and the challenge of teaching to a large and diverse class. The quality of faculty and teaching skill is the point that I am making. This is why we are in the current dispute. 

The issue of teaching to a large class is a significant one, but is not solved by a video lecture posted online. In fact, it is made much worse because the prof cannot ""read the room"" and adapt. 

&gt;An interactive video can be the best lecture ever:
&gt;
&gt;* High energy with no stuttering or stumbling over words/language.
&gt;* The option to drill down on each topic if you struggle with it.
&gt;* The option to rewind if you were distracted thinking about something else for a minute.
&gt;* The option to skip a topic you already mastered outside this class. 
&gt;* The option to watch even when you are sick in bed for the day.
&gt;* The option to pause the video and access a reddit style conversation about that point in the video.
&gt;

These are some really good points about the benefits of online video lectures (which I do use in some of my courses). However, there are challenges associated with this approach as well. It can be difficult and slow to ask a question, and no matter how many times you rewatched a video the explanations and examples don't change. If you ask a live prof for clarification, you typically get a new version of the explanation. 


&gt;The stubborn reluctance to dissolve the classroom enshrines the position of the teacher at the expense of the student's education.


I have conducted a number of formal and informal surveys on students attitudes towards online and blended/hybrid learning, and while some students do prefer online courses, most have mixed feelings or strongly dislike online education. Many even feel cheated if they are forced into online classes without the option to select an in-class version. I don't think switching to a fully online delivery would be broadly effective or appreciated by most students, nor do I believe that it reflects an stubborn mentality. You might appreciate a fully online education, and fortunately for you, many such options do currently exist. ",1509494683

""Hey folks - Great news, the next update for Halo 5 has cleared certification and is on target for release this Thursday, 11/2!Here's what you need to know:

* The update itself should start rolling out around 9AM PT on Thursday, 11/2.
* Once everything is live and verified, we'll then pull the trigger on launching the landing page on Waypoint and will get the word out across our social channels.
* At approximately 1PM PT, a few items requiring back-end configuration work will go live - this includes things like the Arclight being returned to its previous value in Warzone and the new Commendations.
* Lastly, at approx. 2PM PT, the new Halo 5 Local Server app will be available for download via the Windows Marketplace.

Note that unlike prior releases, there are no new REQs being added to the pool with this update so there's no need to hold off on opening packs and waiting for that propagation to occur. But please do note that if you'd like to earn the new Commendations, those won't be live until approx. 1PM PT (we'll get the word out once the work is complete).

**Fixed a number of exploits for Warzone**

- Fixed ability to get inside bases to contest
- Fixed ability to get under the world
- Fixed ability to destroy the core when you should not be able to
- Fixed an issue where the red team shield door would sometimes not have proper collision

* BTB Assault matches now group properly under their own category in the Service Record
* Fixed an issue where REQ currency would sometimes not recharge properly when joining in progress to Warzone modes
* Fixed an issue where players who JIP’ed into Warzone games were not leveling up
* Fixed an issue where JIP’ing players sometimes caused momentary hitches
* Added a fix for the “black screen” bug (We believe this is addressed, and will be monitoring closely - please let us know if you experience this issue post-patch)
* Fixed a bug in which banned players could continue to play matches
* Fixed a bug where Snowzone and Urban home bases did not have player collision
* Fixed a rare crash players could hit if they died while picking up power-ups",1509494690

For flights, set a few price alerts now on apps like Kayak and Hopper but a quick search from DC show round trip is about $200 which doesn’t seem bad at all. That’s how much I’d pay from San Diego if I didn’t have extra Southwest points.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","* Don't underestimate her grounded movement. Sure, she has the best air mobility and among the worst ground mobility in the game, but dashdancing and wavedashing around and wavelanding on platforms adds a lot of unpredictability to your movement that you need if you want to get grabs, and Puff's grabs are her among her best options in most situations. If you find yourself overusing predictably spaced bair pokes in neutral, try mixing it up with your grounded movement.

* Try to pay attention to how your spacing can threaten and scare your opponent. Puff is up there with ICs for the scariest character for someone to face in tournament - an unorthodox matchup plus a frame one insta kill button give people serious spaghetti. You'll notice that certain spacings make (some) players just lock in shield and become sitting ducks for tomahawk grabs. Or you'll notice that space animals on last stock *really* don't want to be grabbed (for obvious reasons), so they'll take any number of bairs to the face to avoid it. Or that Marths get *terrified* if you're crouching inside their sourspot range and start doing all sorts of stupid shit.

* Don't trade, except maybe when you're two or three stocks up. In half of her matchups two or three hits can leave you at kill-%. It's not worth it. Instead, abuse the fact that Puff can just choose not to engage whenever she feels like it. Be patient and wait for the right opening. Get comfortable with long periods of doing nothing but holding your stage control and outspacing your opponent - this is 100% necessary to beat Marth, for example.

* Nair may *look* like a shitty sex kick with a tiny hitbox, and it kinda is, but honestly I think it's her second best aerial. Puff's air mobility means that she can press A and become a moving, autocancelling hitbox. It stuffs aerial approaches, covers below her, and can be respaced on the fly. Make sure you're not underusing it.

* Notice that there are two main ways players start emotionally breaking down in tournament: Tilt/anger, and spaghetti/fear. The two play completely differently, and you can exploit them differently too. Angry players are hyper-aggressive. They make bad approaches and suck at outspacing you. This is when you should play super defensively - just outspace them and bair poke them. Not only will they eat up all your bairs, it'll also just make them angrier and give you a free set. Fearful players do the opposite: they spam poor defensive options, e.g spamming falco lasers or just hiding in shield, and are really vulnerable to ballsy approaches, like tomahawk grabs and empty hop up-tilt rest. Again, if it works, they're just going to spaghetti even harder. Get good at telling what sort of mindset your opponent has and how you can exploit it.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Depends on what format. 

For standard, to stay on top of the meta/play the top tier deck, you're looking at maybe 600 a year in cards, plus FNM entry fees (say, 5 dollars a week, so 250 for the year). Now, you can recoup most of that with tournament winnings/etc. 

If you draft, that's probably going to run you 14 a week. So, like 600 to 700 a year. Again, same thing; you get to sell back your cards and get tournament winnings. 

For modern/legacy, you're looking at just buying into the format, then running the same deck for (ideally) ever, and just paying entry. But the up front cost is much higher (think, 1-3k) and you do run the risk of your deck getting banned.

And that's assuming he doesn't use his Reversal for a 800 dmg cheap shot as you stand there unable to do anything about it.

Damba and Agony Seris are the only ones that stand a chance against Andro now, and that's only if they land the stun first thing upon encountering him, and assuming Andro hasn't invested in the CC item either.

You have 3500W available, period. The rating of the available power has nothing to do with adding all the receptacles together. Additionally, generators create 'dirty' power and the closer you load it to 3500W continuously, the faster it will breakdown and shorten it's life.

Further, I would suggest to the Right Honourable gentleman that it would be far worse for our children if the extent of global inequality and poverty that exists today is allowed to continue. We are currently a surplus, it is therefore perfectly reasonable for us to be helping the very poorest, whilst also playing our role to lower the national debt.

That's even worse, you hurt your social life in both cities and basically have no reason to have a nice place back home since your barely there. When I did a similar schedule I ended up living at home. :/

That was super helpful. I hadn't even thought about the order of operations when transitioning turns, if I want to support that I definitely cannot directly communicate with the game state via my managers.

I like your idea of creating an object per action that can calculate the next steps/task for other managers to use, however it would almost become as massive as the gamestate itself, since all managers need different info, for instance my fogmanager needs to know about all visible enemy entities for each step which means the object would have to contain the worldstate or atleast the worldstate for all tiles that will be visible during the movement, I guess thats fine though.

If you want to be successful you must either be of value to somebody or make them think you are of value to them. Then you observe their reaction to you and you build an intelligence around their behavior and their reaction to your behavior.

There are so many people who want to get recognition and turn to politics or the show business to find it. you gotta feed their need to be recognized and do things with their psychological needs in mind. At the end of the day they will go home and nobody will know them and you will receive appreciation or even fame and get better at your public role, more resourceful and creative.

Given what you've said though, my recommendation would be to check out Juggernaut 2.0.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; calling it group of life or even acting as if it was an easy group is stupid now that we know how well Misfits and WE performed at this worlds.

It's called a group of life because TSM had the odds favored for them. They were up against a team of mostly rookies and WE wasn't looking that hot, while they had tons of international experience. We all know that WE and Misfits were much better than expected, but TSM should have shown the same ability to improve over groupstage while they clearly didn't. 

&gt; Also, what the heck do you mean with above their weight class? They clearly proved themselves to be a great team and didn't get there by accident or luck.

I don't know why you're acting like I'm hating on Misfits or something. I literally never said they got there by accident or luck. I'm just saying that they clearly did much better than anyone expected. If you told someone 2 months ago that Misfits would take SKT to game 5 in quarterfinals, you'd be laughed at. Just because they did well doesn't all of a sudden mean that people should have known they would do so well.

&gt; The results are the results, peoples expecations are not what defines how strong a team is...

A month ago there were no results. You can't act like you knew Misfits would be this strong a month ago.",1509494707

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","This game has been decided to fail. PC gamers are smart. They're the smartest gamers out there. They don't think but know things other people might not, and one of those things is population counts. PC gamers don't think but know that a multiplayer game like Battleborn needs players to be fun. However, they also don't think but know that there simply aren't enough people to go around. Between Overwatch, CS:GO, TF2, CoD, Battlefield, hell even the MOBAs, who is left to populate the Battleborn servers? PC gamers don't think but know that there's nobody left. In order to strengthen Overwatch's player counts, PC gamers made a tough choice that they didn't think but knew was for the greater good. They decided Battleborn would fail. Nobody would buy it, nobody would play it, and all so Overwatch could be the best game it could be. Today, millions of happy gamers frag out in Overwatch. Battleborn and Gearbox should just cut their losses. When PC gamers decide something, it's decided, and no amount of dev work will change that decision. Let's just say I don't think Gearbox will hemorrhage money from this continued support.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well, what's important is in order to do satire or parody well, one must understand it's source material. You can't accurately make fun of something you don't know enough about: blind hatred, both in real life and on a screen isn't acceptable and it most certainly doesn't lead to good content/people. That is precisely why South park works so well: it's creators know what they're doing. Parody is, and always was about finding the flaws in a thing and exaggerating them for an effect. Even cartoon drawings of people, one of the first recorded and widely utilised types of parody work this way. The artist takes a look at the distinctive features of the artee (?) and exaggerates them, in order for it to be more recognizable. Big head, bigger nose, birthmarks and thick eyebrows: these are traits you can emphasise in order to create the intended effect. If parody is done correctly, it can represent things even better than just some big block of text like this. It can be more fun, more engaging and much smarter than a simple representation, because surface-level knowledge isn't sufficient for it.

Beyond that, congressional affairs also reports directly to the director/deputy.

That org chart confirms this would be reported directly to Comey (or his replacement, Rosenstein who has essentially recused himself.) They would ask his permission or blessing on sensitive matters like obtaining a no knock warrant in a highly politicized case, or calling in the sitting president's staff.

But even using LW, I still had the same issue if I needed to change the audio or timing of the clips. Sometimes I will need to change the audio, sometime the animation it depends whats lacking.

This month I am trying to split my video up into smaller chunks and only stitching them back together once I am sure there are no more changes. Once the video is complete I can see if this process was more efficient then the other way. I am hoping others have come across this problem before and maybe there is a better way of doing this.

"berkeley","t5_2qh9w","Here's some bad advice.

When I was in math 54 I could never figure out the differential equations sections (I did decently on the two linear algebra midterms). The professor was terrible, my gsi was a massive asshole, and the textbook was trash. I studied my ass off and still walked into the exam with basically no idea how to solve any remotely complicated differential equations.

Here's basically what I did. Go through every section of the textbook on diff eqs. Copy as many of the diff eq formats and solutions onto your cheat sheet as possible. Do an ass load of practice problems to the point where even if you don't really know what you're doing you can apply some predefined strategy onto almost anything. Go through past exam problems and do the same.

Chances are, the final is also going to be atrocious. If your midterm had a 35% median (I'm assuming the midterm was only on the linalg stuff? That's how it was then I took it) them you can bet it's gonna be really low for the final. You don't need to actually be able to solve any of the problems on the final, you need to be able to solve about 40% of any individual problem on the final. Rake in that partial credit by applying your predefined strategies. Even if you can't really solve the problem, you can get enough partial credit to beat the median. When I took the math 54 final I don't think I fully correctly solved a single problem. I made a B+ in the class. 

If you want good advice, it's pretty much the same for every class and you can find tons of it. Go to office hours and get help. If your gsi sucks like mine did, go to tutoring or the SLC. Use past midterms as practice midterms (try to treat them like real midterms). Supplement those with problems from the book. If you can make heads or tales of the 54 textbook (I sure couldn't) use that to your advantage. Speak to the professor about what strategies you should use to prepare for the final, they'll often drop hints. Paul's online math notes is pretty helpful for diff eqs. If you can do any random problem put in front of you off of your quizzes or past midterms by the time you walk into the exam, you'll probably do well. ",1509494720

"sonos","t5_2ucpt","Thank you!

That page is perfect and looks regularly updated, including yesterday. If there still are services that can monitor page changes, I'll use them as I have before. If not, I'll script something.

I took some options off the URL and am going to use this:

https://sonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4343

As far as the blog, it might cover something as big as going from public beta to GA (which I'm betting won't fix these big problems); but probably won't cover updates.

I think I answered your what's horrible question in my OP, but will try again with more info.

====================================

What's so horrible? Even if you use Amazon Music, potentially quite a bit.

Sonos is neither inexpensive nor limited. It costs four digits for one 5.1 surround single-room system and many multi-room systems. It has consistently and markedly been marketed as a high-quality, well-integrated, multi-room system. If you can do with slightly less good sound, no room integration, and no multi-service integration, there are dozens of other options for much less money.

Here's what the website says:

&gt; Connected, whole-home sound
&gt;&gt;Play Spotify in the kitchen, a podcast in the bathroom, or the same thing everywhere. The Sonos Home Sound System fills as many rooms as you want with sound. And every Sonos speaker is built to deliver crystal clear sound with zero distortion, at any volume.

…not with Alexa.

* No support for Spotify, etc.

Why would you say ""besides""? Years of playlists. Uploaded library of music I own that's not streamable otherwise. Strength of Sonos being a seamless integration across services. These aren't things one deserve dismissal with a ""besides.""  

All-in-all, it's a big disappointment and a step back from how people currently use Sonos. It also looks like bad-faith on the part of Amazon (as with their not selling things like the Chromecast, not supporting casting to Fire Stick/ TV, and plenty more). 

* Lack of support for groups

On the one hand, even remotes like the Harmony Hub remotes don't support this. On the other hand, Sonos has been working on ""getting the experience right"" for over a year. Amateur devs have done groups in the meantime, while Sonos hasn't even done a party mode (whole house). In a company whose future is famously threatened, this doesn't make them appear to be hungry to succeed. This lack of feature makes voice-control feel like one step forward, one step back.

You already can (have to?) specify where to play. How about pre-defined groups? The Alexa app already has the pieces needed. So little apparent additional dev needed.

* The unexpected fatal flaw: Audio Ducking

I turned on the Sonos skill in Alexa in spite of all the above. Why not? So what if it doesn't have what I think it could easily have, what would make it 10x the experience it is? It's not like it breaks anything.

Or is it? It breaks the Dot I have plugged in to my PLAY:5. …but I'll just pull that connection, right?

No.

No matter what I do (I can't turn off audio ducking, which wouldn't be great anyway), if I have the skill enabled, every room in the house gets interrupted when I do anything with any Alexa. ""Alexa, play some music"" or ""Alexa, turn off the hall lights""? Everybody watching TV in another room has to not hear for a blip. ""Alexa, what's the weather?""

But with the video analysis and practice, batters are getting better at catching up to those fastballs. On the other hand, balls with a lot of movement and with lower velocity are less likely to fly out of the park.

My parents took her, my brother, my godparents and their kids (basically family to me, I call the kids my cousins and my godparents Aunt and Uncle), and I to a really nice restaurant since my cousin was in town from Boston. She flipped out at how fancy it was and threw a fit at the table. It was legitimately embarrassing. I realized then that it probably wasn't meant to be, but I wasted another 2-3 years with her before we broke up.

The point is, if she's not even willing to pretend to be nice when your parents take you both out for a very nice dinner, then she has some attitude problems that need to be worked on. I'd eat awful food and tell my current girlfriend's parents it was the best thing I've ever eaten if I had to, because that's just part of being polite. She decided not to be polite then tried to blame it on you.

Also it seems like she doesn't have any desire to get to know your family. This happens a lot in relationships. It seems like your parents were very nice to her and she just decided to not be nice back.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.",1509494731

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","**Budget:** $1 - $200 (USD). Slightly flexible. 

**Source:** Galaxy S8 and MacBook Air

**Requirements for Isolation:** The more the better, I'm a college student who spends ~7 hours in the library where it's completely silent. 

**Will You be Using These Headphones in Public?:** Yes; mainly walking to class and on public transportation. 

**Preferred Type of Headphone:** IEM. I prefer something that is light, and easy to store in my backpack during classes. 

**Preferred Tonal Balance:** Overall balanced, but wouldn't mind a skew favoring the bass-spectrum. 

**Past Headphones:** urBeats^3 and Samsung Galaxy S8 AKG Earbuds. I enjoyed both of them. But one broke and the other was stolen (along with my entire backpack). I would take AKG over Beats for comfort, which is important, due to long stints in the library. 

**Preferred Music:** House music (Progressive, Techno, Deep, Tropical), and film scores (Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore, etc.) 

**What Would You Like to Improve on From Your Set-Up?:** Mainly, I'm looking for something comfortable that cancels a lot of noise. I like being able to put on my music and escape while I'm studying. I really want to be able to enjoy the music, too, so something with higher-quality sound would be great! 

I hardly know anything about headphones, but music is a huge part of my daily life, and I really want to be able to enjoy what I'm listening to. I welcome and appreciate any advice that is offered, and thank you ahead of time! ",1509494731

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Sorry, was too busy at that moment to properly source. Allow me to expound on this particular spout of bullshit.

I would agree that Open Worm is the defacto leader in this area, and that they have made impressive progress. However, one their project co-founders expressly said 2 years ago that they're ""only 20-30% of the way to where we need to get"" (about halfway down the article [here](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/)). Granted, 2 years is a lifetime nowadays, but here is the [list of publications](http://www.openworm.org/publications.html) -- seems like their main thrust is Sibernetic for the biophysics of the body. Their website also does not claim to have successful simulations when you look at their milestones and history.

Semantics aside, I guess having a ""successful simulation"" means something very different to me -- I don't think a successful scientific discovery here will come in the form of a [lego](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/weve-put-worms-mind-lego-robot-body-180953399/) or arduino representation. It's cool and brings attention, but what does it add scientifically? A true simulation should allow for manipulations that make observations about what real experiments will (or have) demonstrated. The simulations *should make predictions that are scientifically testable.*

As a concrete example, I'd like to see a simulation with the ability to change properties of individual neurons and have behavioral repercussions that mirror actual experiments. For example, modifying channels in (inhibitory) GABA neurons to [alter the head movement circuit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854516/) or [ventral motor circuit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2679701/). There's a long line of genetic experiments because they make a great model experiment for genetic manipulation analyses (they grow up fast, have a mapped connectome, etc.). A working simulation (in my view) should reproduce those works or give predictions for future experiments that haven't been carried out yet.

And none of this is to say that this work (and lego/arduino instantiations) aren't super cool or relevant.

/u/Darkmatter010, also that block quote expressly says that this project ""is being pursued,"" and never says that a simulation is complete. But wikipedia isn't a great platform, and I shouldn't have started from there.

She is still as emotional towards Sasuke as Sakura is so you'll still get that (crying about killing him/dramatically running towards him in the middle of the war for example) but at least you wouldnt get the annoying love triangle since Naruto doesnt like her and so she cant string him along like Sakura did. So the group dynamic wouldnt be as bad. Although that changes when Sai joins since we know Ino likes both of them but since Sasuke and Sai are never in team 7 at the same time there still wouldnt be a love triangle. 

In battle if anything team 7 would be worse off since her jutsu would be worthless since she needs constant protection to perform it . As Sasuke and Naruto are both gung ho characters, she cant do the mind transfer and is basically left hiding behind a tree like the team 10 hidan/kakazu fight. Also nearly all the stuff you talked about Ino potentially doing with her mind transfer she cant actually do, especially since most the stuff your talking about happens in part 1/early shippuden and her jutsu is borderline useless till the war arc.  

If anything tenten would serve as the best female teammate for team 7. She has no feelings for Sasuke so you avoid all that emotional crap. Her long range jutsu is useful and would compliment the close-mid range style of Naruto and Sasuke.",1509494736

The entire point of the loot box system is to drive you into enough frustration to make you purchase something, it doesn't rely on you buying a lot, it relies on you simply buying. Whales either happen, or they don't. If they whaling begins to occur during your hype period, you push the model as far as you can until whales die out, that's only reasonable. Not to mention you still are making money from EA sales and upgrade packs, which I will address further below as I feel you are not being honest in your comparisons later.



&gt; If I have read this correctly, you are assuming that a publisher will double down on a project if it is not an immediate financial success. I am not so convinced on this matter.

Good thing I'm not trying to convince you. NCSoft has been keeping failing games alive (Wildstar) for longer than you would expect simply because they are still profitable, not as profitable as they would want them to be I bet, but it still hasn't fallen below the point where NCsoft would shut it down out of necessity, neither did they employ any of the loot box crap. NCsoft is also a company that shows it's financial reports to the public, if you wish to look that up. It's yet again, a question of greed, not need.

Also you completely missed my point, which might be me failing to explain myself as well so no hard feelings here. This isn't a failing project neither am I trying to paint it as one, Fortnite is a success. If people will stop buying llamas at this point, the model will change, the game will not die out. There are more than enough examples of this happening as well, you can see how Warframe initially started out, how pay restricted it was, and how free it became with time. And Warframe had nowhere the amount of resources FN has to begin with, it's once again, a question of greed and / or proper project management. But I won't be guessing here since FN started it's development very early and lived through a hostile takeover.

&gt; We may see studios such as Turtle Rock give half-hearted attempts to revive a title

You can also see ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2. There are ways of doing things, Evolve was not exactly a hit to begin with, it was a very niche game and marketed itself poorly in my opinion. But I guess Evolve is a good example of F2P done out of financial necessity with the risk of bankruptcy.

&gt; the lines between platforms have blurred substantially. 

Can't agree with you here. Mobile gaming and PC gaming are financially different, mobile games don't actually rely on EA sales / box sales / preorders to measure their success, they don't rely on publishers and outside investors as heavily as PC games do, they also don't have any other revenue than in-app purchases to indicate their success, so obviously SWRVE's statistics aren't a great example, in fact, they are of no example at all considering the fact that you can never know how much money was made from EA purchases vs llamas. It's an educated guess that llamas make more, but it's far from reality to think that they are far as 90% of the game's income. If I had to guess, the upgrade packs made more simply because they are a much easier sell.

&gt; As the costs of development continue to rise rapidly, the cost of traditional games has been rather stagnant over the last decade.

It's true that box prices didn't change, but the financial models did. Are you implying that loot boxes are a logical outcome, or are you implying they are the only outcome? Because I can agree it's reasonable to take an already working model (mobile) and apply it to your platform, but I definitely won't agree that it's the only way, I personally think it's lazy.

&gt; Publishers over-hire to hit target dates and then cut those non-essential positions as they cannot guarantee that they can afford them through the lifespan of the game.

That's pretty much any project with a deadline, including film productions and fashion industry. (Or at least those two I can speak for) Game studios aren't unique in that sense.

&gt; No. Many of us recognize them to be a way to support publishers/devs and treat them accordingly.

That's an odd way of supporting the devs, but to each their own. I personally don't see Tencent as in need of my support because I am familiar with their practices, they have no philosophy behind their dogmatic lust for dope. Wow now that sounded preachy, but it's still true, I'll just leave it there. I probably don't need to explain why this model is predatory and morally twisted to begin with, you know that much better than I do most likely.

You are generally right, if EPIC was the only body involved in this, your investment would probably benefit the devs based on the subjective desire of the higher ups to either increase salaries according to income, or not. I would still never take that bet if my aim was to support the devs, and I much rather not support a predatory practice.

&gt; Ultimately, lootboxes and DLC aren't so much the problem as they are signals that the system itself is screwed up.

Lootboxes and DLC's are two different things. I'm not sure why do  you consider DLC's a ""signal"" to a problem as long as the base game wasn't ripped apart to create said DLC's... And even then, it's not half the psychological trick that lootboxes are. DLC's are a legitimate way of making more money out of more content in my eyes, as long as the game that was released doesn't feel ripped apart. But that's me, I just like knowing what I pay for.

&gt; Data absolutely reinforces what we all know is true: whales drive revenue. Success for publishers and VC's is measured with a $.

Mobile markets. Again. They are two different things and  you should never compare a game with more than one way of income to a game with one model. The comparison is simply not honest. PC games don't NEED loot boxes or micro transactions in order to survive, it's once again (I swear this is the last time!) a question of greed, not need.

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","I'm not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt.

&gt; If you think progress continues, what have you seen in the last 5-10 years you believe is worthy?

- LLVM appears to have been developing as a nice common compilation system for many languages.
- Haskell appears to be doing great things in the functional programming domain.
- Racket's work on languages also has been important as a modern extension of Lisp
- Rust's work in safety in concurrency is immensely important if (probably, when) it reaches critical mass.
- Proof carrying code sounds important. This could be used as a basis for algorithm classification, perhaps? But then again, perhaps Godel has something to say against that.

&gt;  Is this what you mean by stuck, or do you believe progress has stopped altogether?

No, because there's too many people working on things. It's just that the common worker remains uninterested by this progress.

&gt;  What do you mean by HCI Integration as it relates to languages?

HCI has a lot of lessons to teach people about systems design, I could guess. User modeling and process modeling, and other ways of applying empirical methods to system design and optimization. People do not treat programming languages and ecosystems as interfaces that should strive for improvements in usability and design -- instead, people only care about power. The pedagogical angle is also useful for caring about ""how easy"" languages are to learn, as we teach more than just syntax but also design patterns, idioms, etc. Programming languages are a unique blend between HCI, linguistics, and computational theory. Too often, we treat it as only a program -- just think about how much information about a program is actually in the comments or variable names or the design structure, etc. Why have we not incorporated this?

&gt; What emphasis should be placed on ecosystems tools that is not already being pursued by Microsoft, Oracle, JetBrains, Google, Apple, Facebook, Mozilla and others?

I don't have enough experience to speak for this.

&gt; Are we at nearly at the end of useful innovations in programming language design, or are there valuable linguistic directions you would like to see pursued?

It's arrogant and near-sighted to insist that ""this is it"" and that the field is exhausted. We have still not solved metaprogramming, modeling and documentation, code generation, algorithm classification, translation between languages, and teaching of programming languages.

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","&gt;  As it stands there can be no good gameplay with CVs no matter how the numbers are balanced.

No matter how much you repeat this, it won't somehow become true. You simply don't like the existence of a hard counter to warship-grade magical invisibility cloaks.

&gt;In any case the impact of their ludacrous vision superiority is terrible for gameplay.

That's backwards. Stealth, the ridiculous stealth arms race, is terrible for gameplay. One of the factors in high tier passivity is that ships get so stealthy you never now when you might get ambushed by half the enemy force, or just one battleship with cruiser-like concealment out to make yet another surprise deletion gif. Do I need to remind everyone here how much of a no-brainer Concealment Expert and the concealment module are on damn near every ship out there?

Stealth is what makes DDs still the second most popular class (games with four-five DDs per side are regular sightings on EU) despite torps being laughably non-threats, despite BB AP, despite radar/sonar creep, and, yes, despite the couple CV players still clinging to existence. Because being the stealthiest ship around grants you better survivability than any armour and lets you single-handedly win the late game.

In and of itself that needs not be bad; that simply means it is desirable that there exist counters to such a strong ability. If information and the concealment thereof is to be such a key element of battle, then there needs to be ways to fight the information battle. Carriers can excel at it, at the opportunity cost of dedicating and eventually expending planes with a different original purpose and while having to fend off their counterpart. It could be the job of DDs, but all too often they won't take on the task; someone has to.",1509494740

The chances that he would EVER see prison even for state crime are slim, but the SS has (as far as we know) no protocols for that.

&gt;Her moves would probably be heavily based on utilizing capsules to summon technological weapons/vehicles, a sort of gimmick keep-away character in a game that's currently dominated by rushdown tactics.

But's that not bulma, she doesn't do that. You're just conjuring stuff out of thin air that isn't part of the source material.

&gt;But then again - this would probably take away the slot of XXSSJXXBLACKBROLYOFDOOM, who would be another thrilling rushdown generic Saiyan, and that would be a terrifying prospect indeed.

Also, I'd imagine that women can feel incredibly vulnerable, especially in NSFW subreddits where men dominate, because they receive pushy or otherwise unwelcome messages when they expose themselves. But yea, men certainly receive much fewer replies than women, except for maybe M4M.

Today, the comedian would be frowned upon as well.

The short answer is that American perceptions of age and sexual maturity are tightening a bit with each generation, likely mostly for the best (though I'd argue it's a mixed bag), and had this event come out a year after it happened, it probably wouldn't be much of a big deal by now.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","I’ve seen that you mentioned that you play paladin.

The general concept is basically, enough cooldowns so you won’t die and also allowing the healer some breathing space to keep you up. Keep in mind that tanking and healing is largely interconnected. Should you choose to not use a cooldown, a healer can spare you some by using theirs and giving you a larger shield. For example, scholar using largesse and giving you adloquim. However they might have a plan of using their cooldowns for other mechanics. Force them to blow a lustrate on you and they might not have another awtherflow to use sacred soil for mitigation on other things. In an ideal scenario you really want to communicate with your healers and co tank on how to best utilise all of your abilities to smoothen out the fight.

The next thing I want to talk about is your abilities and pairing. Big cooldowns can go on their own. Hallowed for example basically allows you to outright ignore the tankbuster. Since it is on such a Long cooldown, it’s use has to really be planned out. It is your most powerful cd and while you can save it for emergencies, it is far better to use it for a planned buster.  
Sentinel is also huge and can be used by itself.  
Rampart is a mid tier cooldown and will be nicer if you can pair it with something else such as convalescence.  
Bulwark isn’t reliable on its own so you mainly use it to build oath and soften auto attacks.  
Sheltron should be used as much as possible, oath gauge allowing. Don’t go blowing your oath gauge if you know a buster is coming.  
Anticipation and awareness are situational stuff. Can be useful in certain fights but mostly not required.  
Your other cooldown abilities are more team oriented rather than solo.  
Cover and intervention are cooldowns. Just used in a different way in which I’ll talk about more later. However you will use them on another person rather than yourself. Damage is still reduced hence the “cooldown”.  
Divine veil and passage of arms works in the same vein as well.  
The last cooldown you have is actually called SHIELD OATH. This stance is a permanent cooldown.

Now that we have gone through your abilities, what I want to next talk about is more important. It is called mitigation UPTIME. You want your cooldowns to last as Long as possible and cover as many things as possible. Paladin isn’t really very good at this but still decent. War takes the cake on this one. Consider your rampart duration and cooldown. It lasts for 20s and cooldowns for 90. This means that if you use it on cooldown, you have a 22% mitigation uptime. What if however your co tank swaps with you and used theirs? You now both have a combined mitigation uptime of 44%! Here’s where it gets better, both of you have more than just rampart. By staggering your abilities and only use enough you can actually soften damage for a very Long time. (This goes back to how tanking and healing is interconnected) keep in mind also range support abilities such as addle, front and palisade.

What to actually use will come with experience and planning for in which by only doing content will you learn.",1509494747

Many years ago, our world was filled with people and villagers. Any chunk of world you were in, you were likely to see at least one other person around you. It made dates awkward. Villages were larger to keep up with an ever expanding population. More people started appearing and more villagers were breeding. But our world could cope with it.

Then, one day, in the Testifi Mountains, a project was complete: a cross dimensional gateway to a new realm they called ""The Nether"". Our scientists went into the new world to explore it's hell-like landscape. We discovered pigmen and ghasts within days. Endermen, rarely seen in our world, were also seen in the nether, but even more rarely than in our world. 

After months, we found a fortress. This is where it went wrong. An army of skeletons, but with swords instead of bows. They were tall, boney and dark. Anyone they touched slowly withered away. We named them the Wither Skeletons because of this. We had no idea that as well as opening a gateway to a new world, we opened up a gateway to war. 

Ghasts invaded us in force, our best warriors defending us. Luckily the portal was patrolled and the order was given to kill everything in the nether. But it came with a price... most of our men were lost in there. Their bodies withered to dust, but the soul remained. Eternal screaming from the dead... this was a real hell now. We saw evidence of another fortress after a few weeks and decided to shut the portal down to prevent further losses.

Our population dwindled. All our players died and most villagers, too. Many of the villagers alive today are their children grandchildren. In honour of the lives lost, we named them after the mountain where the portal first activated: Testificates.",1509494747

What might (but probably won't) work is this. They could jointly send her a certified letter, telling her that she now won't see the baby for at minimum another 3 months, d/t her behavior.  And the next time she shows up, they WILL call the police.

She has really given them no other option. But your SIL may be holding out hope that her mother will, somehow, come to her senses. It's highly unlikely. But a letter spelling out the consequences of continued trespassing will let her know exactly what's at stake.

1. You have a ton of free space on ""Old Drive"". Copy all your files there.

2. Install CCleaner. Run it on C:. This will clean out a lot of junk, including internet cache.

3. Open Windows Disk Cleanup. Hit the System Files button. Check all the check boxes. Run it. We're primarily targeting the Windows Update installation files (what allows you to roll back updates).

4. Check if you're under 250GB used. If not, install WinDirStat to see what programs are eating space. Form a plan to get under 250GB and uninstall. Confirm you're under 250GB used.

5. Defragment C: (may not be required depending on shrink method in next step)

6. Google and perform a Shrink Partition method on C: to less than 250GB.

7. Install your SSD.

8. Google and perform a Clone method from C: to SSD.

9. Change boot drive in BIOS to SSD. Confirm it works.

10. Use Windows Disk Management to delete &amp; create a new partition on the old C:. Format the partition NTFS.

11. Move your data from Old Drive to your old C:.

This will take you longer than just reinstalling unless you have a lot of download or CD software. It may not be worth it.

Also, your Old Drive is...old. You may want to backup critical documents to the cloud in case Old Drive fails during this process.",1509494751

How will we trade with people who have nothing? How will people without food or homes start businesses? How will businesses get skilled labour without a decent education system? It is all very well to say trade is what it will take to improve these lives, but what will help a starving person more - a free meal, or consumer goods? If we want to trade with nations we first have to, as one of the richest nations in the world, and with a colonial history in many of the countries we now supply aid to, tackle global unequalities and share out some of our excesses to the people who have nothing?

"gainit","t5_2s9bg","[Lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/99/5/1251S.full):

&gt; The lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. The bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. The increasing pH as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people.

So it sounds like live active cultures help.  As someone who experiences explosive diarrhea when drinking moderately large quantities of milk, I can say that the same thing doesn't happen when I have large amounts of yogurt.

Of course, now you're buying yogurt and milk instead of just Lactaid.  I get both anyway, though.",1509494754

If you were going to check against a random female NPC (non-player character) you'd probably have to do a charisma check.

For thieving, it would be a dexterity check.

That said, people who do nasty stuff with their characters, like sexual violence, get kicked off campaigns.

The first thing the Dungeon Master does, if they're smart, is a check against alignment; if it's wrong, they figure out some way to punish the character (their particular deity / god their character would punish them for committing a bad thing, just as they are doing).

Maybe the charisma check fails, and the female NPC ends up pulling a knife... because she doesn't like you trying to work your charms on her.

And then you roll for initiative for combat, because she's a level 9 fighter, with a +4 sword in addition to the +2 knife that she's already got visible... you probably shouldn't have done that... if you're lucky, she might let you live.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","&gt;Ok first of all Em isn't the most influential of the generation, that'd be yeezy , but Ems definitely had alot of influence, no argument there 

You are wrong. Like... way, way wrong. Kanye is definitely a huge influence, musically. But Eminem **literally** made hip hop what it is in the 2000s. He influenced just about every single artist around right now, as well as almost every single artist **in the world**. The difference between Ye and Eminem is that Kanye has sold 32 million copies world wide. Eminem has sold 160 million at least. 

160 fucking Million. 

I get that Em is hated and Ye is loved on this subreddit. But saying Ye is even on the same plain of existance as Em. Saying any rapper in the 2k's is on the same plain as Eminem... or any rapper **ever** is on the same plain as Eminem, is fucking retarded. Hate his music. Hate him as a person. That doesn't matter. What matters is the fact that he is more in line with someone like Elton John, MJ, Madonna, etc. And that's an objective fact. 

If you want to see sales figures, here ya go : [Eminem](http://www.statisticbrain.com/eminem-album-sales-statistics/) / [Kanye](http://www.statisticbrain.com/kanye-west-total-album-sales/)

And to debunk the point that every single HHH user brings up when they get faced with facts. The anecdotal point of, ""You don't have to sell a lot to be unfluential!"" Wrong.

Wrong.

Yes, you do. You have to sell enough to actually get your reach out there. For enough people to listen to you to **become** influential. For you to be a name known by many so it is survived by the few inspired. That's why we aren't seeing Joey from the block who sold 32 printed copies of his mixtape influencing a modern generation. 

__________

&gt;Kanyes been using choirs since 2004 .

Here's the point. Kanye, especialy in his recent album, really didn't innovate. He literally just copied what worked for him before and what his peers are doing. Hell, half his song was an advertisement for another song, Panda. He imitated the trap sound, then imitated his own industrial sound from Yeezus, and then included some choir/jazzy stuff because that's **the in thing**. And it is **the in thing** because of both Chance and Kendrick. More so Kendrick, because TPAB was the most popular hip hop record of 2015. 

____________

&gt;And crital acclaim does not mean influence ; 808s and Hearbreak is Kanyes least critically acclaimed album and its the most influential album of the decade .

Critical acclaim can definitely be a factor in influence, though. 808s definitely shaped the sound of hip hop, it is very influential, in my opinion. But sometimes audience acclaim does that job for others, or even artists latching onto the sound. 

&gt;Young Thug , Frank Ocean and Rocky's influence is still to come and to be seen . Uzi cites both Thug and Rocky as influences , Ian Connor is clearly influenced by Frank Ocean, but you're right, as of now Frank Oceans influence on hip hop isn't wide spread , it will be though . Same with Young Thug.

Yeah, so that is to be seen, you are right. So... claiming any of that to be true is just irrelevant. ",1509494757

1. **Saying incriminating shit on the internet doesnt mean shit unless it can be substantiated by objective facts and evidence, which is difficult af to prove because its the internet.**

* All the fuzz can do is get your IP history, **if they are monitoring the vendor or you. Looking at a website isnt grounds for PC.** Nor is saying anything ""Incriminating"" because, for all the baconsuckers know: **you could be lying or mentally ill.**

* Anyone can plug your IP if you arent using Vlassun's and GD/BC for ords. If you have multiple PO's in different **real** peoples names and locations, you're good. Wait a few days to lick the pick and split.

* **The reason I say this is that there are literally MILLIONS of packages which go through USPS (and dont forget UPS and FedEx as well.)** 
____________________________

1.1 The only way they can get probable cause for a warrant is if **the sender, not you** is compromised. As I said above, **for all the cops know (and that includes actual reconissance,) you could be lying or sick.** Doesnt matter if you say you're el fucking chapo because: 

A).The CIA knows you're not.

B). The DEA knows you're not

C). The FBI knows you're not.

D). The ATF knows you're not.

And you know how they know this? 

**Because the NSA and SS can track anyone connected to the internet *RealTime* and will inform them you aint shit.** If you're not committing terrorism/treason, threatening anyone, or have a record for fraud/assault/P&amp;D, you're clear.

* Trust me: **LE DOES NOT have the resources to fish small, even in small towns, because its not worth the time or money due to the extraneous burden of proof they need to gather for a judge to sign off on a warrant.** They have to get the dogs, have them hit properly on the package, correlate it with the shitlists, etfuckingcetera.

Translation: **the process is slow and arduous af. If you arent in the public eye, you've committed no crime.**

* To that end, bc packs (real weight, talking anything over a Zipper, depending on the substance(s)) are overnighted and dropped to vacant residencies, it makes it incredibly difficult for LE to prove shit. 

_______________________

1.2 Lastly, **Do not use fake IDs.** This will get you on the shiteaters shitlist quick. As will ordering any curses and workings: unless you know a good eyer, don't try it. Acting suspicious, mustard, dryer sheets, sending only packs &amp; no other mail, wrong address/ZC: any of these things will redflag you. 

* If you ship house (or PO) and they come a'knockin: **Dont answer that fucking door.** They can leave it, as per *""your""* instruction. If they send a CD, **DO NOT FUCKING SIGN IT. SAY ""IDK WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, I DONT SIGN ANYTHING WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY.""**

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","My church needed to build a new building as the old landlord wanted to kick us out (they wanted to repurpose the building for retail instead of auditorium.) 

In my country real estate is really really expensive, and we had 20,000 members at the time. Renting a new venue that fit our size was too expensive, and building a church just for us was impossible due to government policy. 

So we had to partner with the local developers to build a “integrated civic and recreational hub” in order to build an auditorium for our services. Problem was, Land was so expensive and building costs, that the whole project would cost us $400million. 


The pastors had begun planning fundraisers and fun fairs (while admitting that such things were neither fun nor fair) but the founding senior pastor declared no. All we would be doing to raise funds was through a special offering service, once a year. 

The church had also been prudent in the past, having saved up 20% of its income every year, and had invested wisely in other areas, greatly reducing the burden but it was still a large sum in the range of $280 million.  

We started collecting offerings for it in 2011. We also skipped a year, having no special offering service in 2014. By 2016, it was fully paid off, no debt remaining.  Today it stands a miracle, on Sundays it’s used by us exclusively, but rented out to other gigs on other days, complying with government policy. 

There was only 1 instance of a million dollars donation. And I have personally seen people who have given, their seed has multiplied.

What they want to do is continue to use that tech for as long as money is made on it. Season passes and dlc was one way of guaranteeing it, but that's basically a hard cut off point, after that no more content will be made. With Lootcrates, they can put as much additional support and new content for however long they see money. If no one buys any crates, no more maps, but people still have the full game to play. If loads of crates sell, they have the justification to spend more time with the game, maximising investment.

Since Chase IP only does 5x on cell phone bill payments, not on phone purchases, when I recently upgraded my phone I took advantage of the AmEx offer, earning 10x on the initial phone price, and then I will move the payment back to my Chase IP.  
This, in addition to temporarily routing my cable and satellite bills to a couple of different AmEx cards. Every little bit helps...

The history of religion is complex and messy. There's good things that happen in the name of religion. There's bad things that happen in the name of religion. There's men and women who are lifted up and do amazing, other-worldy things to bring people closer to God. There have been, are, and will be men and women who make major mistakes in the name of religion. 

Those ""historical baggage"" questions /u/Buzzed-not-drunk mentions are questions that have been debated in serious academic circles for over 50 years, and many of them don't have consensus (like polygamy) or have additional evidence that most of the believing Mormon public aren't aware of (blacks and the priesthood).

It's one of the most important equations in quantum mechanics. ""H"" is the [Hamiltonian operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)).
 When you apply this operator to the wavefunction, you get the energy of the system back out; put more concisely, the energy of the system is an [eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of the Hamiltonian.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","It depends on the game. I always have jump/mantle on the rear left that's most comfortable to use. I typically have melee on the right (I like to have stance change on R3 so I don't accidentally melee when startled, usually better to change stance in those instances). The other two inputs vary based on the game... Some games they might be a d-pad input (Battlefield gadgets or night vision and gadgets in Wildlands for example). Jump and melee are usually the big ones though. Or if you prefer melee on R3 you could move stance to a rear input. It usually boils to having jump, melee, and stance change in positions where I don't need to take my thumb off the sticks when I can be aiming/looking/shooting. I usually find a good use for at least two rear inputs on most games (even non-shooters). In Elite Dangerous I liked having my power distribution on the rear buttons... Easier to switch between shields, engines and weapon (and combos of each) while staying focused on dogfighting.",1509494769

* If IOS then you'd need to link your account on IOS device first then on Bluestacks go through the tutorial then on the main menu override account.  It will then overwrite with your IOS account.

Once done your devices will forever stay synched so you can jump between the two.  One thing though, if you start a dungeon/stage on one device I believe you need to complete it on that device.  If you change it will kick you out of the dungeon and potentially lose progress and stamina.

I think for someone that got a really shit education her Portuguese was really good, so that confirm to me that she is more versed on the knowledge area. I think they both should learn English, but it kind irks me Pole with his high school *spanish* trying to speak Portuguese. It’s insulting, but I’m glad they’re learning. Ideally they both should speak each other Family so he could communicate with her family. 

On Brasil is *vastly* ( using loosely ) different of most of the Spanish Latin America countries on that side. Were a nation that it’s build open different ethnicities and we have no issues with people dating other people that have a different amount of melanin. There is not even a name for it, as you say interracial in English. However the racism is there and she will suffer, but the opportunity to grown up is there , more even so if she works for the government since they have quota for ethnicity and she being from indigenous would help. *federal government pay is crazy good.   

It’s a highly complex topic, I’m just brushing it. But it’s different, and if you actually live on a tribal land you’re subject to all kind of different laws. Anyway, what I’m saying is there is a stigma and it is racism, but it’s not a definitive step back either. I understand your point and I agree, it’s more limited and there is racism but Brasil is huge and it’s the 9th economy in the world so it is doable , not easy but doable.
There is also the distinction of being white , or black , or indigenous , or Asian in Brasil however it’s strictly a little bit different. But simply yes if you’re white it can be easier than the others. 

I think the blondie is a factor specifically due to the more indigenous population on that area. And pole like that she’s pretty and exotic as you said.

What people need to realize is that there's no such a thing as a fashion statement, because clothes and hairstyles can't express your thoughts and opinions in an articulate manner. It's vapid, banal and straight up pointless.

Society has many problems, but ordinariness and lack of inspiration when it comes to clothes should be the least of our concerns, and it's merely a manifestation of an underlying issue - lack of original thought. Letting commodities that you wear, consume and dye your hair with define you is not a solution to the problem, it is the problem. You took a different approach but arrived at the same conclusion. Ever wondered why most subcultures end up getting commercialized in the end? Precisely because some people think that individuality can be commodified and purchased at your local Hot Topic or wherever subculture pawns buy their ""rebellious"" attitude.

Wanna rebel against the system? That's great! Go volunteer. Write a book. Donate to the charity. Do something instead of passively wearing your opinions. Make an actual change.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Pennsylvanian here.  Come from a strong Republican family, currently lost politically.   

Basically it boils down to resentment against the Democratic party for the falldown of the economies of the middle of the country.  Rust belt, midwest, great plains farms have all felt a major brunt of the economic downturn and didn't get the resurgence the coasts did in the transition to a post-industrial economy.  

Unemployment and drug use are rampant and there is this idea that the unions failed them and the Democratic party failed the unions.    Then there is this christian revivalism that hit the country in the 80s-00s that pushed people to the ""Christian Party,"" of Reagan.   


Then people just sort of....stuck.   


They hated the Democrats and then it all kind of blew up with Clinton being seen as just another politician and Trump being ""Different"" and telling it like it is.  


Then there are racial tensions and people seeing more violence in the wake of the 3rd wave civil rights movement we have forming in the wake of Occupy Wallstreet and Black Lives Matters and viewing that as an outgrowth of Obama and actually driving down minority votes a bit as people in those communities feel even more disenfranchised.  It drove a backlash against Obama and the democratic party.  


Even in purple parts of Pennsylvania people saw the need for ""change"" as it was portrayed.  People collectively have a short memory.   They wanted a different tax system since they saw Obama as being the taxer and Democrats as supporting it. 

Add in the Obamacare issues, some healthy doses or racism, a fair amount of Veteran animosity towards the government that pretty much failed them and continues to fail them with the abomination that is the VA and Tricare and you have a lot of people that see Domestic as the biggest issue and don't care about Russia and frankly don't believe the news when they talk about it anymore since only Fox said Trump would win and now Fox is saying Trump is right and don't forget about the Uranium being thrown out now.   


Really, there are a lot of issues and it won't change next election, it's going to get worse barring Trump getting Indicted.  ",1509494771

- PG 6'5"" Max Wingspan, Minimum Weight, Primary; Playmaker, Secondary; Sharpshooter 

I think this maybe the strongest build in the game that only gets minor recognition. 

It has great speed, can speed boost, momentum crossover, gets elite rhythm dribbles, strokes threes, can attack the paint, lights out mid-range, good moving mid-range shots with Gold PnR Meastro + Silver Difficult Shots, plays good defense with speed/size and sets teammates up with gold dimer.

I think this build maybe one of the most deverse builds in the game.

Most women aren't interested in dating poly people.  In my experience, they're  not going to suddenly get interested because they got to know him a tiny bit better. 

So the question is, would he rather the women who aren't going to be interested in him go away before or after he's started to bond with them?

If you're up front about it from minute one, you have a lot fewer potential first dates. But no fewer potential relationships. It just saves everyone frustration. 

It can be hard to accept that.  Sometimes it seems better to maintain the illusion that you have a billion potential relationships.  But it's never anything but an illusion. I find that letting go of it just brings me fewer, but deeper, interactions with women.  And I prefer that to more, shorter and more disappointing ones.

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","&gt; Issue 1: does great resistor will dissipate electrones as heat or will it just prevent the electrones from ""passing through""?

Both and neither. A large resistance will only let a small number of electrons pass through per second, but they DO pass through. Even if it's only 0.1V connected to a 10,000,000,000Ω resistor, *some* electrons will pass through (specifically around 64.4 million electrons / second if my calculations are correct). They do not, however, get dissipated. Every electron that goes in, comes out. On the way through the resistor, they transfer their own stored energy to the molecules of the resistor, which heats them up (or, in LEDs, the energy gets converted to photons and is emitted as light). Think of it like there are a bunch of weights. These are the electrons. Now imagine grabbing these and climbing up a long staircase - now your weights store energy, since you moved them upwards against the force of gravity. If you tie a rope to them and drop them down to where they started, they'll deplete the energy you gave them and transfer it to whatever the other end of the rope is tied to.


Every voltmeter has a chaarcteristic called their input impedance. Voltmeters act like a really high value resistor and do in fact draw a little current from the circuit they are connected to, which is not ideal and voltmeter designers want to minimize this. Yours is not very good, so the impedance is low - 200k. Modern digital voltmeters usually have a 10 million ohm input impedance.

Diodes have an interesting feature: they almost always have the same voltage drop across them. Unlike resistors where you can apply Ohm's law, diodes will act like they're not even there (open circuit) until you reach a voltage (called V(f), forward voltage), after which they ""lock"" onto that. 1mA through a green LED results in around 3.3V across it, but running a whole 1A barely lift the voltage drop near 3.8-4V. This is why when you connect the LED in series with the voltmeter, it doesn't/barely light (too low current = not enough electrons that can transfer their energy to light), but it's enough to make the LED ""lock"" the voltage across it.

That said, usually you don't connect voltmeters in series (they act as gigantic resistors after all - preventing most circuits from working). What you want is to ahve a 1kΩ resistor between the LED and the positive power wire and the led to connect from the resistor to ground. This should make it glow, and you can measure the voltages in the circuit in parallel with components.

It seems like you have a small capacitor in place of the resistor right now - that won't work since capacitors block DC current. Replace it with said 1k resistor to get a glowy LED.


EDIT: This is what I mean about the LED voltage staying the same: [[link]](http://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/circuitjs.html?cct=$+1+0.000005+10.20027730826997+50+5+50%0AR+368+176+368+160+0+0+40+5+0+0+0.5%0Ar+368+176+368+256+0+1000%0A162+368+256+368+336+1+3.8+0+1+0+0.01%0Ag+368+336+368+368+0%0Ax+392+292+416+295+4+12+LED%0Ap+256+256+256+336+1+0%0Aw+256+256+368+256+0%0Aw+256+336+368+336+0%0Ax+183+301+234+304+4+12+Voltmeter%0Aw+608+336+720+336+0%0Aw+608+256+720+256+0%0Ap+608+256+608+336+1+0%0Ax+744+292+885+295+4+12+LED%5Cswith%5Csvery%5Cshigh%5Cscurrent%0Ag+720+336+720+368+0%0A162+720+256+720+336+1+3.8+0+1+0+0.01%0Ar+720+176+720+256+0+1.5%0AR+720+176+720+160+0+0+40+5+0+0+0.5%0Ax+501+355+700+358+4+12+Notice%5Cshow%5Cslittle%5Csthe%5Csvoltage%5Cschanges%0Aw+1104+336+1216+336+0%0Aw+1104+256+1216+256+0%0Ap+1104+256+1104+336+1+0%0Ax+1240+292+1376+295+4+12+LED%5Cswith%5Csvery%5Cslow%5Cscurrent%0Ag+1216+336+1216+368+0%0A162+1216+256+1216+336+1+3.8+0+1+0+0.01%0Ar+1216+176+1216+256+0+200000%0AR+1216+176+1216+160+0+0+40+5+0+0+0.5%0Ax+929+355+1202+358+4+12+Voltage%5Csacross%5Csthe%5CsLED%5Csstill%5Csstays%5Csnearly%5Csthe%5Cssame%0A)",1509494774

To answer your second question: the order of magnitude of the dimensions of momentum in the Lagrangian of the theory determines the potential to be renormalized. The superficial degree of divergence for QED in 4 dimensions luckily doesn't depend on the number of vertices in the diagram we are calculating, so that there are a finite amount of divergent amplitudes.

I will admit gladly that the Asari are trope-y. It upsets me becasue so much of ME actually makes sense, and is very well written. Grounded in science (if you can accept Mass Effect, everything else is possible using that)

That said, nobody really calls the Asari ""she"" we just don't have words for whatever they use. The codex translates it to she because in our language, they are feminine.

They don't have a word to call themselves ""he"" or any reason to prefer other pronouns because their language doesn't have pronouns and thus no gender roles.

There's a hot younger man at her work that she ""depends on"" and is so close with people make jokes about her ""work husband."" You don't know anything about him, but she comes up with reasons to go on dinner dates with him. They exchange gifts. He doesn't know you from Adam and doesn't care to.

They talked a lot about how modern technology helped them, but also about the dangers.  They specifically cited the Reddit response as the number one interference in their investigation.  It forced them to release the photos of the suspects much sooner than they wanted to in order to stop the witch hunts of innocent people.  

As soon as they released those pictures, the bombers panicked and went on a rampage, hijacking an SUV and murdering a cop before ending up in standoff with police in a residential neighborhood where they exchanged automatic gunfire and hurled pipe bombs in front of peoples' houses.

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","Not that we could ever prove it, but genuinely curious... did Houston knowingly agree to terms that included Lane with the intention of failing him on his physical in order to extract more draft capital for Brown?

Seems like Brown had no desire to be in Houston anymore and the team was fed up with him right back. This seems a little too convenient. 

NFL players are banged up at this point in the season, every single one of them. Lanes injury seems to by no means be season threatening, and he’s been listed on the injury report a lot this season. 

I guess my point is Houston should have been pretty well aware of his injury situation before entering into trade talks.  Why even entertain him as a piece of the trade if his groin strain would be a deal breaker, unless of course they were looking for a higher pick from us, but figured this was the most side fire way to get it.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","I have no respect for my ex and think she's incredibly selfish and immature. She wouldn't give me a reason other than that she didn't feel butterflies when she knocked on my door anymore. She felt comfortable. Last time I checked, that was a normal thing to feel after several months. 

She broke up with me in bed first thing in the morning after leading me on by spending the night and drinking with me, all by her request. She had no empathy in her voice. She sounded annoyed that she even had to do it. Told me that she knew this was going to be so much harder for me than it would be for her. Said there was no chance she would ever try this again. Ended up seeing someone else within a couple weeks.

I can understand this if we had some rough patches, but we had literally never argued and were always laughing together and very affectionate. Was telling me how she looked forward to our future just days before ending it. 

My memories now? I look back on them and wonder how many of them were genuine. All those moments that I recall making her so happy are all poisoned by the thought that she was just using me to build confidence until she was ready to get back out there after her last relationship. Maybe she was just going with the flow because it was easier than being alone. 

I hope I never hear from her again. She broke my heart and wouldn't even give me a reason. After she told me all the terrible ways she's been heartbroken and how she would never do that to someone. After coldly telling me nasty things disguised as her trying to look out for my feelings (hint, breaking up with me in my own bed is not sparing any feelings). I was willing to give her a chance to explain herself until I heard she was seeing someone new after a couple weeks. ",1509494781

"Android","t5_2qlqh","&gt; So would the device sending the audio convert all audio to AAC on the fly?

 I can answer that yes, this is what happens. See the article I linked for a detailed breakdown on the bluetooth codecs and their conversions.

&gt;And if so, what effect does this lossy &gt; lossy format conversion have on the quality of the audio?

It's not good, that's for sure, but that's why we need to know the bit-transfer rate. Any files will be converted to that rate. apt-X and apt-X HD are also conversions though (albeit very good ones), so you have to be willing to accept that Bluetooth is ultimately a reduction in quality. 

The majority of people though won't notice the quality dip from a Bluetooth conversion with sufficient bit rate. It's not good, but it's also not really a problem with a properly supplied codec.

I did not say there was differences, at least nothing that warrants the situation we have today if we base the state around cultural regions (removing sectarian identities). Shias in Syria are not a different people from those in Leb. To this day you can find Shias that are in ambiguous situation about whether they're Lebanese or Syrian because there's not a clear demarcation of borders in the east of the country. People in wadi nasara are not a different people from the Orthodox in the Beqaa, etc. 

 I started working at some place months ago and it's runned by lebs but there's a Syrian there. I assumed he was leb and when I later understood he was not, I told him and the only reply he gave me is : ""yeah but there's no differences between leb and syria"" 

I told him I agreed with him but he should be careful to who he says this because some like the phalangists have an irrational behaviour for some reason. He said he did not care. And the guy is of Christian background in case it makes any difference for you.

My point is, there's a geographic area that is  similar in its people and history. Lebanon and Syria are states today, there's no point in trying to downplay this since this is the geopolitical reality. The differences are at most political by nature.",1509494782

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","You definitely don't need to chase more for trinity pieces right now per se. You can create the foundation of your team with the following:

* Y'sh providing healing and protectga/shellga (she's one of the best so you're set; you could also consider leveling up Vanille) 
* Minfilia providing a hastega, buff, protectga/shellga, and a breakdown ability

* Tyro with 2 breakdowns. When he builds up enough SB, he can add a mini-layer of buffs with his USB. You can also throw in Alphinaud with his SSB to provide another layer of buffs + a small amount of DPS, healing, and/or carry half of proshellga, but you don't get the breaks that Tyro can provide to cut the damage you receive. 

* 2 DPS With Alph and Minfilia as buffers, you're basically running a mixed team, so you could have either magic or physical DPS fill the spots. 

Hard to give specifics without knowing what you're struggling with specifically, but here are some general strategies: 


1. Level break Tyro past 65 and get his record materia ""Dr. Mog's Teachings"" (randomly drops in battle) to let someone start with an SB bar. Give it to whoever is carrying your hastega (Minfilia, Papa, Tyro) to let your team start with a hastega. You can do the same to Cloud with your eggs because he drops another version of that same RM; give it to Alph or whoever else is carrying a buff to cast it at the start of the battle

2. Make sure to carry protectga and shellga (across 2 people) and cast in every boss fight. It lasts 40 seconds at minimum, so it usually doesn't require re-casting but be mindful if battles start to drag.

3. RW Wall (I do this even with native wall so that I can slot someone more useful than Tyro)

4. Create / hone Full Break and Attack/Magic Breakdown to at least R2, and try to incorporate them all into your team (Between Tyro and Minfilia you can carry all 3 + half of protectga/shellga). If you're strapped for party slots, pick whichever boss seems to use more based on the description, but it's safer to carry both.

5. Your best physical DPS includes: Bartz USB (requires spellblades - stick with the 3* and hone them up to R5, then add in 5* versions when you can; the 4* aren't enough of an upgrade to justify the cost) followed distantly by Tidus, Yda, and Lightning because their bursts let you get through battles without too many hones. Create and hone up Lifesiphon to at least R3 to get your physical DPS's bursts online as soon as possible. In fact, make 2 copies if you can. 

6. Your best magical DPS includes: Edea BSB and Papa BSB &gt;&gt; Terra BSB. Since there's no Lifesiphon for mages, you'll have to hone up some magic abilities for them to build their SB bars. Start with the -ga spells, move up to -ja and eventually chain -gas when you can afford them.

Item: Pixel 2 XL 64 GB (Just black)

Ordered: Oct 23

Ships: Oct 30 (didn't)

Delivery: Oct 31 - Nov 1 (Paid for 2 day delivery)

My major complaints about this cluster fuck.

1. If there were already stocking issues with the Pixel 2 XL by the time I ordered, why would they tell me at checkout that my ship date was Oct 30th?

2. If when Oct 30th came and went and my item wasn't given to the carrier didn't I get an email or some notice of delay?

3. Why when I chat with a representative are they intentionally vague and unwilling to simply answer if my phone has or has not shipped? Lots of apologies but I wasn't even sure anything was wrong yet! I just wanted my tracking number. If it hasn't shipped then simply tell me when it will. Logistical software is more than capable of such things.

4. Google is a data driven company. They absolutely must know an accurate date my product will ship.


I've talked to multiple people in Chat (all part of the same conversation). I've spoken with one person on the phone, and they say they're going to call me back when they get information from the shipping group.

I'm not angry they are having stocking issues, in fact I'm pleased they're selling like hotcakes. I am angry they aren't communicating with me after I made a purchase of over $800. I am angry they failed to be transparent with me at the time of purchase. It's disingenuous to sell someone a product and tell them it will ship at a certain day when you already know that won't be possible. It's disingenuous to up-sell someone shipping options that can't be met.",1509494787

I'm not ok with them letting them go to run amuck, but as I previously mentioned, how many are trying to go back?

**True Name:** Alfred Bernhard Nobel

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

---

###Parameters

**Strength:** E

**Agility:** E

**Endurance:** E

**Mana:** B

**Luck:** C

**NP:** B

---

###Class Skills

**Item Construction:** C+

An inventor during his lifetime, Caster is capable of creating a variety of items for use by himself or allies. His proficiency is highest when working with explosives, however.

**Territory Creation:** B-

Caster is able to create a Workshop. However, whilst this Workshop is active, Luck Checks must periodically be made, and failure will result in the immediate and violent destruction of the space in a series of explosions.

---

###Personal Skills

**Golden Rule:** C

Despite not coming from a wealthy lineage, Caster's aptitude as a businessman means he should never have trouble with money.

**War of Annihilation:** B

The crystallisation of the belief that allowed Caster to develop weapons despite his pacifism - the idea that a war fought with explosives would end immediately due to their destructive power annihilating both sides, thus rendering war useless. Gives Caster a large boost to his offensive power, but only on his first attack of any given combat and only if that attack is made with the intention of completely destroying the opponent.

---

###Noble Phantasm

**Destroyed In One Instant - Dynamite** (Rank C, Anti-Unit ~ Anti-Fortress)

A plain, unadorned plunger-style detonator, usage of which allows Caster to summon explosions at locations of his choosing within the vicinity. Whilst the size of the blast starts fairly small, if Caster takes time to prepare the location to be blasted beforehand the explosion increases greatly in size and power - furthermore, locations prepared in this way can always be detonated, even if they would otherwise be outside the range of the NP. The more time and mana is spent on preparation, the greater the strength of this effect is.

**The Merchant Of Death Is Dead - Nobel Prize** (Rank B, Anti-Unit)

Appearing at first as a blank piece of paper, Caster's second Noble Phantasm gathers mana for seemingly no purpose for as long as Caster is still present in a Holy Grail War. Only after his death does it fully manifest - becoming an embodiment of Caster's 'will', it independently seeks out an individual who would be judged as 'exceptional' by Caster's standards and grants them the boon of a large rank up to all stats. This boon persists until the contract exhausts its stored mana, at which point it returns to ordinary paper once more.

---

###Background

A Swedish chemist and inventor famed as the 'Father of High Explosives'. Possesses a businesslike stoicism allowing him to work unaffected by triumph or tragedy.

Due to his connection to the arms industry, he earned a reputation as a 'Merchant of Death', even while remaining a committed pacifist. Nearing his own death, he sought to turn this image around, pouring all his riches into the 'Nobel Prize' - one last gift to humanity.

His wish for the grail? If you were to ask him, it would be to ""bring about the peace he was unable to in life"".",1509494790

"HeroesandGenerals","t5_2tnq5","The Warhawk is to the Tier 2 Medium Fighters what the Me410 is to heavies -- you rely on using your speed to bait enemies for teammates, then when they peel off your tail to attack your teammate, you turn on them. The Warhawk is also good for engaging lots of air targets, since your MGs have a really deep ammo pool, so you don't necessarily have to drop all of your bombs to engage aircraft and not run out of ammo.

Also, it's a VERY good ground attack craft. Lots of jeeps crossing a field? no problem, you've got a bomb for each one. Got a heavy tank that you need to deal with? Mark him, gain some altitude, drop down on him in a vertical dive and unload all six of your bombs in one ear-rupturing drumroll to take him down in one hit, which is something no other plane can do (I believe the Soviet Yak-9 gets close, but you may still need to give the enemy tank a little lovetap with APCR cannons if you aren't precisely accurate, while the Warhawk has a little wiggle room due to the number of bombs it has available).

The thing you need to learn with the Warhawk is engagement range. You have very flat-shooting guns and lots of ammo to spend, meaning you can engage from a further distance than cannons -- which, because your MG's will have a lower effective DPS than the Yak, since it's assumed you aren't hitting all of your shots, you'll need that extra run-up time anyway. However, you don't want to engage from such a distance away that the enemy can turn and take you in a head-on, which increase your odds of getting shot out instantly. Once you pass your enemy, just keep blazing right past him and gain some distance between you and him while he tries to turn around (most pilots will do a full turn, while more skilled pilots will realize your intentions and reverse their turn after you push past them, reducing your lead). Then, when you gain enough distance between you and them, come about for the head-on; with any luck, you'll have damaged them enough in the first pass that the head-on will net you the kill. This is, of course, dependent on having Flak Jacket Gold to avoid a swift death in the head-on, so make sure to farm that up with HE belts in a Recon plane if you don't have that yet.

If boom and zoom isn't your style, you also have the P-35A, which is the most maneuverable plane in the game, so don't be afraid to give that a go, either. You may not have the best DPS in the world (read: second worst among the Medium planes, just ahead of the MiG-3 if I remember right), but who needs DPS when you are so maneuverable that you can simply sit on your enemies' tails so long as you don't make an egregious error.",1509494791

I've never found myself questioning the integrity or safety of the lift at all. 

The only caveat I've found is that I would probably buy the SUV/truck adapters for tall vehicles. In order to lift a Honda Pilot, I needed to double stack the rubber blocks that come with the lift (and are required to lift any car) in order to clear some components. That turned out to be a little less stable than I would have liked. I still couldn't shove the car off the lift, but it rocked a little. ",1509494791

#Ji Ning vs. Ryūko Matoi
&gt; This is not sufficient proof that her brain is invulnerable to stabbing.

I think we've reached an impasse here. You won't believe her brain can regenerate without pro-feats for it and I won't believe her brain can't without anti-feats against her all-encompassing regeneration. I'm not expecting to convince you but other life-fibers being (like her ""twin"" Senketsu) don't need brains to function, her mother [regens from bullets through the skulls](http://i.imgur.com/eZcUCWv.gif) and doesn't need any [human physiological connections to her body to control it](http://i.imgur.com/kMN0DKT.gifv) and her ""sister"" [lives on without a brain to speak of](https://imgur.com/a/h6QU0).

&gt; Perhaps read the rest

I did. To say he will be like two people is accurate; it is stated that he will be like two people together or ten individually. Furthermore, I contest this feat on the grounds that someone else is claiming that it is something that *will* happen. Saiyan-Sage Goku cannot bust universes on the basis that he ""will"" be able to. Unless Ning has feats to support this from the time-period the version of him that you are using is limited to, this feat doesn't mean much,

&gt; While yours has more damage output, Ning's is more useful in actual combat

Ditch-level attacks will be of no use to Ning. Ryūko [no-sells this ditch-creating force](https://gfycat.com/GleefulRawChimpanzee). Ning will have to invest time in his attacks to do damage.

&gt; That large youth was at the peak of the houtian level, although not with the Crimsonbright Diagram.

Although ""xiatian"" has been given feats, ""houtian"" and ""Crimsonbright Diagram"" are still without context, outside of houtian being less than xiatian. Does Grizzly have any feats of his own outside of losing to Ning?

&gt; it's likely that Grizzly had more raw strength than Ning in that attack

Does Grizzly have any feats to suggest that he is stronger? Do you mean ""stronger"" in the sense of physical strength or general combat-ability? If it is the former, then that is not so relevant as a durability feat would be for him.

&gt; of course, it's going to be enough to pierce Ryuko's vital points

Not unless Grizzly has the feats to back up the attack or Ning has a feat displaying greater strength than this.

&gt; Raiden doesn't have two swords in tourney, I don't think. 

In the linked Respect Thread he had two listed under ""Equipment"" and I know there is a duel-wielding mechanic in the game, although I haven't played it myself.

&gt; she has at least one common weakness

As does Ning, who, from the given feats, heals from light wounds quickly and can reattach lost limbs.

&gt; it wouldn't surprise me if Ning slips his sword past Ryuko in their first exchange, piercing her heart or brain

Is it likely that he would try to pierce her heart (or brain) as his first strategy?

&gt; Correct, she will be far more reckless, just meaning Ning is going to have an even easier time attacking her vitals.

She will be far more willing to take risks with low-value limbs, just as Ning will be, not ""reckless"". In the ""Sacrifice limbs to gain a strategic advantage"" game, Ryūko has far less to lose than Ning, thanks to her superior regeneration.

&gt; Skill feat

Fair enough, though it's still partly a speed feat.

&gt; They're peak houtian

This was not stated in the feat or by you, and ""houtain"" has yet to be explained beyond being less than xiatian. Do these youths you are scaling off of have any feats?

&gt; What it amounts to is the ability to sense and borrow the strength of both the wind and the wind from enemy attacks to dodge

Yes, but the value of this dodging depends upon the feats of the enemy you are scaling them against. What feats does Serpentwing have to make this dodging impressive? Furthermore, windspeed would be negligible compared to these Mach 20 combatants even if they were not fighting in an enclosed city at the bottom of the ocean, where there will be no wind.

&gt; she has fatal weak points

As does Ning, as well as much lower durability in general.

&gt; This could easily be interpreted as underestimation from Ragyo, that second gif doesn't really show her taking things seriously.

Ragyo is OriginalLifeFiberLusted and fully attempting to kill Ryūko. Her casualness in the second gif is evidence of just how much faster she is, lending credibility to Ryūko using her skill to make up for the gap in their speed.

&gt; it's incredibly unlikely that she can land one of those massively telegraphed swings you showed

You presume she is always so telegraphed. She was highly emotional. She has been known to [attack from behind](https://gfycat.com/AccomplishedPersonalAzurevasesponge), with her [clothing](https://gfycat.com/AccomplishedPersonalAzurevasesponge) and to [mix brawling into combat](https://gfycat.com/WellinformedAppropriateIbizanhound).

&gt; The first looks like it would drastically reduce the strength of the sword

And yet it doesn't.

&gt; it's so disparate that it will give him the win without much issue

It is the only area in which he is superior to Ryūko. It is far from enough to give him the win, never mind ""without much issue"".

&gt;  capable of moving through a huge array of moving objects without his speed reducing in the slightest

This isn't a feat, this is Ning discussing a potential feat with somebody. Even if it was a feat, there will be no room between objects to dodge [the AoE element of Ryūko's attacks](https://gfycat.com/EnragedPoshAlaskajingle).

&gt; your arguments rely on Ning's skill being at least comparable

I conceded superior swordsmanship to him. It is the one area in which he is better than Ryūko by given feats.

&gt; Ning is capable of redirecting Ryuko's attacks,

He lacks the strength to do such a thing.

I stand by what I said before:

Swordskill is the only area in which Ning outclasses Ryūko. She has tougher durability, faster and more-encompassing regeneration and greater strength. Ning won't have a chance to fight as he'll be killed by [AoE-element of Ryūko's attacks](https://gfycat.com/EnragedPoshAlaskajingle) and doesn't have the strength to stop her from cleaving through him even if he tries to block. The environment is still far more beneficial to Ryūko than Ning, due to the buildings, Ryūko's not needing to breathe and the lack of wind. 

I still give this to Ryūko 8.5/10, with Ning still clawing in a 1.5/10 on the off-chance he manages to destroy her heart before he is utterly overwhelmed. With Ning's given durability feats, Ryūko could probably kill him just by [glaring at him](https://gfycat.com/SharpConventionalAyeaye).

#Yun Che vs. Lapis Lazuli
&gt; Stepping on her.

Do you have an issue with the world ""trampling""?

&gt; Her water will evaporate when Yun Che hits it with his sword, coated in phoenix fire

Lapis was able to [imprison five rubies](https://s18.postimg.org/jm4jr7z3t/Back_to_the_Moon_002.png) and one Ruby was able to [boil](http://www.gifable.net/gifVault/gf581d15b36d667.gif) a pool of water and [evaporate it](http://www.gifable.net/gifVault/gf581d1ba9b925a.gif) in at most a little over two minutes. She should be able to keep water unevaporated against a heat that's best given feat is melting ice that is ""as thin as a cicada’s wing"". If Xia Qingyue has feats for keeping her ice frozen against heat I'd love to see them.  
Once the ocean comes into play, he'll face something far beyond his ability to evaporate, due to its immensity, its pressure and Lapis' control.

&gt; You have not shown the durability necessary to survive even one attack,

[Ahem](https://gfycat.com/OrderlyDirtyAmericanshorthair).

Lapis has decent durability, outside of her weakpoint, and her water has tanked attacks on par with Yun Che's. It should be within her power to defend herself for long enough to bring the ocean into play, at which point Yun Che will be completely overwhelmed. You still haven't provided any durability feats for Yun Che, so I'm not seeing him tanking so much as one attack if Lapis hits him. Lapis biggest threat is still herself, but with Yun Che's continued lack of durability feats in mind, I'm going to say Lapis takes this 7/10, since she'll be able to oneshot him as a whole as easily as he'd be able to oneshot her weakspot and only has to bide her time.

#Dong Bo Xue Ying vs. Daicon Girl

&gt; making it so that it looks like only one spear was stabbed out

This is due to speed, which is relevant here.

&gt;  He's capable of using the force created by striking an opponent's weapon, or anything else, in order to enhance his speed and strength for the next attack

To what extent? Does he have any feats for using this?

&gt; His spear is easily capable of piercing large rocks, causing them to explode

While that boulder did shatter, to say it exploded would be hyperbolic, equating to a far more forceful shattering than confirmed.

&gt; you've shown no feats that lead me to believe Daicon Girl can survive this

While it isn't piercing durability specifically, shrugging off being [crushed by Dyna Robo](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/79bwp9/the_great_debate_tourney_season_3_round_1/dp5lt6y/?context=3) is evidence of general durability enough to take this boulder-breaking force at least reasonably well, easily surviving it.

You've still not shown any durability feats of Xue Ying's, so his durability is definitively worse than Daicon Girl's here, as his strength appears to be. If they fight inside one of the cities buildings, he'll have reduced room to maneuver and utilise his techniques. Now that you've demonstrated some offensive power, I'd say Daicon Girl only takes this 7/10, but she'll still be able to endure multiple attacks of his while one-shotting him.
___

It is not irrational to hate specific Republicans for their policies, nor is it irrational to hate the ideology of Republicanism for its stated purpose, nor is it irrational to hate specific Republican pundits or voters for their rhetoric if all this is based on knowledge of these things. You've obscured the accusation a little by saying ""the actions the world sees"". I didn't say it was irrational to hate terrorism. I said it was irrational to hate the religion that inspired the terrorism for passages and principles that you suppose exist. 

I didn't say you had to make a pros and cons list. I did say that you haven't begun to look into that which you hate, and that makes the hatred irrational. 

I didn't say it isn't fair to correlate one with the other. That isn't what you initially claimed though. You claimed a cause.

The question about companies has already been answered by me. You should listen to the answers of questions you asked before you ask them again.

"MHOC","t5_31ykc","Mr Deputy Speaker, 

I'm not going to pretend foreign aid doesn't need reform. It does. The fact some of it goes to corrupt regimes who don't distribute it is a problem. However, if even a modicum of that money goes back into Government investment and expenditure, then that will provide benefits to people.

And at the end of the day Mr Deputy Speaker, that's what this issue is all about: helping people. Philosophical arguments and ideology are not what matter. What matters is that foreign aid helps people who have nothing. It helps fund charities providing clean water. It helps fund refugee camps. It helps un-developed countries invest in their infrastructure and economies.

The Right Honourable members opposite do make a valid point about trade - and in response to anyone who thinks this motion it's heartless, I don't agree, I think it comes from the right place, but the honourable gentleman believes trade is more important. I take a different view. I don't think we can fairly or properly trade with nations with very little money, industry, or wealth. I don't think trade will help people who have no access to the economy. I agree, by all means, let's trade too, but it's not mutually exclusive - we need a two-pronged approach. We need high foreign aid to provide for those who have nothing, to help during crises, to provide housing and food, to help Governments invest to grow, and trade alongside that to increase a country's GDP in the long term so that they can deliver sustainable growth. I don't believe we can have decent, worthwhile trade with the poorest countries in the world whilst at the same time having a tiny foreign aid budget.

And I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, we should be proud of our foreign aid budget. It's a testament to our generosity as a nation that we, as one of the richest economies in the world, and one with a colonial past, seek to spread out the wealth, especially back to those we colonised, and help the world's poorest.

I would also say that we don't need to cut aid for the sake of the national debt - we are running a surplus and as such we can balance the two priorities. We should, yes, pay back as much debt as we can now for the sake of our children, but not at the expense of those with nothing.
I hope members consider carefully the issues at play.

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker.",1509494803

I think they might be trying to make a distinction between speed and velocity here so be careful. The maximum positive acceleration is at t=1 because since the spring is exerting the largest force in the positive direction here. The amplitude is at t={1,3} since the displacement from equilibrium in either direction is greatest. 

You can solve for speed/velocity graphically by finding the slope or differentiating the equation of displacement versus time but I don't see a way of doing it algebraically without knowing the spring constant or something.

They seem to working well and I understand some desire to slightly ease or slightly toughen them but your stance and the ""left's"" stance seem extreme.

I discussed all the positives and negatives and thought about how I would handle potential situations during transition and after.  When I felt prepared to face all the difficulties as well as accept all the potential losses I was ready to begin the journey.  I was excited to become the real me regardless of what becomes an obstacle. 

So far, the positives are better than I imagined and the lows are not that bad.  I have never been a happier person in my life.  My wife is being more difficult than I expected but nothing that stops me from enjoying my experience.  

The only thing I thought I would need and still don’t have is a ‘big sister’ to help teach me about being a woman.  All the things a girl learns in high school from friends and sisters.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","He doesn't have to give access to the witnesses, but if the parties DISAGREE on the material facts of the grievance then the arbitrator is unable to decide the merits solely on the written statements. Yet, no one has been able to identify what the arbitrator used to determine that not only Zeke did the crime, but deserved the punishment. 

Elliott doesn't get the right to cross-examine witnesses no, but without the arbitrator being the one to interview the witness, her written statements shouldn't have been given weight at all because it is literally a he-said/she-said with evidence that people are lying. It also doesn't help matters when the NFL attempted to withhold their own investigators findings when it didn't fit the narrative they were creating.

The point you're missing, and most of corporate America seems to miss as well, is that arbitration isn't just about avoiding legal processes, but also about someone being fair and impartial in the proceedings, because without that the whole thing is useless. It's one thing to decide against someone, but it's a whole other to make one of two parties feel like they are railroaded. It's shit like this that gives arbitration a bad name. 

Zeke's team really said it best...

""For example, both the Columbus Prosecutor's office as well as the NFL investigators expressly concluded and conveyed to our office (and others) that the accuser was lying about an alleged July 22, 2016 incident whereby she accused Mr. Elliott of pulling her out of her car and assaulting her. An allegation that was ultimately undermined by her own friend's affidavit which stated that no such assault occurred. The affidavit also outlined the accuser's plan to orchestrate a story to police to in order to corroborate her false allegation of assault. In addition, the NFL's own medical experts concluded that many of her injuries predated the week in question and likely occurred during a period of time when Mr. Elliott was not in contact with the accuser. During the upcoming weeks and through the appeal a slew of additional credible and controverting evidence will come to light.""

There was more evidence of her blackmail attempt then anything connecting her injuries to Elliott.

Legally, I still think they would have been better off going after standard contract issues like frustration of purpose, undue influence, misrepresentation, etc, because there wasn't a single person who signed off on that CBA who thought the arbitration after a punishment was going to be used to hold kangeroo courts hand selected by Goodell, who is then directly influencing the arbitrators in the process with known false information, and cherry picked facts.",1509494806

Well 1. It's not a token board I am on, it's more of a behavior map because if I don't show up I don't get paid. Also there are all these other expected behaviors I have to perform, like mini schedules and sometimes those expectations are provided to me in a visual and I still may not understand it or be able to perform those duties without the right support and tools. (Personally I'm already operating without all the tools an adult needs in life, I have adhd/exec functioning issues).

Also, as you know... Paramecia should be considered to have 2 branches: Transmuters and Producers.

So far, we've seen possibly 3 characters (2 confirmed) who are Awakened DF users (Doffy, Cracker, Katakuri) in the last 2 major Sagas (that we know of).

All 3 were Producer-type DF users. They are able to Produce their Ability, as a detachable extension of their bodies. Luffy is a Transmuter-type. His body completely changed to being rubber, he passively uses his Ability, conscious or not. He cannot produce more rubber, and/or detach said rubber from his body.

Thus, Doffy/Katakuri's Awakening has manifested differently than the way Luffy will awaken his DF abilities. The exact mechanics of their Abilities(Producer-types) doesn't allow Luffy - a Transmuter-type - to have DF powers the exact same as a Producer-type Paramecia.",1509494810

The Great White North (sans Quebec) is not and has never been culturally distinct from its bigger southern neighbor, and it will only continue to be dragged further into America's cultural orbit because it's a country of unoriginal slugs. We have no original cultural output, our best and brightest go south for school and work, our prettiest go to Hollywood to make shitty Bladerunner sequels, and our Christian pop stars go to LA to be culturally enriched into whatever inner-city monstrosity Bieber is right now. If our inability to function as a culture outside of the influence of America's institutions isn't an argument against our existence, then the fact that Justin Castreau is our PM by choice should just scream ""Nuke us!""

Not to mention that we lack any semblance of an original political ideology to motivate our miserable independence. It was Britain that won all of ""our"" famous victories (inb4 ""we burned the White House"" bullshit from Canadians who don't know it was a British force shipped up from the Caribbean) and preserved our independence, only to be replaced by American muscle. Until 1982 we had to ask the Britbongs for permission to change our constitution. Hell, Canada fucking let my fellow limp-wristed surrender monkeys vote for succession, and fuck me if we gutter French didn't decide to remain in a country that (rightfully) detests our snarky way of life. Say what you will about the FLQueers, but at least they took on Canada's drunken moose brigades.

Fuck, I'd like to see Canada in the Union, but it'd be a shitty Puerto Rican deal for y'all. No great nation has ever benefited from importing spineless, socialist-lite coward who won't fight for their beliefs, and even America can't melting pot us into a worthwhile people.

Hell, they even asked a debate question about that one.

Oh and they also played the same shit slinging with Barack Hussein Obama, a black guy with an arabic middle name, who had his native citizenship questioned, who was called a socialist and a commie at every turn, who Alex Jones via 2011 said was going to round up people and put them into FEMA death camps.

Did it work? No, Obama was elected twice, the first time with a progressive message and 64% turnout. It didn't work on him, what makes you think it would work on the most popular politician in the country, who polls 15+ points better than Trump every single time they are put head to head?

Your girl Hillary lost because she's weak on the issues that people actually care about, and didn't inspire turnout one bit, especially in the rust belt where her husband fucked everyone over with NAFTA.

You do realize, that Donald Trump is president. The guy who had audio released of him saying he just walks up to women and grabs them by the pussy. The guy who has insulted vets, women, minorities, etc., bullies whoever he can, cheats and defrauds whoever he can, and people still voted for him enough to win the electoral college.

Bernie's the most popular politician in the country because he wants to help people get some decent healthcare and higher education, and get out of debt, to give people more earning power, hold Wall Street accountable for their financial crimes, fight for fair trade that isn't a corporate giveaway, etc. etc. etc.

Bernie would have won. It's a fact of life. Deal with it.",1509494813

It's interesting because I'm really almost living that scenario: I live in the mountains of Central America, I have a great job and can chill and enjoy life - but I choose not to drink.

There was this one guy I was going on date-like trips with all the time, and after a YEAR I finally pushed him into getting an answer about what we were doing, when he dropped the bomb he couldn't date me because he couldn't introduce me to his parents (we're not the same race/nationality and I live in a foreign country). We work together, and bless him, there's no awkwardness. 

There was another guy who I was hanging out with as a friend and I had developed feelings for and casually asked if he ever would see us as more than friends. He basically said no and we dissolved as friends, sadly.

ANOTHER time I was sleeping with a guy casually and he just dropped me out of nowhere. Months later I got a boyfriend but was in a really bad mood, so I marched over to friends-with-benefits-guy's house and screamed at him for five minutes about being an asshole for ghosting me, then stomped back home.

In every situation, I felt LOADS better. No, none of the situations really worked out how I had wanted them to, but it allowed me to move on. I also actively sought out conversations/screaming matches (in the one case) with them because I knew that no matter what, closure would help me move forward.

And frankly, it did. Days after we talked about what was on my mind, I was 100% over the guy. Consistently, this has always been the case. 

I don't know enough about your situation to know if he will accept your advances and try to move forward - frankly you might be in the friends with benefits zone - but I always encourage communication and truly believe it is worth it.

Talk to him. It will help. And if everything blows up and things get awkward, guess what? It'll make the whole process even easier. Best of luck to you.",1509494822

Out of how much projected retirement savings? Have you stopped to consider that maybe you will be upper class by that point? Or maybe you are now? Protip: no one in America thinks they're rich. Only those above them are. [Good write up in the NYTimes about it here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/sunday/what-the-rich-wont-tell-you.html). 

&gt; No it literally isn't by your very example. If you can max out your 401k you can literally save 5M dollars on an upper middle class income. That is the American dream, that is literally it and you are trying to make it so even LESS people can get that? If that is your point then you can fuck right the hell off.

See man, this is just opinion and useless insults. My ideal of the American dream is to make a good life for my family and children where they are safe, educated, and have opportunities I didn't. Yours seems to be accumulating enough wealth to make it to the top 3%. If the dream is only achieved by 3 in 100 households who break the 5 million net worth line, maybe your dream isn't very reasonable for most people. Maybe its not attainable to those not as privileged as you, or as forward thinking, or as educated.

For many people this incongruity makes their brain flip out.

Teleporting is a much easier movement mechanic for people to accept because we are all used to the idea of a jump cut from film.

He got obsessive about my time with him, wanting to control when and where I went.

He was well aware that I gave half of my pay check to my parents to help them out but he insisted they didn't need it and they were using me. He said things like ""I only tell you these things for your own good"". I put up with a lot of things from him, because I didn't have the experience to tell him no.

Almost as a joke, I looked at how much of the software mentioned on Scott Hanselman's Tools List were [written in Delphi](http://glooscapsoftware.blogspot.ca/2017/04/something-something-delphi-something.html). Some old, some new, and many are still in development and being updated. There was a follow-up piece about Delphi software in the wild and [how to check](http://glooscapsoftware.blogspot.ca/2017/05/software-made-with-delphi-how-do-you.html). Make sure you check out the additional links. Niagara Falls isn't that far away and the lights are really cool.

Anecdotally, Delphi wasn't the first language I used professionally or the only one I use now, but I have been making a living with it since 1995. Right now, more of my paying projects are new development than working with legacy software, and I'm fairly busy.

I'm also an MVP. Some people might suggest that this means that my opinion is bought and paid for, but those people have no idea what they are talking about.

So that's at least one data point.

They can't hold you hostage. The lead is managing multiple relationships and is under enough stress and pressure handling several people at once. The contestant just needs to manage one relationship so it is up to the contestant to leave the show if they can't get there. It really irritates me when people get to Top 2-3 like Becca and Peter and then want to start ""blindsiding"" the lead. They should have left like Brooks did. That was the tough but mature thing to do. Did he get a lot of flack for it in the beginning? Yes but looking back, most people see it as respectful and caring. Getting dragged to the end and then doing that to the lead isn't fair. They may be the ones in power but they have feelings just like anyone else and if you are having that much reservation, you should save them (and yourself) the heartache and leave. I question people's motives who stay till the end... What are you trying to do? Get more airtime? Go to more countries? 

Edit: And I know Brooks stayed longer than he should (especially if he truly never had feelings for Des). I'm just saying that at least he left. He did not wait till he was final 2.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I moved here from Slovakia to study law when I was 19 together with my brother. I stayed for the world-class education, international business culture, extremely humble and helpful people and inclusiveness of the communities I lived in. Sadly, I am considering leaving now as I feel though the inevitable economic decline and decrease in living standard for a large part of the population will empower the anti-immigrant feels even more. I live in Manchester now and I witnessed hate incidents on the tram which involved locals yelling at foreign language speakers to go back where they came from - it happened to my colleague as well who is Bulgarian. I don’t feel comfortable speaking my own language in public with my brother these days to avoid any potential troubles. I’ve got a few brexiteer colleagues who keep reassuring me I am “the good kind” of immigrant and they won't send people like me back, which has never been a reassurance to me. This argument by itself is irrelevant to the hardline anti immigrant folks who voted to get rid of us as we “steal their jobs”. My entire time here, I have always strived to give back to the community and participated at charity events to raise money. Even now we are running a project in my department at work to help Macmillan with their retention and engagement of charity members. As much as I integrated, contributed back to the society I feel as though my time here has run out. UK has and will always be the place where I grew up and got to know the “bigger world”, but in reality a large part of it was possible thanks to the EU. In fact, always felt that UK brings balance to EU thanks to its healthy scepticism and it is an integral part of the EU values I stood by. If it wasn’t for the EU my schools back home wouldn’t have proper school grounds, teachers from the US, ERASMUS nor would I be able to travel, live and work anywhere I wanted. I feel am the child of EU and I am saddened that my British peers perhaps might not get to enjoy the same benefits I had. This along with the societal changes I have witnessed in the short time make me think that it’s time I leave. Anyway, sorry if this was too long of a read and I just feel like all of this self inflicted harm in the form of Brexit has created a pressure on me and it’s challenging to wake up day by day knowing the country I love will no longer be the home I wanted it to be.

Considering how much 'western' philosophy there is I think it would be pretty hard to generalize it like that. It certainly doesn't sound like the philosophies of the Catholic writers I'm most familiar with. However, even if you are correct, so what? It's not like other philosophies have stopped wars and suffering. The Bhagavad Gita, one of the great non-western philosophical texts, is pretty blunt about how it is Arjuna's duty as a righteous man to slaughter his family that are on the wrong side of the conflict. 

But hey, let's leave Eurasia behind in case it's been tainted by 'western' philosophy. Native Americans weren't a sunshine and bunnies bunch either, nor were their religions and philosophies. Slavery, everywhere. Preserving nature? Not really a concern. But who knows, maybe that isn't what they really believed and just what the archaeological evidence leads us to believe about them. Maybe they were all nature loving pacifists, that just sucked at living by their ideals. 

Regardless, what can't be argued is societies that follow western philosophies have a pretty good track record of surviving and thriving. Other traditions, less so. And in the end, that's all that really matters, from a historical perspective at least. ",1509494831

&gt;Those descriptions might conjure images of someone whose role amounted to little more than putting up lawn signs and licking envelopes, but there was more to Papadopoulos’ position than that.

And you parrot the same dismissive statement - like the good lap dog, as you reference a fact check that does not agree with that assessment.

And that’s what you and your cult likes to do.  You take something and insert a little buzz wording, some subtle way to dismiss all wrong doing.  ‘Low level’.  This guy has regular contacts with the highest level staff in the campaign on more than a dozen occasions.  You write it off as if he was some kind of ‘stamp licker’ while referencing the an article that points that out as a complete understatement.

It’s cool man.  Next time just say ‘I will defend daddy no matter what.’  It’s a lot easier.

Technically, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner were also volunteers.  So I’ll give you that, but what I will not give you is that he was low level.  That’s gaslighting and you and I both know it.

Source? I can pretty much guarantee you the iPhone X has a Gen 6 panel. There's no way Apple is settling for less, and Samsung Display has *no* desire to drive Apple to invest even more money in LG's new E5 and E6 plants which are tooling up for Gen 6 OLED production. 

Samsung *Mobile’s* product requirements and design decisions should not be viewed as the ""top limit"" on what Samsung *Display* is capable of and willing to do for the right amount of money. If Apple has plotted a larger portion of their component budget for the display and wants to pay additional money to hit tighter tolerances or include additional production steps they’re welcome to do that.

So, that 50$ sword with the dragon head pommel is shit and will screw you over. Their made out of stainless steel and will break or bend if hit against anything hard. You can bend some of those cheaper swords with your hands. Also, if you swing it hard enough, it could get unwelded from the handle and fly apart. You're better off swinging metal tubing.

Let's say you do buy a real ""combat"" ready sword. Its still shit for fights in a tight space. You're gonna end up swinging it around and bumping it into the wall or ceiling. You're gonna end up breaking your shit in the process. Even if you do hit the assailant, you're probably swinging the blade wrong. You're not thinking about lining up the blade's edges, so you're gonna smack'em with the flat of the blade. Which would be just like you swinging a metal pipe around. You may get a few cuts but he is gonna beat your ass with a crowbar.

You could thrust the sword but it would be hard to hit him and once you stuck him, he is gonna swing his crowbar at you.

So, fuck the sword. Get a mace or a warhammer, just swing the heavy end and beat the fucker up. Their cheaper and more efficient than a blade. You don't have to worry about sharpening it, just swing.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","And I'll go back to where I started -- those are two different pots of money.  I'm not sure what you mean by 

&gt;Car sharing and Lyft/Uber should be given more space at the airport to reduce the number of people who need to take their own car by making those options more convenient and/or cheaper.

The airport has already dedicated ample space and redesigned how Lyft/Uber work at the airport.  They have a dedicated drop off and pick up place, and (as I use it often) it works well.  No change the airport makes will have any impact on prices/rates for those services anyway.

&gt;I get that no one wants to pay more or maybe take 1/2 hour extra to take the max, but that convenience needs to be squared with climate and congestion issues. At some point we can't always get what we want.

I've said this before, but a half hour would be great.  If you don't live on the Max (or live on the line that directly feeds into the airport) you are looking at a train or bus transfer... which can add 15-20 minutes. I'm solidly in the urban core and we are talking 60-90 minutes easily.  

Plus, and I've said this several times, the lines don't even work for late or early flights. At all.  If you take the late flights that come into the airport the or the early flights out, Max/Busses aren't running.  These aren't changes the Port can make -- so again, another pot of money.",1509494835

Garmin uses the 1.2 multiplier to calculate your ""resting"" calories, then adds ""active"" step calories using HR and steps. The former would probably be OK for most people across a day if the latter wasn't included. Unfortunately the active step calories are usually crazy high, to the point that if you ate that much you'd balloon up in no time. Better to ignore Garmin's calorie estimate of your daily total sadly.

On the other hand, recorded activity calories are usually ok, maybe even an underestimate for many. My experience is to trust these.

If you use MyFitnessPal to track calories in/out, turn off the connection with Garmin step tracking and MFP will no longer add the extra active step calorie correction (but will add recorded activities). I've found this to be the best solution.",1509494836

The problem with frag movies is that literally anyone can make them. Record enough kills, cut them down and add music; you've got a frag movie. It doesn't really make for particularly interesting watching, especially if a lot of your kills are just from holding angles.

If you're making frag movies, you have to showcase at least one of two things: amazing aim or exciting, dynamic plays. I'd urge you to watch a video from Noted or Beaulo, as they're not just clips of the actual kills strung together. Rather, they show longer clips, usually with multiple kills, that show off their superior aim and the crazy plays they manage to pull off.

1. Study Tactics. A LOT.
2. Learn all the basic endgames cold. This will help you to know when you can use tactics to transition into an obviously winning endgame.
2. Play 1. e4 as white. Focus on fast development. Learn the open games. You'll egt crushed at first, but you will learn to handle yourself in the open games. This will be the fastest way to learn multiple important opening ideas.
3. Play 1. ..... d5 in response to 1. d4 by your opponent. Your idea of picking an opening ""system"" that can be used to respond to a number of different opponent responses is the absolute worst way to go, as it will lock you into only being able to beat people who don't know your opening system, but will lead to you getting slowly outplayed by those who do, and you won't know why you are losing.
4. Your thought process part is helpful.
5. Analysing your games is an extremely important part of your development.",1509494839

For all we know, the material could have been repackaged or come from countries that we choose not to purchase material from. Then if there is an issue and it comes up, you may be held liable and face fines and the risk of being able to trade overseas. 

Amazon is more of a market intermediary, than it is a pure distributor. I guess what I'm getting to is how do you knew that you are not getting and dealing grey market parts?

Buying and selling material has a lot of strict guidelines and requires individuals to be in an accountable position, if there is an issue.

However, there is a potential difference between the **wild horses** and the animals I mention above. Horses are very social. They bond with other horses (sometimes other animals) and can spend their whole lives with another horse (even of the same gender). So if the wild horses were to be slaughtered, it would lead to a great deal of suffering as many of these groups and bonds are pulled apart.

But despite this, we don't need to kill them. We could let the horses live out the rest of their lives and give them a contraceptive drug to prevent new foals from being born.

Let's be clear; RT says:

&gt; In July, the US Air Force Air Education and Training Command issued a tender on FedBizOpps, a US government website, seeking to acquire samples of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and synovial fluid from Russians. All samples – 12 of RNA and 27 of synovial fluid –“shall be collected from Russia and must be Caucasian,” the tender [said](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=5891545db8f955e347e3493a9575e7df&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;). What exactly was meant by 'Caucasian' is open to interpretation. It also wants information on the donor’s sex, age, ethnicity, weight, height and medical history. Notably, the Air Force said, it would not consider tissue samples from Ukraine.

The link included in the RT article is to a US gov't GSA site.

So I read all about Mary and her disturbing murder, got myself thoroughly on edge before watching the admittedly corny video. I wasn't the least bit disturbed until the last scene with Mary appearing closer and closer to the wounded rider. I got past the end with Mary appearing in front of him. I then spent a good couple minutes trying to pause the video so I could see her face. On about my 6th try I was very focused to try to pause it on time, and just as I'm about to hit pause THE FREAKING POWER COMES BACK ON. This is accompanied by a piercing shriek as the carbon monoxide detector right outside my room comes back to life. I cannot remember the last time I got so startled.

We do expect women to be soft and men to be hard. That is not the same and expecting women to be dumb, and expecting men to be unfeeling.

Now you are confusing sexual orientation with gender roles. There are gay people, and many do choose a gender role. Many are still men, and some choose a more feminine gender role. They help show how true gender roles are.

You're right that fewer did this year than normal, but all year people have been discussing how this year has been *historically* bad for studios. Most people on reddit tend to just not believe them (despite executives across the industry agreeing on this), claiming it's just bad accounting, but studios *are* taking losses right now.

I think the rough estimate for blockbusters these days is over 2x the listed budget for profitability. Obviously, this varies wildly from a few different things. Domestic gross is more valuable than international gross. And different films will earn back a different percentage of their gross internationally depending on their contracts, so some have particularly bad break even points on international gross. And while all blockbusters have large advertising budgets, some are particularly massive.

So if you look in a typical year, most blockbusters are earning the $500+mil to make a comfortable profit. And some earn much less, and do indeed take a big loss. This year has been exceptionally bad for blockbusters, with many high profile films coming up short.",1509494844

The same NVEnc chip is often used throughout an entire range.  e.g. a GTX1050 has the same NVEnc chip as a Titan Xp and thus performs the same in video tasks.
This is why you can see a separate ""VPU"" (Video Processor Unit) usage meter in most monitoring tools.  In the latest Windows Update it shows up as ""Video Encode and Video Decode"" which act independently of the ""3D"" core usage.

The only gaming-like use I can think of for a Telsa card, outside of pure computation and rendering, is running VDI (virtual desktops) with virtualised GPUs for multiple clients.

We don't even know if he was injured the first time, back when Chrollo was probably like 20 and still learning Nen, and the second time Chrollo was trying to snatch their abilities and Zeno still risked being hit by Silva's orb attack to kill Chrollo. Wheter that was because Chrollo was just that strong or he knew he could survive the attack doesn't make it look like Silva is anywhere close to current Chrollo.

&gt;Say that to Meruem.

???

&gt;Well, we know that he has abilities at least[or even more powerful] than Zeno's considering the fact that in Zoldyck Family hierarchy he takes place above his father.

Where does it say that the strongest guy in a group is automatically the leader? Leorio was *this* close to becoming the next Chairman.

Following this logic, Ging who is said by Netero to be one of the Top 5 Hunters and a coterie of Hunters chosen by Netero himself, who called Morel weak, have at least off-screen feats. Ging is also so talented that he can copy punching abilities by getting hit by them once so yeah.

A player could do literally the same thing over and over while just avoiding the other player the entire time (both insanely easy to do in high level). Same thing could be done in lower levels, so there was just a very small skill gap from low level to high level in lance. 

Most of the weapon is the same, but you have to learn more about what options you have to use in what situations instead of using the same thing over and over again, which disallows that sort of situation. Most of the combos are frame perfect as well, making it more difficult to pull off than just clicking a few buttons.

By no means is it the worst weapon; without sair, hammer is pretty much nothing. The only approaches it has is slight &amp; throw, it's only decent kills are sair and nair, dair puts your opponent at an advantage and resets to neutral instantly at later damages. One of its only tools on the edge (recovery) is incredibly easy to bait out, and you don't have a recovery once it is.

Not to mention is New and Improved™ hitboxing: https://imgur.com/a/EAouB

Lance has PLENTY of tools for approaching, damage, and kills in nearly any situation if you use it correctly. I find no trouble using it in nearly any game I'm playing. The only somewhat concerning thing about lance is that it has no reliable grounded kill options, while every other weapon does. (Before it had slight &gt; sair, slight &gt; rec) Still, I don't know anyone that dodges these perfectly every time if it's frame perfect.

Even if your Player doesn't actively expect you to graft the whole world of DC Comics onto your world it is somewhat implied.

Here is a research project that supports the statement I said about large bucks doing most of the breeding. It also talks about the range the travel as well as large floating range bucks.
http://www.shsu.edu/dotAsset/2067b29f-76e3-4f5f-a8df-7631f487d369.pdf


This one is from another article I linked but has a paywall http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/jwmg.1067/full

management strategies designed to balance the sex ratio and extend the male age structure, such as Quality Deer Management (QDM), influence the pre-breeding interactions that affect the distribution of mating success across age classes. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the white-tailed deer mating system under QDM through paternity analysis. Using 8 microsatellite loci and tissue samples harvested from hunter-killed deer at Chesapeake Farms in Chestertown, Maryland, we evaluated 731 deer. The ≥3.5 age class dominated mating at Chesapeake Farms, with 41% of paternity. **However, together, the 1.5- and 2.5-year-old age classes accounted for more than half of paternity (59%).** No evidence of polyandry was detected. Our results indicate the interaction between the sex ratio and age structure, fostered by strategies that balance the sex ratio and extend the male age structure, facilitate breeding by younger males. These results indicate management strategies that employ QDM practices with a goal of propagating the genes of dominant males may fall short, and the interplay among sex ratio, age structure, and dominance relationships may be the main influences of mating success. Managers should account for these findings when setting expectations for reproduction under restricted harvest. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.


If 59% of young male bucks are the sons of the big rack bucks that are taken they will grow and become the large bucks.

It’s the most important one in my opinion because that affects everything else about one’s life, but there are other factors. Just because someone is a Christian doesn’t mean they’re automatucally perfect for you. They could even be harmful. I’ve heard several stories of two godly people entering a relationship, but unintentionally leading each other away from God. The Bible is clear, however, that we are to be equally yoked with our partner. But just because two people are, doesn’t mean they’ll be “perfect” for each other. Partly because all have sinned, and nobody except Jesus is perfect. So relationships fail. Two godly people can lead each other astray if they aren’t careful.

Background[edit]
We've been running our D&amp;D group for quite some time (D&amp;D 3.5), and we were around the 11-13 level range. The game had reached the point where the characters were now 'players' in a kingdom's politics and were national heroes. One of the characters, a paladin, was the youngest son of the now-deposed king. In his youth, he had disappeared for 10 years without a trace and broke his father's heart, the king went into decline and dragged his kingdom with him. Eventually, knowing of the weakness, a coup was launched by a tyrant and now the tyrannical betrayer rules the land with an iron fist.

6 years after the coup, the youngest son returns, now a paladin. What happened to him for all that time has yet to be revealed, but the player and DM had it all worked out.

So anyway, even though the game had revolved pretty much around us trying to get our paladin buddy to reclaim his rightful throne, and most of the plot was centered around it, the player in question decided he was bored with the character and wanted to roll something new.

The DM was a little pissed at this, but he could hardly force the guy to play the character. So, he let him roll up a new guy and drafted in his buddy Chris, who was staying with him for a few weeks to play the paladin ""Sir Peter Fairgrave.""

I hadn't gamed with Chris before but he seemed like a pretty cool guy -- no complaints -- and he really wanted to know all the details of the plot and everything about our characters citing that he actually wanted to do a proper job of playing the character and to ""not let us down.""

I didn't know what to expect, but hey, he seemed really into it. So we played.

Anyway, in terms of the current plot: we were forced to waylay our plans to overthrow the tyrant, as a more serious threat had emerged, that of some form of sinister cult.

We had been dealing with this cult for years, but we had never taken them overly seriously. They were just some messed up guys who occasionally got in over their heads, you know. Often they'd make a bid for power, fuck it up, and we'd have to clean up the deadly deadly mess.

The cult had clearly been playing their Warcraft 3, as they had gotten it into their heads to infect the kingdom's food stores (on a mass scale) with some form of virus that would make the population subservient to some demon the cult venerated.

In game[edit]
It was our 11th hour, we'd hounded the streets for days trying to round up cult agents and get information out of them.

We found out the plague was already in most of the food and water, as they had been at it for months, but a ritual needed to be completed for it to become active.

The cultists were hard to break, and our group (generally not the nicest folks) wanted to torture it out of them. Naturally, Sir Peter was opposed.

""We can't preserve freedom while denying it to others. It's not right, we can't do it, and I won't allow it.""
Chris wasn't being a dick, he was just playing the character. As much as our characters might not have liked it, we as players were having lots of fun. The added drama really worked.

We managed to capture a high priest of the cult, someone responsible for conducting the ritual in this part of the land. It turns out the ritual needed to be conducted at the same time in several parts of the kingdom at once, in order to deliver the maximum effect.

We need to know the other locations, or else all our efforts would have just saved one northern barony and not the whole land. He gave us no choice but to beat it out of him.

Sir Peter wanted no part of this: ""If you're going to treat a man like some animal for the slaughter, then don't expect me to sit by and watch."" He then stormed out, and let us carry on in our work.

We'd been at it hours, and we couldn't get the guy to crack. He just wouldn't tell us anything. He was covered in cuts, had lost a toe at our hands, was dripping in his own blood, but still won't give us want we needed. We were going to give up and try another method, when all of a sudden, our doorway darkens and in walks Sir Peter. He's wearing nothing but his tunic and pants, unarmed, bar for a half drank jug of some form of strong booze in hand.

In steps into the room and announces:

""If you're going to do this, do it right...""
He walks over to the bound cultist, tosses aside his bottle, lifts the chair and sits in front of the beaten man.

Sir Peter:

""I don't want to hurt you, I just need to know the locations of your brethren, then this can be all over for you, I will make sure you are safe and cared for.""
Cultist:

""Ha! I know who you are, Sir Peter Fairgrave; kingdom breaker, runaway child, father slayer. You can't threaten me: I know what you are. Your order, your God won't allow you to lay your hands on me, otherwise you'll fall, and you won't be able to help a soul.""
Sir Peter:

*sighs* ""You seem to be under the misconception about what I am, what I do. I am a paladin, that is true; but as a paladin I don't fear falling... I look forward to it.""
The cultist shot a nervous look at the rest of the party, we were all looking at each other, not sure what was about to happen. The cultist opened his mouth to speak, but Sir Peter cut him off.

Sir Peter:

""As a paladin, I walk on a razor's edge. Not between good and evil, I could never be something like you, but between ""law"" and ""justice"". The ""law"" I follow doesn't permit me to harm you, but I could be ""justified"" in anything I did to you in order to save innocent lives. ANYTHING!""
""You don't know what it is like to be me. You don't know the pain of having to store all your anger, all your fury, all your sense of justice, and hold it inside you, all day every day for the rest of your life. Doing the right thing doesn't mean I get to stop all evil, I just get to trim it when it becomes overgrown. The path I walk is not about vengeance, or what's right; it's about moderation in the face of power, restraint and compassion for scum like you.
""This is why paladins don't fear falling. We don't spend all day looking for ways to prevent ourselves from doing evil and giving in to the darkness -- we actively seek it out. Every time we face evil, we ask ourselves, 'Is this the threat that I'm going to give it all up for? Is this what I am going to give up my ability to help others in the future, in order to bring it down now. Is this the evil that I am willing to forsake my God and my power to stop?!'"".
At this point, he stands up suddenly and swings his arm against the chair he was sitting on. Sending it flying and shattered against a wall, he then kicks over the chair the cultist was sitting on, he leaps and straddles his chest, flinging him about for a few seconds in pure rage, before calming once more.

He looks the cultist straight in the face, both their noses just inches from each other.

""What you should be asking yourself now, what you really need to be thinking about, is: 'Is what I'm doing something that will make this guy want to fall?' Because you should know that once I fall, all those rules which protect you from me are gone. No longer will I be able to be stopped by you, or by my order, or by my God. If I give everything, and I mean give everything, I will never stop. If you escape me today, I will hunt you down and grab you into the pits of hell myself. Even if that means that I have to invoke the wrath of every demon in creation, just so they throw open a pit and drag me down where I stand, because when they do drag me down, I will make sure that my fists are wrapped firmly around your ankles and you go down with me. I want you to listen to me now, and I mean really listen, because Hell truly hath no fury like a paladin scorned.""
""So I ask you, one last time: tell me where the other rituals are being held, or I swear to all on high that I will fall, and fall hard, just so I can show you what it is that paladin truly keeps his code in order to hold back...""
At this point the player, Chris, just stops talking and looks at us. We are all kind of stunned by his speech, naturally.

He just picks up a D20, looks at the DM and says ""I wish to roll intimidate.""",1509494850

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Hahahhaha oh. Sorry. Maybe it's different in different places, depending on the expenses of the area as well. I live in a mixed income area, but I used to live in a small tourist city that was pretty expensive. At one point my rent was over half my income. It was miserable and I went into insane debt. Then someone told me the 1/4 of your income thing, so I found some roommates and made it happen. I have never lived so comfortable as when my rent was in this proportion. I moved out to the country recently, and still have a similar proportion. Travel/commute expenses are now much higher, but I'm still much happier than when I splurged on rent. Maybe it's not always possible. I certainly have not experienced living in lots of places. But I do think no matter who you are, it's a great thing to keep in the back of your mind as you apartment shop- that your quality of life is much better when half your income isn't already accounted for. Plus, there's still internet, cable, heat, electric, and anything else that jacks up the cost of an apartment.

Second, you don't need to make super teams in order to push people to work harder and ""climb"" over that hump. They will already get better because all of them want to win. The quality will get better as long as people want to win. 

All you're doing with the super team is artificially accelerating that process because now, people who aren't good enough to win on their own taking paycuts and joining super teams because that's the only way they can be relevant. The problem with the super team is that there's only so much you can incorporate in your game before the ""team"" aspect gets to you. If super teams are our main motivator, at some point players are gonna hit a brick wall because as much as they have improved exponentially year after year, they just can't compete with these super teams. So now this team is gonna attempt to make an even better super team, and then someone else makes a crazier one and so on and so forth.

And my point is the bar can only be raised so high that all you're left with is one team who one upped the previous super team that was already nearly unbeatable to become a team that practically trivialized what it means to be an NBA champion.

Edit: The changes in the game led to GSW as as super team that's true, but it was the super team before Durant. Golden State has utilized this data and perfectly translated it into what we see on the court and combine that with Steph Curry's phenomenal and mind-boggling range and accuracy, it turned into the most winning-est team in the history of the NBA. However, GS didn't get Durant primarily because of some visual data. Gauging player data is for deciding which role player to sign, not deciding if you're going to take an MVP-caliber player in his prime. The answer to that is almost always yes. You wouldn't even look deep into the analytics to make that decision.",1509494851

GOP got more house votes this time, but got vastly more representation than that percentage of the vote. In 2012 the Democrats actually 1.2million more votes overall, yet GOP control of the House at 234-201, which is directly contrary to the purpose of the House of Representative (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/11/09/house-democrats-got-more-votes-than-house-republicans-yet-boehner-says-hes-got-a-mandate/). In 2014, the GOP got 52% of votes, but 57% of seats. In 2016, House Republicans got 49.9% of votes but 55.2% of the seats. In general, Democrats need to outperform by 4-5% to win seats.

So a little bit of backstory, I've played league since the end of season 2 and have mained AD for the majority of that time taking long breaks from the game. During season 6 my friend asked me to play ranked with him and told me to try jungle, i found zac was one of the most fun champs in the game so i gave him a try which led to great success. All the way through season 6 i played Zac non stop and climbed from silver to plat and got my smurf accounts to silver and gold to duo with lower elo friends.

My main account is Notarize and i have a second account that i mainly used to practise champs in ranked which is called Legobox. My other smurf is my support account that i used to learn support so i could better myself as an AD by understanding the support role.

"paragon","t5_2uu0j","The issue I see is there is room for the skill ceiling to grow because of the immature card system and other changes we're seeing. 

The jungle is a good example - even just getting the new buff I think it's going to really shake up how people view the jungle. Stealing the jungle buff was fun but not super rewarding later in the game - it was just a nice thing to have to cause a small bit of extra damage and defense. 

The black buff though? Since it grants vision around you in a large area (they didn't say units but I'd guess it's larger than outlander scout because they specified 'large') and the slow on hit? Huge reason to invade and steal that later in the game. 

Fangtooth is going to be huge too. It's probably going to be too much at first and need to be adjusted but it is a great team objective to go for now.

I also feel like paragon has a lot going on compared to other MOBA. 

It's not as clear to see someone coming up behind you - you need to aim. Positioning is far more important too because of your field of vision being limited *and* the current state of vision. 

Less concern on *focusing* on the specifics of last hitting, ideally, will free up some of that mental load for more players and allow them to focus on the stuff we're always complaining about: 

* -over extending
* -not helping team fights
* -being in the wrong place at the wrong time
* -judging when to capture an objective
* -harassing the enemy laner properly

I don't know if I honestly felt the game was getting 'dumb' I'd agree - but I just don't. Maybe it's the way I read it but most of the complaints I see read like they're coming from a place of elitism rather than genuine concern. ",1509494856

To be quite honest with you, I think you guys are overreacting to this whole 75hz thing. From their KS page I can see that V3 is not their final prototype, they're planning to iterate in the design at least twice more before they push out the consumer version. They already posted video proof that v3 works with 80fps without stutter, which means it's running at stable 80hz minimum. I reckon it's just a matter of time until they get stable 90hz, with later prototypes perhaps if not in v3. 

In my opinion this HMD is an amazing deal, and the company already has an earlier product they successfully delivered. I don't think Gen2 HMDs from Oculus/HTC will not match this headset in either the FOV or the resolution, not because they can't but because it wouldn't be profitable. Pimax is a challenger brand coming out with a disruptor product, while Oculus and HTC are established brands that are currently competing in a stable market. 

Pimax has been absolutely successful in establishing themselves with their new product (they got the entire industry talking about it which was probably their main goal). They're probably barely breaking even with their KS pricing and add-ons, but that's not that important as KS campaign is not even 10k headsets while the publicity they got from the campaign is probably worth 100x whatever profit they could possibly get from it. 

In conclusion I get the feeling that this is not a company trying to scam anyone, they're just trying to establish themselves for future sales and their KS is just meant to generate hype.",1509494856

 This is the response I got when I posted the question to their page:

I did some research Cxxxx, and the $500 fee is to run testing on the modem to make sure it will perform properly within our network which has been in place since 2013. I would love to get you connected with one of our senior techs that can help find a solution using one of our free modems. Shoot me a private message with your phone number so I can get you connected.

___My response:



if this is GCI's ""policy"" then there is nothing else to be had by this conversation.

Technically speaking, cable modems are built to a standard. GCI primarily uses re-branded Motorola from all that I've seen. There is no ""testing"" that needs to be done. If there is, then if my neighbor bought the exact same make and model of cable modem as I did a year ago, then that modem should already be authorized for use on your network and should not be subject to retesting. Forcing every individual to have their devices tested for compatibility is a marketing ploy.

I do not now have GCI service and I never plan to unless your plans and policies change. I was trying to help a friend newly moved to Juneau find out why things were different here. Every other cable provider I've subscribed to or worked with in other areas has allowed an outside modem to be used without the exorbitant fee. The technology is all the same, the only difference is in the administration of the network.

As I've said in another post - I'm glad to give money to the public school system. Do I have to justify such expense? I would assume - correct me if I'm wrong - that you too are happy about your tax euroes being used in such manner. 

This we use to establish that giving power to the government by itself is not bad (again, if you're an anarchist, that's another matter). 

Why this one specifically though? Because as I said in another post - as I'm glad to pay taxes so I'm not surrounded by illiterates (or sickly people), I'm glad to pay taxes so I'm not surrounded by inbreds. 

&gt;What do you think of countries were it is not illegal? Do you think of those countries and societies as depraved simply because this law doesn't exist there?

"wow","t5_2qio8","Key is being efficient and try to always have one thing you do give progress on multiple fronts.  Wq's that count towards two chests, or wq's that give resources, or wq's that give argunite and resources.  I try to resist the urge to complete weeklies by running around inefficiently; instead I make sure to let every action have multiple payoffs.  Using hearths intelligently together with the flight path whistle you can greatly minimize travel time.  

Today I did world boss and I got all twelve done (3 930s for 24 rolls, ugh) in less than 90 minutes while also doing all char order hall missions.  Rest of week I will prioritize lowest order hall resource chars for the weekly, but waiting for fast paths with emissary.  There was a great path today in wastes where you could pick up almost 5k resources in less than ten minutes, but I didn't have time to get all my chars through, so I got lowest resource chars through.  If I run out of or on a char, I use bloods.  I only do 200% missions.

I spend about a half hour or less doing order hall (addon is a must) for all chars, and wait for opportunities like today where in 10 minutes I can snag 5k order resources while progressing weekly arg and weekly 5k quest.  I play my main for fun and less than an hour a day on managing the other 11.  When raids are new I just worry about getting one char through at a time in lfr, and I make sure to maximize best use of bonus roll tokens.  If a char has a heal or tank spec I run that in lfr to minimize q time, and if it is a dps char I stack up emissaries so q time isn't wasted.

The efficiency game is a little mini game for me, I don't have very much time to play so maximizing rewards for available time becomes a fun challenge.  Not as fun as pushing content but that's waaaaay more time consuming than managing 12 chars.

Doing this the gold flows well (probably around 30k for a half hour of work), I get to get familiar with at least one spec per char, and see the content.  When it feels grindy I just let the chars sit and chase things with my main.",1509494859

Spend the first wave with priority on building your NP gauge, and you should be able to get past the first few waves without losing too much health.

A stronger colonial presence there would lead to more troops already positioned in Asia and the america to support them so that if/when the Russo Japanese war breaks out the Russians would overwhelm them. This would allow the Russians to keep Manchuria and port Arthur making the tsar much richer.

The whole time, between ejaculations, all I could think about was how unbecoming the whole thing was of me. Out of all the men in the world, my girlfriend decided to take the plunge and choose me. I pitifully thought to myself, 'this is how I show appreciation towards her?!' I still have to check myself sometimes, but being in a relationship is really something to be tremendously grateful for. The thought of losing it is unfathomable to me, and would devastate me completely. I can't let something as fucking pathetic as jacking off to porn jeopardize that. The real world costs absolutely do not justify the pixel fueled nano-second orgasm.
I wish it were an easy thing to remember when the urges hit, but I found that reinforcing this thought by repetition and browsing here more frequently helps. The more you quell the urges, the closer you will be to the end of the 1-month hump - where things reportedly get much easier. Just keep your eyes on the goal, go one day at a time, and for the love of your girlfriend refrain from falling deep into the abyss of porn addiction. Your girlfriend chose YOU.

"penguins","t5_2r549","It's a he-said, she-said situation, with the small amount of physical evidence that existed at the time favoring the woman's side.

As an ex-criminal prosecutor, it's very very common for women to change their stories after the initial report due to fear, anxiety, not wanting to make their struggle public, and out of a misguided sense of love. So comments about her changing her story afterwards are not to be trusted any more than comments from the accused that ""he didn't do it.""

In a he-said, she-said, the best you can do is stay the fuck out of it.

What you are doing is blatantly believing the words of the accused involved, and disbelieving the initial report from the victim. This is exactly the behavior that has motivated the entire #MeToo movement. In every other crime, the perpetrator saying ""I didn't do it!"" is a laughable cliche. But for some reason, in domestic assaults, it's like, ""Well, darn, I guess the guy said he didn't do it.""

Yes, I know that innocent until proven guilty is a thing, and yes I know the facts of this particular incident. But the BEST you can do is not take any side at all. Posting shit that says ""he was wrongfully accused"" is just as misleading and inappropriate as if someone else posts something saying ""he was definitely guilty.""",1509494868

Directly comparing them is going to be hard. 7 * Tidus for instance is more likely now to be built as a doublehand build using his TMR. Same with Aileen (though she could go either way). Comparing them to Dual Wield builds is hard. Harder when a unit like Tidus can triple use his Quick Hit even with a doublehand build, you also need to factor in the skill to triple use it.

In general though OK will probably cap out around ~1400-1500 atk, in a BiS dual wield style build. Aileen in a doublehand build can hit 2.2k atk. However Aileen's doublehand build isn't as good a chainer as OK, who has 15-20 hit moves, even if he is hard to perfect chain. Aileen though can use her 3-hit 2000+% LB as a 'finisher'.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","This issue isn't with the AUMF's age, but the fact that it doesn't appear to authorize actions against ISIS. Here's the relevant portion:

&gt;The President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists

Most of the ""War on Terror"" is no longer against people or organizations that committed the 9/11 attacks. So there's a pretty good argument that operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups today are illegal. Courts defer to the political branches on these kinds of questions -- but I still think we should try to ensure that military actions comply with the law.

There's some really neat platforming and boss fights so far, and it never feels like the game is the reason I died. Controls are tight and precise, and while the Pounce's weird arc takes some getting used to, it felt great one I got the hang of it. Additionally, the music is the best soundtrack of any Bubsy to date, and the Verbosity slider got a laugh out of me, though many will probably want that geared low so as to not hear the same lines over and over. 

This is legitimately a good game. I know that sounds weird, but the bobcat finally hit the mark! It's undoubtedly the best Bubsy game, no question. Black Forest Games managed to save the bobcat from oblivion like the sisters. It's definitely worth $20+the soundtrack, though it may be a harder sell for some at $30. ",1509494872

One thing that the video points out in part 2 is that TNG's set was very brightly lit, compared to most shows which use spot lights against a dark background to make things pop.

I remember getting to Valkurm for the first time and being completely lost yet amazed at the same time. I remember the entire world like the back of my hand after all these years and all the best places to level.

I recall being amazed at Avesta too and having mana burn parties. I was also on Bahamut and my LS had a lot of ties with The Order of the Blue Gartr which was great for some of the giant events. I truly miss it all, the challenge was rough but it always felt worth it and made some amazing friends I still have to this day

Ill never forget finally killing Ultima and desperately getting to Shenzen because you knew sea access was just around the corner. All the hatred towards Promy runs, one of the first real player tests. Camping out forever killing monsters for a chest key to get that sweet sweet artifact gear. I loved limbus, dynamis, despised salvage, assault was great, I could go on

I still loved Aht Urghan, it was so incredibly fun to explore those areas, however for me it tapered off when Wings if the Goddess came out, I also went to university around that time and decided it was best not to continue playing. I did go back on and off for all the other expansions, now though, the friends I had don't play it anymore and it feels like a husk of what it once was because of that and how easy it all feels now.

Got any counter to the UK study I posted from 2005? Which is another source of this claim?

&gt;&gt;As a dude, you should be vastly more worried about being raped than being falsely accused of rape.

&gt;I'm a woman. Moving on...

Generic you. Obviously, I would have thought.

&gt;This ultimately encourages some women to scoff, ignore, or laugh at the idea that boys or men being sexually abused, emotionally abused, physically abused, or raped is even a real problem, let alone one that needs to be addressed.

Feminism has been addressing the problem of male rape and sexual assault victims since waaaay before the Manosphere got hold of it as a stick to beat us with, and so have I personally. Strangely enough, when I ask what MRA-types actually *do* about it other than bitching about feminism on the internet (I've acted as an advocate for homeless men or men in insecure housing when reporting incidents of sexual assault to the police, among other things), all I get is crickets.

&gt;Having their cake and eating it too.

Ah, yes. In the end it all comes down to an urge to control female sexuality. The difference between hooking up with a guy with a gross chat-up line and \#MeToo stories about sexual assault is *consent*. Not that complicated.

Finally, your insistence on talking about false rape accusations and judging your college friends' sex lives is derailing a thread *about male victims of rape and sexual assault*, which is an issue you claim to care about, and an issue I certainly *do* care about, so how about we get back on topic, hmmm?",1509494877

"FinancialCareers","t5_2scvl","Hey Mellarkey,
What you're feeling is perfectly normal. Just make sure you have the right expectations going in. 

You will learn either by being thrown into the fire and having to scramble and learn fast to keep from being burned up.  Along the way you'll come close to burning up and burning out, but keep at it and you'll get it. OR you'll learn by firehose, where they turn on a firehose of info and spray it all in your face.  Hopefully you're able to drink some but most is not going to be absorbed. 

Either way, you'll learn it.  They don't expect you to know everything when you start. Just know your concepts and know how to get answers. 

There is a work life balance for a FA, but this field of finance works long hours sometimes like during month end close and worse during quarter closes and worst during year end.  Just know there will be long hours during those times.  But they pay well and you'll be gaining experience you can take anywhere. ",1509494878
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok, this one sounds overly mean at first but just think about it a little before rushing to comment...

""Everyone is single for a reason""

I don't just mean the bad stuff like they're an asshole or a cheat etc. Plenty of times the reason someone is single is obvious.
But sometimes it's more nuanced, maybe they like being single, maybe they're asexual and haven't really figured out to be in a relationship like that yet, maybe they've just been divorced or widowed. 

Someone can seem perfect and leave you thinking ""how is this person still single?!"" - well basically there will be a reason why somewhere. 

When it comes to dating this mantra is useful because often there will come a point where you find out what 'the reason they're single' is, and quite simply that thing is likely to be the deal breaker in my view. It also reminds us that no one is perfect (especially when you turn the statement back round on yourself when you're single)",1509494878

I think you are really mixed up and should re-read this post.  I've never claimed I can control pst, I've admitted I have a problem with tia, I told the girl who has a 2 lb seed problem that she will be fine taking 350 mg of tia, honestly it'll probably give her a decent buzz.

So the biggest problem I have with actually using the site is that the all the input boxes are either dropdowns or sliders. It feels so awful actually search for a riven and post a riven.

I feel one of your highest priorities should be making it so it is possible to just type in every field to filter valid results. That will make it a lot faster for someone who is looking for multiple types of rivens to buy, and someone who needs to post multiple rivens. Another thing that definitely needs to be a typed integer is the ""Price Limit"" on the riven list. That slider is infuriating and not at all helpful. It only steps in multiples of 100, and the scale is so large, trying to get a specific number like 700 for instance, is really annoying.

While it is a QoL change, I feel that it is a massive jump in QoL, and it would make your site MUCH easier to use for people who want to list a bunch of rivens, or Buy/PC a bunch of rivens.

Hopefully, you at least make sure that the ""Search for a Riven"" allows text input, and doesn't make us to try to use 8+ dropdowns with between 20-100 options each every time we want to look for a single riven.",1509494880

"starfinder_rpg","t5_3et65","We had the Drake but from what I remember we didn't have much trouble. My memory is terrible but here are a few things that come to mind. 1. We attacked the platform and not the extra drones. Even though it stops at 4 drones which we figured out by the time the 5th should come out, it's kind of common sense that if something is sending out drones, it's better to attack the thing creating them rather than the little guys themselves. So that 240 HP across all 12 you're mentioning is kind of a moot point. 2. 6d4 damage and ""missing frequently"" won't apply to every group. I'm not sure who they had on the gunner station but maybe it was just poor group composition which doesn't mean that will always be the case for every group. Our gunners seemed to do just fine. 3. Having the four drones fire their laser cannons at the PC's ship doesn't mean it will be barely holding together by the end of combat because the PC's ship is also regaining shields.  
I don't own the scenario and I don't have a log of all our actions but so far, space combat has been super fun for me and as someone who is playing a 100% piloting character, my viewpoint on it should mean a lot since my character relies pretty much entirely on space combat being fun and viable. I love positioning my ship in the right places so my multiple gunners can take shots, I love ""evasive maneuvers"" to add to our AC and I love having high piloting so that I can move second and make sure that their ships don't have a clear shot on us.  
Starship combat may just be difficult for Society since the groups are usually not well balanced properly. Unlike a homebrew game where you can make sure the ship has all the positions it needs, there might just be holes that can cause problems. In that case, by all means take any actions you need to balance the scenario and make it fun for everyone but I don't think it's a reason to complain or say it is broken.",1509494881

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Firstly, welcome to DotA :)

I've played a little LoL here and there (I'm terrible), and supporting in-lane seems to be largely the same basic concepts: protect your carry, harass the enemy, get a little something for yourself where you can.

(In both LoL and DotA, the actual objectives are far more complex and intricate than just those three basic aims, but let's keep it super simple. You're learning a brand new game here.)

Personally, I started out with Lich. He's kind of a common suggestion, somewhat of a ""go to"" for new players. He can harass pretty well with his first ability ""Frost Blast"" and a reasonable attack animation. ""Sacrifice"" will help introduce you to the deny mechanic. ""Ice Armor"" is great for keeping your carry safe in lane.

Crystal Maiden is another good choice. She's a reasonably difficult hero to play well, but great for learning the basics. Provides a lot to her team in terms of crowd control/disables and an aura that helps your entire team regenerate mana, no matter where they are on the map (provided you're alive). ""Frostbite"" is also a great way to get a little extra gold for yourself. It's quite effective at killing jungle creeps, even really early on when it's level 1 or 2. If your carry feels safe, don't be afraid to duck into the jungle for a couple seconds and score yourself some extra gold and XP by frostbiting a jungle creep (you may need to slap him in the face a few times as well)

I'm a little less confident about recommending Abaddon (can someone else chime in on Aba for a newbie?), but he has a really strong support setup. He's versatile in that he can play in many different roles, but his ""Aphotic Shield"" is one of the rare few abilities in the game that can remove a hard stun from an ally, and while his ""Mist Coil"" isn't an amazing heal, it's kinda reasonable in a pinch, and it can also be used as a nuke.",1509494888

But it's too tempting for me to not put money on that match. We had very profitable GOTD picks the last days and I'm going to watch this match anyway. I'm really looking forward to that NBA clash.

&gt;According to whom? 

The bible. He was preaching a false Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:4

&gt;The same Church declared Luther a heretic. 

Since all the people who were at the council of Nicaea were dead by the time Luther showed up, I'm going with no.

&gt;Arius wasn't dumb. 

He was dumb enough to not see that Christ is God.

&gt;This still doesn't address the fact that like Luther, Arius stood against the Church because he understood Scripture as saying something other than what the Church professed.

The study of history is to study 

&gt;what choices they made

To

&gt;to evaluate the choices available to the people during the time period,

is also part of it insofar as you do not judge or merely judge on the basis of information available to them, informed by the social norms and mores those specific people lived by.

&gt;and to ask if there were any other possible options available to them back then, with the knowledge we know now?

Absolutely not. That is speculation, not the study of history. That is applying current knowledge to the past. It's like talking about the Pope and Galileo taking into account what we know now. Or judging the Mayans confronting the Spanish from a 21st century viewpoint.

Which is fine if you're writing fiction. But the study of history leaves speculation out of it and focuses on what we can find/determine/prove about the time THEN, leaving all morality of now out of it.",1509494889

"bobssoapyfrogwank","t5_3m541","First, a reminder of the actual issue I challenged Rolanbek on:

What Rolanbek claimed:

&gt;WT get to claim honesty, and malign the customer as 'some crazy person'.

What WT actually said:

&gt;Jeongdw - Very sorry the validation work takes time, but it’s worth doing and helps all users. To respond to your concern, we’ll refund you in good faith. If you decide we’ve been fair to you, you can reorder. Just let us know within a week and we’ll restore your priority date. Thank you

And, as previously pointed out, I covered the full context of Rolanbek's post as well as the full context of what Jeongdw said. No context that changes the original point in any of them.

Next, the usual observation that nowhere in Rolanbek's response does he provide any WT statement or any context himself that changes the point - that WT did not malign that poster as crazy.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","If I'm reading you right here, you realize that the bulk of the job comes down to the ""on-season"", but it seems like there are still sales going on for the rest of the year. I'm guessing you're something like a seasonal business?

Without knowing the details of the business, it's hard to say, but is it possible to increase your productivity on the off-season? Diversify your sales/services such that you have something to offer for the other ~10 months? That could help justify retaining so many employees when you could (I assume) get by with fewer during the off-season (but obviously, re-hiring the entire team as contractors would probably not go over well).

If that's not a viable option, you just need to make sure that **you** don't start treating the off-season as irrelevant. Even if 2 months are your prime time, and only 25% of sales happen over the rest of the year, you still want to optimize those 25% as best you can. Make sure that employees have clear goals and metrics for success - even if those targets are much lower than during prime time. Continue to evaluate employee performance year-round.

Also, you can make clear to new hires and discuss in a meeting with current employees that the job is somewhat unusual in that your 2 month prime time is the clear most important time of year. You can tell people that if they want to take vacations, want to work at their own pace, want to take off early once their work for the day is done - they have 10 months out of the year to do so. However, they can only do that IF they are prepared to give 100% for the whole of the prime time season - which may mean late nights, no time off during that period, more stress, or whatever it is the work entails.

It makes it a ""perk"" of working for you, rather than an unfortunate circumstance where people just can't find anything to do because they know the ""off-season"" is ""pointless"".",1509494895

Past that, you need to learn how to use the `Get-Help` powershell command.  Powershell has lots of good help available from the command line.  See `Get-Help -ShowWindow Get-Help` to get a window with the help, which may be a bit easier to read.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","&gt; I can get 2 sheets of two side finished ply for $100 and $20 for veneer.

And you can get the IKEA unit for $85.

&gt;The ikea unit is $130 plus shipping because the nearest one to me is 5 hours away.

The IKEA unit $85 unless you're including doors. If you include doors, then you need 3 plywood sheets and $40 in veneer to be equivalent.

If you include shipping from a place like Home Depot. That's another $80-100 for 4x8 plywood. Your cost will be well over $200. 

So best case scenario for you is $150 in plywood and $40 in veneer for the frame and door. Ikea charges about $50 for shipping that unit the last time I had it sent last year so that means about $180.

Last I checked, $190 in raw material cost more than $180 full unit shipped. We haven't even include screws, finishing, stain, sanding paper, handles, etc... for your DIY build. 

&gt;So it is cheaper. Math is not your strong suit is it?

You are now relying on insults instead of common sense. Your math is flawed. Here are why I hope nobody listens to you.

1. You are discounting how much it cost for a DIY build from raw materials to the level of delusional.

2. You are discounting the time it takes to a very unrealistic estimate. Even a pro with pro tools cannot build it that fast. I don't know a single pro that can build it in an hour from raw material. I've never heard any real pro or even hobbyist skip sanding plywood. And I do wood working quite often and know plenty of carpenters. 

3. You cannot even articulate how you're supposed to ""properly"" build this unit in a way that saves time. You are literally just claiming you can do it faster and cheaper when the numbers you provide yourself does the opposite. 

4. You can think you can do a finish in under an hour. You need at least 2 coats of polyurethane and even the fastest drying poly needs over an hour before you can apply a second coat. This one little detail completely invalidate everything you claim you can do.

&gt;Each and every one of those would violate quark color ""confinement"", and while we don't 100% understand how confinement works, having even one unbalanced ""bare"" quark in the universe might possibly be a terribly bad thing. (I'm honestly not sure what would happen.)

&gt;See, when you do somehow create a ""bare"" quark (by breaking apart an existing proton, for example), it tends to pull gluons and other fundamental particles out of the vacuum in an attempt to reach a color neutral state (roughly speaking, either red--anti-red or red-green-blue, although in actuality even those aren't quite all the way to being true ""color singlet"" states). Everything it pulls out of the vacuum is color neutral, though, so that cascade only ends when it meets up with the similar cascades due to the other unbalanced quark(s) from the original collision and they all cancel out (leading to a spray of hadrons in all directions as those newly-created particles clump together due to confinement). It all snaps to consistency within a fraction of a second. If there literally did not exist in the universe an anti-red quark to balance a magically created red one, I don't know if it would ever stop at all.

&gt; How can those goals be achieve? Well, most of those things cost devs ($) and marketing investment ($). Where can the $ come from? The game developers get more ($) by bringing more players into the funnel, and increasing revenue per user by offering compelling content for in game purchase (custom avatars, pack bundles etc.)
You have a great game on your hands. IMHO, game-play mechanics and card art are miles ahead of your main competition. So if the game is better, what's the issue? Awareness. You need to drive more players to pick up the game in the first place (1M downloads to-date; how many are re-downloads vs. net new?) and to stay engaged.

Bethesda really needs you to tell these basic things to them like they're a baby, when in reality they understand the financial and marketing aspect of the game to a way greater magnitude than you. Please continue enjoying life as a naive toddler who thinks they've found the key to making the game successful.

You can post your recommendations for the gameplay to improve without condescendingly offering useless marketing advice.

&gt; Or take a leaf out of one of the most successful micro-transaction games (LoL) and create card skins. Like ""super shinys"", they have custom VFX / animations / voice etc. Regardless, they can do more on both user base and RPU /u/solidage we have free ideas :-)

It's taken five months for Dire Wolf to make 55 cards. What makes you think they can put out custom card microtransactions like this? You can always say ""add this, do that, COSMETICS!"" when in reality you don't really know their developmental or budgetary resources, or priorities.",1509494898

"quityourbullshit","t5_2y8xf","&gt;I’m just against anything that causes people not to take responsibility for their actions.

Right. Abortion is a responsible choice.

Besides, a child is not a fucking consequence to beat someone with. Fuck that mentality.

&gt; The point of sex is to reproduce.

Fuck that. We invented birth control precisely because sex is a part of normal human interaction and separating it from reproduction improves the human experience.

&gt;Condoms are literally 50 cent and you’re telling me people can’t afford that?

Condoms break. Even if there were free condoms on every street corner and free birth control in every pharmacy accidents would still happen.

The fact that you would treat *being forced to bring a kid into this world without anyone who wants to take care of it* as a consequence is seriously fucked up.

&gt; We can kill millions of babies or potential babies or whatever you want to call them or we can just get people to start taking responsibility for their actions.

The fact that you are looking at a baby as a consequence makes me think you don't give a shit about kids. You're just trying to force your shitty sexually repressive ethics on people.

It's not bad to have sex.

&gt; I agree we can’t just all the babies come into adoption centers because we can’t afford that, but if you are going to use tax payers money I would rather pay to have people get a vasectomy than pay to allow people to have abortions. 

Some people want kids eventually, just not at the time an unintentional pregnancy happens. That being said, sterilizations should be easily available. Urologists and gynecologists can be rough to work with if you're not already a parent or older.

&gt;I think abortion should be illegal and if you have a child that you can’t take care of it should be put up for adoption and you should have to get a vasectomy.

Honestly just fuck you at this point.",1509494898

Eventually someone else was called, he thought of his revelation and wondered what had happened.  The Spirit told him, ""You were *considered* but you were found wanting.""

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","Cool, me too. But I've been studying. Took me a bit to get the hang of stops/losses/etc.

You only want to use a stop order to STOP LOSSES. In other words, you buy at 6450, but if it drops below 6400 you want to get back into USD, so you set a stop order sell. Or, you sell at 6450, but if it reaches 6500 you're afraid it'll go to the moon, so you set a stop order buy for 6500, just in case. 

Example: You go long at 6400, expecting price to reach 7000 soon. You think this because you used some trading tools and see that we are due for a price explosion. You set a sell limit order for 6950ish. This will automatically close your long position when the price hits 6950, and it will sell for exactly 6950.

HOWEVER, there's a reasonable chance that the pattern you're seeing is actually _______, and the price is instead going to crater, likely to 2500. You sure as shit don't want to still be long when it does. So you set a stop sell order at 6300, which is where you think the price needs to fall to in order to confirm the pattern that drops the price down to 2500. If the price hits 6300, the exchange will close your long position, selling everything at MARKET PRICE. It does not guarantee you will sell at 6300",1509494903

Yes, there's plenty of low information voters on the left too.  They're ignorant, not necessarily of what social issues are important, but the manner in which solutions can be achieved.  Nader and Sanders promised immediate change, which was never possible.  Low information voters on the left expect instant change and aren't willing to settle for incremental improvements (hence all the hate for Obamacare, despite the fact that it is a step in the right direction)...

So T2ing her is not a MUST , but it raises her dps by a good chunk and makes her CC-ANYTHING ability work 100% of the time instead of 70%.

Valkyrie on the other hand seems like a support character mostly good for her 45% dmg against villain boost.  So idk what to say about her other than I'd vote for enchantress if you don't have dr strange or another character that can do most pve content.",1509494905

It follows that all qualities of its physical form is directly related to its ability to hold an energy. However if you had a piece and then matter replicated one from it to 100x the size (just using sci-fi replication for the sake of an example) the two would have the same holding ability.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","As I said before, I've never played a RF char myself, so don't take my advice as the last word on any matter. Still, a couple things:

You have Elemental Equilibrium. From what I've seen, you can only trigger it with Orb of Storms, right? Having one gearpiece with ""adds # to # cold/lightning damage to attacks"" would allow your shield charge to also trigger EE. It doesn't have to be a high value, just any added cold/lightning damage to attacks (RF/SR aren't attacks, so they wouldn't get affected, but Shield Charge is). 

I'm not sure what you're getting out of Bloodgrip. Sure, it gives you 1.6% life regen. But any rare marble amulet can give the same (the implicit range is 1.2 - 1.6, but just throw a couple blessed orbs at one and you'll hit 1.6). The other mods from Bloodgrip don't seem that great - Phys damage to attacks is useless; life is less than a well-rolled rare; flat life regen per second you can get on a rare as well, and it's not a big amount; moving while bleeding is QoL, but a flask solves that. Only mod I'm not really sure how important it is for you is the life recovery. 

If the life recovery is important to you (depends on how much you rely on your flasks I guess), then it might be a good idea to stick with it. Otherwise, I'd get a marble amulet with more life, a line of added elemental damage to attacks (to trigger EE), cold resist (to cap your resists) and increased fire damage or strength (more life) if possible. 

Throw some blessed orbs at your belt. That 30 life implicit wants to be 40. Gives you 32 extra life. 

A really well-rolled rare helmet (t1 life/t1 hybrid armour and life, or something close to that) can also net you 150+ extra life, at the cost of around 3 to 4k damage and not having the immunity to freeze/chill (which can be dealt with with a flask). Seems worth it to me, but I'm unsure how much such a helmet would cost. ",1509494909

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","I actually think we got it spelled out to us in this episode.

The Klingons want her, she is a prize more valuable to them than anything, she killed their Messiah.

At the end of the day, the Discoverys mission is to use unconventional means to find a way to win the war, and at some point a diplomatic option may present itself where Burnhams life can be traded to the Klingons for a cessation of hostilities.

It's not that he's planning on selling her out I don't think, it's if the opportunity ever presents itself he wants her in his back pocket.

we know that the Admiralty is against her being there, she is there purely as a result of Lorca.

We've seen Lorca a few times now show that he wants Burnham kept alive, he orders Tyler to come back with her alive or not at all last episode then in this one, when Mudd comes out of the Gormigander he specifically orders Burnham not to engage while sending others after him.",1509494913

People with really weird proportions may find his sequence frustrating. Particularly - long-limbed women, in my experience. And tall people just generally often have issues with setting up to pull from the floor

There is a difference with having people set up like this in front of a coach, and then tweaking it, and having people read a book and then just bending over to set up. When the latter fucks up, they post on the SS forum about their back hurting and he gruffly tells them to read the book.

Teaching people to pull with a rigid/neutral spine can be hard. I, too, have used variations on Rippetoe's cues to get people close to right idea. ",1509494913

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","&gt; If white people decide to be less racist it won't make too much of a difference in the economic and social inequalities inbedded within capitalism

White people being less racist would literally make all the difference. The system is upheld in large part by the biases (conscious and subconscious) that the society reinforces in white people. If large enough portions of white people were made aware of these biases, it would result in a change to the system. This was the basis of the Civil Rights Movement. 

&gt;I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.”

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Honestly it doesn't even matter if it was her feelings for you that was the cause of the breakup, it isn't as if the feelings she had during the hookup would have disappeared. Heck, she entered the relationship halfheartedly to begin with, it was inevitable it would fall apart. 

It may be too soon but the bigger concern is actually the buildup. You two have teased and romanticised the idea of this for a long time now and sometimes the rather flat reality that real dating represents can be a bit of a shock. There is also a lot of pressure to make sure it works since you are potentially upsetting so many people [the exes, etc] and risking the friendship. These are things worth keeping in mind so you don't fall victim to them, dating best friends is harder than it seems but obviously can be one of the more fulfilling relationship dynamics as well. 

There is no right or wrong at this point. I see a good sense to admitting the feelings so that she doesn't rebound to someone else or back to him. I also see the sense in waiting, in case you inadvertently become a soft rebound for him. Maybe hang out a bit and just let it organically play out.

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","So I have a thought or two on your post. First, I've never really thought about 

&gt; in our post-religious culture, we are embracing a holiday that at its core is religious, albeit occultic

I think that's really interesting, and I've never thought about it! Coming from someone who also really dislikes Halloween (I really just find excessive decorations and stuff gross, for lack of a better word), I'd like to offer a counterargument to one of your points. If you're under 35 this might be something interesting to consider, but if you're not I might be speaking out of my element, so disregard.

Have you ever considered that Halloween was *always* this raunchy and exploited by adults, and you just never noticed it before? I ask this partially to myself, also. I'm in college now and I'm honestly surprised how bad it is. You know that joke in Mean Girls where they say girls just use Halloween as an excuse to wear lingerie to a party and they can't get called out? If my instagram feed is to be believed, that's much truer than I thought.

I don't think adult Halloween parties are a really new concept. If they are, it's at least been a thing for quite a few years. But like I said, maybe you're a bit older and have actually noticed a shift in culture even while you've been an adult. If so, I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on that! I do agree though that adults have ""gotten more into it,"" in a sense that wearing a costume to work, for instance, isn't unheard of anymore. Who knows though, this is just my personal experience on it. Could differ in different states/regions.",1509494918

Cars are easy. There are establishments that will sell you a car for around 4 grand or less with payment plans that go around 2 years. I got my car from BC Motors right outside of gate 2 and my payment is $150/mo and it has a warranty for 2 years.

Every link in a chain of mechanic, chemical, or biological synthesis takes some energy or loses some of the material to conversion, and nothing is free when it's an essentially closed system. (Yes, even Earth is mostly a closed system at scale, but it's big enough that most of us won't see it directly outside of market forces unless we make a point to seek out the limits of things.) When getting feedstock of any kind of raw material into orbit is expensive, it's a scary balancing game of weight and fuel and intrinsic value of the material. 

I have read some speculative sci-fi that included this kind of generation ship to one degree or another, and there's usually a (plot-driv(en/ing)) shortage of raw physical or genetic material at some point. I think you'll have a hard time convincing people that it takes so much raw input to sustain a human in space with minimal intended resupply and have difficulty keeping these ventures properly balanced for the population, especially in a survival of the species/'I don't want to die' situation (again, novels, would be boring without conflict).

i think its an amazing system, here are a couple of my favorite things about them. 

it eliminates the possibility of horseshoe malfunction and an out of sequence deployment. once the container is open its open and the bag cannot come out of the container with out the pilotchute 

positive deployment of the pilotchute. this one comes with a little experience jumping the system. i hear some complaints about it initially but this is actually one of my favorite parts. most people tend to have a iron grip on their pud, with a little practice you'll feel the pull of the pin after that hang on to the pud with a lose grip or even just two fingers, you'll feel the pilotchute inflate and get pulled from your hand, its a pretty reassuring feeling to know your pilotchute is inflated and doing its thing


loose puds, doesnt happen often, but sure it can happen and its definitely not as bad of an issue as one might think, if its not there just reach a little further back, its hanging out right there by the main flap, its not hard to get. i've had it happen once and it wasnt as scary as i thought. 


downsides, they're not good for wingsuits, they have a hard time inflating behind a wing. 

sauce: 800some jumps on a pull-out system and totally recommend them.

A lvl 18 Ornn's perfect combo deals 1019 + 46% max health (!!!) + 60% of both bonus armor and bonus MR (an extra ~200 damage at full build would be my guess. That means 300 armor and 160MR, btw). So 1219 + 46% max health as total damage.

I'm leaving item choices (and their effects on damage) aside, since the two champions do not have the same scalings and do not benefit identically from the same items (Ornn is more oriented towards magic damage so Abyssal Mask works bette on him than on Sion, and Sion benefits a Titanic Hydra to take advantage of his infinite stacking).

Therefore in these theoretical conditions, it's a tradeoff between 963 damage (2163-1219) and 34% max health (46-12).

Which means that in these conditions, Ornn deals more damage than Sion against targets with over 2832 max health, and less against squishies.

Finally, as was said by someone else, Ornn's combo takes a lot more time, especially time during which his opponents aren't CCed and can get away (therefore it's hard to call it ""one cycling someone"", which implies that you can get the combo off relatively fast). Sion can get his full combo off with his target stun-locked.",1509494923

People do fearmonger. Out of their hate for micro transactions, they don’t care if they’re bad or not, they don’t like them so they tell people the game is bad. Then there’s the people who are terribly misinformed. Such as the journalist who assumed the credit limit in the offline arcade meant that you could no longer play the game if you ran out of credits. He then presumed you had to pay (with real money) to get more credits, to allow you to keep playing. Which was completely untrue. It was simply a credit earning limit, to prevent credit farming against easy bots. 

And yes. Be careful, nd don’t take everything you red too seriously. That’s not pathetic. That’s common sense. As long as you don’t listen to a review and adopt that reviewers opinion as your own, and instead just consider it as you learn about a game yourself, you’ll be okay.

My first time hurt sooo badly that I gave up PIV sex for about 3 months afterwards and never spoke to the guy again out of embarrassment. It wasn't the guys fault and it wasn't because I wasn't turned on enough. I totally was! That's just what happened. After a few more tries with my now boyfriend I learned to really love it. 

Suggestions: go down on her. Don't ask for head if she's not done it before, because that seems scarier and more complicated to the inexperienced. This will be more about giving than relieving tbh. 

Mood lighting, warmth, provide romance, have contraception sorted before hand (condoms nearby, STI test sorted, knowing she's on the pill or whatever).

Be open minded and non judgmental. Virgins tend to have built sex up in their minds to be a Huge Deal. Which in some ways, it can be. But the idea of two people just doing something really natural and fun and sometimes gross isn't what they have in mind.

Flat plastic that you curl by the heat of an iron.then I cut it into the shape of a nib. 


The problem was they run out of ink too fast. 


Oh and that headless toothbrush has a pie hole running half way through its length. 



That pie hole has ridges on it, which were placed there one by one with a wider. 

Did I mention it's sometimes very hard to get the clay to slide off the pencil in a clean piece, and I ended up scraping ruined attempts off the pencil with a razor twice? 



And the ""wrapping paper"" is newspaper. 

Sometimes when clay is wet, touching it in order to move it from the protect paper (paper that protects the furniture, clay Will  take the paint off the table) spoils the careful shape you were going for, so you slowly cut around the clay pen, so you can transport it safely to the baking trray



See those squares at the top of the headless toothbruh""? 



If you put a small hole in polymer clay, and then bake it, the baking can cause the hole to close up. 



So you put in a piece of folded aluminum paper, so the ""*headless toothbrush*"" can have slits at the top. 


Because the original tutorial said that if you put your straw nib in a pen - knife holder, your handwriting will improve 



What else did you ask about, the tooth pick holder? 


Well, I suppose you could call them that. 


I was following the shark nib shape. And I decided to encorporate the principle of the straw nib pens. 



Since they worked the best out of any pen I've ever tried to make. There's a folded hole by the bottom of the staple, with a straw nabbed pen. 



And that hole, holds ink for a long period of time. 

So when I was making the shark pen nib, I rolled out the clay thin cut it into a square 🏢🏦 and then folded it over the tooth brush so the clay wouldn't loose it's ""ink hole"" while firing. 


Then it was between scissors, a engraving knife and a roller, for five minutes, and for each of those nubs. 



Even placing them down on the tray made them Deen reshaping.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Top: Smeb. Of all the toplane gods in Korea, Smeb has been the one that has really carried the baton for the longest. Players like Reapered, Maknoon, Shy and Flame brought it into existence but their peaks as the best or one of the best really lasted only one season usually. Starting in season 5, you had the holy trinity of Smeb, Duke and Ssumday plus Marin. All three of these players were gods in the top for at least two years; Marin, sadly, was only really magnificent for one year before he went off to China and slid back. After season 6, Duke and Ssumday left the premier region for lesser regions and have had limited success. Smeb, however, has maintained his top form for three years, which is why I give him the nod.

Jungle: This is probably the most difficult to place. Dandy is certainly a reliable pick, however he was only really amazing for one year, though he certainly had flashes of greatness in season 3. I think, ultimately, I've got to give it to Bengi just on his accomplishments and longevity. Yes, he played with Faker and had amazing other players to back him up but he was also worthy of playing on the team and carried his fair share of the weight in extremely clutch situations.

Mid: Faker, no doubt about it.

ADC: This one is also difficult, simply because there is a plethora of amazing ADC players. However, in the end, I think I've gotta give it to Pray. Pray has been amazing for four years now (Seasons 3, 5, 6 and 7) and would have been a world champion for at least two of those years (seasons 3 and 5) and probably a third year (season 6) if it hadn't been for one team: SKT. Dude is like Karl Malone and the Jazz running up against Michael Jordon and the Bulls. It's unreal just how unlucky his career has been thus far. Shout out to Bang, though.

Support: Probably Gorilla. He's been superb for nearly as long as Pray, though Wolf is certainly up there as well. The reason I don't consider Mata is because he was amazing in season 4 but mediocre in 5 and 6 and even season 7. It's true that his high was the highest high in the support role but he held it for a moment before it disappeared. You need longevity and Gorilla really fits that role with superb play making and length of excellence.",1509494927

Theres too much infighting among stock android fan boys who can't help but talk trash about anything that doesn't have a g stamp on it.

I'm just telling it as it is. There are valid reasons for everything and android is better off with variety.

It's objective official fact that without s Apps there wouldn't be any balance to Android. Why do you think galaxies are the only ones certified by the nsa?

The s ecosystem is the Knox ecosystem.

The people talking trash about it just lie and never make any reference to this angle which is outright insulting.

When people don't know why they are as they are they seem like they don't have as much online integration but if you see them in context of I Apps which is the only other ecosystem certified by the same markets you understand the fundamental differences and why they are as they are.

When he hit the ground it cause the ball to come out. I don’t see how that can give him a stone hands. I’ve watched the ball hit Pryor in the hands multiple times for him to drop it. Can’t remember once for Doctson. The only other ball I saw Doctson fuck up was last week but even then he beat the corner by 2-3 steps but Kirk through it behind so he had to stop and fall back. And you say he’s not capitalizing on his targets but he has 3 TDs on just 17. I would say that’s pretty good. And they are in the market for WR because outside of Doctson and Crowder they have no one.

Edit: Play I was referring to was against KC. I agree the drop against Dallas wasn’t great but one play should make him labeled stone hands. And he made up for it with the TD",1509494930

There are problems with this. He checks up on my work very often, so if he walks over to my desk and I'm working on my own iteration based on his idea, he will just tell me to do what he sent and ask what's taking so long and then squint at me the whole time I talk.

But to answer your question about Cooper needing to ""save the girl"",  the book says that Cooper's mother had some issues due to a failed marriage. We don't get details but perhaps depression, or alcoholism, something like that.  Cooper in his youth tended to her.  Tammy suggests that this could be the reason Cooper tends to have a savior complex.  She states this very plainly that he can't help himself when he sees a damsel in distress. She says that Windham Earl's wife was reaching out for help from Cooper, rather than it being strictly a romantic dalliance.  Same thing we see with his subsequent concerns for Audrey, Annie and naturally his mission to save Laura.  We also learn a lot more about Annie and her troubled past in the book. So it makes sense.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My family took in foster kids for several years and I saw and heard things that will never leave me. The most haunting thing wasn't what a kid said but what one of the judges told us before placing one of our kids with us. He said that this was the worst case of abuse he had seen in 37 years of being a judge. He was abused in every way by nearly every person he had come in contact with in the first 8 years of his life. His mother, father, grandfather, both grandmothers, sister, brother, and a slew of other people around him had abused him sexually, physically, and emotionally. His parents prostituted him to friends and family. He was kept inside their house leaving only a handful of times. The kid, we'll call him Jake, talked about those outings as if he was taken to Disneyland when in reality he was taken to McDonalds and then taken to play in a park for an hour. He showed up at our house with the clothes on his back and nothing else. He had no toys and said that he had a few at home but he left them hidden because he thought we would steal them. We later found out that his sister had told him this as well as a bunch of lies that we were going to lock him up in jail.

I can't even come close to conveying the amount of sadness and pity I felt for this kid. It only got worse after I got to know him. He turned out to be one of sweetest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. That made it harder to believe that so many people were willing to hurt this kid. But every now and again he would show just how damaged he was. When I raised my hand to pat his shoulder and he would cower in fear. Or my dad would come home with pizza and he disappeared and we found him under his bed. Apparently, pizza night was when his parents ""friends"" would come over and when we told it was pizza night, he panicked. I went and laid down next to him and talked to him about what was going on. I told him that my family would never hurt him and wouldn't let anyone else hurt him either. We was honestly confused by the concept. I finally talked him out from under the bed to find that he had soiled himself. I helped him clean up and we went to have some pizza.

The way my parents took in those kids and treated them like their own taught me everything I needed to know about being a good person. They didn't keep a dime of the money from the state and every kid that left our house went with suitcases of clothes and bags of toys. With any extra money we bought season passes to the local theme park that my brother and I took our foster kids hundreds of times.

I like to think we were at least a good memory for most of these kids and gave them at least some semblance of a childhood for the short while most of them were with us. In truth, most of the kids were put right back where the state found them. With a parent that swears up and down they'll do better. But that was bullshit. Most of those kids that were sent back and forth until they're old enough to go to a group home. But by then they're usually, for lack of a better term, broken.

Stewardess receives complaint from passenger.
Stewardess goes over to couple, advises them that plane staff have received complaints about said couple engaging in inappropriate behaviour.
Stewardess advises this is the first and final warning, and if anything else happens, it will be escalated to proper authorities where they may be fined and charged.

It's not Reddit that confuses you. It's context. Punishments that fit crimes, that seems to confuse you.

I agree with you that it's totally not cool to get your cock sucked in front of a bunch of unwilling participants. But whats the context here? Did she think she was doing it discreetly? Or was she calling everyone over and telling them to pull out their cameras while she goes to town?

I'm thinking it was the former, and if that is the case. A stern warning to keep it appropriate would suffice. 

Besides, someone already replied to me advising that the FBI didn't prosecute them or anything, and they may have gotten off with a fine and criminal record? I don't even know.

So, after weighing myself today I saw that I was now squarely on 19st (266lbs), so approximately 20lbs difference from my first weigh-in at 286lbs 5 weeks ago. Despite nothing having changed with the scales themselves or the way I was weighing myself, I simply couldn't believe it. Maybe it's just self-esteem getting in the way, but I had to check whether the figures were true to really believe them. I went to MFP, to my records and, yep, I had weighed that much 5 weeks ago; I grabbed the nearest heavy towel and, yep, the scale was still working. The scale wasn't lying and I wasn't seeing things.

After I thought back to the month just gone and only then did I realise just how different my eating habits had become due to CICO. During the Summer I was having massive bags/bars of chocolate or sweets every single day (sometimes even multiple times per day) without fail, I was having 'just' a pork pie or two with lunch and I was snacking on sharing bags of crisps multiple times a week; in the past 5 weeks I could count on one hand how many times I'd had done the same. Now I'm sure some of that is water weight or whatever, but seeing that I've legitimately, truly kick-started my weight loss journey is such an amazing feeling to have. So, if you're still in the first few months of your journey, take a look at the numbers and you might be surprised.

It just slammed shut, extremely loud, and I have no logical explanation as to how.

1. The EU's studies are, despite appearing quite pessimistic for our chances, wildly optimistic. In that case, revealing that our government knows that we're more screwed than the EU thinks we are is worse for us than it is for them - they already think we're screwed.

2. The EU thinks it has the upper hand because its studies show that we'll be screwed far worse than they will. Revealing the studies would strengthen our negotiating position by telling the EU that they're overly pessimistic about our chances, or overly optimistic about their own.",1509494942

Hey,  
  
sorry for the lack of updates recently! Been working on a couple of projects at the same time. One animation is close to being finished and a picture series should be done shortly after.    
With this one, I started yet another project a couple of days ago. Thanks to my [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/ellowas) for their endless patience!  
  
Enjoy!

"politics","t5_2cneq","Now we're up to 5 words of coverage of her *free* game. In a list of 50 mostly forgettable Steam Greenlight games from other indie developers. About as scandalous as letting one person cut in front of you in a line to donate clothes to charity. Presenting it as anything more than that is feeding back into what made the non-scandal into an alt-right recruitment tool.

The response to the free game getting 5 words in the 50-game list was to saturate social media with uproar over payola and rampant corruption, followed by thousands of accounts worth of harassment and real-life threats directed at the person whose free game got mentioned briefly.

The scandal was manufactured from the outset, using exactly the same techniques as the alt-right's other recruitment drives. Find something vulnerable that you know you can make look bad. Identify what your target audience is most likely to feel is wrong in the world. Hold up the vulnerable target as a cornerstone of everything they feel is wrong. It doesn't matter if they are right or wrong with the things that make them upset. The propagandist uses that preexisting bias to get all of their anger focused on an easy, weak target as the source of their unhappiness.

Now unleash your new followers on the target. By ""defeating"" the target they find a sense of power over what makes them so unhappy. They feel they can defeat the problems in the world that are bothering them so much. So keep feeding that feeling. Send them up against other vulnerable targets. Start tying all the targets to a higher-up target that you can claim was the mastermind of it all. Start working in your *real* agenda.

With enough care and patience, you can get your followers eating out of your hand, targeting your real opponents, accepting your view of why the world works the way it does.

It's standard fascism. Stirring hate, finding scapegoats, always diverting people's real complaints onto targets of opportunity and away from your real agenda. Latching onto the free barely-mentioned game as the symbol and *heart* of industry-wide complaints was *always* a cynical ploy to pick up and manipulate an online army of people already angry at ""the system"".

Think how easy it is to do the same thing based on cultural or religious complaints, or fears for personal safety, or economic fears. Scapegoat, defeat, gain credibility, instill fascist ideals.",1509494945

    *Explanation of My Betting Approach*  
    - I differentiate between the game of the day (GOTD) and further picks. The GOTD picks are ranked according to my preference, whereby the highest listed pick is always my first preference, which would be equivalent to the POTD. Whereas further picks are only ranked descending in terms of kickoff time. The earlier a game starts, the higher it is listed.  
    - I don't select randomly a game of the day. I'm doing a lot of research and while these research, I go through various games. Some games, which are worth considering and promising, but haven't sufficient potential to be the game of the day, will be listed under the category further picks.  
    - I'm adhering to the game-of-the-day-approach with several picks, because it enables a higher degree of diversification and thus reduces the risk of loosing the entire invested stake. On top of this, after intensive research, it is mostly not that easy to select only one ultimate pick. Thus, the diversification eases slightly the pick selection process. 

    *Further Remarks*
    - No pick is a guaranteed win, so please only wager what you can afford to lose.  
    - Everything is possible in betting.   
    - Feedback is very welcome and appreciated.  
    - BOL everybuddy.  ",1509494947
