"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","Following up on one question hanging in the air:

&gt;equation of tangent of circle is x.x1+y.y1=a¬≤

*When does that work?*

ONLY for a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius a.

ONLY for finding a tangent line through a known of tangency (x1, y1) on the circle itself.

*Why does it work?*

Segment from center (0, 0) to known point (x1, y1) on circle has slope y1/x1.

Slope of the tangent line that contains (x1, y1) will be negative reciprocal, which is ‚Äìx1/y1, because tangent is perpendicular to the radius.

Point (x1, y1) is on the tangent line and ‚Äìx1/y1 is the slope. Use point-slope form.

y ‚Äì y1 = ‚Äì(x1/y1)(x ‚Äì x1)

Multiply both sides by y1.

y.y1 ‚Äì y1.y1 = ‚Äìx.x1 + x1.x1

Rearrange terms.

x.x1 + y.y1 = x1.x1 + y1.y1

But x1^2 + y1^2 = a^2 because (x1, y1) is on the circle with radius a.

x.x1 + y.y1 = a^2

I repeat: That works only to find tangent to point (x1, y1) on a circle with radius a that has center (0, 0). It does not work for any problem where circle is not centered at (0, 0), and it does not work for any problem asking for equation of tangent line when point of tangency isn't given.

I know some people paint supporting unions as a negative thing but they‚Äôre so important, unions are the ones who fought for and got everyone labour rights. Union jobs are what supported my family growing up. Most of my family is or has been part of a union at some point and I don‚Äôt know that we would have been able to have a middle class life otherwise. Unions cover such a large portion of the population that they really just represent the regular working person. 

The NDP have solid plans for pharmacare which might sound expensive but when we, the people of Ontario, are a single bargaining unit we can achieve better deals across the board from drug companies on prescription costs.

* Composed around 1638, Miserere was the last and most famous of twelve falsobordone settings used at the Sistine Chapel since 1514. At some point, it became forbidden to transcribe the music and it was allowed to be performed only at those particular services at the Sistine Chapel, thus adding to the mystery surrounding it.

* According to the popular story (backed up by family letters), fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was visiting Rome when he first heard the piece during the Wednesday service. Later that day, he wrote it down entirely from memory, returning to the Chapel that Friday to make minor corrections. Less than three months after hearing the song and transcribing it, Mozart had gained fame for the work and was summoned to Rome by Pope Clement XIV, who showered praise on him for his feat of musical genius and awarded him the Chivalric Order of the Golden Spur on July 4, 1770.

If want to have a *political* discussion, we can have one.  


I for one don't agree with NDP policies at all and I'm curious has to why people think they're better than the PC's. For starters I think not taxing minimum wage workers is probably smart, I think i can see where hes trying to go with this.

1. I think its going to improve economy even if its by a little bit. \(With things like spending on products and services and moving cash in the country\).
2. Students are able to keep more money to pay back student loans a little bit quicker, an extra 500\-800 dollars is a 1/3 of a college semester so that might help give some leverage with paying back student debt.
3. It allows a poorer families with minimum wage jobs to help pay for food, rent, etc.

I also think scrapping carbon tax is ultimately good. I don't think we can force green innovation by throwing a ton of our money at it. It seems like its better if we encourage companies to foot the green innovation by minimizing the regulation and encourage companies to innovate themselves as they are the suppliers of all things that emit carbon. They hold a ton of the technology that helps run things more efficiently and more green.   


Reducing small business tax is HUGE. People like Walmart destroy local competition and this would provide an amazing edge to startups and local mom and pop shops and the like. It would create a more competitive and healthier economy.   


As far as I'm concerned, hes not being transparent on the budget, which is severely hurting his image. It sucks that the OPC chose Doug. However i don't think we should undermine the entire PC party for that. I think they will not do as bad as everyone says they will.  


Now on the NDP side of things,   


She promised global health care, which is one of the biggest destroyer of economies and the biggest contributors to debt. I am all for giving Ontario free health care, however its a little silly that anyone can just come through the border and receive treatment for no cost. Medical isn't cheap and it shows in our national debt. If you look at the debt before Pierre Trudeau took power and the debt 20 years later. Its essentially a slope way upwards. Which is the cost of keeping people alive. Don't get me wrong i think its amazing that we have healthcare for our citizens and I like the system as it is. However if we release it to the entire world to get free treatment. Its going to hurt us big time.  
That being said I don't like PC's position on privatizing it. However they weren't transparent on that either. So I can't comment too much on that.  
Package all of that and the huge game with identity politics. I don't think anyone is stupid for picking PC as a potential candidate to take over.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","Dialects of living languages have to be constantly diverging almost by definition -- it's one of the effects of the language being in constant, daily use, and being learned from the cradle. When a language becomes increasingly fixed, less commonly used, and stops being learned from the cradle, it dies.

There are arguments about communications technologies viz. language, but I think what some of these arguments miss is that these technologies change the *rate* of language divergence -- not the underlying processes of divergence itself -- by providing a sort of reference standard that is a bit more fixed than the way the local aristocrats (or equivalent) talk. 

Languages with extensive written traditions, for example, especially in a manner where the writing reflects the phonology, tend to diverge much more slowly than fully oral languages -- but it's *also* true that in many examples of languages with extensive written traditions (like Latin), the written standard is wholly reflective of the prestige register and can often mask or obfuscate changes in colloquial speech over time.

More questions come about now because with modern recording technology, we can preserve ways people *talk* that was simply never available until the 20th century. But even then, consider that the prestige register of [Mid-Atlantic English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent), which was popular among the pre-jet age equivalent of jet-setters, is now basically dead.",1527811204

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","To be honest OP, I'm not sure what was up with your parents but high risk pregnancies involving hospitalisation implies accidental pregnancy - especially if your younger siblings are only a year apart.  Either that or do your parents come from a religious sect that frowns on contraception or were any of your younger siblings twins? Cause high risk pregnancies usually means the doctors don't recommend subsequent pregnancies (and certainly would be pulling in the mother the moment she fell pregnant again).

In any case, your dad shouldn't be shoving responsibility on you to support your family.  But I think he's probably scared and trying to make himself feel better that even though he's basically failed at making sure his children will be okay, that you'll be there.  

This is very unfair on you.  You're only in your mid twenties, and you should never have been made to bring up kids when you were still a kid yourself.

But - unless you want to cut off your dying father, your mother and your four younger siblings, it is what it is.  Maybe your mother can be encouraged to go back to work once your younger siblings are old enough not to require as much supervision.  And hopefully your father has a peaceful death.  Your siblings will grow up and with your encouragement and help, they'll know how to save money and live a better life so they don't need to lean on you financially.  

I guess what I'm saying is that you're in a catch 22 - you can't take back your lost childhood, and you can't drop the responsibility of financially supporting your family without losing your family.  But at least it isn't forever.  Your younger siblings will graduate from school and will learn to support themselves (you should have a talk with them soon though about how much you can provide for their college educations so they can be ready to get scholarships and loans like you did) - and you can help your mother be better prepared for retirement than she is at the moment.  

With regards to your boyfriend though... Do you love your family? Does he know this? Cause if he does, him saying you should stop helping them is sort of sociopathic.

It feels a bit odd that this guy has been dating you this long and be completely uncaring about your family. 

Anyway, if he wants to resign and invest his savings then he can - but he has to do it on his dime.  That means he should have enough savings to keep paying his share of the rent, the utilities, the food and luxuries bill while he plays around with his savings.  That's how it works when you start playing with becoming independently wealthy with savings.

Also, as much as being in a relationship means supporting your partner - that doesn't mean sacrificing your financial stability and happiness so they can freeload.  If he wants to do this and you agree to basically being his financial safety net while he screws around, then there has to be rules in place.  Stuff like ""how much money do you need to be able to generate to do this for longer than [x] period of time"" and ""what constitutes enough money to not work"" and ""when do you go back to work"".

Though to be honest, OP, I'd have dumped him when he was saying I should cut off my parents and younger siblings (who are all 13 and younger?) who were more or less dependent on my earning capacity to stay above the poverty line.  It's just so ... coldly sociopathic.",1527811204

When you say this, do you mean it in the sense that people should be free to worship without any restraint?

One concept that I actually really like comes from the Islamic Middle Ages. Perhaps you've heard of it, but Islamic states instituted a system in which *dhimmi* or ""people of the book"", who were practitioners of religions related to Islam (most notably Christianity and Judaism), were permitted to practice their faith so long as they submitted to the Islamic authorities, notably through a religious tax system.

I think that this sort of system provides the best balance between ""free"" practice of religion and maintaining the dominance of the state religion.",1527811204

For reference, yes, I did grow up in a small Wisconsin town where people say hi, chat and are generally pleasant. I have also spent time in major cities and it was no big deal to say hi, how's it goin' or to ask for directions. I used to be like you where I would not interact with people because I thought it was inconvenient or I might bother them bit I had to learn to get over that. If I do bother someone the interaction is less than 30 seconds, they'll get over it.

Next, try going to places where people might expect someone to interact with them like a bar.

Since you seem to like a transactional approach just ask for the time.  ""Hello, could you please tell me what time it is?"" ""I forgot my phone at work.""

You could honestly be getting on the bus and say ""hey"" to the person you sit next to or across from. They my say ""hey"" back or give you that little head nod. A simple social interaction.

Because you NEVER see it happening doesn't mean it NEVER happens. There could be people sitting all around you willing to talk but not wanting to make the first move and that is where you have to step up and go for it. Like I said earlier, what is the worst that can happen? Seriously, what the fuck are you afraid of? They might not respond? Gasp! They moved to a different seat!

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","It won't flat out powercreep the 5A, it lacks the gun depression to do so. HEAT also gives a notable advantage at tier 10 due to the 85 degree ricochet angle (not to say 350 pen APCR means nothing), and its mobility is still arguably better. Slightly lower top speed and hp/t ratio, but significantly better terrain resistance stats and effective traverse.

430U isn't being powercrept either, it'll still likely have the armour advantage, and the mobility advantage is undeniable -- the medium tank effective traverse is what sets the 430U apart from other fast 'heavies'. Don't forget the camo, which is easy to get over 30% when stationary and like 25% when moving (iirc, don't have my client open) unlike every heavy ever.

It'll be strong, but I think it's about on par with the 5A and 430U. The only thing I would advocate nerfing for now, before it goes through the live server stages of testing, is the APCR pen and shell speed. 330-335 pen APCR with 1300 m/s or so would suffice, not 350 pen with 1800 m/s.",1527811208

The discussed event has nothing to do with Obama, the dolphin language ""experiments"" took place in the 1960's.

Additionally, under the Obama administration NASA's budget went from a nominal amount of 17.833 Billion USD in 2008 to 19.508 Billion USD in 2016, an increase of 9% (though less than the estimated loss of purchasing power due to an estimated inflation of 11.5% in that same time period).

&gt; NASA 50/50 Florida and Texas

NASA has a presence at locations in Alabama, Australia, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, Ohio, Spain, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

With the majority of its personnel being located at the NASA headquarters in Washington D.C. and the following 10 field centers:


*  Ames (Research), located in Mountain View, California

* Armstrong (Flight Research), located in Edwards Air Force Base, California

* Glenn (Research), located in Brook Park, Ohio

* Goddard (Space Flight), located in Green Belt, Maryland

* JPL (Space Flight), managed by CalTech in Pasadena, California

* Johnson (Space), located in Houston, Texas
 
* Kennedy (Space), located in Merritt Island, Florida

* Langley (Research), located in Hampton, Virginia

* Marshall (Space Flight), located in Huntsville, Alabama

* Stennis (Space), located in Hancock County, Mississippi

Though the largest individual NASA facility is the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the majority of NASA employees are in California distributed amongst the 3 field centers and multiple associated research and development facilities.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Debt as in loans for business and mortgages would still be measured in fiat. 

If and when bitcoin gains a sizeable adoption size, where it is practically ubiquitous, fiat will still exist. But it won‚Äôt have such a sizeable control over the levers of the economy. After all, in the US alone, it‚Äôs trillions in debt is measured in dollars. For the government to pay its debts, dollars must still exist. And from the looks of that debt level, it‚Äôs going to be doing so for quite some time.


So back to the lending argument. Loans could be made in bitcoin, but priced in dollars. For example, let‚Äôs say I get a $100k mortgage loan. But let‚Äôs also say that in that time, 1 BTC = $100k. So the bank lends me 1 BTC....but the size of the loan at date and time it is written and signed for is fixed at $100k... plus any interest. 

If 30 years from that point 1 BTC appreciates in value to $200k = 1 BTC.... well that works for me and I can pay the $100k loan back and sti have some satoshis left over.

If the opposite happens and 1btc falls to $50k.... then I owe 2 BTC to pay for the original $100k loan. 

Fiat will still exist and will serve as perhaps a fixed point of accounting for debt/loans at the time they were made.",1527811212

I got it because it was cheap and seen great reviews online praising it. here's a TL:DR from Tomshardware

PROS:

30\-144Hz FreeSync range

Ghost\-free overdrive

Bright picture

Great color after calibration

Uniformity

Panel response

Low input lag

Build quality

CONS:

Out\-of\-box accuracy

Viewing angles

""The AG271QX requires some tweaking for best results, but once you change a few settings, you‚Äôll get to enjoy a nice image with some of the best motion processing we‚Äôve seen from any FreeSync monitor currently available.""

"rum","t5_2rg5e","**Review: #16**

This is a sample of 18 yr. rum from Nicaragua,. bottled by Hunter Laing‚Äôs Kill Devil label at 60.2% ABV. I‚Äôve been a fan of both the Golden Devil and Kill Devil series in the past.

---

**Kill Devil ‚Äì Nicaragua ‚Äì 18 yr. ‚Äì 60.2%**

**Nose:** Big oak. Wet tobacco. Spray paint. That‚Äôs about it, but they‚Äôre all extremely clear and rich notes.

**Palate:** Raisins. Citrus. Massive oak. Chewing tobacco. 

**Finish:** Under ripe banana. Cinnamon. Barrel char. Faint charred vegetal note.

**Strengths:** It‚Äôs complex and full of character.

**Rough Spots:** This one can get hot and sharp here and there.

**Grade: B/B+**

**Final Thoughts:** Another really interesting pour from Douglas Laing. This and the Bellevue had me considering grabbing backup bottles. Both were a good value for their age and specs, but they also both left me believing I hadn‚Äôt yet tasted what the distilleries were capable of.

---

**GRADING:**

**A:** Truly memorable for all the right reasons. Pours I‚Äôm gonna be craving later. I‚Äôd buy a backup at the right price.

**B+:** Hits all the right notes with one or two exceptional ones. Just missing the crave worthy component. 

**B:** Quality standard pour if priced accordingly.

**C:** Less interested. Minor flaws that start to diminish enjoyment. Situational purchase, but unlikely I‚Äôd buy a full bottle.

**D:** Major flaws. Won‚Äôt be repurchasing in any format ‚Äì single glass or bottle.

**F:** No desire to keep drinking except to confirm it‚Äôs really as bad as I thought.

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/12.png#sprite) went to the beach with Hiyoko at around 8:15 AM, and she showed me a new dance! It looked so graceful and beautiful, I just had to take pictures!

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/00.png#sprite) departed at 9:00 AM, and got to snapping pictures at each location, just in case. I think that took about...15 minutes or so. I met with Kiyotaka, Rantaro, and Maki at the restaurant afterwards to discuss the supplies.

[After](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/10.png#sprite) the meeting, Maki asked me to come with her to investigate the hospital. I accepted, and we arrived there at around 9:30 AM. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/04.png#sprite) were about to leave at 10:40 AM, but then, out of the blue, Maki dashed out of the hospital! Of course I was curious, and so I followed her to Electric Avenue, where I discovered she was guarding the store from Kokichi.

[Jeez,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/11.png#sprite) you always have to be trouble, don't you, Kokichi? When are you going to man up and stop acting like a child?

[Anyway,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/02.png#sprite) I decided to stick around because of that meddling menace, but after a half-hour, Maki said she could handle it, so I left.

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/09.png#sprite) figured that'd be as good a time as any to develop my photos, so I headed to the printer over at Rocketpunch Market at 11:15 AM. I figured having a physical copy would be better, anyway. Once that was done, I dropped them off at my cottage and came to lunch at around 11:50 AM. The only people absent were...Kazuichi, Angie, Korekiyo, Rantaro, Kaito, Himiko, and Keebo.

[There](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/01.png#sprite) better be a good reason for each of you not showing up. Especially you boys, and you better not lie, either!

[At](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/16.png#sprite) noon, Hiyoko was trying to get my attention, and I accidentally ended up dropping and breaking a glass as I was about to get a drink. You don't have to be so forceful, okay, Hiyoko?

[She](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/13.png#sprite) really wanted to go to the amusement park that day, so a bit later, we left and had a great day. We went on rides, ate some cotton candy, and all of the other good stuff. I'm so glad I got to spend that time with you today, Hiyoko.

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/06.png#sprite) started heading back at around 2:10 PM, but...that was when we heard it. Kazuichi's BDA, informing us of a body in the diner.

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/07.png#sprite) were about to head over, but then we heard the explosion over at the 5th island! We rushed over there, and we happened to bump into Kokichi, so we told him about what we heard.

[But](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/18.png#sprite) then we headed into the weapon shed of the military base, a-and...

[...we](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/17.png#sprite) found Gundham's lifeless body, and the BDA played once again.

[During](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/06.png#sprite) the investigation, I figured I could use my camera for pictures to figure out if anything was taken. But the weapons were so scattered, so I'm not sure if even that will do any good, and I didn't have time to check either set of photos...

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/09.png#sprite) wanted to investigate the other places, but I didn't want to just leave the body. Luckily, Kaito showed up, so I asked him to stay while I went around to the pharmacy, where I ran into Kaede, Ibuki, and Keebo, and to Electric Avenue, where I ran into Himiko, Angie, and Kiyotaka.

[Also,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/10.png#sprite) I should mention that I lost my purple cleaning rag for my camera. I could have sworn I had it at around lunchtime, but...oh well. That's all I've got.",1527811215

"discordapp","t5_388p4","Okay as much as everyone loves to ask for this and thinks it would be cool, it is not...

Okay so let me explain, as a bot dev, why this is annoying to deal with.

When a person joins (talking from discord.js library btw), an event is fired off that tells the bot someone joined. The ONLY thing this event has is the member that joined, nothing more. So, in order to track invites like you want to, the bot has to, on loading up or joining your server, fetch ALL the invites, get their usage amounts, then, in your case, assign them to certain user IDs counts, etc etc. Then when someone joins your server the bot must once again fetch all the server invites from your server and then check them against its stored values to see if any of them changed.

This might not be too bad on a small server, but if you want to give out levels based on advertisement, which i highly do not recommend because it can land you in hot water, you are going to have at least 20 or 30 of these things floating around which is 30 invites that the bot dev must store, and then compare off of which is not so much hard as it is a major hassle.

I hope this explains why this thing does not exist on any prominent bots yet. Maybe when discord gives us bot devs and the api library devs the invite a person used to join then we can see more of this stuff working out.

P.S. Because of the nature of promises and api and bla bla bla, sometimes you can get a false positive, eg two people join from different links at around the same time and they both get assigned to the invite the last person joined with, which is another issue.",1527811217

In the story I have, the main evil person is like... from this long line of royal dragon slayers, and she decides to change the path of how the kings play by instead forcing the dragons to do what she wants by harsh training and tourture when they're really young.

So... :/ ... I'm like, if she does this, she probably wouldn't be able to talk to them, but communicate like how you would with a horse where you'd hit/poke it a certain way to control and move it.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","here's the problem - benzo's are actually too good at what they are designed to do. they don't just mitigate anxiety, they completely fucking remove it from existence.... until, it starts wearing off, and your brain can't help but desire that sensation of being completely care-free, which can't otherwise be created. And so you're left with a choice, live with anxiety, or take the bar, and of course, we'll always want to take the bar.

here's where you are now: you can't function without it, because the anxiety is so overwhelming the thought of going day after day in the agonising state of fear and fireworks in your brain makes you shudder. 

here's the problem: the only way to end the addiction is to wean off the benzo's slowly (typically using valium) and endure an extended state of anxiety until you are completely benzo free. And still, your anxiety will be present, but you will no longer be a slave to the xan, and similarly can be proud that you are managing your mental health and moving toward a more sustainable future.

benzo's work like floaties for kids learning to swim. You had been treading water for long enough you decided to put on floaties (inflatable armbands), so you could just float.

With nobody giving them information, they had to end the task force. His entire point was that they didn't have any evidence connecting anything, so they had to disband the task force. 

That's not ""blaming the gay community"".  That's saying the truth: the police did exactly what they should have with the information they had.  If they had more information, they could have stopped it sooner.

In other words, no seeking, turning within. (Kensho). Realization on the spot of emptiness, the transience of things, non-duality.  To be in playful samadhi. (The ""Unborn"" of Bankei).

&gt;*""You need to search morning and night until you reach the point where the road of conception comes to an end, whereupon you‚Äôll suddenly spontaneously stop. After this stopping, the racing and seeking mind stops.""*

Death (Samadhi). 

The racing mind ""catches up"", if you will, and rests. Unification of mind and body. (Which transitions the thinking from intellectually-based, to intuitive-based, ""non-dual"" functionality, or actions free from binding ""karma""). That's to do non-doing, I believe.

I don't see IASIP as some kind of politically minded comedy akin to south park. They don't need to be trying to educate their audience on why black face is stupid, because that bit relies on the audience already having that understanding in order to to be funny.

There's no pivotal moment where the characters realize what they're doing is wrong. In fact the characters basically never learn any lessons, so if anything you could argue that it's sending the message that you can do those things without repercussions, even though that also would be a stretch because at the end of the day it's just a comedy show.

Snakes and lions are supposed to eat meat.  That's not immoral or wrong.

They slowly grinding their way through the Philadelphia underground rap scene, gaining close ties with Jedi Mind Tricks and forming part of [Army of the Pharaohs]( https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/8dxgzp/daily_discussion_thread_04212018/dxqpuss/). In terms of popularity they're far outshadowed by Jedi Mind Tricks, 7L &amp; Esoteric, Celph Titled, and Apathy - but I like them almost as much as any of those guys. A big part of that is due to the fact that they are often able to mix gritty street raps that wouldn't sound out of place if spit by The Lox with that underground battle rap flavor. Don't be fooled by their nerdy names - these guys are gutter. 

This is their second real LP, and IMO it embodies their sounds the best. They deliver hard hitting, aggressive bars with smoothly crafted multis. Pretty much all the songs are on that gangsta rap shit talking tip but they pull it off very well. And they're totally unapologetic about the seeming contradiction with their backpack image - ""'Yo Planetary what's up with all that gun talk? / You're too underground,' Nigga that's the onslaught"". They also have well crafted hooks IMO. Nice features from Royce and Sheek Louch as well as the usual suspects of Vinnie Paz and fellow AotP member King Syze. 

Production is nice and varied, with some Stoupe-esque beats on some tracks and more minimalist, boom bap type instrumentals on songs like ""U Don't Like Me"" and ""Altered Beasts"". ""Spanish Fly"" has a bouncy, uptempo Latin-flavored beat that the two emcees ride perfectly. My favorite, though is ""Brute Force 2"" which is basically a heavy metal remix of their track ""Brute Force"" from their previous album. It sounds jarring, but it actually works perfectly IMO and goes hard as hell. ",1527811224

I'm using the oxo currently, and I'd choose it over the others solely for the fact that it makes fantastic coffee, and doubles as a kettle for tea or pourovers. My wife drinks tea, and I love that I can use one machine to simultaneously make a pot of coffee for me and tea for her, both ready at the same time. It doesn't seem like a major feature, but in practice it's absolutely awesome.  Plus it looks fantastic, and watching water boil in a glass kettle is pretty neat.",1527811225

* Basically what you said (though it doesn't necesarily involve the budget). S√°nchez stays for a bit, pushes a few reforms quick and then calls for a new election for October, shortly before the ERE ruling

* S√°nchez stays until the EU elections of 2019. If that election is good or at least decent for PSOE, he calls a snap election for September 2019.

* S√°nchez expires all of Rajoy's term and the election happens as expected in June 2020.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Do keep in mind that there is some guessing involved in what I'm writing, guessing based on what often tends to be true for AMAB people but what does not necessarily have to be true in every single case, but it is likely that your breasts are both shallow and wide, traits that breasts can have both of which can make them both look and feel smaller. If you have the means of doing so, it is recommended that you try bras made specifically for shallow breasts, as those tend to be more accurate with how they fit AMAB people for their sizes, but not only does not everyone have the means of doing it but some people actually do feel comfortable enough in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (in quotation marks because there's nothing abnormal about having different breasts nor in using bras that are made to fit different breasts) bras to keep on wearing them and not give any thought to trying out other stuff.

Ultimately, matching a bra boils down to two parts: matching the band, and matching the cup. The calculator is only a starting point, as it itself says, so while it's likely to give you a starting point that's more accurate than many of the calculators you will find (as well as many bra-fitters, but that's a whole different kettle of fish and a whole different industry shame), if you deviate from what it's given you in any of those two parts and you feel more comfortable in it then it's your comfort that matters more than the numbers you get from a mere tool (a good tool, sure, but a tool nonetheless, though yes, it's been adjusted for the needs of AMAB people so while it's not guaranteed to work perfectly ... then again, no tool ever is, it's no fault of the calculator, it should be working quite well for you regardless of your AMAB status).

Matching the band is fairly simple, all things considered. Take the second measurement that you are inputting into the calculator: tight and snug, but comfortable. If you get a bra with a band size that's, on the furthest hooks, tight and snug but comfortable, then that's a good starting point and while you will have to make adjustments for stretch from wear (this is the real reason why the bras have more than one set of hooks, and you can find info on this sub about which manufacturers, at least about some of them, make bras that are more resistant to stretching from wear) because some people have borderline measurements that make it look like one band size fits them the reality will be that the bras bought with those band sizes will start to feel too lose after just a few days because that just happens sometimes. It may or may not be what happened in your case, but if a 40 inch band is more comfortable to you than a 42 band then by all means go with what feels better.

Matching the cups is ... a bit more complicated. There's a lot of stuff to consider, starting from sister sizes for when you adjust band sizes and going through basically everything breast-related, so the shape of your breasts, their projection, how wide they are, how wide-set they are, how long you have been wearing bras for properly (you can actually gain some breast, so to say, by ‚Äúscooping and swooping‚Äù into properly-fitting bras for some time, which causes your breast tissue to get more susceptible to being where it should be instead of everywhere else). Standard-fare cups are a good fit for some breast shapes, but for some others not particularly if you are trying to match them letter-for-letter, so ultimately you have to get bras of all the sizes you can find that seem like they could fit and try them on and check how comfortable they feel. Getting a bra that is made for the kind of breasts that you have, if you can get that, may result in suddenly finding a bra in a size given to you by the calculator (or, you know, close enough to this) that feels very comfortable even though you wouldn't expect it because with normal stuff you have to go for a rather different size; there's a gallery of shallow breasts that I've seen ... somewhere, not sure where now but there may be a link to it here, that shows women and not necessarily AMAB women who have shallow breasts and how they look and what their sizes actually are compared when they thought them to be before getting bras that were made for shallow breasts, and I do remember there being a woman who had breasts with the cup size of K whose breasts looked like they couldn't be above B ... until they were put into a bra made for shallow breasts.

Also, gaping does not always mean that the cup size is too high. Sometimes it means the complete opposite of it (I know, sounds weird when you have no idea), sometimes it means that the bra simply doesn't fit because it's built that way, and sometimes it happens but the bra is a good fit and is comfortable so it's basically a visual glitch. You'll have to try on stuff and compare how it feels to get a feel on how to recognise which it is.",1527811227

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","This comment needs to go up as far as it can. Caretaker fatigue is no joke. 

The anger OP is feeling towards her Dad right now is just the beginning. 

OP, if you‚Äôre reading these, take it from someone older who has been on meds, to therapy, and doesn‚Äôt want her own children, it‚Äôs only a matter of time.

Your body or your emotions will betray you and it will be dramatic. 

With your Dad‚Äôs approaching death, I would recommend counseling NOW and I mean yesterday really. You‚Äôre going to have a hard time processing your feelings about his passing unless  you get some support. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre going to also have to process the guilt you are already feeling for being angry at him (which is totally called for and normal!). 

Please. You might ‚Äúlove‚Äù him, but he doesn‚Äôt love you the same way. And definitely not the way a caretaker needs. Dump the boyfriend. Dump him now before your Dad dies. You are better off single during that time than with someone who will be jealous that you are paying more attention to your grieving family than him. 

Please find someone who is EQUALLY if not MORE of a caregiver than you are to spend your life with. You will know because they make you uncomfortable when they offer you support. Learn to say thank you and accept support. And most importantly, learn that it is completely normal to need support and allow yourself to access to it. 

Start demanding more of your siblings. They are getting older and are capable of taking on responsibilities. If they don‚Äôt learn how to fend for themselves they will suffer for it and end up relying on you, and eventually pushing you away. Allow them into the sibling role and let them support you if they can, either emotionally or by doing tasks that need to be done for the family. 

Then, maybe, after some time and setting boundaries with your Mom, it might seem POSSIBLE to have your own kids. Then you will really know if you want them or not.

So then what's the downside?  I remember in games like Mabinogi to actually have high ranking crafting took a *lot* of effort, to the point it's almost impossible to do if you don't focus on it early on due to how stats factor into it.  I remember players actually had to bring the materials *to* the crafter *and* pay for the item creation because the materials needed were so incredibly difficult to get in the quantities requested that the crafter sure as hell wasn't going to go out and do it.  Only a handful of players were good at crafting, and the servers had select players that were famous for being able to make things.  Being locked out for two weeks means for two weeks players couldn't go to you for crafting and your rivals get all your business, or you were screwed when it came to improving because that's 15 days of experience gone.  I'm sure by now it's spread out to more people but it would've taken other players years to get to that point because these crafters would've focused on it instead of other things like combat or magic.  This guy got it in *three days*.  Four times over.  

What *advantage* is there if people can max out crafting that quickly?  I'm sorry, I'm not seeing how this is bad for him.   This reads more like getting achievements out of the way in any other game than it does being able to, like, have a monopoly on produced items.",1527811228

Even if I never am in that position again, it makes me feel stronger and more competent now to know I have proven I can do it.

&gt; CHARLESTON, S.C. - South Carolina has become the first U.S. state to pass legislation to fight anti-Semitism on campus, after supporters of the measure said it would help colleges battle discrimination amid growing numbers of such incidents nationwide.

&gt; The bill passed the South Carolina House by 86 votes to 4 late on Wednesday.

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","That's just not true.

The US fights for its political and economic interests. In this case, the US, its NATO allies, Israel, and Saudi Arabia (and some other Arab states to a lesser degree) have a confluence of interests in maintaining what's basically a regional hegemony in the Middle East. Assad's regime certainly has its many sins, but the only sins that those parties are really concerned with are a willingness to cooperate with Russia and Iran to expand their power in the region, and the fact that Syria is a pathway for Iran to resupply Hezbollah in their proxy war against Israel.

Not all of those parties agree on everything, obviously. Certainly Turkey, for instance, has its own unique interests in the conflict.

There are other aims, to be sure. Fighting ISIS to preserve Iraq's stability (and clean up the US's own mess there). If Assad had fallen, possibly a pipeline. Greater autonomy for the Kurds who are a generally but not entirely pro-US group in the region. Maybe learning more about Iranian and Russian capabilities. Maybe increasing the economic costs to Syria, Iran, and Russia. Maybe gathering intelligence on jihadist groups. Maybe maintaining strong ties with other allies that care more directly about the conflict. It's hard to know all of the many factors that may contribute to the calculus.

But it's about political and economic interests. That's why states do complicated things. All of them, always.

US intervention has sometimes been on the side of freedom and democracy and stability and human rights. Lots of times it absolutely has not.

There are no parties that don't have blood on their hands in this conflict, but the US is definitely the most geographically distant and has maybe the least direct national safety and security interests of the parties. It's about influence and power, and it's really a case of an in-group trying to maintain their position against out-group parties that are seeking to increase their own positions.

Jonah Goldberg's (otherwise-pretty-good) piece on immigration this week is an excellent example. 

I can absolutely separate ""here is my conservative argument for [X]"" from ""here is my argument about trolling the libs"". What I'm saying is that, with considerable regularity, all of these outlets do both, and they do the latter with gusto.

The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned almost 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km2) and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million.

The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a de facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King jure uxoris W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland.

*****
&gt; CHARLESTON, S.C. - South Carolina has become the first U.S. state to pass legislation to fight anti-Semitism on campus, after supporters of the measure said it would help colleges battle discrimination amid growing numbers of such incidents nationwide.

&gt; The bill passed the South Carolina House by 86 votes to 4 late on Wednesday.

&gt; South Carolina Democratic Senator Brad Hutto, who opposed the bill, said its proponents were trying to inject the state&amp;#039;s lawmakers into a foreign policy debate.

My nMom made me go to after-school tutoring for reading and writing. I needed to avoid being held back. I'm now in a Masters Program and I believe that my English writing/reading skills have gotten me very far in life if it weren't for the extra tutoring I had. At the same time, I missed out on learning to fluently speak my native language - but my mom never continued to teach me. Instead she'd just yell at me and scold me, instead of actually teaching me the proper grammar of the language.   

I moved back home from undergrad last year, and if my nMom ever needs a reason to argue with me she'll bring up with whole ""Say something in our language!"" gladly knowing I can't - I believe she gets some kind of joy out of it because she can hold it against me. ",1527811237

What does an AnCom order of battle look like?  When M1A1 Abrams and Bradley Fighting Vehicles roll in - when drones are preparing to rain hellfire down on your places of gathering, when the Imperialist grand strategy for crushing your organizing is a very clean, and simple, and neat 'defeat in detail' strategy - **what does the AnCom order of battle look like?**  Do you even have one? Is you're plan for revolution anything more than ""everybody get yer gun and we'll take on the guv'ment?""  

What weapons do you have to take out a tank?  How many?  Where should they be deployed?  What about air superiority?  How many people are to be deployed, and where and when and how?  What logistics are supplying them?  For how long?  Who will replace them?  Do they have enough supplies?  For how long?  Who has this information?  Who does it get shared with?  Is there a grand strategy for the aggregate total of all our forces?   These are real, material, questions for which anarchists give no consideration or answer.  The reason you see so many ML splits is because these are very real debates over things that materially exist.    

ML/MLM societies have their ugly sides even at the best of times, but they are also the only ones that can bring enough firepower or just ""will to fight"" to resist a much more powerful empire for a sustained period.  You will never be allowed to get 99% of people organized, or even 60%, or 50% - violence from the Empire will be brought to bare against you long before anything can develop that far.  

The biggest obstacle to success is the Empire, and part of your philosophy has to plan for facing down and overcoming that empire that will immediately and quickly respond to anything that threatens it - with the full force of all of their means of production (meaning not only will the military be against you, but the television will condemn you for crimes - real and imagined, and the Imperialist news and media - which anarchists still seem to swallow with sincerity - will portray you as Stalinists regardless of your distaste, and will shape global public perception).  You anarchist allies will disown you, Chapo Trap House will declare your revolution to be ""not really communist,"" and you will never be given a turn at the microphone to contest this perception, all long before you have any real momentum but after you've made a fatal commitment to your strategy. 

I sometimes feel like some of the AnComs have failed to truly think through what any sort of revolution **looks like** in an era past 1871, or for any chunk of land larger than a city maybe. This idea that we all just get our muskets and rise up **has been defeated often and repeatedly across the world over the past hundred plus years.** Even if you somehow pull of a big, well planned and orchestrated ""surprise revolution"" it would only be a temporarily disabling blow to any Empire - because their capitalist systems are self-reproducing. They are like the Terminator - you shoot a hole in them and they are incapacitated for a moment but then that hole fills back in and they come back at you as a fully functioning war machine.  The argument from Lenin is that the best way to fight against such a machine is with a machine of our own - a self-repairing, self-replicating, massive instrument of war, and that process and the underlying philosophy is called Marxism-Leninism.  And the machine we built was the Soviet Union, and now that it is gone we have to rebuild another one, because nothing in the anarchist arsenal is capable of dealing any lasting damage.  

Why do you think people tend towards ML quadrant in the first place - it gets a little upsetting to see our fellow leftists, who in most cases should be our natural allies and closest comrades, treat us with extreme hostility, distance, and distrust.  The problem for me is NOT that you guys disagree with our ultimate conclusions, it's that many of you dont understand how we even arrived at the Authoritarian Left quadrant in the first place, or what those conclusions actually are. Being called: Red Fascists, Stalinists, etc - with the most common derogatory term being Tankies.  This is almost always an indicator that we aren't being given a fair consideration of our opinions, and that you have reasoned, incorrectly, that we have become Authoritarian Leftists simply because we love power, or are inherently violent or cruel, or just fucking love tanks.  With how many of us who lean into ML(M), I'd like to think you understand that we have real reasons for ending up there, rather than just assuming we are all tank-obsessed LARPers apologizing for everything Stalin and trying to manipulate ourselves into being kings.  

edit: a few corrections and made it a bit less hostile.  Also, I do realize the ""we're not tank obsessed"" and the fact that I mention tanks several times - it's from an essay ""Where do tanks come from"" and its deliberate for exactly that point - tanks are a very complex piece of machinery that are a requisite for fighting a real revolution - yet the process to produce one is very complex and requires not only factories, but many other means of production working in conjunction with their production, all of which 'have to be on the same page, while effectively fighting a war.'  That whole process is something I would love to hear an anarchist solution for - if you can offer one I'm all ears.   Yes, you can do a protracted people's war, but pretending that Maoists aren't more in line with MLs than anyone else is just wrong.",1527811238

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Re\-posting this here since I had to spam it down below due to a lot of misinformation being thrown around. There's a suspicious effort to assert that ONT copied VEN's incentive program, i.e., specifically that ONT copied/pasted VEN's incentives. There was even an implication that NEO copied VEN's incentive program. Since I would not have noticed this \(possibly coordinated\) effort to mislead those who haven't DYOR, and how easy it is to spread fake news around here to unassuming investors, I thought I'd share some facts.

**10,000 VEN**: 4.2 Thor daily, 29.4 Thor monthly, 1533.0 Thor yearly. \(thorcalculator.com\)

**10,000 ONT**: 4.32 ONG daily, 129.6 ONG monthly, 1576.8 ONG yearly. \([https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/triones\-node\-incentive\-model\-dbcb175f4728](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/triones-node-incentive-model-dbcb175f4728)\)

Similar, but not exact amounts. Pretty much on par with 15&amp;#37;\-16&amp;#37; incentive returns in terms of secondary token numbers. What about NEO?

**10,000 NEO** \(theory\): 4.03 GAS daily, 28.2 GAS monthly, 1471.7 yearly. \(neotogas.com\)

I dunno, the values are close but not exact enough to say ONT ripped off VEN. But VEN's incentive program is similar to NEO's as well. I wonder if NEO copied VEN's incentive program since their functions are pretty similar, and their websites \([neotogas.com](https://neotogas.com/) and [thorcalculator.com](https://thorcalculator.com/) \) indicating said values are curiously similar in layout, font, and design?

NEO coin age: **21 months**

VEN coin age: **9 months**

ONT coin age: 3 months

NEO did it first and is still the only crypto mainnet supporting the 2\-token incentive system. Good luck to VEN and their mainnet launch in the coming months and to all VEN holders on your investments.

I welcome any objections or issues with my numbers. I've already said below I'm willing to die on this hill of pettiness so any issue with my facts will be responded to.

Edit: You're not going to put the burden on me to prove that NEO and ONT did not copy VeChain. The burden should be on the Vechain brigade to account for their misinformation with facts. Moreover, perhaps there should be a discussion of whether VeChain copied NEO's 2\-token incentive system?",1527811239

After the detention you have the fact that she spat at the officers, which is illegal and disorderly conduct. 
 
As for the officers actions. They fact he said ""you're about to get dropped"" is not a crime or excessive force. Could he have chose different words, yes, but that is not necessarily wrong. The use of force up to the punching was not excessive. The punching I think went a too far. She was not a large person and the two officers on scene should have been able to detain her.

Without going into specifics about my situation‚Äîspecifics which have left me feeling quite bitter toward the department and UTA in general‚Äîhere are some general issues:
(1) No advising appointments. Students must often wait hours to see an advisor in an understaffed department, usually during the busiest part of the semester. Students must form their own waiting lists each day, and these are obviously not enforced in any meaningful way.
(2) Advisors are able to drop students from classes without notice or statutory justification, and are not required to assist students in re-registering for classes which become full once such a decision is successfully  appealed.
(3) Advisors often make assurances to students which are forgotten from one semester to the next. Students are often required to explain complicated situations and request the same considerations for them at every meeting with an advisor.

*****
&gt; CHARLESTON, S.C. - South Carolina has become the first U.S. state to pass legislation to fight anti-Semitism on campus, after supporters of the measure said it would help colleges battle discrimination amid growing numbers of such incidents nationwide.

&gt; The bill passed the South Carolina House by 86 votes to 4 late on Wednesday.

&gt; South Carolina Democratic Senator Brad Hutto, who opposed the bill, said its proponents were trying to inject the state&amp;#039;s lawmakers into a foreign policy debate.

Ah yes! I've read about testing the band in the Beginner's Guide. Buuuut. I forgot to do it while I was at Nordstrom. But I did test the *b. charming* bra when it arrived.

I think the way I put on a bra has helped me get a feel of the band size. I put a bra on backwards, link the farthest hook, turn the bra around, and adjust it accordingly. I've grown up with adults who put bras on this way. I'm not sure if everyone does this, but I do it so I can see which hooks I'm linking.

The brief moment I have the bra on backwards, I ""gauge"" how the band feels. In that moment, I would think ""this is feels just a liiiittle tight"" or ""this feels alright so far, let's get it on properly"". Of course, I only do this for a moment. I think wearing it like that for a little longer would do me good.

But thankfully, the tight bands were easy to remedy! The gores? Not so much. While I have a good grasp on my breast shape, I do not know which bra styles will complement me best.",1527811245

Did she penetrate it? No, she just cracked it. Like I said, OP.

It's very simple: you level from 100 to 110 with +50% experience from heirloom gear.

You haven't finished any quest lines or zones or most of your order hall stuff. You're friendly or something with 4 factions, don't even know the others. 

You go to the AH and you buy a crafted legendary and then everything you need to begin Argus. 

Relics are the first thing you go looking for, because

1. you just got a 3rd slot when you hit 110, and you definitely don't have one lying around

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","This proves nothing to me. The cop still punched her in the face.

When you're a cop, wearing a badge and upholding the law, your job is to be ABOVE the behaviour of the assholes and criminals you're arresting or dealing with. If you can't do your job without punching a 130lb rowdy woman in the face, maybe you're in the wrong profession. The police are supposed to act ABOVE behaving like idiots, and as taxpayers who fund their salary we also expect it.

Sure this woman wasn't being cooperative, but I don't think she deserved being punched in the face, and right away you can also tell her attitude was probably testing the officer's patience. That doesn't mean he's allowed to assault people just because they give him attitude. Yes, maybe she shoved him at the end there, but once again, he's supposed to be the ""bigger person"" as an officer of the law in this situation, and since he'd already piled on top of her, I don't think punching her was warranted.

This guy was probably a bully when he was younger, who didn't put up with people's attitudes and so he became a cop and just feels like he's allowed to shove people back who test him. That's not part of the job description when you're a cop. When somebody pushes you to the limit, you don't hold a gun and a badge so you can push them back twice as hard with them. 

People here downvoting me clearly don't get my point. They just see a woman who was drinking on the beach that deserved to be punched in the face after being pretty much sat on. That's behaviour you'd expect out of *other* drunk people, not someone in a police uniform who's supposed to be a professional, *and* a role model in the community. ",1527811248

The BCNDP and Greens formed a coalition just after the election and before the liberals could pass a budget. They voted the budget down and since any budget vote is a non-confidence vote, the government fell. That's how I understand it anyway.. :).

*****
&gt; CHARLESTON, S.C. - South Carolina has become the first U.S. state to pass legislation to fight anti-Semitism on campus, after supporters of the measure said it would help colleges battle discrimination amid growing numbers of such incidents nationwide.

&gt; The bill passed the South Carolina House by 86 votes to 4 late on Wednesday.

&gt; South Carolina Democratic Senator Brad Hutto, who opposed the bill, said its proponents were trying to inject the state&amp;#039;s lawmakers into a foreign policy debate.

"BlueCollarWomen","t5_2vqg9","Both the other commenters are super right and i agree 100%, i just want to add a few things in case you're worried about the things she's bringing up, since i basically was you (currently 2nd year inside app, in the bay area): 
1. I personally feel very safe at work. It's still a professional environment, even if it is a very casual one. it is like, 99% men, that's true, but the sites tend to be busy, your coworkers are usually around, there's lots of supervisors from all companies/safety people/office people/inspectors, so it's not a lawless free-for-all feeling. It feels structured, which to me, makes me feel safe at work.   
2. Far away sites: I don't know if your local is different, but this is an excellent question you can ask! Just google ""local # ibew hall"" (i don't know your number for your area) and ask where your jobsites would be - are they in one particular county only? The ones around me specify you can only work in your one county (doesn't matter where you live - if i live in San Francisco county, but apply and get accepted to San Mateo county, my work will always be in san mateo county). A very valid question for your hall! 
3. The classes - i'm not super sure what this means. For us, we have classes at our JATC (the school for the program, joint apprenticeship training committee) and they are mandatory, scheduled for us, and only taken there. it's affiliated with the community college nearby , to get us credits i think, but we never do anything there or with the school teachers etc. it's just a way to get credit towards a AA or something (sorry i'm not super familiar with it all!)
4. Pay - another thing you can ask is about the pay scale! Or it'll be on the website, on the 'where/when to apply' flyer. You start at a certain percentage of full wages, and work your way up. 

Overall, it's not as scary as it seems! It's a big undertaking but you can really adapt well and I've found people to be very happy to teach an admitted beginner who has a good attitude and is determined to learn.

Thinking that he can beat anyone and everyone was one of the most important traits of Souma, at least for me. He never thought that he couldn't beat someone before this and that was a character defining trait. He's simply shoved it away which is very disappointing to me.



And I'm not talking about him being naive here. Even until the latest chapters, he thought he could beat Tsukasa in a 1v1 which clearly wasn't possible. So this change was very sudden and didn't really fit in for me.",1527811249

&gt; CHARLESTON, S.C. - South Carolina has become the first U.S. state to pass legislation to fight anti-Semitism on campus, after supporters of the measure said it would help colleges battle discrimination amid growing numbers of such incidents nationwide.

&gt; The bill passed the South Carolina House by 86 votes to 4 late on Wednesday.

&gt; South Carolina Democratic Senator Brad Hutto, who opposed the bill, said its proponents were trying to inject the state&amp;#039;s lawmakers into a foreign policy debate.

I racked my brain for a thought of anyone else who might know. But then, there would be no reason for anyone to.
The computer fan whirred and whirred, the system error messages coming up again and again on screen, duplicating like square bacteria on steroids.

In front of me, my suspicions written out-
No more errors
Windows 7
Exploit flaw
Hack reality

It was the year 3072, so you'd wonder why I had a Windows 7 OS, let alone one of the old world machines. Blast from the future, in our world all the errors are gone. With everything. And I mean everything- cars, homes, robots, even some people. 
They've automated it all. Everything has autopilot, it seems even life does.

My dreams surfaced when I realised there was something wrong with me. I didn't go to the doctors, and that was my first action out of place. The hormone controllers usually keep that sort of behaviour stable. But then I got a sort of curiosity, and I started digging under surfaces. And that's when I found out about before the automation.

Since then, I've been searching for a machine from the old world. I've had to reconfigure and rebuild this one from schematics, but now it works, and for the first time I have visible proof of an error. A mechanical flaw. Outrageous right?

This kind of thing would be illegal, if I hadn't created a safe space in my basement for it- no cameras, no network, off grid. But now I feel that in a world with no errors, this Windows 7 may be my only chance at hacking reality. I'm going to have my best shot. Wish me luck",1527811257

There was a video of a college player who shot with the jankiest, most un\-ergonomical shot I've ever seen and he still put 100's up\(wish I could find it, his hand was super high on his stick for a shot\). So the prescribed way is open to your personal input as long as you can justify it.  


Just had a look at tom's shooting, it follows the fundamentals with his own little twist so no wonder it works. A super quick release and great accuracy is a very efficient way to beat a goalie.  


You want to play D1, that's excellent.  Coming on here and putting your video up is also great, this group is a great resource and putting yourself up here and the way you've replied to critique shows you're sincere.  


Only advice I can give is know why you're doing everything. and if you can't justify it with a 'it just feels good' or 'thats how coach said' then should you really be doing it?   


If you can know why you do every part of your game the way you do it then you can cut out all the bad habits and things which slow you down. Know what type of shot you'll use and where, in detail. Where you'll aim\(goalie dependent\). Some guys can walk onto teams from natural athleticism, but if you wanted to get on a team just from athletics you can join track.  


Lastly Its great to see you actually considering advice given, I've seen plenty of highlight videos where the player just gave excuses over every bit of advice. The ""I never really do that, etc"" and it's refreshing to see someone just considering it.  


Keep up the great work!

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","Here's the basics of health insurance.

You will pay the premium every month. If you don't go to the doctor, you will only pay the premium for that month. (Preventative care\* is included in the premium and shouldn't cost you anything more than the premium if everything is billed correctly.)

Something happens and you need to go to the doctor to get diagnosed and get medicine. Maybe you have a UTI, a fever, or a sore throat that had been around for a while. You can probably get this handled by your primary care physician. To know how much it'll cost, you look on your plan summary under 'primary care physician' or 'office visit'. It'll likely say something like $50 co-pay or 20% after deductible.

If it says $50 co-pay, your visit will just cost you $50 or less. (This is in addition to your monthly premium. All costs from here on out are in addition to your monthly premium.)

If it says 20% after deductible, then you're responsible for the full cost of the visit unless you've met your deductible. If you've met your deductible, you're only responsible for 20% of the cost of the visit.

There's also something called an out-of-pocket-max (oopm). This is the maximum you'll have to pay for medical care in a given year. Most plan years go from January 1 to December 31.

Let's say something big happened. You got cancer and needed surgery, chemo, and radiation. Luckily, you caught everything early and you had treatment from February to July. Cancer is expensive, so you reached your oopm in March. This means that fever and sore throat you get in October is covered 100% by your insurance and all you have to do is pay your monthly premium.

#Assuming you stay in-network and have medical insurance all year, the least you'll spend on medical care is your monthly premium x 12. The most you'll spend on medical care is your monthly premium x 12 + your oopm.

Preventative care\*   
Just because you go to see your doctor for a yearly physical, doesn't mean that everything is preventative. If your doctor orders blood work or other diagnostic testing, the testing isn't preventative. If your doctor gives you advice or consults you about some condition, your visit may not be billed as preventative care. It's ridiculous, but it happens. You go to your doctor expecting to not spend anything, but then they take your blood pressure, notice it's a little high, recommend a blood test or a consultation with a different doctor, you trust your doctor and agree only to find out that the extra stuff isn't covered as preventative. 

This basically happens every day either here or on r/personalfinance (or someone doesn't check with their insurance if a doctor or a facility is in-network) and there is very little you can do to not pay the bill.",1527811260

"cpp","t5_2qi27","Non-volatile RAM is nothing new, one of the first C embedded systems I worked on had only NVRAM , which was used for working memory as well as storage.  Incidentally the manufacturer collapsed because they couldn't compete on price with other devices that used a mix of cheap RAM and Flash. 

I don't recall the exact details now, but I think the way the OS set up was that certain address ranges would be marked as ""don't reset on startup"" , and we could assign variables to that address range via a source code extension. Then we could either just work directly in those variables, or (to support adding struct members in future). memcpy in and out of it with some primitive serialization.

I'm sure people can come up with much better idioms nowdays though :)

I had read something on hurdles artists hit long ago. A ""How to constructively critic"" style book. Wish I could remember it but it was too long ago, before the internet. When we would fell trees to scrawl our thoughts upon them. We would take these ravings and throw them into dungeons which we called ""libraries"".

Anyway, lettering was the other good tip I remember from that book. Tattooing and advertisements have lots of text. Look at the vowels and compare how similar they are. If no two E's or A's look the same then they need to practice lettering.

If you see a tattoo with great art but it somehow still looks cheap, it's most likely bad lettering.

It is also based on [how your brain can process scrabbled text](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-teasers/scrambled-text). After reviewing this article it should be clear that noticing differences in the letters themselves has to be actively focused and concentrated on.

Heh.  Did I tell you about during my first year in SGI (then called ""NSA"")?  I was pressured to be in the Kotekitai (I already played flute and had my own), and I saw right off that the younger teens, whose moms were forcing them to be there (note: Sunday morning, for an hour and a half or so, not counting obligatory gongyo, every week), just *hated* it.  The music we were playing was horrible - ""Higher than the Sky"", ""Forever Sensei"", all the standard gakky Gakkai ""hymns"".

So I stopped by the music store and picked out a simple jazz number, three parts, for clarinet, flute, and some other Kotekitai instrument - can't remember now.  I handed it to the YWD HQ leader the next time I saw her; you know what she said?

&gt;""Jazz is hard.""

And then she put that music away and it was never seen again.  I didn't even get to take it back for a refund!!

My suggestion might seem a bit off topic but it helped me a lot. I realized the pressures paralyzed me and don't allow me to concentrate \(How could I while my landlord set a deadline to leave the home\) I told myself a week of thinking and planing is better than seeking for a job without result.  I assumed that everything is fine and Someone pays me to plan his/her life. this was the first step because I couldn't plan for myself because I was trying to justify defects or make exception about myself so I imagined the plan is written for someone else.  
What was the plan? The perspective and the solutions with exact timeline. I made promises to everyone based on this timeline. 

For example I told to my landlord exactly when and how much will he receive and He accepted my proposal. 

Just be realistic and rational in your planning. for example you mentioned about Binary options and basically online trading. This is my interest as well but I didn't relied on it on my plan because I hadn't seen anyone makes living with binary options. Yes there were lots of bragging here and there on forums or YouTube but my overall result was negative after 2 years of trading. So how did I place it in my plan? I searched for real sample of successful BO trader first with proper proofs. I found but the problem was the tuition fee for the courses. as a result saving money for education took place in my plan and so on.

If Chabloz had set up her own website, and published her video directly on that website (ie. not using a YouTube ""embed""), there would have been nothing the law could have done.

Yes, this is a slightly weird distinction, but it's a real one. There are laws about *sending* (n.b.) offensive messages, but there are pretty much no laws about what you can or can't publish in a non-message format.

"politics","t5_2cneq","From your own article:

&gt;This was supposed to be the big one. At 2,300 pages, the new law ostensibly rewrote the rules for Wall Street. It was going to put an end to predatory lending in the mortgage markets, crack down on hidden fees and penalties in credit contracts, and create a powerful new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to safeguard ordinary consumers. Big banks would be banned from gambling with taxpayer money, and a new set of rules would limit speculators from making the kind of crazy-ass bets that cause wild spikes in the price of food and energy. There would be no more AIGs, and the world would never again face a financial apocalypse when a bank like Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

&gt;Most importantly, even if any of that fiendish crap ever did happen again, Dodd-Frank guaranteed we wouldn't be expected to pay for it. ""The American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes,"" Obama promised. ""There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period.""

That sounds pretty good to me.  Whats wrong with it?  Oh, from your article:

&gt;a troop of water-carrying Eric Cantor Republicans are speeding nine separate bills through the House, all designed to roll back the few genuinely toothy portions left in Dodd-Frank.

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Its an unpopular opinion here but i generally like shapiro. He is responsible along with Trump for my switch to conservative.

Trump made me switch conservative. Shapiro changed my opinion on universal health care, abortion, gun control even after i was a pede.

One of the greatest things ive see  was shapiro destory chunk yogurt. He is very smart, candice owens is right though. He tries to overcomplicate thingd to always be right.

I feel he gives Trump more credit now, mainly because of israel. But its his stubborness to admitting he was wrong about trump that he always has to find some issue with something hes done.

Its a hard one for me. Obviously id pick Trump, but i still like shapiro. I think a recent change is that so many of the people looked up to by college kids are now on the right. That only ever used to be leftists. But now you have shapiro, peterson etc.

I think we need these people on our side. This war will go on after Trump. Shapiro will be part of the reason the next generation of voters dont turn into liberal maniacs",1527811268

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here's a lovely excerpt from Ezekiel Chapter 23:

When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.

Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.

**There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.**

So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

""Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side--

the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses.

They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards.

I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. **They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire.**",1527811268

"Thunder","t5_2s53c","It's highly unlikely.   And I'll leave it at that.  It doesn't make much sense for Cleveland to pay 4.5 dollars for every 1 dollar of the luxury tax line for Abrines and Ferguson (which they will be if they take on Melo's salary .  It's very Thunder blue colored glasses to value that Abrines and Ferguson are worth a 150 salary allotment for a tanking team in 2018-2019 that leads to 100+ million in luxury taxes.   They're....not *that* good).  

None of these scenarios factor the interests of the other stakeholders in any realistic fashion (the Cavs willingness to pay the luxury tax next year without Lebron, Melo...if Melo wants to be bought out, why not just demand it from the Thunder instead of this charade trade?)...so why entertain such a fantasy?!?  

It's not enough to punt on the luxury tax problem and say, ""well, the Cavs will just trade Kevin Love to get near the luxury tax line...""   Who has cap space?!?  Name a team with cap space that will take Kevin Love's salary without sending any back, without asking for picks to offset the salary of Love (most of these teams are tanking and want picks for wasting their precious--and thus very valuable in a tight market--cap space for a salary dump....meaning, it could be the freaking Blazers who offer the best deal for, say, the Atlanta Hawks for unwanted salary, and not the Cavs)?  

This is what frustrates me about these scenarios (and emblematic of so much in the real world)...who is paying for the so-called free lunch, why, how, and what are the subtle payoffs that afforded such a ""free lunch""? (In this instance, salary dumping in a tight cap space market where teams are probably willing to fling first round picks to get out of their idiotic 2016 salary decisions).  

It's more realistic that Lebron--who said he would never take anything less than the max--to betray that previous statement and betray the interests of the players association, and say ""screw you all, I'm signing with the Thunder for tax payer mid level exception of 5.5 million!"", because that is *one* stakeholder acting out of character, instead of 2+ (Melo accepting a NTC with the Cavs, the Cavs willing to pay 100+ million in taxes for the honor of buying out Melo and...Ferguson and Abrines...OR some third party that takes on Cavs salaries pro bono essentially to help the Cavs).   

That is more realistic, Lebron accepting 5.5 million, mainly to *join* his buddy Melo, than these opt in scenarios that require multiple parties to do WTF?!? moves against their own self interest.   ",1527811268

My mental calculus says the relatively small difference in precision between the two, if you are shooting consistent match-grade ammo, does not offset the AR advantages of portability and rate of fire.

There's also only so far I can cover on foot across a city in a day/night whereas as a SR can take seconds and doesn't wear down any of my own physical stamina. (also, I'd like to point out that the limited time nature of shinies in pogo adds a great deal more frustration to them than main series hunting ever has, knowing that I have to drop everything and do what I can to hunt a species on the days or weeks it's available, even if I have other commitments to balance, is beyond frustrating compared to being able to just put the DS down for a bit and come back later when it's more convenient).

The paper you cited has nothing to do with the simple denials you make in response to any of the points I raised that invalidate your position, it's just something you want to go back to insisting is relevant because it's better sourced and more coherent than your own ramblings. Alright, I'm not taking issue with any of the claims in the paper except that the SOV and MOE functions are separable. And you yourself are claiming it never actually even meant to say that, despite you claiming that they are separable (which I then took issue with *you* for, not the paper you claimed didn't make that claim).

&gt; So you're not going to tell me when the flippening will occur?

Unlike you, I do not have the hubris to imagine that I can time the market. All I said was when the market dictates the hashrate will abandon the BTC chain, and that will be its death warrant. That is a fact. I do not know when it will actually happen, simply that it will, because silly science fair projects unusable for their intended purpose compete poorly with global scale payment networks following the original plan that had accounted for visa scale payments by the architect back in 2008 before Greg Maxwell sabotaged and hijacked it.

"westworld","t5_2xhxq","The character in the show was an adult though.  There was no implication of a child having sex, just adults who happen to be someone's offspring.

You're trying awfully hard... let's go through your ""reasoning.""

&gt; At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to personally watch or hear or imagine her having sex.

Ask yourself why. Also... side note but no one said anything about imagining or hearing or watching.  All that ever happened in the show was her mentioning that she enjoyed the pleasure palaces and the person I replied to said that scene was rough.  Introspect further on why even the ""imagining"" of it is distasteful.  It gets at the heart of why incest is taboo.  Evolutionarily speaking, incest is genetically undesirable, so naturally humans developed (read: these particular traits survived) a psychological reaction that keeps us from wanting to act as such.  From there the same recipe for understanding sexuality as male dominance is at the forefront.  An individual unavailable to a male for sexual dominance is treated as lesser i.e. as property.


&gt; Is this rooted in a drive to control? No, because I literally do not want to and will not control her life in any way.

lol.  That's not how patriarchy works.  That's not how implicit misogyny works.  That's not how any of this works.  Control (read: power) is infinitely more complex than I want and I will. lol

&gt; Because I don‚Äôt want to see or hear or imagine my son having sex either. Or my mom. Or my dad. Or my brother. And I don‚Äôt want any of them or anyone else seeing or hearing or imagining ME having sex either. See how it‚Äôs possible to hold both views in a consistent, sustainable manner?

See above.  See also Engels, [Origin of the Family.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf) Ooh and check out Levi-Strauss' The Elementary Structures of Kinship too

&gt; Every individual has a right to their own preferences, especially when it comes to their own body and senses.

And understanding the causes (patriarchy) and implications (implicit and internalized misogyny) of those ""preferences"" is key to feminism.

&gt; What you have done here is the equivalent of reacting to someone who says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you‚Äù to a female telemarketer because they hate dealing with telemarketers, and conflating their hatred of telemarketers with the history of male hatred toward women.

Or... not that.  The only way that analogy would work is if we were to measure the different reactions inflicted upon male and female telemarketers and then exploring the reasoning for such implicit biases.

&gt; That does NOTHING for female empowerment.

lol.  If only feminism was about female empowerment.  I have a few lesbian-separatist brochures you should really take a look at!

&gt; It distorts the reality of what is being contested and muddles discourse in a way that alienates potential allies. 

By alienated potential allies you mean oppressors unable to challenge the ways in which they oppress and members of the oppressed class coerced into aiding in their own oppression.  Or how did you put it...

&gt; the instances in which women have contributed to such problems have largely been instances in which some women have been negatively influenced by patriarchal systems and essentially ‚Äústooped to their level.‚Äù

"Lumix","t5_2wxkc","Man, I have SO many thoughts on this camera.

Pros:

1. The lens is absolutely, positively a Leica. There was a Leica version of this camera, with the exact same lens. And the one on the Panasonic is 100% a Leica, with the same exacting quality and performance. Unreal range! Optical image stabilization! Very respectable speed! Beautiful rendering, hardly any CA to speak of, extremely well corrected. This is a Leica lens. 

2. I was stunned by the performance from a 1"" sensor. But I'm not a pixel peeper, and I often enjoy noise. This camera has a fantastic noise pattern, as the resolution is quite high for the sensor size. So you get very small noise, and detail isn't really compromised that much. I shot at 1600 at night, and in low light conditions happily.

3. The controls and build quality are as good as a DSLR, extremely solid build. Not weather-sealed, but really, really good.

Cons:

1. The size. If this camera was able to be a little smaller, I would have kept it. It's basically the size of a GH4.

2. It's not great for video, and I was surprised when Panasonic basically turned the FZ2500 in to a video-centric camera. They should have just kept everything about the FZ1000, and made it a stills camera, possibly could have shrunk it down a little or something. 

But don't take my word for it. Here's some samples:

[Here's where I was sitting for sumo on my recent trip to Osaka.](https://imgur.com/uaoQG4c)

[And here's a shot the FZ1000 got me from that distance.](https://imgur.com/Pt3gLqi)

"otomegames","t5_2t3uv","It was the Revived in Passion Event Epilogue - which I probably set myself up to dislike him reading that since I can't stand smut. But I thought maybe just maybe Kenshin will change my mind. ... He did not and it cost me my view of him from then on v.v. So it might have happened with anyone else if I read their epilogues, but I only read his... I just didn't like how he seemed to force MC into his bed without waiting for her to be ready for or wanting such. All he had regard for was his own desire to possess her body, mind, and spirit - which in itself is very unwelcome to me. I don't like it when someone wants to claim every part of someone else for themselves. It really creeps me out.. People need to have something of themselves that's untouched by anyone to allow themselves autonomous control over their own lives, and these so called lovers want to violate such a precious natural freedom and claim what should never be claimed by anyone for their own. It's sickening. This is the process of breaking someone in to suit your own desires and will. How is that romantic. It's not, not to me, at any rate. Perhaps I read him wrong but his actions there have such an appearance from my eyes. I know Shingen gets a bad rep for unwanted advances but to me at least he only wanted her body and not everything that belonged to her like Kenshin does. As long as you can keep something of yourself free of influence there's a way to disentangle yourself from them. And that's exactly why men like that don't want that. They don't give you any such leeway because they know that if they do when they start displaying increasingly undesired behavior you'll be too defenseless to fight them head on since they've already infiltrated your mind, body, and spirit just like they wanted. It's a fact that everyone needs space, and these men will refuse to give you a cm to yourself without them in it. Basically you should get a restraining order if they don't respect your right to keep to yourself in some form.",1527811279

I honestly believe that the terribleness of today's alternative music can all be traced back to the spring/summer of 2013.

Imagine Dragons' first album came out and Radioactive spent the entire spring as the the #1 alternative song in the country. Right after that Sweater Weather by The Neighborhood came out, and despite the song being mopey and boring and literally *about winter* it became the alternative song of the summer and was #1 for almost all of June and July.

It didn't happen immediately (IMO 2014 and the first half of 2015 were fantastic for alternative music) but since the second half of 2015 almost every huge alternative song is either copying the ""generic"" alternative sound of Imagine Dragons or the ""mopey hip-hop influenced"" alternative sound of Sweater Weather.

Edit: The one exception to this trend recently is ""Feel It Still"" by Portugal. The Man which doesn't sound much like either of those. I would expect that about a year from now there will be a half dozen alternative songs out that sound exactly like ""Feel It Still"".",1527811282

Title: **Question about a family friend‚Äôs offense description - re: Child indecency.**

Original Post: 

&gt; There is a gentleman we have known for about three years.  He is the sweetest guy around and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to help someone out.   Regardless, he ended up in jail last weekend and we found out through one of his other friends.  
&gt; 
&gt; Turns out there was a warrant for his arrest for a child indecency charge in 2011, and he got pulled over for running a stop sign.   The charge was child indecency-tg (f2).   Unfortunately I can‚Äôt find an exact definition online.  Can anyone help with that?   Things point to a false accusation, but I‚Äôm not going to accept that right now.  
&gt; 
&gt; Appreciate any comments, and if this isn‚Äôt the correct place to ask, please point me to the correct one. üôÇ

This mod may be more than what you are looking for... but it adds a bunch of quests, in addition to numerous excellent companions, as well as dotting various talkative NPCs around the world.

* Ser Joffrey (24) - Slightly soured by his loss in the lists, Joffrey spends most of the time eating and drinking in silence. It doesn't take long for him to leave the table.

* Patrek (21) - Unlike his elder brother, Patrek's loss had done nothing to dampen his spirit. He alternates between which family member he speaks to, seeming to revel in the company of his family once again.

* Mia (17) - The pretty young lady of Prester enjoys the feast to it's full. She chats happily to both Patrek and Aidan.

* Aidan (16) - The wild young one, Aidan seems relatively at ease on the feast as he listens to his brother Patrek, hanging on his every word.

-whatever you put in (item wise) is returnable.  Totw, core, whatever.  If it was NAT when you put it in the set you get it back NAT. If it was auctionable it will be again

-training point refund: they aren‚Äôt going to only refund like 10% of the points you put in.  I‚Äôve heard a few numbers they are considering and am very hopeful it is a significant refund

-there are multiple chem types. Yes it takes more players to activate them but you have 50 total spots on roster plus unis and such to apply chem, you can just use silver or gold backups to get some of the chems you need.  Also since you can choose your chems on every card you can craft the team you really want.

Good point on the young kids learning to play a long NBA season. It's a misconception that just because a player is young means he can just play all the time. The fact is, these players have never played this much ball in their lives, and it takes a while to get used to. Tatum for instance, played 100 games this year, and only *29* at Duke last year. That's a huge jump, not even factoring in he had a huge role in the team with big mins. 

We do need a young big for our long-term team. Horford isn't getting any younger, and will need someone to take over for him as he gets on. Having a big man does not equal playing a post-heavy game; see any number of 7-footers that are out on the perimeter shooting threes. And there are a handful of players coming into the NBA this draft that have a skillset conducive to success in the modern NBA",1527811290

I also hate how too many MC act righteous but once they become strong, they go back to being evil. Also I hate how authors artifically create tension when theres no need(i.e. MC neeeds to get more powerful b/c his wife got kidnapped by a guy from 1000 realms above mc), like seriously wtf? How does some guy who can blow up galaxies, just descend to the mortal realm to steal MC's wife amongst hundreds of quintillions of women.

Yes, well said, this is exactly how he works.

&gt; Look into layers, blocks, and xrefs. 

He used layers for line thickness and color for an old long gone 8 pin plotter. It's still set up the same way and it just makes the purchased items \(doors,windows,tubs\) green, dimension lines red and Structural steel is blue, that kinda thing. Other than that, I don't know how layers should be used. 

He taught me how to make blocks, I've been going through his window blocks, stretching them out to all kinds of custom sizes and saving them as new blocks so we never have to do it again. I like that Autocad Architecture already has a massive collection of multi\-view blocks. Although I failed to figure out how to stretch a multi\-view vanity block a couple of FT.

No idea what xrefs are, asked my dad, he said he knows what they are and he doesn't use them, so another thing added to my list to look into.

&gt;  If you present these feaures to your dad in terms of a cost saving measure, he will come on board quicker. 

He isn't dead set against it, he just remains very skeptical. His colleagues have tried to get him to use other software over the years and he tells me they all fall apart when he gets to drawing the roof. He's defiantly curious, I'm sure if he had the time he would sit down with Autocad Architecture or Revit and struggle with it for the day. Eventually becoming so frustrated with something, give up and go back to his tried and true methods.

I'm pretty comfortable learning new software, I'm familiar with a half a dozen different logistical supply systems but CAD is a whole different beast. Honestly I'm so far in the dark I don't know what we need. What I do know is I struggle with the metal gymnastics of turning a floor plan into a section drawing. Also its annoying when a client makes a small change to our plan and then we have to go back to every individual drawing and make changes. I think it leaves a lot of room for human error. It's too easy for me to forget to make that change on the one of the elevations. If i could master a 3d model and make the change once and it fixes it in all the views that would be life changing.

&gt; According to several parents, players and Elites manager Tommy H. J. Neeposh, players were called &amp;quot;Savages&amp;quot; by at least one coach and a number of spectators.

&gt; Tommy H.J. Neeposh, the manager of the First Nations Elite Bantam AAA team, says that his players were subjected to racist taunts and treated unfairly by referees at a recent spring hockey tournament.

&gt; &amp;quot;Are the [Indigenous] players white as snow? I don&amp;#039;t know. Were the players a bit arrogant? We just organize the tournament.""

"serialkillers","t5_2s9td","They can *sentence* you to any amount of years, but there is a maximum amount of years you can actually *serve,* and it‚Äôs a very small number. 
I think Lopez was convicted in Ecuador and served like, 15 years or something nuts. 

EDIT: Sentenced to 16 years, served 14. Keep in mind, this penalty was given after being found guilty of murdering 110 little girls. 
That‚Äôs not one of those numbers that are an estimate either, like you‚Äôll see someone ‚Äúconvicted of 2 murders but possibly responsible for 9 total‚Äù those are actual *convictions.*

I believe they changed the max sentencing now. but at the time, yup, 16 MAX for any crime / combination of crimes. 

EDIT 2: Garavito is scheduled for possible release in 2021, he is what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmodel prisoner.‚Äù
However, Columbian law states that any criminal convicted for crimes against children *must* serve at least 60 years.  It‚Äôs possible he could spend up to 80 years in jail. ",1527811293

I'm gonna tell you this one more time, as simply as I can.  We know of one type of plastic that is ruined by plastic glue, and we know one type of plastic (my phone protector) that isn't.  So 50% chance plastic camera lenses are made of a plastic that is effected.  Glass lenses are not affected.  Quartz lenses are not affected.  So if you want to destroy a camera, putting glue on it is less than 50% effective at accomplishing your goal, IF YOU HAVE GLUE WITH YOU.  I guarantee you can find a pen at the airport.  And I guarantee even a welterweight couch potato can muster the ten pounds of pressure required to break the lens.  So glue is less than 50% ruined.  A pen is 100% ruining that lens, and once the lens is broken, you can stab the pen deeper and likely ruin the entire camera.  Spy cameras are tiny and do not have any reinforcement between panels.  You could very likely render it unrepairable in a matter of seconds.  I don't understand how any sane person could debate this.  You won't have glue magically appear if your flight gets routed through south korea, **and it probably won't work anyway**.  How in the world are you justifying this massive conversation?  You've disputed nothing I've said except you think you can't break a lens that's less than a quarter of an inch of glass or plastic, which is just as unreasonable a claim as the rest of your argument.  Like, you've gotta be bonkers to think your solution is superior.  **NO ONE PACKS PLASTIC WELDING GLUE TO THE AIRPORT**.  FFS This conversation is borderline retarded.",1527811295

Don't burn bridges though. Perhaps you can sit down with your manager and explain you're giving them your notice due to the issues you feel they have not addressed. It'll either push them to do more to meet your requests or they'll just let you go like you wish.

This is human conceit talking, and reality denial. It's very widespread, and I'm not judging any individual for thinking this way, but I disagree. 

What I see in your response is a willingness to accept the horror for our own entertainment, facilitated by denial of the horror.

Edit. On a little reflection I feel a bit bad for being so dismissive of what you actually wrote. I'm in considerable pain here and it distracts me.

I see emotions as being a result of chemical cascades in our brains. I believe this to be true of love, or fear, or anything else we feel. Some of these feelings are extremely pleasant, and comparisons to drug effects are ubiquitous in our literature. I also believe that we attribute far too much meaning to them as a coping mechanism.

Beauty is an interesting case. I believe that our perception of beauty is based on two of our drives. We seek advantage, and we seek resources, and what we perceive as beautiful usually depicts a symbolism of one of the two concepts. It's not always readily apparent to us in the moment why we see something as beautiful, but when one looks at the patterns of recognition of beauty it becomes more clear, at least in a way that makes sense to me.

I think we attribute an unhealthy amount of meaning to this feeling, as well.

I guess when we get right down to it, I don't perceive Meaning in life the way most people seem to. I think the universe is very largely deterministic, and that free will is illusory. I see life as a series of ongoing chemical reactions governed by the properties of matter. I see the activity of every particle in the universe as being predicated on the activity of interacting particles, and that includes the particles that right now make up you and me. With that in mind, if you'll pardon the pun, every thought we have is predicated on the interaction of the particles that we're composed of. We have absolutely no control beyond our ability to observe a sliver of reality, and we convince ourselves otherwise to cope with it all.

I'm so very tired.",1527811299

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Very much agree, tastes and level of risk aversion change with age. When I was a kid in the 80's, I could be reliably found on any number of two wheeled conveyances in a two piece swimsuit and maaaaaaaybe a pair of flip flops if my mum was around. I can remember ditching this little Honda while similarly attired, and I knew (from  ONE very informative experience) that you can't put your feet down in barefeet or flip flops.  I wasn't supposed to be riding along the shoulder of the road because the yard doesn't have gravel or traffic... anywho, I just ditched toward our front yard and kicked the bike away from me. Knocked the wind out of me, and my skin had grassburns, but I was just worried some neighbor would see and I'd get a stropping for riding on the road. My knees and elbows and sometimes the palms of my hands were covered in roadrash from about age 6 to 12.

Now, a couple of weeks before my 40th birthday, the thought of attempting to move my bike from the garage out to the driveway in flipflops makes my skin crawl. The grips feel almost alien when I don't have gloves on. I also can't imagine riding something I couldn't plant both feet flat during a stop, but when I was a kid I would ride anything as long as I could get a single big toe to touch while on tippies.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Your epistemology is a bit limited. God mostly has knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. God does have knowledge by experience as well, but that knowledge is based on things like creation. God had full knowledge of creation: what it would be composed of and resemble. But God did not have knowledge by experience until the actual moment of creation. God's omniscience is like a superior form of knowledge by acquaintance and description. God's knowledge by experience is limited. Jesus had/has more knowledge by experience than God did/does.

Bertrand Russel explains knowledge by acquaintance:

I say that I am *acquainted* with an object when I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e., when I am directly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive relation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes judgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation. In fact, I think the relation of subject and object which I call acquaintance is simply the converse of the relation of object and subject which constitutes presentation. That is, to say that *S* has acquaintance with *O* is essentially the same thing as to say that *O* is presented to *S*.

God by His nature is acquainted with all knowledge in that all knowledge is presented or readily available to Him.

Knowledge by description is knowledge that is had specifically without first hand or experiential knowledge; this would be like me saying ""Losing a child is horrible."" I have never lost a child, but based on what I know about it, it is demonstrably horrible.

The only limitations possible for a neccesary being, are those that would either forfeit His necessary nature or those that result in a contradiction. God's omnipotence is not diminished because He cannot create a rock so big that He could not lift it because the proposition is logically contradictory. God also cannot create a square circle, a river with one bank, or a mountain without a valley.  God knows sin by description, but He does not know it by experience because God cannot and does not sin. If God did know sin by experience, then His nature would be corrupted. Satan has knowledge by experience about sin because he commits sin. Satan has more knowledge by experience than God in terms of evil deeds, but that does not diminish God's omniscience.

"marijuanaenthusiasts","t5_2uzej","No, removing all the roots is not necessary, and here's some good news: it is not common for holly to put off suckers (eg: burning bush is a great example), so you shouldn't have to worry about it valiantly trying to survive after you remove it. 

Yes, the area will be pretty thick with roots, so it's really up to you if you want to remove them. You can't replant on the exact same spot the holly was unless you hire someone to remove the stump, obviously, but whatever you plant as a replacement will do it's best to put down roots where it can while the holly roots decompose. It takes much longer for things underground to decompose than above ground because of the limited oxygen available. In a wooded environment this process goes a little faster due to more addition of a wider variety of bugs/bacteria to help; not so much in an urban area.

Also, if you do go with another holly and you want your holly to put off lots of berries, you'll need two plants; one of each sex for pollination. The more berries the more benefit to wildlife! If you want one with no berries, though, get a male plant, and a reputable garden supplier should have them marked as such.",1527811304
"DanganRoleplay","t5_3ckk4","[Oh](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/01.png#sprite) no, this is horrible! With Kazuichi gone, I'm next in line! What does this killer have against people with dyed hair?!

[Well,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/07.png#sprite) and Gundham too, I guess... what did he do again? 

[Either](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/02.png#sprite) way, let's see...

[Ah,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/05.png#sprite) right, right! Alibi time! Ibuki's going to tell you what she did!

[There](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/03.png#sprite) was breakfast, where we had some wacky meeting to talk about Monokuma, but then he showed up with a bunch of books. Then Taka made us split into groups and I went with Kaede and Rantaro to the Pharmacy at 8:15 AM.

[Let's](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/17.png#sprite) see... there we saw bottles of... drugs, more drugs, poisons, more poisons, and... more drugs and poisons.

[At](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/16.png#sprite) 9 Mahiru came around and took a few pics, then left with Rantaro. Since Kaede and I are music buddies, I invited her to go practice at the Music Avenue!

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/04.png#sprite) arrived there at 9:15 AM and set up our equipment, and shortly after we were playing. Ibuki thinks that Kaede and her make an incredible duo! We should make a band called 'Two Girls, One Avenue'!

[Umm,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/07.png#sprite) except for the part where the electric amp broke and we had to ask Kazuichi to fix it... 

[He](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/13.png#sprite) happened to pass by and we told him what happened with the amp. With his magic mechanic powers he was able to fix it in mere 20 minutes after getting the stuff he needed!

[After](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/12.png#sprite) he finished fixing the amp, we went back to playing and Shuichi came by at 10:45 AM to watch for a bit. Ibuki has the genius idea to hold a concert later, and the both of them agree with her!

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/03.png#sprite) went back to the restaurant at 11:50 AM for lunch. If I remember right, there were a bunch of people there: Gundham, Sonia, Mahiru, Miu, Hiyoko, Taka, Maki and Kokichi.

[At](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/11.png#sprite) some point, I guess around 12 PM, Hiyoko dragged Mahiru to the amusement park, and 10 minutes later a whole bunch of other people arrived: Kazuichi, Keebo, Himiko, Angie, Kaito, Rantaro and Korekiyo. Then Gundham left another 10 minutes later to take care of his hamsters.

[And](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/16.png#sprite) then Kaede and Ibuki's moment to shine arrived! We announced our concert, which would take place after lunch in the Music Avenue! Truly fitting for 'Two Girls, One Avenue'!

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/04.png#sprite) left the restaurant a little after 12:30 PM to get everything ready, along with Taka, Miu and Shuichi! We finished in about 20 minutes, around when Keebo, Himiko, Angie and Korekiyo arrived.

[And](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/09.png#sprite) then the show started! We played a few songs we wrote together, like our hit single 'Don't Leave Me Hanging By A Rope'! 

[Other](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/12.png#sprite) songs included are: 'Bi The Way', 'I Spilled Pink Paint All Over The Piano' and 'They Ordered Me To Use The Ladder... Or Was It Stepladder?'. Buy the CD now, only $19.99 on Amazon!

[It](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/08.png#sprite) rocked! We played until 1:50 PM, and everyone was having a great time! 

[My](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/13.png#sprite) instincts don't lie when it comes to choosing a band partner.

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/11.png#sprite) started to clean up, and Miu was gone, but I didn't see when exactly she left. A little after 2 PM we heard the BDA go off and we hurried over to the diner.

[And](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/01.png#sprite) just as we were getting to the central island, another BDA played, so we panicked and split up! 

[Kaede,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/15.png#sprite) Keebo and Ibuki headed to the Pharmacy, but we didn't really find anything of unusual. It doesn't seem like anything was taken.

[That's](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/ibuki/07.png#sprite) all for Ibuki's alibi... I hope it helps.",1527811304

"customhearthstone","t5_30mve","The current system in place only gives you a maximum of 5 mana beasts to work with so you'll never go over 10 mana. For example the mammoth isn't in the pool. They did this because otherwise you could be put in a terrible position where the only beasts available to you are going to make the product cost more than 10. I.e. if you picked a 4 mana guy and then your second pick was all 7+ mana beasts, you wouldn't be able to work around it coming out any cheaper.

For your card to work you would need to follow the suggestion stated above, or have the pool for this card a different pool than from rexxar capped at 4 mana beasts (which is pretty limiting) 

That or we can say ""screw intuitive design"" and just play by your ""Well don't make anything over 10 mana"" and cry when the only options in front of you are going to result in a 10+ cost beast, which would mean the card wasn't designed well.",1527811307

Pandering to the Alt-Right is lucrative, but then so is the 'Classical Liberal' Anti-SJW crowd who arent into racism. So you'll see a lot of Brittanys and Allsups using careful intellectual language like 'preserving european identity' to keep both camps happy.

Now on to Lauren. I honestly do believe either she is a racist, or she is just extremely clever at marketing to racists. But one thing I will say is that she walks the line very carefully. As of today I will not find Lauren calling herself a white nationalist or advocating for an ethnostate. BUT the martin Sellner guy that you found creepy actually met Brittany through Lauren. Because Lauren was working with and promoting his organisation (Generation Identity).

Now with an honest  and objective lens on, as Lauren Southern fan tell me it isn't a little bit troubling that she is behind people like this, these are people who dont want people who look like you to live in Europe and definitely don't want you race mixing with white people.

and also shes a race realist, to me that's evidence enough of racial bigotry but check out what she says

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I don't have an all encompassing answer but I do have some ideas that contribute it to it. 

First of the US has basketball hoops in virtually every park in the country and in every elementary, Jr and high school. So not only is everybody exposed to basketball growing up, they have every opportunity to play. In the rest of the world they don't always have basketball courts so soccer is go to sport for the masses.  But for the US the abundance of basketball hoops makes the sport accessible to every body no matter their socioeconomic status. 

Culturally sports is very important in the black community and basketball/football are the most popular, it's starting to change but generally we don't play baseball anymore and we don't really play soccer. So while black people are a minority in this country, damn near every black athlete plays basketball. Contrast that with white athletes who are spread out over all the sports. 

AAU plays a large part because it ends up being an extremely extensive scouting network. You could be some kid in a extremely rural town who plays for a garbage team, but you just have to go to one tournament and play well and someone from a bigger team will see you and recruit you. The better you are eventually the bigger and bigger clubs will find you and give you a bigger platform to perform and showcase your talent. At the highest level these are all fully funded teams so if you are good enough you will get to a national level where the top schools can see you play and offer a scholarship.

Add up all those things and you have a situation in which the US is able to maximize their minority black population and give them chances to progress without systemic forces working against them. 

The finals piece of it is cultural and it has to do with player development. There are two predominant basketball cultures in America white and black. Naturally these tend to mirror the cultures at large. White people are much more system oriented, they like to be able to replicate things and  prefer uniformity. They have a very strong affinity for teamwork and generally shun individuals. Black people have been historically ""let down by the system"" so there is a stronger sense of individuality. Creativity and expression is encouraged, there is less peer pressure to conform to the system.  Now this has disastrous consequences in society at large because we live in a society controlled by white people and so success generally comes to those who conform. Sports is a little bit different. 

At a young age, white players are taught that the system is most important, and individual brilliance often comes at the expense of the team as a whole. If a talented player takes "" more than their fair share"" of the shots, they are labeled a ball hog. If they spot a mismatch on offense and take advantage of it without using ""the system"" they are labeled selfish, or a showboat or whatever. So after a while you get that kid to start to play well within themselves because they don't want to be an asshole and show up their teammates or opponents. Of course you have some kids who don't really care and so that peer pressure doesn't have a lot of effect on them, but for the majority of players it has a profound effect on them and they never get a chance to explore their own individual game and maximize their talent. 

With black players it's very different. The game is just as competitive but entertainment and individual expression are more important than performing for the system. That's not to say the system isn't important, but that the players are more important than the system itself. Players are encouraged to take their man on if they have an advantage and to create.  So players are given the freedom to develop and maximize their talent. Coaches also focus on individual skills at younger ages and have a smaller emphasis on team based drills and running plays.

This is not an all encompassing answer but in my opinion these are some of the reasons why the NBA is so heavily African-American. I'm a former player and a AAU coach and these are just my observations from my years involved in basketball. Please feel free to challenge my ideas or ask me questions because this is a subject that I absolutely love and don't claim to be an authority on. ",1527811310

*¬øEse estrato de la poblaci√≥n?* Beatriz Sarlo, quien posiblemente sea la mujer m√°s instruida que hay en este pa√≠s, dijo haber abortado cuatro veces.

Dejemos el paternalismo de creerse que la clase media hace las cosas por ser la Avant Garde de los pobres. Los militantes de la clase media act√∫an por sus propios intereses.

&gt; Y esto s√≥lo hablando de relaciones sexuales consensuadas. ¬øNecesito traer a colaci√≥n todos los casos de nenas de 11-12 a√±os abusadas que quedan embarazadas y que no las dejaron abortar incluso cuando se prob√≥ fehacientemente que fue v√≠ctima de violaci√≥n? ¬øY las que fueron detenidas por tener abortos espont√°neos?

No, no necesit√°s traerlo a colaci√≥n porque no es lo que se debate en el Congreso.

&gt; El tema es much√≠simo m√°s complejo y no es s√≥lo cuidarse con preservativos o que las mujeres no los queremos poner. 

Si quer√©s prevenir el Sida, que causa doce veces m√°s muertes de mujeres (m√°s las muertes de hombres, claro est√°) que el aborto, s√≠, es tan sencillo y s√≠, s√≥lo se evita cuidandose con preservativo.

&gt; No simplifiques diciendo que se trata solamente de un tema de comodidad. Adem√°s de tomar a dos o tres de Twitter como referencia de toda la lucha... 

Si no se tratara de un tema de comodidad, las muchachas del pa√±uelo verde hubieran criticado a Leticia Br√©dice por no haberse cuidado.

&gt; The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says it expects charges to be laid against the ANZ Bank, its Group Treasurer and several other companies and individuals over an alleged criminal cartel arrangement.

&gt; The ACCC said the charges were expected to be laid by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to trading in ANZ shares, following an ANZ institutional share placement in August 2015.

&gt; &amp;quot;The charges will involve alleged cartel arrangements relating to trading in ANZ shares following an ANZ institutional share placement in August 2015,&amp;quot; ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.

That sport exists, and its not called powerlifting. You're free to celebrate and participate in that sport without shitting on this one. No one is under the illusion that a smaller lighter lifter is stronger than a larger guy, that's not what they get medals for. It's a sport, and it's unsportsmanlike of you to hold people to your self\-conceived notion of what the sport should be and claim their medals are participation trophies.

\&gt;  I think it should be the same for the Oly lifts.

So in your judgement, olympic gold weightlifting = participation trophy in anything except SHW. You are certainly free to have opinions like this, but you didn't keep them to yourself you posted them on the internet and invited discussion and judgement.

"proED","t5_38934","Regular people *don‚Äôt* know anything about nutrition. My best friend is about to complete her doctorate in dietetics and I‚Äôve become her de facto listening ear because, even without the legit biochemical understanding and knowledge she has, I‚Äôm her only friend not in the field that ‚Äúgets‚Äù it. How sad is that? The only person in her life that doesn‚Äôt work in healthcare and has a rudimentary base level understanding of metabolism and diet is an eating disordered 30 year old woman. There‚Äôs something terribly wrong with that. 

What I haven‚Äôt been able to suss out is are people lacking knowledge about food/diet because they‚Äôve legitimately been mislead or miseducated, or do people ‚Äúchoose‚Äù misinformation because it appeals to their emotions? I can‚Äôt escape the worrisome feeling that a lot of the nonsense people regurgitate is the result of some serious willful ignorance. 

I get that weight loss can be supremely difficult. Between food addiction, BED, metabolic disorders, etc. my heart goes out to all the overweight folks out there struggling just to get to a healthy size. I can empathize even if what I‚Äôm dealing with isn‚Äôt quite the same. And further, if someone is content at a larger size and simply doesn‚Äôt want to lose weight, more power to them. As someone who smokes, willingly engages in eating disordered behavior, and drinks regularly it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in any place to pass judgement on anyone else‚Äôs decisions regarding health. But when I see people point to ‚Äústarvation mode‚Äù, or talk about how any form of calorie restriction is bad, I have a hard time not feeling contemptuous. It takes a lot more effort to search out ‚Äúinformation‚Äù or ‚Äúproof‚Äù of those kinds of food related ideologies than it does to simply look at the evidence supporting the standard view of how nutrition, metabolism, and diet function. Meaning holding those views requires actual work, and that points to willful ignorance based on excuses and ‚Äúfeels‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to be sympathetic to someone who actively puts down trying to be healthy because they put the comfort of their own stagnation above someone else‚Äôs effort. 

 I‚Äôm cool with people doing whatever they want with their bodies, as long as they‚Äôre being intellectually honest about their choices. I doubt you‚Äôd find many of us advising others to adopt our dietary habits because we *know* what we‚Äôre doing is dangerous. Why is it that so many of us are here posting about how guilty we feel lying to the people that ask us for advice, trying so hard to balance what we know we are doing to ourselves and being supportive and helpful in a healthy way to the people we care about, but anywhere else on the internet when someone posts about their diet success or their determination to get to a healthy weight someone inevitably shows up spouting some garbage about how whatever they‚Äôre doing is terrible and dangerous?

Sorry for the rant. It just really grinds my gears. There‚Äôs something deeply unfair about eating disordered people displaying so much honesty and understanding and *knowledge* while HAES folks are out there screwing things up for so many people trying so hard in the face of so many challenges. It just...ugh.",1527811312

The toughest thing of course is that with the PvE becoming free later this year, the problem of this + trading + taxis will only be more and more apparent as people can make a new account for free and never need to spend any money for it.

Epic needs to come up with a solution, one that will both stop the trading/taxi lower players to higher leveled areas, but also allow friends (since all the BR players will have access too) to still enjoy the game with those who are massively over leveled. 

That‚Äôs a main issue with the trades, is being able to drop stuff is actually useful, as I‚Äôve given constructors trap materials to make the base how they want.",1527811313

"AsianParentStories","t5_2u8j6","This was my exact experience in undergrad when I was commuting from home. I did the same thing as you -- stopped answering calls and got a dozen missed calls. This was when cell phones were just taking off. I can't imagine what sorts of text messages I would've gotten!

One time, my mom got so angry/scared when I stopped picking up her calls that she got in the car and went out looking for me. I have no idea where she went. Got the biggest scolding of my life after that. It's funny in hindsight but was traumatizing at the time, lol. 

I regret not having the typical college experience and blame my parents' over-protectiveness for making me unprepared for the real world. I now live in a different state from them and have attempted to catch up on life. My relationship with them has also vastly improved.

I don't have good advice for you, but I wanted to say that some of us get you! You're not alone. It gets better.

Pros from this is that you're not massively in student debt. I also think that I absorbed most of my parents' insanity on behalf of my younger brother, so yay for him, lol.

A few tricks that I think helped: 1) Tell them that it's hard to answer the phone, like if you're in movie, in class, or a loud restaurant, but you can check in with them via text. Teach them how to text if they don't know how. Gain their trust by actually texting when they don't expect it. 2) Sell everything that you do as being related to academics or work. I think this experience has made me a really good salesperson, haha. (Not a salesperson by trade, but it helps with pitching ideas to friends and colleagues.) 3) When you get the chance to move out, and it won't bankrupt you, do it.",1527811313

[https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons\-granted\-president\-donald\-trump](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump)

One of the big differences between Obama's pardons and Trump's is that Trump has made several of them without following standard procedure. Normally the President consults with the DoJ and then the pardon is issued on his authority through the DoJ. Trump has gone and just announced pardons kind of willy\-nilly. 

And of course, other than the pardon for Jack Johnson, all of Trump's pardons have been for people who have done things that his supporters and campaign staff are likely to be charged with.

When people say that LSD, cannabis, psilocybin, etc. are non-addictive, this is referring to it on a chemical level i.e. your body chemistry will not shift to account for the continual addition of this substance into your system, thus be unbalanced when the supply is cut. Because most sources of this information are science, chemistry or medically based, the substances are called non-addictive; and they are as such by category. If everything was to be labelled based on psychological dependence risk or ability of willpower to refrain from usage, everything would come with a warning label.

You may have heard that tripping often will make you want to trip less, because for the majority this is true. Information isn't put out based on minority groups or lowest common denominators. If it was, expect an extra 10,000 pages in every study ever published on anything, because one guy doesn't seem to possess the ability to stop himself from smoking a joint, or eating a certain type of food, etc. Which is why extensive research, safe use not abuse - harm reduction - are so important.",1527811318

Kazan finally manages to catch the beasy off balance, slamming it to the ground much like a judo practioner would. In one final tantrum the raptor spews a gout of flame at whatever creature is latched on to it, causing kazan to release her grip and jump back from the flames, however this doesnt go unnoticed by Masa.

Masa sees the flash of light from the flames and instantly reacts slamming down one of the clay jars full of sticky oil during one of his evasive rolls. The over eager twins whilencontinuon their assault fail to see what has happened and easily step into the oily goo. Masa finally gets to his feet and launches his own attack. As another kick comes his way he grabs hold. With a forceful spin the male twin is taken airborned and flies through the air before crashing into his sister.

"indieheads","t5_2zj24","Gave in and heard the leak yesterday. Here's my track by track breakdown. Overall I enjoyed this very much, more than I expected. It's odd because it's neither a letdown nor a mind-blowing album on first listen. I have a feeling it will grow to be one of my favorites of his discography.

""Age of"" - Off to a good start. My first impression of the harpsichord driven track was that 0PN made a kosmische-y r/dungeonsynth album, like the backdrop of a gnostic / esoteric themed experimental album. Different but not quite novel if one digs into the vast world 80s or 90s era avant-garde, sounded like something I'd hear off an [Ulver album] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tJNWFdfuko) or [Coil release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVljKISj-MY). I always hope releases like this can serve as entry-points for listeners but often reviews fall short of highlighting such recs. Apparently this samples [""Blow the Wind: Pie Jesu"" by Jocelyn Pook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jsZzXu6EIA) which is the kind of deep cut niche music that's way beyond mine and most people's knowledge base.

""Babylon"" - Here comes to autotune vocals, I'll be honest, immediately harkens Kirin Callinan's album [last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gytUsZ2sTSM) but with more effects. Not a bad thing, as it goes on that first impression melts away as I get lost in the backing instrumentation. Pacing and scope wise it sounds similar to the Iggy Pop collab song ""The Pure and the Damned."" I like this a lot more than ""Black Snow"" which sounds kind of flat in comparison. 

""Manifold"" - Here we go, album is picking speed and cranking up the reliable unabashed 0PN weirdness.

""The Station"" -  Okay, really starting to dig this. At first sounds like more subdued G.O.D. era stuff. I always felt like that album was channeling regurgitated cathartic teenage angst via Nickelodeon GAK visuals, nu metal / post-grunge noise, and geocities sites. If that cathartic reconciliation of an embarrassing past was G.O.D. then this sounds like epiphany moment a kid jumps from Linkin Park to [Radiohead.](https://vimeo.com/183292065)

""Toys 2"" Build-up from the start sounds like a toy orchestra and MIDI synth rendition of John Murphy's [Adagio in D Minor from *Sunshine*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-4XD-wbalY) 2:00 shifts to something more akin to 80s/90s new age music honed into more abstract noise and drone, akin to [Dedekind Cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB2_PdGLcUQ) or [Claude Speeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILNTOC55MUw). Some interesting sounds here, including like what I take as a synth modelled after steel guitar timbres. This reminds me I still need to watch the film *Toys*, a film that looks like a [vaporwave aesthetic](https://media.giphy.com/media/sTiAOplGzluuY/giphy.gif) sampling goldmine. 

""Black Snow"" - Ironically the least exciting 0PN single I've heard yet was also the biggest earworm - the melody of this creeped into my head more than just about any previous 0PN track. I had the same dilemma in the past when Grimes released ""Go"" - I all but hated it at first but it grew on me. Same phenomenon with this one. I get the context of it now but still not the strongest track.

""myriad.industries"" - interlude, sounds like an AI musician bot improv jamming off the melody of video game menu muzak.

""Warning"" - Some tense shit, def more past 0PN vibes on this, arpeggios, suspenseful build-ups, percussive elements coming in and out.

""We'll Take It"" - Goddamn, the beats are something else. Reminds me of the hella underrated [early work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idYVClhUVzc) of [Vex'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPTHh-big4). Lot of post-grime vibes on this (Logos, Rabit, Sd Laika, Antwood, Amnesia Scanner, Lotic) Dig the vocal sample, find it intriguing. Beyond the cinematic, almost [trip-hop stomps](https://youtu.be/xK-YrXYa2JU?t=2m22s) of sound some shimmery [Lone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y03l3V2YuQ) sounding synth lines emerge at the end (embedded to BoC among others), not to mention akin to early 0PN's Juno stuff. 

""Same"" - I like how ANOHI's voice fits into the track. This sounds crazy but's almost like an [Alt-J-esque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrhSJzM8NLE) melody but with some aggression and teeth.

""RayCats"" - Is this the [James Black collab track?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ehllI7Jts). I kid, actually a big fan. Solid track. Not much else to say other than it's refreshing to hear some actual dynamism on a track volume and reverb wise, not just brick walled walls of sound. 

""Still Stuff That Doesn't Happen"" - Ok, I hear James Blake's [Harmonimix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLozoX1RdnM) influence all over this. Pretty goddamn poppy, still left-field enough to recognize as 0PN. R&amp;B influenced avant-garde electronic music has been done to death but this is still in pretty good company of producer deconstructing the hell out of pop. If you dig this I'd check out Giant Claw's album [Dark Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUn3Zrc0VwE) One of the better tracks.

""Last Known Image of a Song"" - Wonderful closer, I could listen to a whole LP of music like this. Again, lot of touches of 70s/80s new age jazz, ambient, etc. But beyond that not exactly memorable. Def a coda with a cute little abrupt finish, not a huge closer but I like it nonetheless.

""Trance 1"" - Bonus track but not sure if it's from the sessions for *Age Of.* I guess I'd only know for sure if there was some harpsichord noodling. Classic 0PN vibes. Lovely bonus track but note sure if it's from the same headspace, at least not in the sense that this was an outtake. Then again it would of also made a nice closer.

edit: TLDR - great, not massively groundbreaking but exciting, worthwhile and cohesive. to quote an acquaintance ""this album feels transitional... one foot in R+7 / GoD, the other in Myriad / the future. Not fully formed. Still enjoyable though "" ",1527811324

You earned it. You deserve it. Everyone messes up, even in big ways, but that doesn't make what you did any lesser. I'm a 26 year old two\-time dropout. Dropped out of highschool. dropped out of college. Went back to college and flunked out twice again. That was 4 years ago. This year? I'm publishing my first novel.

There are very few fuck ups so great that you can't come back from. You opened your eyes today and posted this; that already is the first step to you coming back to a place you want to be.

You still are that awesome funny person you were before; you went through a loss and relapsed\-\- that's okay.  After my basically little brother died I failed out of college that last time; you're normal. Things happen and we fuck up. Whats important is that you know yourself and want to change enough to come on here. I dont think you're hopeless, if anything I think the opposite. Someone who's hopeless wouldn't even bother to write what you have and open up to strangers online, even if its just to vent. 

You tried. And you're trying.  That right there is the biggest secret to changing your circumstances. I myself just posted a thread on here about an hour ago so I may seem like a hypocrite here, but for you I dont think you understand how seriously badass it is that you came here. Give yourself some credit, or at least one last chance.

Look up some resources online for local stuff in your city.  If you cant go down there or dont feel comfortable, there's forums and chatrooms dedicated to people struggling with drug problems and just...offering a community of support from people who've been there or are right there with you. 

I dont know what your relationship is like with your family, but if you feel like you can\-\- just be real with them. Write it in a letter if you cant talk to them face to face, let them know you're struggling with this problem and want help. No one who loves you wants to see you suffer or self\-destruct.

You're young, and I know you probably get told that left and right, but hear me out.

Think of something you did in the past that you're happy you did now. 

Now think of a 21 year old version of you, clean and healthy, working toward things that makes them happy. That future\-you is going to become present\-you in five years, and they're going to think ""wow im so glad 16yr old me turned things around. Thanks past\-me! ;D"" That you can be the real you. Take little tiny steps, every day, to get yourself there. Today you posted on here. Tomorrow? Do some research on treatment centers and treatment options. Look into forums and support groups. The day after that? Set a goal. Something small and simple that you KNOW you can do. That's the secret.

Finally; there's nothing wrong with who you are as a person. You do drugs, so what? Everybody's done something or messed something up for themselves at one point in their lives. Some of us multiple times. Your friend shouldn't have judged you like that but that is their shortcoming, not yours. You can absolutely find other people who will understand and give you the support you need, whether they're in your own family, other friends you have, or even online. 

I'm rooting for you. I wont say ""dont give up!"" because its unrealistic. Give up when you need to. Cry when you need to. Vent, stay in bed, be upset when you need to. But when you're done, remind yourself why you started recovery in the first place and get going again. 

I hope this was at least a bit helpful. ",1527811324

I had a girl who was going to court against her biodad who had raped her (got the full story from a coworker) , and she would not stop telling people ""Don't let (biodads first name) come near you because he's mean and bad and will touch your privates!"" it really shocked me because this girl is the sweetest and funniest little girl ever, shes only 4.
Ive had kids who were playing barbies and one of the"" mom"" barbies started yelling at the ""child"" barbies shit like ""I wish you were never born! I hate you! I wish i had never carried you"" etc. Kids who talk about their parents fights, what they said, where they went and how many doors they slammed. Nothing is off limits at (a good) daycare, because children can't go through these things alone, and often the parents don't want to talk about it or they're the ones causing the problem.

And that's assuming that people are really worried about the person's access to kids and not just opposed to hiring someone like this in the first place - the title of the article leans toward the latter, calling out ABC's hiring of these individuals and not their decision to put them on projects that give them access to children.

Let's pretend as though we are the police officer here. We are walking down the beach, patrolling and making sure no crimes are being committed and everyone is safe. We see a young girl with a container of alcohol on her beach blanket. This is already a crime, whether you're under 21 or not \(just like how you couldn't walk down a public street carrying a container of alcohol. Furthermore, she's a minor, which is a separate crime. So now she's committed two crimes. We ask for her name \(which she is legally required to give to us, as we know for a fact that she has committed two crimes\), and she doesn't give it to us after multiple requests. So now she's committed three separate crimes, so we go to arrest her.

She runs away and pushes the police officers away \(this can be seen in the video\), which makes crime #4.  Once they are on top of her, she kicks them and spits on them. The only questionable actions by the police officers are the two hits that he delivers while attempting to subdue her. That might be excessive force, it might not be; that's for a judge to decide, and I do believe that these officers should have to stand trial in a court of law. However, it's pretty easy to see how the woman in the video was at fault. She committed multiple crimes, and then was completely uncooperative \(illegally so\) when confronted by the police.",1527811330

For the over achievers, a final Google search on Republican solutions to school shootings include fewer doors, arming teachers, or to have the Federal government do better surveillance on its citizens. (The Cheeto in Chief himself suggested that one.) Studies indicate these measures would either have no effect, or worsen the problem. (Maybe not Trump's nanny state but that's another discussion)

When I asked him how he learned to play like that, he told me it was really popular with the inmates while he was in prison. Everyone would play, and you had to be good because the winner would get the loser's soup at dinner. If you lost you went hungry. I believe it because let me tell you, he was a fantastic player.

"personalitydisorders","t5_2ziu8","Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not a psychologist or a doctor. I am currently working on my Master‚Äôs in Forensic Psych and can only tell you what I think based on what I know of mental disorders and what I know based on what you have stated. 

To me, it does seem as if you may have some psychopathic tendencies, namely lack of strong emotion, impulsive and thrill-seeking behavior, and a history of behavior that is harmful to others. However, the fact that you are addressing it now is a good thing. 

The general consensus on the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths is that there psychopaths are born and sociopaths are made. There is strong evidence for genetic involvement in the development of psychopathy, and strong evidence for trauma and violence in the environment when it comes to sociopathic behavior. Sociopaths also are more likely to experience emotions such as remorse, although that is not true for everyone. Therefore, my first thought is how you have grown up and whether there are factors that may have contributed to a more sociopathic or antisocial disposition, such as growing up surrounded by crime or violence. You are still very young and are obviously aware of how you have developed thus far, which will be a great asset to you in the long run. Have you always felt this way, or is it something that has recently developed? Do you ever have explosive, violent, or destructive behaviors? Have you ever been diagnosed with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder? (And btw you don‚Äôt have to answer any of these questions if you don‚Äôt want to‚Äîjust throwing out things to think about) 

There are also sexual preferences known as paraphilias, which are commonly known as fetishes or deviant sexual preferences. These include sexual sadism, pedophilia, necrophilia, cross-dressing, foot fetishes, and many more. It isn‚Äôt really known why some people develop paraphilias, but as long as no one is actively getting hurt, assaulted, or killed, or as long as no crime is being committed (like breaking into a morgue to have sex with a corpse or actually molesting a child/downloading child porn), paraphilias are not necessarily harmful. Based on your description of arousal when others are in pain, it sounds like you may be a sexual sadist. In this case, there are safe and consensual ways to express this desire. BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and Masochism) is a fairly common practice for many people, and the BDSM community very much encourages safe and consensual practices.

I say, continue to examine yourself and why you feel the way you feel. If you feel therapy would be helpful, and if it‚Äôs an option for you, look into it, if only for the purpose of better self-understanding. Like I said, you‚Äôre young, and there is a lot of mental and biological development you have yet to go through. Good luck and I hope you are able to find peace with yourself.",1527811331

&gt; Nicaraguan bishops have announced they are abandoning peace talks with the embattled administration of Daniel Ortega after at least 11 people were killed and 79 wounded during the latest mass protest against his rule.

&gt; Carlos Alfredo Portobanco, a 26-year-old student who was among the protesters, said: &amp;quot;We feel oppressed and disrespected by a government that talks about peace but does nothing but promote violence. We don&amp;#039;t want any more dead - our mothers suffer when we leave our homes because they are not sure we will return.""

&gt; Senior members of Nicaragua&amp;#039;s Catholic church began mediating peace talks between Ortega and the student-led protesters on 16 May, with protesters using the dialogue to berate their unpopular president and their first lady, Rosario Murillo, as asesinos.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","My worlds usually have a way to create or explain magical \(or technological\) items and artifacts and have many dangerous items by nature. Though I don't have most artifacts in my worlds fleshed out, there is one world \(and one concept that currently does not have a world, though it could fit in multiple\) with a dark nature that leads to forbidden and dangerous artifacts: \*\*Grimoire\*\*.

In this world, the Grimoire itself is a sort of necronomicon: it contains information on a littany of rituals involving dark blood magic and documents on daemons, the parasites the heroes track and kill. Not only does it have information, it has spells written directly on the page in blood that can be used at any time, and some of the pages can create gateways to pocket dimensions with terrifying monsters. Only to be used by an extreme professional daemon hunter.

Grimoire also has the actual Necronomicon, as well as several extremely dangerous weapons that use blood as fuel. There's also a concept that I haven't fit into a specific world yet: the four rings of the apocalypse. Each ring contains a shattered piece of an ancient evil entity. The rings also take hosts, granting them abilities in exchange for a devastating price. For example, the Ring of War gives increased strength, speed, and durability to its hosts, but when they put the ring on, their mind is flooded with anger, rage, and hate \- the ring is the only thing that maintains their sanity, and even then, most hosts fall into insanity dealing with the voices.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Now, let me caveat this.  Right now, if someone walked into my office and asked me to code an implementation of a balanced tree I could not do it.  Frankly any mature language has implementations of any data structure you're likely to come across either built in, or in one of the thousands of 3rd party libraries.  For the most part, I think interview questions on these types of things are total BS\* unless you're actually doing systems level coding on high scalable systems.  Now that being said, understanding the pros and cons of common data structures and recognizing O\- in your code makes you a better developer, no question there.

This is because in my experience bad coders can't even write easy code.  I used to give my interviewees a laptop, open internet, and a problem similar to ones we solve in the work environment.  That is to say when we were writing database driven business apps, I'd make them write a method that retrieved, updated based on some rules, and then stored some data, because that was 70&amp;#37; of what our code base was doing.  They could use any language, or framework.  Didn't care, solve the problem.

70\-80&amp;#37; of people who walked in the door, who claimed to have experience in these very things, couldn't write anything remotely resembling a solution given 2 hours.  The people we hired sat down, brushed off some dust if necessary, and banged out a working solution in about 20 minutes.  If you were more junior, I would generally make you an offer if you got 70&amp;#37; of the solution done and could demonstrate that the lightbulb was on and you could at least come up with a reasonable solution and start attacking it in a logical manner.

It'd be the same approach for me if I decided to use those interview questions on algos and data structures.  Here's a laptop with the internet, find me a solution.  I don't care if you stack overflow every line of code so long as you can sufficiently explain how and why when you're done.  Having those implementations memorized just tells me that you spent a lot of time reading ""ace the interview"" guides, not that you can actually think creatively, solve problems, or communicate well.  And those 3 things are the things I value in my technical team.",1527811333

Frankly if the prosecution can paint you as a creep and use your internet history against you it doesn‚Äôt take much more than circumstantial evidence to convict. 

There are plenty of cases like this, more than can be citable. It‚Äôs best just not t get entangled or do your due diligence. Look at cases like Cameron Todd Willingham, Adam Frasch or others. A bit of character assasination and some circumstantial evidence is all that needed, even if you have the means of a financing a healthy defense. ",1527811333
"mcgill","t5_2rhkw","My bad, I only looked at the comment before your reply. Either way, the point still stands - living in a tiny, double hotel room with no kitchen and no living space should not cost you two grand a month even if it does come with food. It's currently costing me about $980 a month total with internet, groceries, and rent, and that's to live by myself in a nice studio. 

And it's not good, at least not in C4. And it's a known fact that at least once a year, students have to go to the hospital with severe food poisoning bc the cafs have 0 standards. And actually yes, you should be able to go a year (or even more!) without having to send people to the hospital because they ate your food. Any real restaurant that was making people that sick on that consistent a basis would be shut down. 

Now, the fact that you're going on about being able to get an NY strip steak proves that money is apparently not an issue for you. For people who have to pay their own way through and were trying to make their money stretch, you have to go for the cheap options, and even a terrible cheeseburger still costs $8. It's absolutely a steal, but just for McGill. ""Pricey"" does not begin to describe how overpriced their food is, and when I've talked to housing about this, they said it's because it's ""like going out to eat every night"". Like, that is not what a reasonable person would do. I do not want to have to spend $10 on food for every meal - hell, my average day's worth of meals since getting off the meal plan probably costs like $8 at most. If you are someone who's comfortable spending that kind of money on mediocre food, then congrats, you're not someone who has to worry about money, I guess. For anyone coming to McGill for whom money is an issue, then that's not something they can afford to do. ",1527811333

Also, having meta decks omni present at all points in the ladder severely dulls the experience of climbing and makes the new player experience excruciating. Plus, the mtg meta is a lot less rigid compared to the hearthstone meta because you can usually put answers into any of your janky decks since mana fixing exists. Your deck will still be less consistent but you can still win games. 

As far as the card economy goes, I don‚Äôt see any way in which hearthstone is more generous than mtg arena. Having to dust 4 legendaries to make just one is absurd. In arena you can get packs at a similar frequency but wild cards are FAR more common than their equivalents(golden legendaries, epics, etc.). As you open enough packs you also are guaranteed to get mythic and rare wildcards from the vault.

From the very beginning of the manga and the anime they establish that food is so good it has people explode out of their clothes and the blessing is really just an exaggeration of an exaggeration.

 It's ridiculous for Azami to have others explode out of their clothes and it's cheap fan\-service but it's a defining aspect of the series \(for better or worse\). All of the Nakiri's have ridiculousness as a defining trait. The grandfather goes bare, one speaks random English when the food is good etc. 

Honestly, the hierarchy of characters in Food Wars is pretty loose. While it's established that Rindou and Tsukasa are both stronger than Soma and Erina in general the ranking of the other Elite 10 is a lot more inconsistent. Erina as the 10th Seat is able to defeat the 4th seat. The 6th seat loses twice to non seat members. 

 A lot of the characters in Food Wars are giving hype by defeating fodder or built up by the author through reputation rather than direct explicit rankings in case the series wants to be flexible over who's stronger than who.  Barring a few exceptions like Rindou and Tsukasa.

Soma admitting that he isn't as strong as Rindou, Tsukasa gives his character a direction to go towards. Rather than Soma just trying to directly take on his dad next. ",1527811335

*****
&gt; Nicaraguan bishops have announced they are abandoning peace talks with the embattled administration of Daniel Ortega after at least 11 people were killed and 79 wounded during the latest mass protest against his rule.

&gt; Carlos Alfredo Portobanco, a 26-year-old student who was among the protesters, said: &amp;quot;We feel oppressed and disrespected by a government that talks about peace but does nothing but promote violence. We don&amp;#039;t want any more dead - our mothers suffer when we leave our homes because they are not sure we will return.""

&gt; Senior members of Nicaragua&amp;#039;s Catholic church began mediating peace talks between Ortega and the student-led protesters on 16 May, with protesters using the dialogue to berate their unpopular president and their first lady, Rosario Murillo, as asesinos.

""Today MormonLeaks‚Ñ¢ releases a compilation of information connecting the Mormon Church to 13 companies who collectively owned over $32 billion of shares in the United States stock market at the end of 2017.""  

Later, in the summary, ML states the 13 companies ""appear to have ties to the Mormon Church.""

The facts are in. They are not disputable. I know reality is scary, but there have been over 19 separate indictments, over 5 guilty pleas, and dozens of more charges to come (ignoring the 70 charges Manafort is facing.)

This is a sample of 19 yr. rum from Bellevue Distillery - column Still from molasses distillate, aged in ex-bourbon and ex-cognac barrels, and bottle by Hunter Laing‚Äôs Golden Devil label for K&amp;L at 59.7% ABV. 

---

**Kill Devil ‚Äì Bellevue ‚Äì Guadeloupe ‚Äì 19 yr. ‚Äì 59.7%**

**Nose:** Bread pudding. Baking spice. Caramel. Banana. Black olives. Deep and rich. Awesome.

**Palate:** Cinnamon. Oak. Vegetal mid-palate. Fernet and cola. Molasses. Flavors move quickly.

**Finish:** Charred veggies. Background sweets and dark fruits. Roots and botanicals. Long and dynamic.

**Strengths:** Nose and finish are complex and endlessly fascinating.

**Rough Spots:** Palate is brief and thin compared to what happens with the long finish and the complex nose.

**Grade: B+**

**Final Thoughts:** The brevity on the palate is a little disappointing, but the nose and finish are really top notch. And there is still complexity on the palate to be admired.

---

**GRADING:**

**A:** Truly memorable for all the right reasons. Pours I‚Äôm gonna be craving later. I‚Äôd buy a backup at the right price.

**B+:** Hits all the right notes with one or two exceptional ones. Just missing the crave worthy component. 

**B:** Quality standard pour if priced accordingly.

**C:** Less interested. Minor flaws that start to diminish enjoyment. Situational purchase, but unlikely I‚Äôd buy a full bottle.

**D:** Major flaws. Won‚Äôt be repurchasing in any format ‚Äì single glass or bottle.

**F:** No desire to keep drinking except to confirm it‚Äôs really as bad as I thought.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","My ancestors came to this country and, along with their state, agreed to join the Union on the basis that this country would be governed according to the tenets and principles outlined in the Constitution.

We did not join together out of being conquered, some ethnic fraternity, religious hegemony, or even cultural identity. My ancestors granted the government any power it possesses, and that is my inheritance. If that contract is breached, then I owe no more allegiance to the tyrannical dictators that breached it.

Would a revolt win? I don't know. But so much of human history is filled with petty despots and horrific oppression. I was born with a taste of freedom in my lungs and liberty in my veins and I'll be damned if I will live to dishonor the sacrifices of my ancestors, and if it comes to that I'll take every weapon I can get. Better to die on your feet than live in your knees.

That being said, even if I think it's a bad idea, I would accept a legally passed amendment to the Constitution that repealed any of the bill of Rights (not just the 2nd), that's what we as Americans have agreed to after all.

For example, **if the country sinks deeply into a recession**, a depoliticized population could very easily be mobilized into thinking it's somebody else's fault: ""Why are our lives collapsing? There have to be bad guys out there doing something for things to be going so badly""-and the bad guys can be Jews, or homosexuals, or blacks, or Communists, whatever you pick.

Also there is the fact that sometimes he just says borderline retarded bullshit about topics he knows nothing about, like ""Nazism was an atheist doctrine. So was Marxism.""

It might look like you have an unusual amount of slots of a certain level, but that's exactly how it works.  You just have to remember how many sorcerer slots you have at that level, and only refresh the warlock slots on a short rest.",1527811341

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","\&gt; The point of saying it is Divine is to create and give meaning to the unknown

I kind of get what you're saying. I like to write cryptic poems and read mystery novels.

\&gt; also freeing the unknown from being a product of God, a superstitious entity. The word Divine is used, as the definition of Divine that has been created through religion is God like, not necessarily God\-superstitious entity\-, and God forming the meaning through the numerous religions being present, the meaning of just being the source of creation,

I don't really agree with this though. ""God"" and ""Divine"" are both pretty closely associated with \(at least what I'd refer to as\) superstitions. Your choice of words just makes what you're trying to say pretty unclear. It's pretty loaded language.

\&gt; so the Divine, is the source for creation of the unknowable or is the unknowable force.

What's so special about the things that are unknowable to us though? I mean it's interesting to think about, but we already have a word for it. Unknowable.

\&gt; Another point of summarising it in this way is to bring those who believe in a source of our creation together with those that believe things are out of our knowing or that nothing can be known about the nature of creation, yet both are true and expressing this with the term Divine is a way to bring the concepts together.

What do you mean ""a source of our creation""? The source of people's creations? The ""creation"" we live in, i.e. the universe? Or something else? My trouble understanding your point is because of the loaded language your using. I have to assume that by ""those who believe in a source of our creation together with those that believe things are out of our knowing or that nothing can be known about the nature of creation"" you just mean ""everyone"". Am I understanding correctly? And when you say ""believe things are out of our knowing or that nothing can be known"", in what sense are you using the word ""know""? Almost everyone believes they can know \*something\*.

\&gt; yet both are true

Both are Greek to me so far.

\&gt;  and expressing this with the term Divine is a way to bring the concepts together.

Not a very clear one.

\&gt; Not everything you encounter is created consciously, something's are created unconsciously.

I agree.

\&gt; It is not so easy for all of us to enjoy the beauty when we see eye to eye with all views, but feel that there can be a more interconnected relationship between them or can sense that there can be a definition created to bring them all together into one simplified meaning.

The problems in the world that prevent us from enjoying its beauty and the conflicts that drive people run a lot deeper than the choice of words we use to describe our beliefs. People have deep disagreementa about a lot of things, and like I said, the words you've chosen are really loaded. I think they would cause a lot of misunderstandings and maybe even more conflict.

\&gt; If we also choose to accept that things can be consciously created...

I don't think anyone would deny that.

\&gt; ... we will come to want to focus our conscious attention towards thoughts of a positively influencing manner on the creation of what happens in reality

That's not exactly ""loaded"" language, but it's pretty vague. People are bound to disagree on how to interpret this. ""Positively influencing"" means a lot of different conflicting things to different people.

\&gt; you just enjoying the beauty of life is already contributing to this, but your thoughts could be focused towards solutions in uniting the people and solving worldly issues as these are creations of consciously focused attention, that gain more power in masses.

Uniting masses behind a cause is easier said than done, but I'm not even sure it's necessary, and maybe it's ok if everyone has their own causes and supports the ones they care about. ""Unity"" is overrated.",1527811343

Yes he got 4/9 votes each time, but the mistakes were so glaringly obvious and, especially after losing BB18 he should've corrected them.

2. Vanessa was one comp away from winning bb17, a season which she dominated far more on her rookie season than Paul dominated bb18 during his rookie season.

3. Paul played the most dominant game ever on BB19, but it was against the worst cast ever. Against that cast, I think there are a ton of players including Vanessa who could've crushed it and won, which Paul was unable to do. ",1527811344

"puppy101","t5_2rw7o","&gt; My trainer's GSD was terrified of black garbage bags when she was a puppy, and it took months of positive reinforcement to get her to be okay with them. She ripped through crates, door frames and walls and was an all-around terror. She was afraid of pieces of garbage flying by in the wind while on walks. And now at 2 her pup is a Canine Good Citizen, advanced obedience trained, protection/police trained, and is an incredible, well-adjusted, mature dog.

Now imagine if this dog had belonged to an average person (like OP), not a trainer. It's highly unlikely that she would have grown up into a stable, confident dog. Most people do not have the time, aptitude or knowledge to do this much counterconditioning and training, and I think it's unfair to use this as a comparison.

&gt; There would have been no way to tell how social or unsocial your puppy was going to be from the rescue

I also disagree with this statement. While some puppies that show anxiety in a shelter situation turn out to be confident dogs once they are in a home situation, it's pretty clear when you see a well-balanced puppy at a shelter. The rescue should have erred on the side of caution since OP clearly and strongly stated their desire for a highly-social puppy.",1527811348

[Here's the original thread](https://dm.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/8n9vth/anime_has_changed)",1527811348
"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","IIRC the full circle represents the percentage shown.  
  
So for instance the Legendary Banner has 8% chance that one of the twelve units will appear in the circle.  
So the odds of one specific unit being somewhere in the circle is 8% * 1 / 12 = **0.667%**  
  
(Then there is the chance that any Red Legendary appears at 8% * 3 / 12 = **2%** of the time)  
  
---  
  
On a regular banner you have 3% chance that one of the banner units are the focus.  
  
I believe you were using an example of 3 units (Y!Tiki, Linde, Merric for example); which would be 3% * 1 / 3 = 1% chance at Y!Tiki.  
  
Then I believe Zekdawg was going with the common assumption that actually there will be 4 units on the banner (A!Tiki as well).  This would make their example 3% * 1 / 4 = 0.75% chance at Y!Tiki.  
  
Of course, Zekdawg's answer was a bit incomplete, because there's also the 3% non-focus chance.  
There are 74 current units in the 5-star Pool if I'm not mistaken.  So the odds of pulling Y!Tiki from the pool of 5-star units would be 3% * 1 / 74 = 0.040541%  
When you add that to the 0.75% we got earlier from the assumed 4-unit banner, we get a grand total of **0.790541%** that Y!Tiki resides in one of the 5 orbs in a regular, 4-person banner's summoning session.  
  
(Or the chance of getting an S+ ~ A+ tier unit, or red 5-star unit with good fodder hovers around 3% * 23 units / 76 units [+A!Tiki and Merric to pool] = 0.908%.  Added to the 0.75% = **1.658%** chance at Y!Tiki or another good 5* Exclusive Unit/Fodder)  
  
---  
  
So yes, it's better odds of sniping only the character Y!Tiki from a non-legendary banner.   18.6% (0.790541/0.667) greater chance to be more mathematical about it.  
  
However, if you are considering the fact that you could also get Sigurd (Close Defense Fodder) or the new unit L!Ryoma as well in the Legendary Banner.  You have a 20% greater chance at scoring a decent unit/fodder (2/1.658) compared to the New Power Banner.  
  
Of course; many people's definition of a good red unit or fodder may differ.  
Another factor is the pity breaker going up the more you pull without getting pity broken by something.  But still, it should be roughly like that.  
  
So TL:DR;  Only Sniping Y!Tiki?  Look to save only for a non-legendary banner with her on it.  
But trying to get Y!Tiki or pity broken by good units?  Legendary Banners are just fine.",1527811348

It is definitely useful, so if you want to try again, there's a good tip :) ",1527811350

"bladeandsoul","t5_2skd6","Okay look here is the big difference between p2w and pay to progress using Vindictus as an example, a game that had and honestly still probably has the best action gameplay on the market. Note to take: Vindictus is dead due to its p2w nature. P2W means you spend money and you win, its in the name lul, it basically suggests that you can get an advantage that a free to play player could not. This is evident in Vindictus - RNG upgrades from +8 and further with max being +15, item gets destroyed on failure, but hey, you can buy an item shop rune to avoid destruction for only 9.99$! Also, make sure you're the first one to get that +15 item that gives much, much greater stats than let's say a +12 weapon, because if you are the one doing the most boss damage, you get extra drop! Well ain't that handy. Don't forget to also buy item shop only costumes which give extra stats to your character while you're at it!

Now compare it to Blade and Soul. Sure, you can spend a million Euro on trove if you're Bill Gates and basically get full gear in no time, but the key point to it is - if you choose not to, you are not going to be ahead of someone who farmed it with time, and are not going to benefit from it in any way, except for feeling good about yourself and I guess 6v6, which well I agree is an argument towards BNS being P2W, but c'mon now people, there is so much more to do in the game than 6v6, which quite honestly doesn't give that good of rewards if you compare it to the time spend in it, which you could use to farm Naksun or SSP for those precious moonstones.

Basically what I am trying to say, quit complaining so much about the game being P2W when clearly only 1 small end-game aspect of it is P2W. You do not get anything extra for being the best in your party, you cannot get any sort of stat boost that a free to play player could not get by grind and if we really get into it, people who spend these giant amounts of money are the ones enabling us to play the game for free, instead of paying subscription money like in the Korean servers.

Thats just a bit of a rant from me I guess, Im no whale and my mediocre equipment vouches for that, but Im just tired of these ""BNS is P2W"" posts when I honestly don't see any game in the market at the moment which comes as close to being equalized between free to play players and P2W players.",1527811351

&gt;It was an argument on fewer people watching the classics and how classics can't be a thing anymore cuz there is so much anime that everyone jumps to the new thing once the old one is done  

So it kinda joins what Gigguk says in his video. There's definitely a seasonal watching mentality in the anime community nowadays, and new anime gets forgotten pretty quickly.

Besides mechanical skill, positioning and game sense is VERY important with Ana since your surviability depends on it. It's been a little while since I started watching ML7, a Top 500 Ana main who is very educational and a nice guy. He has a Yotube channel where he teaches you how to throw cheeky anit\-nades, does vod reviews and uploads gameplay. In addition, which is even more important, he has positioning guides for Ana on different maps on his twitch channel which helped me a lot to improve my Ana. 

I have 400 hours on Ana now and reached mid\-Diamond this season, started from low Gold three seasons ago.

And the ending is super climactic. Loved seeing Two-Face, Penguin, and Mr. Freeze. The gritty, realistic rendering made them look great. 

However, Asylum has the edge in atmosphere, I think. A few parts creeped me out and a couple made me legitimately spooked. The Scarecrow nightmare scenes were super effective.

It's important to note how it got to such a point where it's even quite a success overseas, and in online streaming platforms. No other anime production has ever gotten to that scale before, and it's hard to forget the highest grossing film in Japan. 

Kimi No Na Wa doesn't have to influence works within it's own decade to be influential, it can have an impact on the next one. Gundam didn't have any impact the very same decade it came out, because it came out at the end of it. We'll only begin to see truly Kimi No Na Wa inspired works by the next decade because nearly all of the anime airing right now had already been scheduled, entered planning and even production before it made it's mark.

I agree it's complicated, that's why we're discussing it and in the end why we'll have to wait and see if it really does end up having a genuine impact.",1527811359

We drafted that constantly and ended up building a second powered cube around Frontier. It‚Äôs m15 forward and has quite a few different deck types to draft around and has been an absolute blast. The majority of our bulk is as in m13 forward anyway so I only needed to grab a few singles. We basically took a lot of the Metagame decks and stuffed the cube with seed singles from those to give it that feel and then added some other fun decks we enjoyed drafting. Like Naya dinosaurs, grixis pirates, bw vampires and zombies. We are still tweaking trying to get the best environment we can but we love it and pretty much draft 3 times a week so it‚Äôs been the best thing we‚Äôve built. 

Whatever you do end up building. Build something you enjoy!

Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.

For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do‚Äîliving in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you. But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.

[Here](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/kathleen-kennedy-quotes-yoda-dishes-star-wars-at-archer-film-festival-998045) is Hollywood Reporter's accounting of it, notably the last paragraph is this:

&gt;""There are literally hundreds of people working in areas throughout production, marketing, visual effects and post production, and still, the majority of those jobs are held by men. These are all jobs that women can do, they just need to be given the chance. That means that unions, studios, producers, directors and other women in positions of power and responsibility need to make the effort. So, do, or do not. There is no try. The force is female.""

"pearlsjewelry","t5_3g5mf","This pearl is characterized by the ability to brightly shimmer in the sunlight, as well as an unusual ""metallic"" coloration, uncharacteristic for other varieties of sea pearls. It is believed that the pearl of Tahiti is often ""black"", which is why its second name ""black pearl"" appeared, although in fact it is gray with more or less light shades. In addition, there are pearls of this variety with a completely untypical coloring: for example, blue (paecock), eggplant, green, olive green, blue and even red (magenta). The most valuable, and therefore expensive, are iridescent blue and cobalt blue.

Every black pearl is a beautiful work of nature. Neither of them never repeats his girlfriend in the form and subtle color shades. That's why it's extremely difficult to create a necklace of black pearls. Thousands and thousands of pearls will be touched by a master in their fingers before creating a unique necklace, learn more on peals at [pearl necklace]( https://pearltradition.com ) blog and latest news. After all, the requirements are serious - every pearl in such a necklace should have only a round shape, and also be at least 12 mm in diameter and, of course, ideally match the color of its neighbors on a thread. Such a necklace, at times, is worth a fortune. Because it's collected for years. After all, not every master will be lucky to create such a miracle. Too little nature creates perfect black pearls. Sometimes there are not enough similar black balls on the earrings.

Personally, I don't think fashion and architecture are at all analogous. Did you look up brutalism yet? It's been captured here. This design is intentional and seamlessly executed. Thus, beauty and in it's own right, rather amazing. 

The intention is not about pleasing subjective aesthetic taste. It's about executing brutalist architecture with a rustic inspiration. It's next level shit man and that is what makes it wonderful regardless of anyone's taste. 

You're entitled to your subjective opinion. That doesn't make this structure any less of a self standing piece of art. 

For the record. I'm gonna go ahead and say that roughly 99% of brutalist aficionados work with concrete in some manner. So we see a whole different world of beauty in it. In that right, we may be biased. 

To sum, it's not about your opinion. It's about making a statement. The fact that we've had a rather nice and lengthy conversation about it lays claim to this space being great. I respect your tastes though. ",1527811364

"Rainbow6","t5_2t1bl","I entered a casual match just yesterday, it was 2-0 when I joined in and my team was apparently a 4 stack of squeakers. Now, they were all talking, breathing, and coughing into their mics, and when talking, they were using a foreign language which I knew how to speak but they didn't think I understand.


So anyway the round goes on and I get a 4k, they start talking about kicking me, they can't because it's match point, so they start talking about tk'ing instead, but one of them convinces them not to because he says I might help them win.


So the match result became 2-2, overtime matchpoint now, one of them injured someone and then died afterwards, I killed the injured guy and the other guy who was in the room. The kid kept screaming into his mic in broken english that I shouldn't have killed the guy and should have waited for him to bleed out so that he gets the kill he deserves or whatever the fuck was going through his mind, then he tells his friends to tk me, which they do. They lost.

There'd be a kid's b-day party and one parent would look at the label of a bottle of juice and say ""oh, you must not care what your kid eats"" and the other parent is like ""what's wrong with corn syrup?"" and the first parent doesn't know. And then they'd be like ""HFCS is nutritionally the same as sugar, and like sugar, it's fine in moderation.""

There are two really big problems with those ads:

1. HFCS is NOT nutritionally the same as sugar. Fructose metabolism is not regulated by blood sugar levels the way glucose metabolism is. The consequences of that are not yet completely understood, but saying they're nutritionally the same is a LIE.

2. The only way to consume HFCS in healthy moderation is to avoid it as much as possible and only consume it when there is no HFCS-free version of the food you want to eat. Next time you're at the store, try only buying HFCS-free foods. I'm sure you're thinking, ""well duh, just don't buy any soda or candy."" Try hamburger/hotdog buns. Try cookies. Try protein bars. Anyone who isn't *trying* to avoid carbs or HFCS is eating way too much HFCS.

That is exactly the kind of propaganda the sugar industry was putting out before 10 years ago or so. The sugar industry paid for the research that claimed that high fat diets cause heart disease and sugar is innocent, and paid to spread that conclusion around for decades. It was a lie (or, if you're feeling generous, a half-truth). Maybe you're too young to remember when most of the candy in the grocery store *didn't* have ""fat-free"" or ""low-fat"" on the label, before there was a ""low-fat"" version of every kind of chip, cookie, and cracker?

"KansasCityChiefs","t5_2s3ft","I mean probably but like from all we have heard is that he is basically a QB with massive potential, with scheme/footwork issues that came into possibly the best situation in the league to sit behind. Alex was a fucking wonderful mentor, regardless of what happened in the playoffs. We owe Alex a huge deal of thanks for how he handled the situation, and essentially had his best year ever just to be traded. Look at Roethlisberger, look at how bad he is treating Rudolph essentially because Ben is selfish.

We haven't drafted a QB in the 1st round since Blackledge. The one we got is a super talented gunslinger coming to a team that went 10-6. We essentially are going to go BALLS DEEP the next 3 years while we are on his contract and hope he works out. That's what the Seahawks did and it gave them a Superbowl, it's essentially what the Eagles did with Wentz too, and the Ravens with Flacco.

If your QB is on a rookie contract and he essentially becomes a top 12 QB in the league, you have enough money to throw around that you should be vying for a Superbowl. We need to surround him with defensive talent and play makers on the offense, and we sort of already have that. That's where a lot of the hype is, because if Mahomes even is half of what we have hyped him to be, then we are in excellent position for a deep playoff run, because we will have extra money to throw around.

*****
&gt; Donald Trump doesn&amp;#039;t like the Western alliance  for reasons that we must leave to future historians  and Thursday, he took a big step toward wrecking it by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

&gt; The European Union was forged out of the earlier European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community, which ended a millennium of intra-European war and which was only possible because American military power and American economic aid created the safe space that allowed Europe to heal and then flourish after the Second World War.

&gt; The World Trade Organization is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which, along with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, grew out of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement in which the United States and Britain convinced the allied nations to lower tariffs and promote global trade, based on the American dollar as the world reserve currency.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","You are not addressing the market for big men. It is not there, and there are few teams with cap space in a given summer. It's not impossible for this situation to exacerbate as time goes on with some of the $200 million dollar contracts that will be hitting their 3rd season. That is why Love doesn't stand to make more by opting out and re-signing for more guaranteed over the long term. You are assuming that there will be enough teams with cap space and it is not going to be the case, especially not for big men. Look at all the big men who got big deals recently:

Paul Millsap: 3 yrs/90 million at 32 years old. He missed half the year, and had his worst statistical season since he's become a starter in the league. 

Blake Griffin: 5 yrs/ 171 million at 28 years old. Got traded 6 months after getting paid. Detroit went all-in to make the playoffs. Missed the playoffs. Coach got fired. Many have doomed Detroit to mediocrity the next few seasons.

Dwight Howard: 3 yrs/70 million at 30 years old. He's regarded as just one of the many bad contracts on Charlotte, another team doomed to mediocrity.

Teams have learned their lesson. These are not slouches either, these are are former all-stars and all-nba guys too. With these and many other similar contracts as hindsight, nobody is going to take a chance on Kevin Love with his extensive injury history, not unless the cap makes an unexpected spike. Kevin will definitely be better suited to take the 28 million in 2019-2020 and then take what he can get in FA in 2020. Best offer could still come from the Cavs. ",1527811366

Armors are very odd, there are the oddly fast ones Amelia, Draug, BK, that can reach up to 40-50 spd and the exceptionally slow ones Hector, LA!Hector, W!Tharja at around 20ish spd rarely ever getting investment into their spd. Theres also the not very fast F2P armors(Gwendolyn, Sheena) which can be run with a spd superboon (up to around 29 on a unmerged spd boon I think) they can reach mediocre speeds 30-40s enough to not be doubled easily. Then theres the speedy infantry Ayra, Nino, and Mia. fully merged Ayra has about 47 with slaying spd refinement and spd boon. Add a spd tactic and a single spd blessing makes it reach a easy 56 spd. Mia with that same setup can reach up to 59. Don't try to outspeed these creatures, just give up and use WF.

It seems to me the biggest issue is that reddit's subreddit-styles aren't easy to collaborate on and import/export/tweak. We've talked about having a 'skins' system (think Winamp) that allows people to easily find, use, and contribute to various styles. That should make it all a lot easier. None of this is actually *built* yet so it's an evolving discussion.

As for mod permissions, having talked to /r/science about their needs, it's clear we're going to need to have a rather unprecedented level of granularity by the time the system is mature. Styles would be one part of those permissions.",1527811369

My DPS heroes do more damage with Sonia amping than with Aselica's buffs. Furthermore, you also have to take into consideration that Aselica's buffs can be dispelled and Aselica herself only deals a fraction of the DPS that Sonia is capable of which further lowers the team's DPS potential.

Shea is also completely useless when she gets interrupted. Not only does one of her abilities go on a 20 sec+ cooldown, but she doesn't gain a trance stack. Also, BD 75+ flying breath still one shots squishy heroes with the damage reduction from S1.

I've tested my T5 Shea vs my T5 Frey. I initially thought Shea would raise my team's DPS higher than Frey, but that was not the case. Not only do my teams have much better sustainability with Frey healing, but the DPS is higher as well. 

Frey's S2 Dark allows her shield to not only provide CC immunity for her team, block 600k+ damage, and boost healing by 50%, but also provide a 20% damage boost with only 3 sec downtime assuming the shield doesn't get broken. Combine her T4 Dark with Inner Peace, and Frey is also constantly providing the team 5% of her attack as a buff.

I agree they are a few buffs away from being really good, but there are better heroes to fill their positions as of now.",1527811369

''Before the Nazi Party was founded, a strong youth movement already existed in Germany. It began in the 1890s and was known as the Wanderv√∂gel, a male-only movement featuring a back-to-nature theme.

Wanderv√∂gel members had an idealistic, romantic notion of the past, yearning for simpler days when people lived off the land. They rejected the modern, big city era and took a dim view of its predecessor, the industrial revolution, which had been started by their fathers and grandfathers. They scorned greed and materialism, and the new emerging corporate mentality. They found strict German schooling oppressive and rejected parental authority. They saw hypocrisy in politics and the rigid social class system of Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany, based entirely on birth and wealth. ''

(I don't even remember what AQ stood for, but it was the insect raid/dungeon).

Or this article

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html

I mean southerners were pretty racist for a long time, but depending on what statistics you're looking at, ""race"" might not be the magic bullet that won the republicans the south. Instead it may actually reflect southern voters who really liked money more then they liked the KKK. For instance Congress didn't switch to republicans in the south until the nineties, which is a long time for the civil rights act to have any impact.

Also on a lessernote, Barry Goldwater did support not passing the civil rights act, but he was also the same dude who supported abortion, openly opposed the harassment of homosexuals, and really distrusted the rise of the religious right.

I'm more inclined to believe that Goldwater wasn't a racist, he just didn't like the government dictating what people could do with their spare time for better or worse. I also can't imagine that the south openly embraced Goldwater that much when he did stuff like threaten to sell the Tennessee Valley Authority, a prominent federally owned power company that came out of the New Deal. Something that actually caused him to lose tennessee.

My closest experience to that was my extreme food neophobia. I was so scared of trying new foods that I was mostly fed with baby food until 22 y.o., when I left my mother's house - and one specific one which only she had the recipe. And just as you, she didn't think that this behavior warranted some kind of therapy... 

Rather, she used that phobia against me all the time. I heard several times that, if I moved, I would die because I would be unable to feed myself. 

Somehow, I managed to overcome my phobia slightly at least for some few stuff when I left my NMom's house - just enough for surviving. Even so, I lost almost 20 lbs and only ate when I was literally starving.

Then I decided to start therapy and my psychologist pointed how my relationship with food ressembled that of a baby.

Anyway, I still has this phobia, but it's quite weak by now. I can eat almost everything, but I still feel a lot of anxiety when trying new things.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","I agree that the cop definitely was too eager to take her down.

The cop was within the law to arrest her. And was there a reason why she got hit? Absolutely. Did he have to UFC her ass in process? Probably not.

This is different than the sovereign citizen guy. He was calm, sure, but his license plate (which turned out to be homemade) came back as registered to a very similar car and an owner with a CCW permit. So you have a calm guy, with a potential firearm, didn't give his info to some fairly polite officers that so they can just ticket him for the traffic violation and everyone can go on their way. Still doesn't give info, gets told he'll be arrested, still doesn't give info. So they called a K9 unit in to be able to safely arrest the guy which results in the guy getting bit by the doggy.

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","I've quoted this before, but it's relevant and shows the pervasive nature of the Garden of Eden myth:

&gt; Spiritual awakening [even in a secular sense] is the process of recognizing our essential goodness, our natural wisdom and compassion.

&gt; In stark contrast to this trust in our inherent worth, **our culture's guiding myth is the story of Adam and Eve's exile** from the Garden of Eden. **We may forget its power because it seems so worn and familiar, but this story shapes and reflects the deep psyche of the West.** The message of ""original sin"" is unequivocal: Because of our basically flawed nature, we do not deserve to be happy, loved by others, at ease with life.

#

&gt; By teaching us that something is fundamentally wrong with us, our parents and culture carry forth the message of Eden. As we internalize this view of our nature, we become ensnared in the trance of unworthiness. We can spend years and decades of our life trying to be who they wanted us to be, trying to be good enough to reenter the garden.

Doesn't cover any mod, just how they work. tl;dr 3v enters a transformer, exits at a few hundred to 1500V, and charges a capacitor, and one lead of the capacitor is wired to the 'live' part of the grid (middle of the sandwich panels), the other panels to battery negative, and the black flies bridge that gap. The voltage coming to the capacitor is fixed due to the transformer coil (and that's alright, given that bug wings will already trigger it just fine), but you can upgrade its capacity for a higher-amp shock. Write down the capacity and voltage and type of cap in your racquet, find one that matches (or a bit over) the voltage and type, and has whatever capacity increase you wanna try. It ends up as a trade-off, it'll take a proportionally longer amount of time to charge the main capacitor, your hose has the same flow, but your bucket size multiplies. Haven't timed the recharge time on mine, but until the batteries start getting weaker it's about one blackfly a second with a full-power 'pop'. I'm strongly leaning to doubling/tripling the capacity of the weaker racquet's cap, just to see how it compares in power to the better one.

You can upgrade the batteries and the circuit will multiply up the voltage, but the parts are made for 3v and will wear out faster much above that, but I've seen 9v battery mods that probably have enough voltage to arc through the air between the panels like a taser, but it may pop the now-underrated transistor feeding the coil and leave you with a dead racquet sooner than anticipated.

Really, the racquets, capacitors, etc. are all cheap enough just to mess with and not worry too much about breaking.

Also as per usual with caps, do make sure they are discharged with something insulated from your fingers before you start poking at it, they still hold power after the buttons are off and battery is out.",1527811377

People are capable of change, but it's improbable that they will experience change without existential motivation to do so.  That's why young liberals become old conservatives.  Once you have a family and assets you become keenly aware of why it's important to protect both of those things.  When all you own is an iPhone and a $100k excuse for an education, you don't see why the evil, greedy old people are so insensitive to the needs of the world.

If you're going to try to tell me that someone experienced a change of heart and mind without a significant change in lifestyle, association and circumstance, I'll put money down that what you're seeing is pragmatism.

 Shields are a joke right now, this shield system makes the best fix for it to simply remove shields from the game. With no shields it is more simple to understand, we keep the new power and have the ship overheating when reactor is down, then calculate the damage tolerance on the volume of the ship, not amount of blocks. This would force players to have empty rooms that might as well be decorated = interior. Layers of armour would then be traded of damage tolerance, and thus optional and working but would remove filling of rooms with blocks behaviour.

""Something I wanted to add - it's interesting to see how Survivor developed over the years and what it later turned into, because I guarantee that the goal of the show in 2000 was not the same goal that it has now in 2018. 

I don't know if people remember that Mark Burnett (the producer) had an earlier show before he did Survivor. It was an adventure racing show called Eco-Challenge. It was basically where teams of people challenged themselves against nature and against the elements as they tried to finish the world's most difficult race. When Survivor first came out in 2000 it was MUCH closer to Eco Challenge than it is to the show that everyone knows today. That first season was also a struggle against the elements, and a chance to test yourself against nature to see what you're made of, and how strong you really are. In fact I love pointing out that the main sponsor of that first season of Survivor was the United States Army. Because THAT was the prime demographic for the first season of Survivor: Soldiers, survivalists, adventure racers, basically just all around badasses. That was what Survivor originally started out as. But it sure hasn't been that type of show for a while.""",1527811381

"politics","t5_2cneq","No attempted collusion? Are you kidding? What does it mean ""they got no info""? You are taking their word for it? Does intent mean anything to you? So we know about that meeting. What else happened that we don't know? It is absurd how easy you are dropping that as a potential problem, let alone all the other stuff. Attempted murder is still a crime. People don't walk because they failed to kill someone. ""Sorry guys, I wanted to shoot you, but my gun jammed so we cool, right? Nothing bad happened, right? It's not like I blew your brains out, or anything. Let's grab a beer."" Come on, even kindergarten kids know better than that.

And ok, so let's say there was no collusion. Then what is the problem with just letting the investigation do its thing? Why complain and threaten and obstruct?  According to you guys, trump is perfect, clean, wholesome, never said a lie, never hurt a fly.  What can go wrong? The truth can't be hidden, you guys are watching like hawks, right? You have all three branches' names and numbers, what's the problem? Don't you want that sweet redemption of truth , so you can rub it into our faces until clouds turn into rocks? Or you are not so sure, very deep down and that's why yiu don't want to really know?

And please note that I did not once defer to whataboutism. The things you are taking for granted because trump, or one of his gang said them are absurd.  But, you know that would never and has never worked for anyone on the opposite side to you.

Anyway, we have a disagreement. I tried to use facts, you are dismissing them. I allowed for possibilty that things may be different, you are throwing all caution to the wind.

"networking","t5_2qkaf","&gt; How do I arrive at this absolutely 100% data-driven conclusion: ""yep, that 1Gb link really needs to be 10Gb, because I can see X and Y and Z, therefore give me $money.""

You don't come to this conclusion 100% in a data driven way because interconnected distributed systems often don't have the visibility in every step of the process to give you data so you can plot said data on a graph and show trending. Network devices are generally pretty good about providing you data with some things, but not in other things. But more to your point, what you're going to have to ask is the ""what"" before the ""why"". In this case, what is the baseline requirement? What is the customer trying/wanting to do?

&gt; I actually care more about proving the ""why"" to myself more than anything. Sure, the client will just trust me and probably just cut a PO when I ask. But I want to understand why that is absolutely the correct thing to do, based on hard data, not just some hunch.

This is good, I like this approach and I like your gumption.

However this again comes back to the ""what."" You must answer the ""what"" before you can answer the ""why."" Are they a retail business with 100 remote offices and each remote office has 10 POS machines that need to do ordering/purchasing? Need to build a datacenter that can interface all the POS data from said machines? Need to provide multicast to all those branch offices so the inventory management system can keep the POS system in sync with ordering so that empty inventory isn't ordered? 

Again, first you need to find the ""what."" Then later comes the ""why.""

In the above example, you probably don't need much bandwidth/latency/jitter requirements. You can probably make due with shit tons of IPSEC/GRE tunnels and IGP/BGP running across them. But start tacking on multicast, or real time interaction traffic, or video/voice, or machine learning.....then you'll have far far different requirements.",1527811382

A few family members on my mom‚Äôs side have bipolar (grandpa, uncle, cousin, and I strongly suspect my brother is undiagnosed bipolar).

&gt; In the Pentagon‚Äôs response to Kaine, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy David Trachtenberg asserted that the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Al Qaeda and the 2002 AUMF green lighting the war in Iraq continued to give the Executive branch the authority to fight ISIS in both countries.

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/why-are-u-s-troops-staying-in-syria-trump-admin-wont-say.html

This article is related to the Trump administration but the US under Obama used the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Al Qaeda from 2001 already as a legal ground to be in Syria.

edit: downvoting facts, must be /r/scw

&gt; President Barack Obama‚Äôs plans to ramp up U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Iraq and potentially launch new ones inside Syria rely on a thirteen-year-old law authorizing military force against al Qaeda and its affiliates that he has publicly stated he would like to see repealed.

Take your point about the kettle, especially since the kettles on sale here tend to be a tad more powerful, I'm told, than the ones sold in other countries. 

The Guardian isn't actually snobby - just up to broadsheet newspaper standards of having actual news values and requiring a reading age of more than 12. And in 2002 (?) when your story is set, not actually that lefty either. Between the Thatcher years and five years of Tony Blair, the Overton Window in the UK is not where it was when I was a kid, and the Guardian was, as I recall, pretty solidly Blairite at the time. Which is to say, about as left wing as the parliamentary\* tory party ca. 1975. 

As to what *should* be there in that pub, if it's a proper local pub it has been there at least several decades \*\* and will have acquired all sorts of clutter. Chain pubs buy generically ""old"" stuff up, apparently by the hundredweight and scatter it about, but the genuine article will have photos of regulars from years gone by, souvenirs brought back from foreign wars, stuff relevant to whatever the local industry is - in Butetown, the docks, which will add to the exotic souvenir count and bits of local history all over the walls. 

Also likely: the pub's various sports team trophy hauls. Darts, five-a-side football, rugby, pool, maybe ten-pin bowling. Some of these will be seriously old, and occasionally for sports long out of fashion. Framed news clippings of long-dead regulars winning medals or breaking records or otherwise distinguishing themselves. Service souvenirs of previous owners who'd been in the forces - pub landlord used to be a popular second career for retired NCOs, and the reason so many pubs are named after famous generals.

There will also be at least one of:

* an offensively noisy one-armed bandit (when it's playing, they just quietly flash their lights if nobody's losing money on the thing)
* a jukebox if they get a younger or rowdier crowd in, or
* a quiz machine

and a ratty-looking cigarette vending machine, they hadn't quite disappeared yet.

There's almost certainly a dartboard there too, but Harry might not have noticed that the first time he went in, or it might be in the back bar. 

Oh, and a poster up somewhere informing patrons what night the quiz night is. Nearly every pub has one. Less common are open-mic nights, local bands (although generally one or two pubs in an are will specialise in this and the others won't bother) and karaoke. Which is always good for a laugh.

\* You have to make this distinction. Some of the constituency conservative parties are politically somewhere to the right of Louis XIV. 

\*\* In some cases, centuries. The oldest pub I could reasonably call a local opened in 1616.",1527811384

You're far from cali so doesnt make a huge difference if east coast vs midwest. Rankings are fairly similar, both well respected. 
Cost - 400k Tufts vs 300k SLU. This difference is big, with loans it will double to 200k by the time you actually pay it off. Thats about a year salary if you do clinical medicine. 


Degrees - Extra help when applying residency, not a ton but its not negligible.


At this point, genuinely try to see where you would be happier. See what curriculum is better for you and who matches better in california (*this can be skewed by the number of californians in each class) but if one school barely sends anyone out there for a few years in a row, itll be harder to get interviews without making a huge effort (away rotations ect). Being happy for 4 years, with classmates you can relate to/mesh well with, and an administration that cares about you will make a HUGE difference. 

Lastly, when does each school take Step 1? Some have moved to taking it after 3rd year and there is was a paper recently showing a 10point increase in step scores based on taking after 2nd yr or 3rd yr. Thats not nothing. If your absolute goal is to return to california, a solid step 1 score will make a world of difference ",1527811384

Wikipedia says they were supposed to be analogs for LA street gangs, but none of that came through at all.  They don't act like gangsters, they seem like analogs for tribes in parts of Central or SE Asia, or areas of Africa, where conflict is rife and economic development minimal.  There's no flashiness like you see with gangs, no satire of how their culture is (or was at the time) glamorized by pop culture opportunists who don't have to suffer its consequences, etc.

The writers apparently didn't know WTH they were talking about if that was their intended subject, which would explain why it seemed incoherent.

And they didn't even properly explore what they *did* show: A culture of bitterly selfish egoists lacking even the redemptive feature of aesthetics (as with Klingons) or diabolical logic (Cardassians, Romulans, Ferengi, Borg, etc.) in their corrupt pursuits.  Such societies will obviously exist, but why make them a *subject*, let alone a multi-season main antagonist?

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsnapchat).

**Bethesda Softworks**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks

&gt; Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 as a division of Media Technology Limited, and in 1999 became a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media. In its first fifteen years, it was a video game developer and self-published its titles. In 2001, Bethesda spun off its own in-house development team into Bethesda Game Studios, and Bethesda Softworks became a publisher only. It currently also publishes games by ZeniMax Online Studios, id Software, Arkane Studios, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks and Bethesda Game Studios Austin.

**Bethesda Game Studios**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios

&gt; Bethesda Game Studios is an American video game developer, acting as in-house development team for parent company Bethesda Softworks, established in 2001. Previously synonymous with its parent publisher, the studio's name and logo were established with the release of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in 2002. The studio is led by executive producer Todd Howard. A second studio, Bethesda Game Studios Montreal, was opened in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, followed by a third studio in Austin, Texas.

They are different entities. Bethesda Game Studios didn't want to fall into a Fallout/Elder Scrolls cycle, and they haven't.  Bethesda Softworks published a ZeniMax Online developed game.

""There's no rule that says that a Retriever can't play basketball.""

Maryland makes a swift comeback and wins with a buzzer beater. Tony Bennett steps down as coach and becomes a Ralph Lauren suit model.

Anxiety: too scared of social failure so you won't give yourself a chance of failure (obviously this goes from not wanting to talk about your cock size to not even being able to talk with a taller person; I know bad examples). There are so many different sorts of anxiety, so I won't dive deeper into that. 2. Not wanting this type of social contact with the particular person because you simply don't like the topic or person. But these are just the 2 main reasons imo. I did not try to attack you with this, so I said whatever reason. I did not try to tell you, you have some social disorder (even anxiety is not a disorder at all; pretty normal actually; only becomes a problem at certain degrees).

No, figure it out. Cholomite pointed out where you were deering when he quoted you. Your first sentence here was a qualifier, start there. Read the article. Examine your behaviors and recent interactions with your woman. 

&gt; I've taken the mantra of never buying on approaches/dates into this LTR and I guess it's too much push. That would seem obvious.

It isn't about the money or pushing, its about presentation and her perception of you.

&gt; That'll be the fucking day. I'm here because I'm fairly confident in my belief that women are mostly a reflection of their man's behavior.

Hopefully you really believe it and I agree. Barring some weird ladies, most of them respond very similarly to a lot of the tools here. AWALT exists for a reason.

Then you get stabbed and die. 

Maybe your mom was a narcissist and you are too, maybe you were molested, I dont know I dont care but the point I am illustrating to you is that it pays to examine yourself emotionally because you can live your whole life as a miserable unhappy prick while convincing yourself everyone else is wrong.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; You ""know"" that your wife loves you, as I do with mine, because I have evidence to support that conclusion

That depends what you mean by know. I certainly have strong evidence to support that hypothesis and it appears to stand up to all attempts to examine it. For all pragmatic purposes I agree I ""know"" this. I agree that a belief which is well supported by strong evidence can be close enough to true knowledge that it makes sense to say we ""know"" it. But in reality its still just a belief supported by evidence, not something we can empirically test.

&gt; And I could, if I wanted, subject her to an fMRI scan and it would prove that she loves me based on her brain imaging

Depending what we mean by love yes this is a potential way to empirically test it. BUT, is it irrational to continue to believe it without this empirical test? I don't think it is. I think its rational to believe it because there is sufficient evidence to support the belief, even though we don't KNOW it in the empirical sense. As such I think its possible to rationally believe something without believing you empirically know it. But again that goes back to what we mean when we say we know something.

&gt; So I'd conclude that a claim of knowledge, based both on objective evidence and potential proof, is acceptable

I agree. I'm really just looking at the hypothetical semantic argument here about whether its possible to have rational belief without truly empirical knowledge about something.

&gt; someone who claims they know that unicorns are real, they do not have anything to back that up

True. But this is getting into a more specific argument about the type of claim. I'm really not arguing whether or not certain beliefs are irrational due to the lack of any real substantial evidence. Rather I was just pointing out that I think its *possible* to have rational belief absent a belief that one ""knows"" that thing (depending what one means when they say they don't ""know"" it).

Claiming one believes something for which they have absolutely no real tangible evidence, such as actions, behaviors, and statements to support a claim of love, is a different story altogether. In that case I don't think it makes sense to say one ""knows"" that claim is true using ANY definition of ""know"". So in context I'd agree its irrational to believe something which you have absolutely no real evidence of. In that context I would say the answer to OP's question is yes, its definitely irrational to believe something without also believing you know it. But further, I would say its irrational to believe something without also knowing it (not just ""believing that you know it"" which as you point out a person can ""believe they know"" something which they absolutely do not ""know"" in any sense of the word)",1527811390

It just made for good PR to say that ‚Äúthe guy who wrote the prequels isn‚Äôt in charge anymore‚Äù but if you think for the second that the people at Lucasfilm, including Kathleen Kennedy, aren‚Äôt incredibly loyal to George Lucas and his vision then you are kidding yourself. He sold the company to Disney so that they could all keep their jobs and keep working on what they loved. They are telling his story and completing his 9-part epic space saga exactly as he wanted, but allowing directors to come in and write characters, stories and generally help fill in the gaps and dictate how they get there and convey those overall story beats to complete the saga. 

This is still 100% George Lucas‚Äô epic space saga. What comes after, with Rian Johnson‚Äôs trilogy for example, is anyone‚Äôs guess but this 9-part space saga about the Skywalker‚Äôs is and always was George‚Äôs. ",1527811392

"diabetes_t2","t5_2vzs0","Non Alcoholic fatty liver resolved its self after 3 months. 

Before keto I had very low HDL (good cholesterol, High triglycerides, but normal LDL, and Total Cholesterol. At the 3 year mark I had normal HDL, normal triglycerdies, but high LDL and total cholesterol.

From what I read if your ratio of Trig/HDL is below 2 then the association with LDL high heart disease goes away, but the higher that ratio gets the more LDL becomes associated with heart disease. My ratio of Trig/HDL went from bad to normal. So while my cholesterol is not text book perfect, but it is way then it was before. The LDL and total could be explained by me dropping 10 pounds right before the test, and that does increase LDL.

I looked into vegan research on diabetes, and while it sounds really promising, the Randomized Control Trails for reversing diabetes kind of falls flat on its face. About 1/3 improve A1C. 1/3 does not. 1/3 gets worse. After about a year the average A1C of the groups return to what it was at the beginning of the study.

The studies on Ketogenic diets and diabetes show 80% of people getting off medication or reducing medication, and has a much large A1C drop then the Vegan research.

Also it is important to note that the explanation of what causes high glucose levels from the vegan experts was disproved back in the 90s. They are still advocating the outdated view, because it conforms to their opinion that meat is bad.",1527811394

Also, I can still play most of my games I bought 10-20 years ago, without having to buy them again. Sometimes it takes extra elbow grease to get some stuff to work, but 99% of the time I can. Only recently has Microsoft started to embrace this concept on the Xbox One, while Sony and Nintendo are either charging you for the privilege, or aren't providing an option.

Plus I can play my games on my laptop if I'm traveling to different places a lot, admittedly with lowered settings. Until the Switch came along that wasn't really an option for consoles, and even the Switch still has a limited library, and you have to pay for ports of the games you already own.

There is plenty we could do without violating the second amendment. It literally has the words ""well regulated"" in it. I would welcome full background checks including gun show sales as well as more stringent mental health background checks (throw in universal mental health care while we are at it), limiting magazines couldn't hurt. Harsher punishments for anyone who doesn't secure their weapons properly and they are used to commit a crime. Make them an accessory to the crime. I'm tired of reading about these dumbass parents who keep letting their deranged kids have access to their weapons. 

By the way, I know full well they won't be banned, that ship sailed a century or so ago. But let's also not pretend that the rest of the world and their statistics don't exist. No country in the western world has these kinds of issues, and that's because they dealt with it long ago.

Surely, you think, this must be from another time, right? When we didn't understand medicine to the extent we do today, or something? 

Yeah that was only 6 years ago. 2012. The exact quote from this fuckstick is:

""First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.""

Also it won't shock you to know that Steve King (R-IA) thought this was all hunky-dory, because he'd never heard of a girl getting pregnant from rape or incest. No joke.

""Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way, and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter,"" King said.

He was arguing in favor of a law the GOP was pushing that only exempted ""forcible rape"" from abortion bans. So if your 13 year old daughter is seduced and impregnated by a middle-aged man, too bad, she's having that baby.

I suppose that would depend if it was a sexually motivated attack like a BTK esque sort of killer or if it was more of a Son of Sam visionary type of killer. Sometimes when discussing sexual killers and murders traditional sex isn't required. Sometimes things like a knife can be used as a form of penetration and still give the killer the release like traditional sex would. This wouldn't be considered sexual assault instead just a stabbing but it would still be a sexually motivated crime. Typically when the targets are so young its due to sexual motives. I feel like if it wasn't sexually motivated then it narrows the offender pull don't dramatically.

Even when you look at the now debunked POIs Michael Klunder and Daniel Nations they both have a very different sexual offender rap-sheet. The now dead Michael Klunder was much more of a sadist that put over 100 stiches on his first victim that survived [source] (http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/klunder-s-first-victim-recalls-attack-on-her/article_2a2025c0-c521-11e2-a593-001a4bcf887a.html) where as DN while still a bad guy and boarderline(?) mentally ill got his sex offender title from indecent exposure which is significantly less violent and scary than the previous sex offender.",1527811400

It's Edward who might sue Charlie for selling him something he didn't own. Charlie is clearly guilty of fraud. But isn't it Edward loses out?

If both transactions were carried out on paper the first one would be valid, and the second one will be fraud. Charlie should go to jail. But I have a hard time believing that courts will they invalidate the first paper contract in favor of a later electronic contract.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Mom told me this story about when they first met more than once. Dad's kitchen and bathroom were SPOTLESS. 

BUT

he had a ""pile"" in the living room. It was apparently about  six feet in diameter, and a good two feet high. He called it his ""filing system"".

One day while Dad was at work, she got curious decided to have a look at the contents of the ""filing system"".

The contents were unopened bank statements, and assorted unopened bills, shirts that needed buttons, pants that had holes in pockets, socks that needed mending, books with bookmarks in them, papers on a variety of subjects, TWO wallets with contents in tact. Newspapers with things circled on various pages, several empty bottles from either soda or beer and bits and pieces of what would normally be considered as garbage.

She went after the bills first. Opening, and sorting them by source, then date. Then she organized the newspapers by date. The books by subject.

The wallets she put on the small table by his chair.

Then she went after the clothing. As she worked through the clothing sewing up the holes and putting on buttons, she recovered the astonishing amount of $35, and some change. In 1965 terms this wasn't small change.

The rest she threw out.

Dad comes home, and notices his pile is gone...Mom tells me that he stood there for a few moments completely silent and still. She says at this point she got worried. Dad looked up and obviously saw her apprehension, and immediately broke out a big smile for her. Then he got a sly look on his face. He then went into the kitchen and started to cook.

""ok"" he said ""where did it all go."" Mom broke out the mental tally of everything she'd found, what she'd done with it, etc. etc. etc. 

""Good stuff, your the best girlfriend in the world!"" said my Dad. He then binned all the newspapers, and the bills. He told mom that he knew what each piece of mail was, and how much it either told him he owed or had. 

She decided to test him on this and took some of the various statements and bills and began to quiz him. He recited the amount owed, the date, the amount held, and on which date of every bill or statement that she asked him on. ""I can't be bothered to waste the time opening mail that I already know the contents of."" He told her


Then he went on to tell her exactly how much money, and exactly where it was in each item of clothing that she had repaired.

He basically knew the exact contents of the pile, including the wallets, but that he just didn't have time to deal with the item or issue at the moment. He was working steadily as a cabbie, so he had a fairly constant stream of cash so that he could afford to just go out and buy a new shirt, socks, or pair of pants when he needed

The wallets he admitted to having thought he had lost so he just went and got new ID and threw the original wallet in the pile when he found it, usually in some odd place that he had left it.

By the time he was done, he came out of the kitchen with a full meal ready to go.

Mom told me that she pretty much decided right then and there that he was a keeper. ""Any man that was this even tempered, and could cook was a serious consideration, I just had to manage for him what he couldn't""

So she made him a deal, despite her being a strong Feminist, she would organize and mind the bits he couldn't deal with, and he would cook.

Despite a number of separations, they were married from late '67, until she died in '98. Thirty-one years. They managed to deal with each others ""peculiarities"" as best they could, supporting each other all that time.

This one below is the more classical style but it's more expensive since it is more complex so in order to stick to the $100 budget I will have to make it from the chest up and with a simple color background.

"coys","t5_2ryq7","Wait what? Here is a list of things to explain what i meant. 

1. Drafts: the worst teams get the best assets, literally reallocation of wealth

2. Wealth sharing: both the NBA and NFL have policies where in which if a team is making too much money (via any sort of sales, tickets, merch etc.) they share it with the 'have not' teams. This in some ways I realize is similar to TV deals with the prem, but moreso equal as your final place has no effect on sharing. 

3. Luxury tax: Im by far most familar with the NBA. Where if you go over the cap you pay an exponential amount of money for each dollar you go over. There is also a repeater tax where constant offenders get charged even more the longer they go over, this essentially ensures teams cannot go over the tax for more than 5 years.

Edit: 4. I understand you 'monetary dick' example, however in the NBA look at the Knicks, Lakers right now, wealth is not nearly as much of a determinant 

Im not really sure how you jumped to this conclusion, also in relation to your rather condescending comment at /u/hnye . Socialism is quite literally mandated equality.  ",1527811404

If you can get say Domi and sign someone like Derek Ryan to replace Strome as 3c both in production and as a better face off guy/pk I don't understand why you're objecting on the grounds that you are. 



What's wrong with trading a good asset for another good asset? Obviously if it's the Chiarelli special of trading for a downgrade I'm not in favour of it but that wasn't my suggestion.

My point was if Strome can be used to acquire a player of greater need he's hardly irreplaceable and isn't the kind of player who should be on any teams untouchable list. What's the objection to that?

"Barcelona","t5_2qosg","The battery status is completely irrelevant, it only affects your mobility. As I already wrote, I considered a 8hrs plugged laptop to an AC source, no batteries involved there.

The fancy tube lamp, I guess a CFL, uses more energy, but still, from 0,72‚Ç¨/month using it 8h, you could say it uses double that at most: 1,44‚Ç¨/month MAX.

45‚Ç¨/3=15‚Ç¨ per head, that is weird as now I appreciate more of your concern. But let's be clear, even though you may be using your lamp like 8h/day (I couldn't care less), to me it is logical to think that the last roommate used his light in a similar fashion, so there cannot be any discrepancies between his/her and your power usage on that aspect. Then you may add an maximum extra 1,44‚Ç¨/month for your laptop if the last roommate was computer illiterate AND didn't even watch TV or whatever.

Macbook example: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3fkn97/power_usage_of_the_macbook_pro/
(They conclude it's rather 20W, so I overestimated even my numbers as expected)

https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-much-does-it-cost-to-run-a-macbook-pro.1372285/
(They get lost in a similar problem to yours and solve shit AFAICS)

https://reductionrevolution.com.au/blogs/news-reviews/5842594-macbook-pro-laptop-power-consumption-review
(from 8 to 30W, mine is 16 to 23W)

You of course could search more but there isn't much more to see, many of mac and apple forums is filled with retarded answers which may confuse you further, point stands, a CFL+a laptop&lt;=3‚Ç¨/month (assuming 8h of usage every day)

I'm not used to talking to roommates but just in case I would split the invoice pending further investigation of where the culprit may be, also, to me, even the investigation is worth to me more than the 22‚Ç¨ difference so I wouldn't look much into it IRL (unless it happened all year long).

Another thing you may check is if the invoice is related to real power used or an (over)estimation of some sorts (it is written there).",1527811405

That's not the same as being groped in a sexual manner, that's far more serious.

&gt; Getting groped is no different.

I don't know how on Earth you can equate this to that. Let me ask you in this way: if someone groped your mother's ass, you'd take a $200,000 cheque, or would beat that guy up? If you take the cheque, you have some very very big philosophical/moral issue[s]. And you're probably a coward, who wouldn't stand up for his mother's body's privacy, but hey what do I know, you'll take money for you own ass being groped, so I shouldn't be surprised.

&gt; That you are a neanderthal who would consider anything less than 'knocking his teeth out' for someone groping your ass insufficient to make you whole is a very rare aberration - the overwhelming majority of people would take compensation and move on.

Let's see how many downvotes and upvotes we get, and then we'll see who agrees with what.

And as for calling me a ""neanderthal"", it seems like a sport for ""pseudo-intellects"", or ""intellectual wannabes"" like yourself to call anything that opposes their baseless ""philosophy"" as ""neaderthal-ic"". What I said is what any man, who has some manhood in his heart, would do. What you're saying people would do, which is take money for getting their sexual parts assaulted, grabbed, groped, and touched by force without consent, that's what you'd expect money-grabbing whores to do, those who prioritize money over their honour, such people have no sense of honour, because everything is money money money.

&gt; But I think we both know the only place you have the balls to make a threat like that is on the internet. Because if you actually behaved the way you described, you would be in prison or dead.

Uh, I don't think so. It's safe to say people get knocked the fuck out for touching someone inappropriately, and that usually ends right there. And plus, even if you were told to explain yourself, I think saying that you reacted because of someone's provocation and instigation would be a pretty solid excuse. But, hey, maybe you'd get sent to jail for punching someone who gropes your ass, because idk, ""civilized"" society does seem to have very flimsy laws which might put you in jail instead of the actual offender.",1527811406

I seriously read one the other day where he was thinking he was taking 120gs a day, give or take, and was told it was non-addictive and he was upset that he felt like crap. Like you didn‚Äôt notice you had a problem taking over a quarter pound. If I took my dose every hour that I was awake, I‚Äôd still would be under a hundred grams. I can‚Äôt fathom how someone could eat that much powder, everyday. Or he never noticed his problem by the fact that no one ever talks about dosing like except for quitting Kratom. I have such and addictive personality, but that‚Äôs like smoking sugar trying to chase a crack high or something.

I like the fact that my vendor has labeled on the bags, every single one, to not exceed 5 grams in dosing otherwise negative effects can occur, or something to that extent. I mean, I dose more than that because where my spot is, I have too, but I feel like it‚Äôs good idea. Gives some idiots a little common sense and direction, and although all doses are different it‚Äôs kind of like a standard to go by.

Harris did not care, he did not want to be questioned about it either, sounds familiar like Ford and his so called team.  

Hospitals and schools were in chaos, strikes etc.  Students lost time from strikes from elementary all the way up.  Mike Harris did not care, when you question a conservative during the Harris strikes, they simply replied `why`and walked away.

Hospitals were cut, under staffed employees, rushing patients out of the hospital fast, or letting them wait in the hall way of hospitals, no funds, no help.  Food bank use was on the raise, due to labor disputes; labor laws changed not to benefit the employee, rather the employer. 

Ford doesn't have a plain, his plain is simply wait for suckers to vote for him, then when he's in announce items on the chopping block.  Once he would see the revenue that would be brought in from the same thing he is shouting to people about, he would keep it, I can guarantee. Stop being fooled by his `common man` approach, he has a business he wants to expand he can do that with tax payer dollars and if elected `you can't stop him`, in the end he will stop himself, like Mike Harris did; he isn't the brightest bulb.

For example, if you had a 5 kg block of tethered ice, it contains 5,000 cubic centimeters (or 5,000 ml) of liquid water, but while solid it takes up roughly 5,500 cubic centimeters of volume.

(This is why ice floats, by the way)

So when the ice block melts, the water level lowers (assuming the ice block is tethered at a point that is not neutrally buoyant and given no evaporation) because the total volume of the system has reduced when the ice becomes water.",1527811407

"television","t5_2qh6e","Because that's the best Trump can actually articulate, he literally does not posess the nuance nor the intellectual knowledge / articulation to discuss the rift in society. 

AND

That's what the media is reporting. 

See Trump's frustration with the Media? how many times have you've heard Huckabee Sanders say ""He didn't say that / mean that in the slightest"" He feels he's under attack and isn't warrented in the slightest because he and his base has a world view completely formed on radically different assumptions. 

It completely parralels the current political debate surrounding Jordan Peterson's rise to an academic celebrity, because he's articulating a counter argument to ""Western ideology"" that resonates with a lot of the same people. He's know the most read author on Amazon. 

Unfortunately the same narratives has historically been coopted by racists Nazis etc and becomes almost impossible to separate the conservative reactionaries from the more violent alt-right. 

It was been said that Trump while campaigning made his base bloc ""Self-Aware"" in the process and I'm still trying to get to the bottom of that. 

All that's happening is a continued escaltion of rhetoric. Unfortunately I see no clear way to address 1/3 to 1/2 the population who fundementaly see the world differently. We see them brainwashed as talk radio turned into entertainment new and they see us as brainwashed by universities by being taught PostModernism as the only recipe to understanding the world. 

How can you actually progress when you cannot even agree on the most basic facts? Does this resonate with you at all, you claiming as a conservative and myself as a liberal?

Edit: this is mirrored as recently as Trump's decision not to appoint any more WTO judges and to defund the UN, Trump's reasoning is more Nationalistic and feels U.S. is paying more than his share but the rights ideology shares the outcome because they see international organizations as Globalist (with or without the Jewish conspiracy) and apparatuses of the ""west"" to control other nations (the world). The WTO saying to Trump that he can't coerce concessions from allies via trade war is the economic equivalent of Political Correctness. They've made the rules in their own image (Globalist Free Trade) and Trump fundementaly does not agree with it's foundational assumptions. 

Edit edit. Take for example the even more recent audio Clip from Cohen saying that ""Spousal abuse is not illegal"". This isn't a statement typically associated with the west, it the statements from religious middle Eastern or other countries. To call him wrong would be to force your own morality onto someone.

Jesus was killed by romans. Christianity in antiquity was undeniably associated with Rome and prestige by proxy after it was adopted widely in their provinces and by their leadership in spite of the fact that as you said - they were all shit stains, not very Christian.  Rome undeniably destabilized Judea in such a manner that could've (and did) lead to widespread unrest, especially of the religious kind. 

MLK was killed by Americans. America in the wake of this collectively mourned him, and he has become quite large figure in American history. His birthday is a national holiday and his ""I have a dream"" speech is lauded by many. Yet black people still decry systemic oppression nearly daily. America created and upheld a system of slavery, segregation, and disenfranchisement that created the conditions in which a messianic figure like MLK could arise.

Typing in shear stress in google will give you a better idea of what shear stress looks like. But basically it prevents the building from moving side to side, and falling over like a deck of cards. 

Usually engineers call for some type of plywood to be used as shear wall, or will have designed some more elaborate system to provide shear strength for a building. The plywood most residential framers would install has specified shear strengths and nailing spacing to provide the calculated amount of strength needed to keep the occupants safe. 

In this example they used some old doors. This is not the typical recommended way to earthquake proof a building. ",1527811415

What is it to me if the saints who achieve visions of the divine glory and, in a very real sense, experience deification in the present, partake of the divine glory in a different way to me when Christ returns?

In a sound culture, women remain chaste until marriage, and monogamous marriage is the only real solution to incel.  If you participate in the degeneracy of modern culture, then you are contributing to the incel of others.

"gamesEcultura","t5_3l4jr","&gt; tudo parece que vai tomar um tempo demais que eu n√£o t√¥ afim de perder.

Isso √© muito verdade. Por isso que eu n√£o arrisco come√ßar algum jogo competitivo: eu penso que pra eu ficar bom, terei que investir muito tempo naquele jogo, mas n√£o sei bem se vale a pena esse investimento (e nem sei se daria pra investir tanto tempo assim, ultimamente). 

&gt; o que mais a gente v√™ √© sempre ""mais do mesmo"" a mesma receita de bolo repetida v√°rias e v√°rias vezes.

Pior que se o jogo for divertido, eu at√© acho que vale a pena.

Eu acho Far Cry e MGSV levemente parecidos. Os dois tem muita miss√£o de resgatar ref√©ns, os dois envolvem ser stealth pra n√£o ser detectado pelo inimigo ao invadir bases, e etc. Mas o MGSV tem um clima mais pesado, mais s√©rio, complexo, t√°tico. O Far Cry √© bem mais ""porra-louca"", e isso me diverte mais. Acho que eu me divertiria muito mais com o Far Cry 5 (que muita gente diz que √© id√™ntico aos antecessores), do que com o MGSV, que acredito que muita gente o considere um jogo muito superior aos Far Cry's.

&gt; o mais memor√°vel foi o Zelda BOTW, que eu literalmente estava vivendo pra jogar esse jogo, eu passava meu dia no trabalho pensando ""n√£o importa o qu√£o merda meu dia vai ser hoje, o que importa √© que quando eu chegar em casa eu irei jogar Zelda"".

Essa √© uma sensa√ß√£o boa demais, n√©. N√£o rolou isso com o Mario Odissey tamb√©m?

&gt; Quero dizer tamb√©m que √© muito importante n√£o se for√ßar a jogar jogos que n√£o te trazem divers√£o, apenas porque o t√≠tulo √© famoso. 

Pois √©. √Äs vezes a gente acaba comprando jogo famoso que a gente acaba nem gostando tanto assim, no final das contas. Aconteceu isso comigo, com Hollow Knight. Jogo indie lind√≠ssimo, bom demais, que destruiu o g√™nero MetroidVania e ficou super popular por tudo isso. Eu comprei com muita vontade, pois ver jogos indies ganhando destaque em meio a muitas publishers grandes, com seus jogos AAA cheios de DLCs e microtransa√ß√µes, √© algo que me enche de esperan√ßa. S√≥ que n√£o me contaram que o jogo √© tipo um ""Dark Souls 2D"", e isso me surpreendeu negativamente. Duvido que todos que falaram bem do jogo no youtube ou em mat√©rias da internet chegaram a zerar ele. Mais dif√≠cil e frustrante que Cuphead (que √© divertidinho, at√©). Fico feliz de ter apoiado financeiramente uma developer/publisher independente, mas ter pra sempre na biblioteca um jogo que nunca irei zerar √© meio desanimador.",1527811417

Imagine a spiral.

Smaller things count more, and instead of broad-strokes creativity (unusual builds, weapons, spells), the creativity becomes small-scale (e.g., throw in a canceled WoG when he backs up against the wall to force him to expend an extra roll's worth of stamina when he has to dodge forward instead of back, keep on the pressure to capitalize on the advantage).",1527811418

"u_aonemobilemechanic","t5_j4og1","AONE MOBILE MECHANICS‚Äì AXLE REPAIR &amp; REPLACEMENT

Here are some of the axle and drive shaft repair services we perform.

DRIVE SHAFT REPAIR

A drive shaft is a cylindrical rod located in the middle of rear-wheel drive cars between the transmission and the rear axle shaft. It is designed to transmit the power generated by the engine to the rear of the vehicle. A four-wheel drive vehicle may have two drive shafts, while front-wheel drive cars have ‚Äúhalf-shafts.‚Äù Like any other part in your vehicle, drive shaft may suffer from wear and become damaged, which you may notice by the clunking noise during shifting or acceleration, unusual vibrations or squeaking. Whenever possible, our mechanics will perform drive shaft repair, but replacement might be a safer option in some cases.

AXLE SHAFT REPAIR LAS VEGAS

Axle shafts, also known as CV axles and half shafts, make it possible for the car‚Äôs wheels to turn by carrying the rotation momentum from the transmission. An axle shaft consists of several components: a metal pole, CV joints and boots that contain grease. If boots get torn, the grease leaks out and CV joints eventually fail due to poor lubrication, causing the entire axle shaft to wear out. Aone Mobile Mechanics  offers mobile axle shaft repair that may include replacement of one or more assembly components. However, in the case of a heavily damaged axle, a replacement of the entire shaft might be necessary.

CV JOINT REPAIR LAS VEGAS

CV (constant velocity) joints are located on each end of the axle shaft. With two axle shafts in a front-wheel drive vehicle, that‚Äôs a total of four CV joints. Outer CV joints that connect the axle shaft to the wheel tend to wear out first because they experience more movement. A CV joint is only as good as the boot that protects and lubricates it‚Äîa failed boot is the most common issue with CV joints. If you are noticing popping or clicking noises when turning or vibration when accelerating, these could be the symptoms of a failing CV joint. Typically, when symptoms become evident it‚Äôs too late for boot replacement and the entire CV joint needs to be replaced, which Aone Mobile Mechanics  will gladly assist you with.

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REPLACE AN AXLE?

How Much Does an Axle/Half Shaft Replacement - Front Cost? The average cost for an Axle/Half Shaft Replacement - Front is between $477 and $941. Labor costs are estimated between $149 and $189 while parts are priced between $328 and $752. Call us for free estimates! You buy parts and we will put then in for $60 hour. 

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REPLACE A CV JOINT?

A replacement CV axle can cost $50-$150 or more, depending on the vehicle, and the project takes about half an hour. CostHelper readers report paying $12-$23 for DIY replacement of just the CV boot, or $100 for two CV axles with boots, for an average DIY cost of $45. Call us for free estimates! You buy parts and we will put then in for $60 hour.

Speaking from my own experience I could relate to some of the *individuals* that people in the show dealt with, but I did not feel that high school in 13RW was representative of my own experience.  
  
High school (and education at large) in the United States can vary *a lot* depending not only where you grew up, but the size of the school as well. For example, I went to a relatively small high school in New England where the social groups tended to overlap a lot and thus those stereotypes cliques you pointed out didn't really exist. On the other hand, sometimes larger high schools can have these more segregated groups to some extent.

While this may eventually be a possibility, it shouldn't be for at least a few months while the puppy is learning to be house broken. Puppies need to either have constant supervision or be crated. If no one is there, puppy needs to be crated, which is good for you because then you don't have to worry about your dog getting to it (preferably puppy should be crated in roommate's room with the door closed). 

You shouldn't be letting the two interact really at all right now. The puppy is too young to play with, honestly it's too young to be away from it's mother/litter. And if your dog is too rambunctious with a 6 week old puppy, I doubt it'll be any better when the puppy is a little older.

Obviously leaps and bounds safer. But if you have any sort of serious tolerance to opiates, you will be blowing through that shit like it's going out of style. There were periods of time during my addiction were I would take close to 80-100 GRAMS of the shot a day lol. 

The duration is even shorter than regular opiates so the compulsion to redose has constantly was even more prevalent. 

My life actually got WORSE when I let my newfound kratom habit soar to insane levels. Granted I'm an extreme case. It's an opiate and it can absolutely run your life just like any other full agonist opiate can.

I went from oxys-kratom-suboxone-kratom-7 day sub taper and finally sobriety. 

Unless you want to remain chained to a drug it's just more of the same and it always ends up in the same place. Dosing just to wake up, dosing to go to the store,dosing to go to family events etc.

Life is SO fucking much better when you can wake up without drowning 20g of green leafy garbage puking all over the place occasionally lol.",1527811421

Were Sabratea less well trained, she might have visibly shuddered at the cold simplicity of the statement. She was not squeamish, no more than any other hardened battle sister, but this was different. Those being interrogated were not heretics, not xenos, not strangers. They were her charges, her friends, her sisters.

However, a small hint of possible comfort came to her when the other armored woman seemed to pause as well. It could have been simply a moment to collect her thoughts, but it just as well could have been a brief glimpse that showed Sabratea that this Canoness was also bearing the weight of her actions, as necessary as they may be. Whether this was the moral weight or simply their mutual exhaustion as leaders in a trying time was left just as unspoken.

For her part, Sabratea waited in patient silence. She knew better than to speak up unless spoken to first. At least that was the instinct she was given when this Canoness carried her weighty weapon in the same way that the Abess had carried her Power Hammer. With that very thought and a vague memory of a sickening crunch of bone trying to stir itself from long untouched places in her mind, Sabratea saw Iolessa shift how she held her hammer to a slightly less menacing posture.

When Iolessa spoke again, her tone retained its steadfast yet soft quality; but through her choice in words seemed to paint a picture of someone struggling to offer comfort of some kind, without breaking the bonds of formality and necessity. Sabratea understood the intent of the words she was being offered as much as she understood the harshness of their circumstance.

When she was told she would be reunited with the things she was separated from. Sabratea nodded in confirmation in response; but waited for the other woman to finish speaking.  Iolessa promised that in time all would be well again and then Sabratea spoke ""I have faith that it will.""

*""...If no one elses.""* 

Again words the other woman spoke gave Sabratea pause. She hoped that this would not be the case. She hoped that her sisters would find rest, peace, and a modicum of spartan solace in due time as well. Were she stronger she would resolve herself to seeing that she did not rest until they did, but even her most devoted and fanatical mind knew that there were limits to a mind and body, and hers had been pushed long enough with her vigil at the helm, and organizing the transfer from her side of the ordeal.

Sabratea heard the question, and knew that too lingering a hesitation would be a grave mistake. The intimidating weapon that Iolessa bore was proof enough of that. And yet she could not force the words to spill so quickly from her tongue. Someone less composed, less hardened, might have fumbled over words or asked for clarification. A fool would have dared to ask if remembering the ordeal was necessary. Sabratea was no fool, and though hardened and composed, she felt a strong desire to take a seat again before sharing the horrors she had endured. Yet she had not been offered to take a seat, and felt that to do may be misconstrued, if not outright disallowed. So she remained standing, but Sabratea did take a moment to reach up and remove her winged helmet. Through her own judgement she determined that this Canoness might prefer to look her straight in the eye and be allowed to read her face and seek truth in it rather than listen to words filtered twice through vox arrays.

""We saw hell."" Sabratea answered in simplest terms. The cold blue of her remaining organic eye, and the even colder green of the mechanical replacement for its twin, looked into the lenses of Iolessa's helmet. That other eye had been lost in the very hell she now ventured to describe. ""Daemons of all kinds, warp borne horrors, High-level phenomena. Our Gellar field faltered. We had intended to go and fight beside those stalwart defenders on Cadia, but some of us felt as if the Black Crusade had come to us instead. We saw sisters immolate themselves to ensure the taint did not take them, and that they could send back the daemons instead. We saw corrupted facsimiles of those dear to us and lost be used to try to tempt us to foul machinations. We saw a cleric fall to the wills of the archenemy and turn his arco-flagelants against his flock of navymen. We saw hospitallers bring the Emperor's mercy to hundreds of suffering. I saw the Canoness Commander protected by my sisters fall in tide of teeth and a swath of fire. I saw the sisters that survived that turn to the Repentia to seek forgiveness for their failings, and saw them die holding the lines so fleeing guardsmen could retreat to safer corridors of the ship. I saw servitors turn on their own Mechanicus, and cherubim become daemon-hosts. Through it all I saw that the faith of my sisters that survived, was all that protected the basest things we managed to retain. Those souls we protected with the faith and actions of our own, by the grace and protection of the Emperor. I saw the deepest horrors of the archenemy and fought it with His word at my side to protect me as I did his will. I saw the bodies of my sisters that were lost, and thus cleansed in fire to protect us. I saw the miracle of his grace proven once again to me as you came to deliver us from a slow death after surviving that nigh unending nightmare."" 

Though her voice dared to rise and fall a few times as she fought back the fog of memories that dared her to look back into them and ponder more deeply the true horror of what she had survived, Sabratea resisted that urge as she delivered her speech in response. Still her eye brimmed with tears from equal parts sorrow and relief at what she and those with her had managed to live through. ",1527811421

Obviously Trump saying ""The FBI never told me about no Russian intelligence operation."" is a lie. An ordinary one that you could just label as ""a lie"" it's not ""post truth"" or anything fancy. He knows one thing but says another. Simple.

However, is it really the same thing when an entire demographic, a whole media sub-culture, a man using the bully pulpit of one of the world's most powerful positions, a hundred other groups and sub-groups all lie *as a matter of course* while loudly agreeing with each others' lies in every forum they can reach? Whether or not those lies are self-consistent? And it almost seems better if they aren't. I don't think so, and *that* is what warrants another term beyond mere ""lying"". Because it's not just lying about something. A lie can be uncovered. This is *systematic*, it's an attack, the aim being to undermine truth as an idea or a thing of value.

Perhaps that isn't anything truly new, but this is at least a new generation of it, wearing new clothes, using new tools, and coming around for another pass.

""No like this."" and he SLAMMED his fist down on the table.

From the outside we are good to each other and our friends celebrate our relationship. Really I am just codependent and enabling. I was casually dating to get over said high (obvs not the way to do it) and was not looking for a relationship when I met my now husband. But he pursued me in a way I hadn‚Äôt experienced before. He wanted to be around me and to talk to me and take me out and have fun and be a part of my life and I genuinely fell in love with him. After a year and a half or so the veil fell and I realized he was an extremely broken person and I had become someone‚Äôs savior again (previous marriage, before high, kind of what led me to high, it was abusive and awful but same savior concept). At that point we were living together and shared several financial interests and it was just not as easy as, I don‚Äôt want this anymore. We were supposed to get married once before and I called it off and should have broken up with him but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do that to him in the place his life was at. I do genuinely love and care for him. And then my situation changed and I needed health insurance and he needed help with some legal things that being married would help with, and I had an impulsive moment, woke him up and said, let‚Äôs get married today. So we did. Maybe it was the right decision. I‚Äôm starting counseling soon and it‚Äôs something I will explore with my therapist. But at this moment I feel incredibly unfulfilled. I just can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs my broken brain or if I really feel this way.

"dishonored","t5_2sn3m","I feel like your example says less about Haspel and more about how we engage with fiction and fictional characters. So, for instance, we live at a time where there's a trend of anti-hero TV: *Breaking Bad* is a fairly recent example, *The Sopranos*, etc. There is a moral element in how we relate to characters -- and indeed, this is why a lot of anti-hero fiction usually places the anti-hero against someone who's worse, or gives them some sort of twisted sense of honour -- but it's not the only thing going. There's been a lot of coverage and interest in why, say, we tend to root for Walter White (an increasingly-ambiguous drug dealer) and get annoyed by, and even vocally hate, characters like his wife.

In video games, we tend to root for a protagonist even more by default. We, after all, in a sense *are* Corvo. We make the decision, and justify it, and part of us knows there aren't really other options.

But I think it's interesting that even though we are given those choices, your examples are all meant to be intentionally discomforting. *Dishonored* presents a corrupt world, filled with corrupted people, with a dark mission that forces you into some sort of moral compromise -- discovering what the Pendletons' fate is is a sudden shock, torturing the Art Dealer forces you into an dark area with sinister lighting. (There's a reason, after all, the low chaos achievement is titled 'Just Dark Enough'.) I believe we're meant to come off feeling slightly dirty about it, even as we do it. I contend, then, we are bothered by them. Likewise, V, at least in the comic, is not meant to be a pure hero -- his actions are frequently questionable, and it is not the comic's intent we side with him completely.

As for Haspel, I believe it would be short-sighted to say that the only reason people dislike her is media. Certainly, media -- both fiction and news coverage -- plays a large part in how we perceive the world, but it's hardly the only reason Haspel is controversial. Torture is, unsurprisingly, controversial, as is waterboarding. And Haspel does not have the advantage of us running around in her perspective, nor the comforting blanket of fiction.",1527811427

"yorku","t5_2s8jd","&gt; unit 2 members have recovered their senses but unit 1 grad students are still drunk on ideology...

""...recovered their senses""? I guess Unit 2s just had to be whipped into shape like wayward, disobedient wives, or something? Dangle the threat of summer course cancellations over our heads, till we fall in line? With all due respect, a turn of phrase like that betrays a complete lack of awareness of our working conditions, and the fact that, as full-time (yes, you read that correctly) faculty members, who publish books and articles, attend conferences, and have built up national and international reputations, we deserve more than to be second class citizens. 

You may think that Unit 2 lecturers are not eminent scholars. They are just also-rans, who could not get real jobs. That is not true, or, at least, it is no truer for Unit 2 members than for YUFA faculty. Now, one can go ahead and recite the mantra about the ""sector-leading offer,"" but the ""sector"" as it is, consisting of contractually-engaged lecturers with no career stability, who make up more and more of the full-time teaching personnel at universities across the country, is a pile of garbage. Keeping 50% of your teaching personnel on temporary contracts is a horrible management practice, and it is inexcusable to abuse a model that originated to allow units to fill temporary gaps in the curriculum.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","This is kind of a problematic video. 

**I think the observation that starts off the video is interesting.** Yes, Trump won despite taking a ""more hardline than the hardliners"" position on some issues. For example while Rubio and Cruz were talking about ""halting the flow of Syrian refugees,"" Trump just said ""Muslim ban."" Cruz said border enforcement, Trump had ""build the wall and make Mexico pay."" Rubio had his reformacon conservatism, and even Cruz had ""crony capitalism,"" but Trump had ""drain the swamp.""

I think the video fails to properly analyze WHY Trump was able to win the GOP primary despite ""breaking the seal"" on all the hardliner-courting euphemisms.

The narrator gives us this long history lesson on Goldwater '64 but he doesn't at all mention figures that are CLEARLY more direct predecessors of Trumpism like Pat Buchana, Ross Perot, Tom Tancredo and Sarah Palin.

**The narrator of the video obviously has a hard-on for drawing a direct line between Trump and SOUTHERN STRATEGY.** But in what sense does that differentiate Trump from Jeb Bush, who literally purged the Florida voter rolls of Black-sounding names to help elect his brother, then ran in 2016 as a ""federalist"" who would ""return power to the states""? In what sense does that differentiate Trump from Sarah Palin or Newt Gingrich? - who were also *clearly* making appeals to rural Whites in states without large enough cities to outvote them.

I think the victory of Trumpism over the GOP comes from 4 factors, and it's disappointing that the author of the video talks about, well, zero of them.

**1. Discreditation of establishment Republicanism &amp; the neocons.** Bush was a disaster, I think this point explains itself. In 2012 every GOP candidate competed in the primary to see how often they could call themselves a ""Reagan Republican."" Even then, the meaning of that phrase was fading. It's practically irrelevant in 2016. If your **first** election was voting Reagan (18 in 1980) you'd be 54 in 2016. Someone who was in their thirties at Reagan's first election would be in their EARLY SEVENTIES in 2016. So if Republicans couldn't look to Reaganism and couldn't look to Bushism, what could they look towards?

**2. Death of the succons**. The Christian right has never been less relevant in my voting lifetime than they are today. The succons are literally dying, and the ones that aren't dead have diminished as a political force due to the total victory of socliberalism on issues like gay rights. We have a GOP president who secretly paid for abortions, I think that's worth noting. There have been succon revolts against every Republican nominee since Bush 2004, and every four years they are weaker. Without this shift of power within the Republican Party, Trumpism would be impossible. Think about Huckabee &amp; Santorum's ""valiant"" last stands against McCain and Romney and compare that to Ted Cruz's absolutely pitiful performance agaisnt Trump.

**3. Return of the paleocons.** The Paleocons never went away. They were just forced into exile by the fusionist conservatives and their neocon successsors. The end of the Cold War almost IMMEDIATELY began to break up the fusionist coalition, but 9/11 put that on hold for long enough to let Bush get two terms with no right-wing revolt. The election of Obama gave the paleocons renewed energy. The Tea Party was sort of like an awkward alliance - it started out as a Paultard phenom, but was then bought out by the Kochs. Trump himself is a political animal of similar stripes. All the competent assets on Trump's campaign like KellyAnne Conway and Cambridge Analytica, ***are former Cruz campaign assets*** that the Mercers repurposed to elect Trump once Cruz faltered in the primary. The business conservatives are willing to entertain the paleocons in a way that never seemed possible when the Christian right, anti-communism and later the War On Terror were the motivating factors for the Reagan-Bush-Bush fusion.

**4. Symbolic vigor of Trumpism.** I think this is a big deal. Everyone should read this article: **[Donald Trump's Fictional America](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/donald-trumps-fictional-america-post-fact-venezuela-214973)**. It's by a writer who saw Chavez's populism in action. The upshot is the idea that populism is more about delivering appearances than realities. This is very similar to WEB DuBois's concept of the **""psychological wage of whiteness.""** Trump's overweening concerns with appearances and ""making America win"" show he has a pretty strong grasp of what makes populism actually work. The consequence of understanding populism is that the slogan IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN the policy. The slogan doesn't stand for the policy, but rather having a slogan IS your policy. This is what makes the wall better than ""border enforcement."" Reactionaries don't want to enforce the border, they want to act out resentment. ""Make Mexico pay"" is literally that. All of Trump's other policy planks, like banning the Muslims, are similarly pure sublimations of the politics of resentment. I think when the video draws a distinction between **""conservative euphemisms &amp; Trumpian directness""**, the author of the video is getting close, but not exactly spot on, to understanding what makes Trumpism tick.",1527811431

I don't think it's solely responsible, so much as that *not* allowing private business and trade would have resulted in conditions where the advances in technology and industry would have been much slower.

Private business in a competitive market tends to lead to fast innovation by creating incentive and reward structures that encourage efficiency and by providing space for innovations to be tried and measured against each other. If you try to run every industry collectively, even assuming you can avoid some sort of statist command economy (and historically speaking that's a pretty tall assumption), you end up with decisions being made by people who don't have much interest in seeing them made properly, and a lack of mechanisms to objectively measure what works and what doesn't.",1527811438

"AsianMasculinity","t5_30c2m","Who: 24, Indonesian, 5'10 - yes I'm a giant for an Indonesian man. I'm a pretty laid back guy, I have a live and let live mentality towards the world, with the one exception that I like to correct people when they're wrong about topics with absolute details. In college I was very social, went to the gym 5x a week and went out on average once a week. I've graduated now and since then have put my life focus on building my career and achieving my long term goals rather than going out and getting girls.

Where: Austin, Texas, since 2011. 

Experiences: As the liberal haven of ultraconservative Texas with a giant college campus filled with all kinds of different fob Asians and Asian Americans, Asians aren't really looked down on here. The AMWF:WMAF ratio is slightly better than in Asia and other US cities, but it's still pretty bad. There's a very significant white old money population that won't even look at you in an elevator, but the same goes for any non-white male so it's not just us they shy away from.

I haven't really tried to date any white girls so I don't have a lot of experience, because I've been happy with the selection of Asian girls. There were several times when I was at bars/concerts and some white girls were definitely very attracted to me, but I was in a relationship through all those experiences so it just caused me trouble  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

I live in a fairly lower-middle class neighborhood without a lot of white people. To be specific, my annual income as an individual is 2x the median 
household income in the area. I've never felt any discrimination from the black and latino population who make up most of this area, though the experience in white neighborhoods may be different. Mexicans specifically are very welcoming to me, I think there's a common sense of ""we're not black, white, or oriental"" factor to it. There's also a huge Vietnamese population in Austin apart from the student Asians, so that might be a factor. Fortunately, since there's virtually no other Indonesians, I get looped in with the ""hardworking, successful, smart"" stereotype whenever I do run into ignorant white people, and that's worked out on my behalf when I got pulled over with a not-insignificant amount of herbs and claimed I was heading to the library. More on this in a second.

My girlfriend's dad is a hapa - white/Taiwanese - and the most racism I experienced was with him. It's not the usual form of racism you experience in the States - East Asians look down on Southeast Asians, because we're seen as the underdeveloped and poor Asians, I can elaborate if anyone is curious - however, owing to the fact that I'm not afraid to talk back when I hear bullshit and that I have a very successful career, he gradually learned to respect me and now we're good friends. I'm the only man to have ever dated any of his daughters who addresses him by his first name.

For the fun bit - my girlfriend looks hapa even though she's only a quarter white, and she's a solid 9-10. I'm not the best looking dude - according to several girls, I went from a 3-4 before college to a 7-8 during college through fitness and dressing well. I'm not as fit at the moment, probably a solid 5 now, and several times I've seen white guys get confused when she tells them that I'm her boyfriend. 

Weather sucks dick between April and September, it's great between October and March. Cost of living in Austin is steadily rising thanks to Californians moving here, but I get job interview offers almost on a weekly basis thanks to that so I'm not complaining.

Unrelated protip: if you're Asian and you're 5'9 or above, you're considered tall in the Asian community. So stop complaining about not being 6', you're a disgrace to your people when you hate yourself. Also, never make fun of anyone for being short, and make an effort to call out girls who do.

Feel free to PM me anytime as I was diagnosed with hypersensitivity.

When are you taking it? It's most likely a low dose of amitriptyline. You should always always take it at night. I made the mistake once of taking it during the day and I experienced dizziness and sleepiness. This is the hypnotic effect of the medication.

If the side effects of the amitriptyline are too much, you might want to try an SSRI like Fluxotine which also has evidence of helping with nerve pain.

For me, I needed to holistically tackle my hypersensitive esophagus, my gerd, and my mental issues. Right now I'm taking Pantoprazole 40mg once a day, Fluxotine 20mg in the morning, and clomipramine which works very similar to amitriptyline but helps with my OCD at 100mg at night.

**Are you trying to identify what's on your face?**

While we understand you'd like help, none of us at SkincareAddiction are medical professionals; we‚Äôre not trained to diagnose skin conditions.

On reddit, a better place to post would be **/r/AskDocs**, which uses verified flair to mark medical professionals,  but we really recommend **[seeing a doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/when_to_see_a_doctor)** for diagnosing skin problems.

-
If your question is about an everyday skin concern like acne or closed comedones:

* Check out **[Common skin concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index#wiki_common_skin_concerns)** in our wiki.
* Do a **[subreddit search](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)*** for your question, because it's very likely  been asked before.
* Post in the **[help thread stickied on our front page](http://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction/about/sticky?num=1)**. It's full of super helpful, experienced people who hang out there to answer questions, so you'll get the most reliable answers there!

&amp;nbsp;

If you still want to make a post to the sub, you'll need to use one of the tags from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jmg/meta_list_of_valid_title_tags_and_their/). A correct title would look something like this: ""[Tag] This is the title of my post"". Make sure to use square brackets. 

Be aware that we are pretty strict about [medical questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_2._safety_first.21) on this sub, so if you're asking for a diagnosis, your post could be removed by the moderators.

Thank you!

The removal of more judo techniques from IJF contest makes judo weaker, and less credible in self defence.

It's a tough one for newbies. It's very easy to overextend or to not hit the right strategic beats or mess up the timing of closing companies. I still do that and I have 10+ plays of the game now. 

Having said that, congratulations on incubating new players. Hope they enjoy the next game. I would recommend playing 1830 as one of your next few ones. There's still few that match the strategic depth to rules simplicity ratio of the game. It can be long, though in practice most of my games go to bankruptcy, so perhaps 1889 is a better first game if you have 4p.

If you are stuck with 3, and even if not, I highly recommend just playing 1849 over and over again. There's easily 100 plays in that game and it's usually more enjoyable to delve deeper into 18xx rather than wider, especially since you already know everyone likes 1849.

I don't recommend 1846 at 3 with new players because it can be tame and boring. The map is often too open and the train rush slow so you don't get the flavor that good 1846 provides. 1846 is actually a pretty deep, if incredibly front loaded, game but that won't necessarily come out with new players. I think 4 or 5p 1846 can be a great intro game, though I still prefer 1830 or 1889. I will provide the caveat that I basically dislike 1846 at any count other than 5 anymore, but I have tried learning games at 3 and they've mostly bombed not because of difficulty but because of the tameness.",1527811447

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Voluntary manslaughter: sometimes called a¬†crime of passion¬†murder, is any intentional killing that involves no prior intent to kill, and which was committed under such circumstances that would ""cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed"". Both this and second-degree murder are committed on the spot under a spur-of-the-moment choice, but the two differ in the magnitude of the circumstances surrounding the crime. For example, a bar fight that results in death would ordinarily constitute second-degree murder. If that same bar fight stemmed from a discovery of infidelity, however, it may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.[74]

It's weird because if I really am an ISTP, I think I have a pretty good Si function as well. I can remember events very clearly and often re-watch them at night.

"television","t5_2qh6e","I'd agree with what Vince Gilligan said on his podcast, when he was asked when Walt truly broke bad, and I think the answer is very similar for Jimmy:

Walt ""broke bad"" at the very beginning. All of his problems could have been solved in the very first season had he just accepted Elliot's offer. He'd no longer be teaching high school or working at the car wash, he'd be back at his old company he helped create, he'd be making good money, he'd be doing interesting work again, he'd be repairing his relationship with Gretchen, he'd have health insurance for his cancer, etc. Walt had a deus ex machina opportunity on a silver platter, and he turned it away.

It's how we know his ""I did this for the family"" line was always bullshit. If that were true he would have hopped on the offer in a heartbeat. But his ego (that same ego that saw Elliot's offer as ""charity"") is the main villain of the story and it's always been part of him. It's why he left Gray Matter in the first place. He felt insecure being with Gretchen and felt threatened by Elliot, since they both came from wealthy families and Walt did not. After leaving Gray Matter, he also held and lost jobs at Application Labs, some chemical company, and Sandia Labs (the latter of which we know was lucrative). We're only left to surmise that Walt doesn't play well with others and has always had an ego problem.

So, to me, asking when Jimmy becomes Saul or when Walt becomes Heisenberg, etc... they're always one in the same. We might see them embrace their inner demons more openly as time progresses, but the demons were always there, given the evidence we see for how Walt behaved before BB or Saul before BCS. A big theme across these shows is that any ordinary person has the capacity for both good and evil, but what matters is how you choose to react to circumstance. Sort of like Mike's whole speech to Daniel in BCS after his first deal with Nacho:

&gt;I‚Äôve known good criminals and bad cops, bad priests, honorable thieves. You can be on one side of the law or the other. But if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word.

As evidence, I present:

1) Riot Repertoir has said on the boards that he thinks point-and-click cc is unfair, and that Malz ult and Ryze root are particularly so

and 2) every time they nerf Malz, they say, ""Reducing his damage and increasing his cooldowns will make him less of an ult bot,"" which is obviously not true.

You are overly attached to the notions of x and y. If I wrote the equation d = 5w + 6, that is a linear equation where w is the independent variable and d is the dependent variable, just like y = 5x + 6. Which leads into...

2) Linear equations of the sort you deal with when learning algebra have two variables in them, one you plug values into and one you calculate based on those values. Normally we call them x and y.

The equation you posed has three variables in it. This is no longer a linear equation in two variables, because to calculate the value of, say, z, you would have to have values for both of the other variables.

On the one hand I dislike cunt as an insult because it's typically sexist (usually applied to women, and separately, disparaging of vulvas and vaginas).  In my life, when I've heard people get called cunts, it's almost always in a misogynistic and vile way.  On the other hand, some people use the insult cunt in a non-sexist way (it might be regional), and insofar as it's just a strong insult, I can't think of one too vile for Ivanka.  The fact that her version of motherhood (rich, white, biological, marital,straight) is so revered and celebrated while other women and their children who are risking their lives to escape poverty and war are ripped apart and subject to violence in the US is (Trump has repeatedly attacked such women and their children, accusing them of being members of MS-13, being animals, or trying to game the system by arriving as unaccompanied minors)... deplorable. She has become the administration's diplomatic branch, a job usually reserved for the first lady, and in that sense she isn't just the president's family (who I'd prefer not to criticize) but part of his administration, and therefore completely fair game.

* [Myra Kenning](/u/Gengisan) (31), the lord's widowed gooddaughter who nevertheless was viewed by her adopted family more as a Lannister than as a Kenning. Her own children sat at her side.

* Cerion (13), the lord‚Äôs heir whose strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes might have made him stand out amidst his family.

* Ryella (12), Cerion's eldest sister whose blonde hair was worn in ringlets and framed a round and unremarkable face. She, too, was not one would call an extroverted personality, though polite smiles came to her face when anyone came near, with the girl presenting herself as the very model of the perfect young noblewoman.

* Myrcella (9), the last of the late Ser Tybolt's children, who was the only one of the trio to boast both the green eyes and golden hair typical of their house. Hers was a more open personality than her siblings, eager to meet new people though not in any particular rush to depart her family to do so.

* [Cerenna](/u/parekeetweet) (12), Dairren and Feona's eldest daughter who - even seated - exhibited a sense of constrained energy, as if she could burst into motion at any time. Her blonde hair was worn loose and long, swirling down lower than her hips, while her green-hazel eyes sparkled with mirth.

* Leila (10), the second oldest of Dairren's brood of daughters, whose quiet nature seemed more disinterest in her surroundings than borne from a shy nature. Her wavy golden hair fell to her chin and her emerald eyes were keenly observant.

* Ciena (8), the middle of six siblings, who was all too excited to be at a grand feast for the first time in her life. The pageantry captured her attention with ease and she yearned for the day that a gathering such as this might be held in her name. She'd inherited both the striking brown eyes and the wavy blonde hair of their mother.",1527811452

I do things more offline, which is fine. I bring my laptop around with me anyway. Back up important things with an external hard drive. My smartphone usage has declined and become more utilitarian (I consider this a positive side-effect).

I do *rarely* still use Drive, if I absolutely must back up a file and have no other means handy. In this case, I use VeraCrypt to encrypt my stuff before handing it off to Google. Occasionally if I want to watch a Youtube video, I do it through Hooktube.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","*Disclaimer: New DM/player perspective*

As a newer DM myself, I've definitely railroaded my players while the BBEG monologued. I've never gone so far as to allow a roll and then totally negate it because, ""cutscene,"" though. I think many (new?) DM's see monologuing with the BBEG as their opportunity to unveil a huge, fun part of the story while RP'ing a powerful, exciting character. It makes sense that they don't want to end the monologue early. Often, the DM may only be controlling townspeople or more normal characters, while the players get to RP their characters all day long. Even then, the DM only gets to RP normal NPCs if the party is actively trying to communicate with them, which not all parties do.

But the BBEG? That's the DM's opportunity to RP the culmination of all their hard work, scheming, and story-weaving for a few minutes! When a PC interrupts you 3 words into it with, ""I run up and punch them in the face"" it's just deflating.

So yeah, I have definitely railroaded a monologue in my limited experience. I know the idea is that the story belongs to the players, but, for me, I feel the story belongs to both the players and the DM so a little uninterrupted monologuing here and there should be allowed, so long as the players aren't getting screwed in the process.

That said, I recognize that it's just not how the game works and my perspective will likely change as I play more and get some experience under my belt. ",1527811454

* check out the [whale bone arch](https://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2015/06/01/alaskas-spring-whaling-season-a-success-despite-challenging-sea-ice/)
* visit the [museum](https://www.nps.gov/inup/index.htm)

other users will tell you we changed our name from barrow to utqiagvik but no one here will care if you call it barrow.

also alcohol isnt banned. you can bring your own alcohol and drink it but since you'd only be here for a couple hours i dont think it would be worth the trouble. just dont bring a lot or else you'll be stopped by [alaskas largest police canine team](http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/North-Slope-launches-Alaskas-largest-team-of-police-dogs-to-sniff-out-drugs-bootleg-liquor-419657574.html)",1527811454

Yes. If American steel producers could produce steel at the original (pre-tariff) price point they would already be doing that and the tariffs would never have been necessary.

Realistically what will happen is this: the price for steel will jump to a high point due to the tariffs. Then it will slowly start to drop again as American steel production ramps up to compensate. Eventually, the price will reach a new equilibrium and level off.

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","I'm not know what you are or aren't doing, so if any of this is ignorant I am sorry.

I think you need to focus less on the kink side though, and more on just dating. You'd be surprised how many male subs will tune into your masculine personality and if you get talking, and just drop in some more Dominant flirting to a male sub, (Especially in an area Femdom is rare) he wont stop until he knows if you are a Domme or not.

Anxiety can be a terrifying demon to face! But if you suffer from it in anyway I'd suggest you beat it to a pole anyway you can! From example, Personally I have a cocktail of mental illnesses I am working through right now including anxiety, and I've suffered from a xannax addiction (Don't use xannax!) I remember however, when I was onit, and I had confidence. I was able to talk to girls, and sometimes I did explain I was submissive as I was wearing a choker in public. I actually had no negative answers. One girl said she wasn't into it, the rest actually found it attractive that I was confident about it. I didn't actually take t further, as I felt like I was cheating the girl with the xannax. But the same works for guys! We don't say it outloud as much, but confident women are extremely attractive. If you can confidently tell a guy that you want to dom him it will give you a insane advantage. (I don't know if you are or not already though).

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","Theism, really any belief in the supernatural is either out of ignorance or out of indoctrination. Religion isn't real, and anyone who believes any of it is real is wrong by basic empiricism and rationalism. 

You're a Christian based on your flair, your Bible has a ton of stuff that not only contradicts basic science but actively has patriarchal or otherwise reactionary content. I'm not even talking about just the Old Testament, the New Testament has a lot of reactionary stuff in it. 

Not just sexism, and not just St. Peter's homophobia but tons of heteronormative and cisnormative stuff

Christians themselves have a long history of using their beliefs to oppress and aggress. 

If you consider the Bible to be a legitimate book, then there is something intrinsic to your beliefs that directly conflicts with anarchism, namely the, ""Render unto Caesar"" verse which literally says God picks people's leaders. 

That, and also none of it is real, any of it. That's not up for debate, none of it is real if it's not verified by science.

"Braincels","t5_3pci5","I suggested therapy for the issues of low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts, for which therapy is verifiably effective. I have never suggested therapy is a valid solution to the lack of an enjoyable sex life. That's a straw man argument.

If you are having thoughts of suicide, I urge you to contact crisis services to talk to someone. Let me make myself abundantly clear: **I do not condone or encourage suicide.** Therapy *can* help with finding meaning in the world other than sex, as well as helping you improve your self-image, and therefore it can indeed help you... if those are goals you're willing to work toward. However, if you go into therapy and ask your therapist to help you get laid, you're likely to be disappointed with the outcome.

I believe you when you say that the only thing you would like to accomplish by being here is finding a way to have a more fulfilling sex life. But that is not what everyone is here for, and for those that are seeking other goals, therapy can be and often is an invaluable tool.

I can assure you, I am not here to troll. I am here to offer my condolences on the loss of someone who should have been able to find the exact help I am advocating for, and to encourage others in his situation to seek that help rather than take their own lives as well.

You're free to disagree with me, and you're free to believe anything you wish about me. I certainly can't stop you. But I urge you, as I have urged others, not to feed the rhetoric that therapy is either useless or harmful, because it could save a life.",1527811459

It's easy to fall into that mindset, especially on shore duty where I have sailors bitching about being at work past 1400, but just because you had to go through something shitty doesn't mean you owe it to everyone else to make their life suck too. The only stories anyone has about cranking are of how much worse off they think they were than you are (see: this thread).

It's a fact that cranking is a bullshit waste of a sailor's time. The Navy spends thousands of dollars training and adjudicating some Sailors to perform their job, then sends them to scrub trays for 3-5 months. If the galley needs more manpower, there need to be more billets to fill that gap.

They are taking the people that MH don't want and will never get, they are also double dipping and getting the people waiting for MH, at least until MH finally comes to PC. 

When MHW hits, everyone who likes MH is just gone, period. Dauntless will be left with those that can't afford MH and those that don't want a game as hard as MH. That is why Dauntless will inevitably appeal to the casual player base, because that is who will stay and spend money when everyone else has already left. It would be kind of dumb to try and appeal to the MH crowd and lose so many casuals when the MH crowd WILL leave no matter what. Ideally they would want to get all demographics, but casuals and MH fans want two entirely different levels of difficulty and don't coexist well together.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Do be friendly, polite, and gentlemen-like. Small gestures like opening the door for her and pulling out her chair can make a great first impression. Although you don‚Äôt necessarily have to pay for dinner, it‚Äôs a nice gesture that will probably be well-received if you can afford it + you were the one who asked her out. If that‚Äôs something you feel like you want to do, be prepared to politely say ‚Äúno worries, it‚Äôs my treat!‚Äù if she offers to split the bill.

Also take the time to make sure she gets home safely‚Äî don‚Äôt just ditch her at the restaurant when the date is over. Walk her to her car if you drive separately, or walk her to her front door if you‚Äôre supposed to be taking her home. If you liked her and feel like you want to see her again, definitely at least go in for a hug before you leave. If you really hit it off and you feel like a kiss is appropriate, that‚Äôs fine too. Just try to be smart about reading her body language and getting a sense of whether or not she‚Äôd be into that. 

Also a great tip‚Äî try to think of some questions ahead of time to keep in the back of your mind in case the conversation starts dragging! I have a bunch of go-to first date questions I always whip out if things start to get awkward. People like to talk about themselves. Ask her things that encourage her to tell a story, make sure you listen thoroughly to those stories, and then you can add if you‚Äôve got any similar experiences. 

Don‚Äôt make lewd sexual jokes, ask her personal questions about her sex life/sexual history, or discuss exes at all. 

Probably better to avoid overly controversial topics like religion, politics, etc. on the first date *unless* you know for sure that you both come from the same background in either respect (for example, you met through a church group and are definitely both religious) OR either one of those things happens to be a complete dealbreaker for you. Even then, if you find out there‚Äôs some fundamental disagreement there, just try to remain polite, calm, and change the subject. You don‚Äôt have to go out with her again if you get the sense that you‚Äôre not compatible, but you don‚Äôt want to make the rest of the night an awkward mess either.

Title: **Apartment complex pet issues**

Original Post: 

&gt; Throwaway as people here know/have my reddit handle...
&gt; 
&gt; I‚Äôm having some issues with the apartment complex I‚Äôm currently living at. I currently have a 7 month old puppy who seems to be picking up items he shouldn‚Äôt find in dog common areas of the grounds. The 1st incident involved multiple cooked chicken wing bones thrown on the ground near the area I walk my dog in the morning ( I brushed it off as they had people cleaning out 2 lower apartments that open to my door and figured they don‚Äôt care/weren‚Äôt residents.) I recently went through ANOTHER situation within the past week in which someone threw a large amount of raisins all over the grass where a dog station is. My dog ended up eating 10-20 of them, the only reason I noticed was because he was staying in one area too long. I knew raisins are poisonous to dogs so I had to call the vet after hours and induce vomiting. (Thankfully I caught it) Due to me catching it quickly he didn‚Äôt have to have his stomach pumped and stay for 2 days on IV fluids/blood tests since it causes acute renal failure... After this incident I held my composure as I was livid and asked them to write an email expressing to residents not to litter/etc, especially in dog areas. They have yet to send the email out after 5+ days and just said sorry to hear...
&gt; 
&gt; Tonight was the final straw, I was walking my dog tonight and he managed to pick up  MORE cooked chicken wing bones at the dog station he found the raisins around. I‚Äôm beyond livid and will be speaking again to my leasing office tomorrow as this is the 3rd time in a little over 2 weeks. Is there anything I can say/show to them so I‚Äôm not just dismissed again? Please help!

His value comes from a speed, a quick shot, and a relentless forcheck that makes him great to pair with someone like koivu who prefers to hang high in the offensive zone. ",1527811463

Hell, you bring a shroud and it's over. But there has to be a way.

Maybe the killer would start right beside them in that case, looking exactly like one of them. Their crouching and emoting is perfectly mimicked. In order to find out who's who you need to navigate to a blood testing counter a la the Pig's boxes. Someone can either go to witness the killer's reveal, or if one or both take off then everyone can ve suspicious of that character the rest of the game.",1527811463

I'm just not sure, friend. I've been through some things. Ultimately, the faction change was my idea. I was born as Alliance. 

There's a funny story behind it... I wanted to get away from my boyfriend for a bit. I encouraged him to make a character, or faction transfer One, but I was surprised when he said, ""I might go Horde properly..."" or something like that. It's not that I wanted to distance myself from him completely... I wanted to be with him, but I found it harder and harder to get time alone. I was only meant to be part time Horde-ing it. 

I still had every intention of hanging around with him... But I thought, if I got away for a little bit, I'd make some new friends too. 

Anyway, he ended up coming with me, and when he did... Which was a few weeks or months later, I was absolutely happy about it. I was glad he made that decision because I still found that I had the same trouble making friends, and I missed hanging out with him and having someone to talk to. I think I probably really encouraged him to do it at that point. To do this Horde thing. 

I then realised I liked him more than I'd realised initially, otherwise I wouldn't have missed him so much when I put on the red and black banner. 

At this point, we have broken up... And after so many years as Horde together, and having so many Alliance friends... I think I'm considering the notion of re-alliancing. 

I'm not really sure I 100% like it. This traitoring. But at the same time... Well... All my friends are there, and I mean, they're really all I know. 

I don't know how I ended up with so many Ally friends, (technically, I have like 3, but I got along with their friends okay... And 3 is like a lot for me anyway) but you know... If you have literally nowhere else to go... 

Heh. Why am I bothered? Do people even still talk to each other?

You're gonna be like, ""shit, I didn't ask for your life story"". Well, I didn't know I was gonna tell it. 

So... Yeah. So you're set on this Horde thing, then?

1. how good is the person at portraying realistic emotion?
2. how well does that emotion 'fit' the character being portrayed?

---

evaluating the first is going to be hard if you're not that great at reading people in general. children are a pretty good place to start. can you tell the difference between crying because of physical distress, crying because of emotional distress, and crying for the sake of manipulation (temper tantrums)?

can you tell when someone is crying because s/he is happy vs. when s/he is sad?

if someone yells at you, can you quickly identify if the person is angry, or excited, or just trying to get your attention?

next step is to start mapping those real-world situations to the ones the actor is performing. how well does s/he portray that same state? sometimes it's really blatantly obvious that the actor isn't sad when s/he is crying, for example. if the character is actually supposed to be sad in that scene, then that's pretty bad acting. if the character is trying to fake that s/he is sad as part of the scene, that might be really good acting.

I also recently uncovered another huge secret my father kept (he's not an agent, but he very much has had a double life), and it cemented for me that ""getting off the train"" (metaphorically speaking -- I went no-contact) was the right decision for me. I saw Paige as a traumatized young woman who was doing what she had to do to survive. 

I was moved by her standing up for Henry. If you think about how often she was left alone with him, she often played the big sister/mother dual role for him. She cared for him in ways kids should not be asked to do.

i'm shooting again tomorrow morning and am thinking should just err on the side of safety and use the 35 and keep it at 1.4? or any suggestions for changing the settings on the 24\-70?

Trump just hands out pardons to the worst people he can find, while today's Republicans zip their lips. Modern Democrats have never been in a position where they *needed* to ignore the wholesale dismantling of justice by their own party.

Your statement is literally true, but it doesn't convey anything useful to the conversation. It's either a both sides false equivalence, or a statement with no reference point and therefore no meaning to pass along. Rather than pushing back against the criticism, try looking deeper for the meaning you intended to communicate.",1527811466

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","TLDR; I've had sex, a lot.

Ok. This will 1) get buried because as usual I am late to the game, and 2) be hard to nail down because I was a fucking manwhore most of my teens, 20s, 30s, and have started to slow down in my 40s.

Let's see... First off, I have slept with 186 different women. Some of them between others or later in both our lifes, but it is 186. There may be more if I do another hard count, but definitely not lower. 

So yeah. Fucking manwhore. These are in no particular order, just in the order as I remember them.

* dated three girls names Kristen, Kirsten and Kris at the same time. I kept from getting their names mixed up by nicknaming them all 'Scooter' and they all thought it was cute as fuck

* fucked a 'cousin' (our families just knew each other so that is why the ''s) in the stairwell of the local mall. During business hours. In the daytime. Went back out and hung out with the girl that the cousin was trying to hook me up with. Didn't get to fuck friend, though she did try to kill her mom because she didn't want her to see me any more (she ended up in the psych ward

* just ended a fuck-buddy relationship, started dating a girl, had a party and fuck-buddy asked if she could crash in my room. Girl I was dating ended up in my room. Started getting to it and I asked her if she wanted to see if ex-fuck-buddy wanted to join. She said yes. Asked fb is she wanted to join, she said yes. Fucked a lot that night. They became friends on their own and just used me as a reason to try out their lesbian sides. I think the sluttiest thing out of that is that they picked me up from work in an old station wagon (dating myself but whatever) and one would drive while the other would fuck me in the folded down back seats. They would switch-off when we hit lights and dead ends. This was the first of four or five threesomes (depending on your classification of threesomes)

* started dating this girl who I thought was a different girl. Ended up dating. She liked fucking in weird places like the restaurant bathroom when her brother and friends were out dining (the bathroom had one of those translucent to opaque switches that made it hard to tell what was going on but I am really fucking sure that if you just see an amorphous  blob through there gesticulating in the way we were it probably didn't take a giant leap to figure that shit out.I ended up apologizing to her brother who was used to this shit (and between you and me, she probably fucked her eldest brother)) 

* this is a good one; was having relations with a girl one summer (this is in my teens) and the girl I was dating pimped me out to her GFs that hadn't had sex. Once, on a dirt road, not far from a real road, and definitely in sight of well lit houses

* I had a habit of girls coming over to my place (or me to theirs) and having their GFs (non-sexual) over at the same time and ended up fucking them both. It would start by me fucking girl I was dating (or seeing) in front of their friends and just straight up asking if they wanted to get in on the action. Sometimes they would leave. Most times they would stay. (Girls apparently figure this shit out before coming over.)

There are more instances, but I am tired of typing. One day... A book! (I guess. Who the fuck would buy it though)

No problem!

&gt; the swinging animation of an Axe is very misleading.

This is exactly what I'm talking about; I'm glad I'm not imagining it. IMO they should either change the windup animation to match, or just let the axe extend further. Doing either would make the game feel much better, with my personal preference being them increasing the range a bit (I'd like it if there was a larger difference in reach between the light and heavy weapons, though this would have to be balanced ofc).

&gt; player collision feels like mud

100% agree. Frankly I think they could probably just remove player collision entirely and it wouldn't suck. Movement is already so slow and momentum is such a big thing that having player collision on top of all that is just unnecessary.

"CBD","t5_2zppx","I just received their 600 mg tincture.  I have been taking it for three days now. This is my first real CBD experience so I am giving it a little time to see how it affects me before writing a review. 

As of now, I can say that it seems really potent because I am feeling some kind of change with just 3-5 drops.  Ian, the CEO did an AMA on here and told me to start with 10 mg.  I started with 5 mg and am now just taking 3-5 drops since it seems strong for me. Everyone will be affected differently of course.  Still finding the right dosage. 


For what it's worth, I did a *ton* if research before deciding to purchase this product. My research included going into local vape shops (4-5 shops) discussing and researching their products and CBD in general, various internet sites, company websites, reddit, and contacting some of the companies directly.

I decided I wanted a full spectrum product with terpenes, rather than an isolate. 
I also decided that I wanted a product with 500 mg/30 ml or greater, so I can have a larger range with dosing.

My final decision was between: 
Lazarus (reputable and best priced);
Bluebird Botanical (reputable, with tremendous positive reviews);
and finally Symbiotic Nutritionals (reputable)

Lazarus didn't indicate if their tincture contained terpenes, so I sent them an email to inquire. I received an automated reply confirming they received my email, however they never did respond.

I called Bluebird and they answered the phone and were very polite in answering my questions.

I was all ready to purchase from them but then took a pause to consider my decision to spend $100. on what amounts to a supplement with benefits that are questionable to me, as I have not tried CBD..

During my pause, I noticed Symbiotic Nutritionals had been vetted on theCBD.place. I sent them a quick note and they responded; they were and continue to be very helpful in answering my questions. Ultimately I decided to purchase from them because I could get a 600 mg tincture with terpenes for under $50 and the company appears to sell high quality products . The company's labs are posted on their website- (even though I don't fully understand how to interpret them.) 

The tincture arrived in a nondescript and unremarkable white package. The box with which the tincture was contained was slightly creased, however the bottle inside the box was perfect and as described.

I guess that makes sense.  There aren't that many people working on new types of databases or filesystems or network protocols or etc.  There's probably a lot more of those areas than you know about and a lot more people in each area than you know about.

Updates are pushed out every couple days on alpha, it's very likely these changes had very little to do with what reddit said, and alot more to do with what alpha has been testing for weeks now. 

It is not surprising at all that you saw one patch notes, and then they were changed days later. As i said, alpha patches drop almost every other day, as they try to balance these things.

From what you wrote, you don't seem to view people as being more than what they present on a surface level, but then you go on to express frustration that the people around you don't appreciate or understand the inner workings of your own emotions. Thing is, most people have a lot going on internally that isn't shared with everyone around them. Most people only have a few friends they feel comfortable opening up to on a deeper level. 

The way you describe other people comes across as arrogant, condescending, and alienating. That may not be your true characteristics, but thats what comes across on a surface level.

To go from anything that ain‚Äôt blonde to a fun color like blue there is a LOT that has to be done to hair to make it that way.

It also depends on the stylists teqnique. 
It actually sounds like he was doing a favor for you and spacing it out over two appointments so it was easier on your hair. 

If you go full out on one go you can run into major breakage or just really shitty feeling hair.

The whole aim of Hoover's [COINTELPRO Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) was to undermine the Black Panthers **because** they appealed to white moderates through initiatives like the [Free Breakfast for School Children Program](https://www.history.com/news/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party) that fed 20,000 U.S. school kids *each day*. The goodwill and progressive action of the Black Panthers' terrified the status quo.

**Here are the Black Panthers' ten points that outlined their purpose:**

* 1 We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Black Community.
* 2 We want full employment for our people.
* 3 We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists of our black and oppressed communities.
* 4 We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.
* 5 We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.
* 6 We want all Black men to be exempt from military service.
* 7 We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER of Black people.
* 8 We want freedom for all Black men held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails.
* 9 We want all Black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by the Constitution of the United States.
* 10 We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.",1527811471

I really feel his 911 call, as in, what he actually says, doesn't really give much insight into the reality of his situation.

My assumption at this point is that his body is still out there, somewhere within walking distance from his vehicle, and they just haven't been able to find him due to a combination of factors (size of search area, not knowing which direction he was walking in, potential underestimation of how far he'd traveled, assumptions he'd deliberately run away due to criminal history, initial concealment of information from his brother that was in attendance with the Police that night).

"nbadiscussion","t5_3cw3x","I guess this is a pre-comment, hope this is allowed. Maybe I can kickstart the conversation, it‚Äôs hard to actually discuss basketball sometimes on r nba. 

Jason Lloyd, reputable Cavs writer, was on the chris mannix yahoo podcast and they discussed Lebron‚Äôs tendency to take the first game of each series off. He likes to survey the lay of the land, pass to his teammates, work on his jumper. 

That is not a luxury lebron has in this series. If the Cavs go down 2-0 it‚Äôs over, because we aren‚Äôt winning 4/5 in this series. We need to take an early one in oracle. 

The Cavs need to come out with Jeff green on Durant, Lebron on Dray, and lots of switching. Put anyone on Looney‚Äîhe won‚Äôt make you pay. 

If the Houston series showed us anything, it‚Äôs that Durant is the only person who can stop Durant. Single team him, dare him to iso. If he‚Äôs willing to launch 20 footers over smaller guys then you live with that all day. 

If this series is a shootout the Cavs are fucked. They‚Äôre probably fucked anyways, but the model for success here is the 2015 finals. Rock fight. Grind it out, possession by possession. 

My biggest fear for the Cavs is transition defense. Against the Celtics, lebron pouted about missed foul calls and walked back in transition. The Celtics almost beat us partially because of that and now we‚Äôre facing (IMO) the most talented offensive lineup of all time. 

Can‚Äôt wait for the game. Moments like these make me a basketball fan. Can lebron keep this game close? Will G Hill be aggressive? Is Rodney Hood even confirmed to be alive?

&gt;Basic Definition of Parliamentary¬†Government  
&gt;  
&gt;What is a parliamentary government? Generally speaking, parliamentary governments are defined by an absence of clear separation between two key branches of government: the legislative branch, which is responsible for enacting laws, and the executive branch, which is responsible for implementing laws. **Instead, in parliamentary governments, the executive branch is ‚Äúfused with‚Äù and ‚Äúdependent upon‚Äù the legislative¬†branch.**

What makes people think I‚Äôm gonna have so much in common with this group of people just because we‚Äôre the same gender? I‚Äôm comfortable in my gender identity but I am in no way feminine. I typically have more in common with guys if you‚Äôre going to generalize like that.

Most of the time it seems like this is used to give a sense of comfort. Like ‚Äúit‚Äôs just us girls/guys.‚Äù So that somehow magically makes you less self conscious and makes you perfectly comfortable? It‚Äôs fucking stupid. 

I‚Äôm still kinda mad about the last time I had his happen. We were having a group discussion and for whatever reason we were talking about relationships, and in an extremely heteronormative amatonormative way, which as an aro ace person with 0 interest in relationships I just *loved*.

"confession","t5_2qo2a","I think you‚Äôve already acknowledged something important - people who are social are desirable. 

While you can‚Äôt change your looks, looks are not the only thing that matter. I‚Äôve never been a 10 but it hasn‚Äôt stopped me from dating, marrying well, and even a professional model/dancer/actor (not in porn/stripping though there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that either). There is so much to being empathetic, being a good communicator, having good character, dressing well, comportment, etc. that goes into being an attractive person and it took me a long time to get all of that and I‚Äôm still continually working on it. Pretty gives you a small advantage and I won‚Äôt deny that but it‚Äôs as the adage goes ‚ÄúThey may forget what you said ‚Äî but they will never forget how you made them feel.‚Äù What you should take from that is that even though being pretty may stir feelings in another person, you absolutely have the ability to make yourself more attractive. 

When I was growing up, my mother would tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not ugly/dumb‚Äù and she was very deliberate in instructing me on my temperament. It wasn‚Äôt ever done in a way that made me think she thought I was ugly but that there is a lot that goes into how people perceive you. She taught me the importance of social graces and good manners, so much so that I took the initiative early on to study different cultures and particularly, table manners, because there are so many taboos around that. She never let me out of the house in an ugly outfit or makeup but she didn‚Äôt stop me from experimenting either. Trust me when I say a lot of effort goes into crafting an image and a persona and that it works best when you‚Äôre good on the inside first - it might take some time for the outside to catch up but it always shines through. 

The other thing is that your beauty isn‚Äôt contingent upon others‚Äô ability to see it. Just because other people pass you by for someone who is prettier on the outside doesn‚Äôt mean you are ugly or undesirable. Pretty girls have mass appeal but one woman who has a wider appeal than another doesn‚Äôt mean that the one with a more niche appeal is necessarily ugly - a big part of being successful is knowing what audience to play to in the first place.

As it stands, Lucasfilm decided to take the hit financially and release a good movie over-budget than keep Lord and Miller on and release a possibly not-good movie on budget. We can only trust LF that the original cut from Lord and Miller was bad enough to warrant them getting fired, Howard getting brought in, and the movie doubling its budget. 

At any rate, there is one win for Lucasfilm here: fan reception to Solo was surprisingly good, especially in light of the near civil war that occurred after TLJ. It‚Äôs always a good thing for the fans to be back onboard, and if it only costs them $150 million now to do it, they‚Äôll tank that hit and keep on rolling.",1527811476

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; We must consider though that at different times there are different needs for charity. For example, if we can say for the sake of argument that giving money to build a masjid is better charity than buying a gift for your brother generally speaking, then sometimes, it may be that in a particular situation or occasion, giving that gift to him would be better. Why? Because it may be that in that situation, that act will bring other benefits, such as helping keep the ties of kinship (whose importance is EXTREMELY stressed in Islam), giving da'wah and so on. So there may be times where one is better than the other, and other times when the other is better.

I agree with this assessment. 

On the point about the Hierarchy, im not denying some things have been explicitly mentioned to have great rewards, but  I know of no explicitly undeniable hierarchy, such a thing could only be defined by ijtihad and guesswork of someone, its not really completely conclusive, and most likely subjective as others will reach different conclusion.  and as you said, sometime there may be a greater need for one thing over another. if say for example someone(through their own ijtihad) rates giving to orphans lower than building a masjid. what happens when there are more masjids than people and there are hundreds of orphans in need, does one then follow the ijtihad of so and so(the context and circumstances of which one knows not) and build another masjid when there are orphans not looked after, b/c they think that gives more reward based on someone's ijtihad? it would seem to be that where one gives money should be based on need and necessity. a man is going to end up taking so much time deliberating and looking for the one task for which he thinks he will get maximum thawab, imagine he decides when the answer may be that giving money to help a distant family member( as /u/AlbanianDad mentioned) and he is going around looking for a distant cousin while his next door neighbor is in need of help for medical bills. this is why I said find the closest place and the most apparent need and the thing that seems easiest and give there, instead of making things difficult and taking time deliberating and holding off from charity until you find what you think(and its subjective) is the best. you may end up thinking and holding on to the money for months years, and end up not having he opportunity to give at all, afterall one does not know when Malik-Ul-Maut will come..

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","You seem to miss the point of my what my argument was when referencing white supremacy. Nicolas Cruz isn't white. He is latino and jewish, neither of which are white. Thus the comparison of an asian killing in the name of black supremacy. It doesn't really make sense.  In reference to the women sleeping with other men, I cannot understand why he said it because I cannot put myself into his head. However, it is irrelevant because he is not white.

Yeah, the drill would be a great cover. Its kinda like how on 9/11 they happened to be drilling for a hijacking. Thank god there was nothing suspicious about the 9/11 official story and no one questions it. 

Alex jones is a joke. I do not dispute that. Are you familiar with the concept of controlled opposition? Are you aware Alex Jones has already admitted he is playing a role or is an act on his show. His existence helps to discredit any legitimate conspiracies. This is an effective strategy. In practice, it puts forth a legitimate conspiracy and then a bunch of completely bat shit crazy ones. What this does is that for those who may believe in or find plausible the certain legitimate theory then immediately gets associated with him and his other ideas. Thus, the insult ""thats an alex jones tier conspiracy""  and arguments akin to that. This is also whats known as a ""hang out"" or a ""limited hang out"". Research the strategies of disinformation put in place by intel agencies. Its fascinating stuff and quite effective. They spend billions in researching the effects of such strategies.  Its why the crux of you argument is to reference alex jones and compare me to him. 

You are correct, I didn't finish my thought when i thought I had. Thank you, allow me to clarify. I can't speak for others because I have no researched nor looked into them to the extent I have parkland. The vegas shooting stands out to me as well.

The problem was that was his last healthy years, after that he got weird injuries all over to the point where he played only 66, 31 and 35 games in his last three years with the team.

Second, she was in the wrong all the way around, having alcohol as a minor, disorderly conduct, refusing an officers requests, evading arrest, assaulting an officer (more than once). The list is there in chronological order. 

All for what? At worst she might have gotten an appearance citation and had to pay a small fine (depending the local laws), I know this from first hand experience.

So I guess Ford is Morgoth, the cunning dominator and deciever, unless you still think he's good. ""[Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron), one of the [Maiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_(Middle-earth)) of [Aul√´](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB), betrayed his kind and became Morgoth's principal lieutenant."" So I guess Bernard is Sauron, depending on what he does next. ~~And that means that Elsie must be the witch king!~~ Maeve is Aragorn because she's good but up to this point has been focused on her own personal relationship with her daughter, instead of the bigger picture. Soon she'll switch gears and direct that empathy toward saving her whole race. ~~Dolores is actually Boromir because she had good intentions but now is just a corruption of the ring. She'll be redeemed in the end right before she dies.~~ Actually no. Elsie is Frodo\- she's not of the race that inherits the world, but she's their savior. I think she'll become even more empathetic to the hosts, especially considering Bernard is a host. Dolores is clearly Saruman\- Ford's agent of desctruction. Teddy is Grima Wormtounge. Dolores is gonna die by Teddy's hand at the end of Act 2 and now that Ford's back the real battle between Maeve and Ford will happen after that. But in the end it will be Elsie ,who Ford failed to expect, who undoes him. The zombie hosts are the orcs. Oh wait now, Ford's Sauron... uhhh **Bernard is the Witch King.**",1527811480

That said, I don't believe that people have a ""right"" to free medication or reduced cost medication, just because they need it. There is an enormous cost associated with drug research and someone has to bear those costs and the companies still need to have the incentive of possibly hitting the jackpot on something Viagra. Pfizer was able do a hell of a lot more research(on top of getting filthy rich in the process) than they would have been able to if they wouldn't have been able to bring that drug to market for ED even though it had been developed initially as a hypertension drug. 

It's an unfortunate facet of the nature of the beast, but the reality is that if there wasn't money to be made in the industry a hell of a lot less innovation would be going on. Being able to take advantage of the buying power of the collective should help the little guy get his pills, but it doesn't help that things like Medicare Part D expressly forbid the government to negotiate for drug prices, even though they are buying an insane amount of pills. You can blame politicians, the same ones that would be managing a single payer system, for bowing in to major campaign support from the drug industry.  ",1527811481

Before buying any software, check out their tutorials and YouTube, I think it helps get a feel for the process with that software. 

This guy:

https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoNuff93

Does alot of stuff specific to anime studio/moho (same software new name) but has lots of great tips on bone animation in general, rigging and etc.

Also checkout some animation workflow videos on the software you choose, lots of good stuff on YouTube that will give you a massive overview.

This book is the animation Bible: 

The Animator's Survival Kit: A Manual of Methods, Principles and Formulas for Classical, Computer, Games, Stop Motion and Internet Animators https://www.amazon.com/dp/086547897X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_iZieBb5YZ9TMH

It still has lots of good pointers for creating realistic looking animation and stuff game studios need and to my grave I'd suggest anyone interested in animation read it.

Anyway it's not elegant and may not perform all that well, but the way I can think of would probably be drawing the game on surfaces (the application surface, for example) and cutting it up using [2D textured primitives](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/drawing/drawing%20primitives/index.html). Pseudocode would look something like this:

    In the regular Draw event:
        Draw the two views on the application surface side-by-side (as opposed to on top of each other)
    In the Draw GUI event:
        Get the texture of the application surface: https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/surfaces/surface_get_texture.html
        Use 2D textured primitives to draw four triangles, using the applications surface's texture, such that: https://i.imgur.com/vVkP0rO.png

Haven't done split-screen myself so it might not be as easy as I'm making it out to be (read: *probably* won't be as easy as I'm making it out to be) but this should be a start.

^Also ^you ^know ^what ^would ^be ^really ^nice, ^Reddit? ^The ^ability ^to ^embed ^links ^in ^code ^blocks.

Afterthought: you could probably do some really neat picture-in-picture style split screen effects like this, depending on how you draw your triangles. Whether this is a good idea or not is another matter entirely.",1527811482

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","I've been thinking about this for a while.  

I've always supported gays and lesbians, from the first time someone called me a lesbian, then had to explain what a lesbian was! (True story, this was in the early 90s, before the internet was a Thing and I was very naive and sheltered.)

To my teenaged mind, since the people who didn't like me, also disliked gays and lesbians, then obviously I was going to annoy them by being a supporter of gay rights! (In the early 90s, in a small, rural, conservative farm and ranch community in Texas. Yes, im contrary.)

Over the years, I met and befriended people in the gay community and never wavered in my support. I even called myself queer for several years while trying to figure out what was going on with my own orientation and needs. 

I read a lot about the T in lgbt, but while being homosexual or bisexual made sense, being trans....didnt. It didnt matter how often someone - including transfolk- tried to explain...it was like watching a movie with a gaping plot hole that no one else seemed to notice. It just didn't make sense, not the way it was being presented with gender and sex and all the rest.

Recently I read a post equating disphoria to a mental illness, saying a disphoric brain needs certain hormones - usually hormones opposite of what their body produces - to be healthy and balanced. That their brain also needs certain physical tics or signs to sustain mental stability.

Now THAT makes sense to me. I am bipolar and deal with various family members with mental illnesses and as a teacher, I can point to my students with similar issues. I get quirks, tics, I get needing certain rituals or arrangements to be happy and secure. 

When I view transgenderism as a mental illness, with transition as a needed therapy, then it makes sense, because I know what its like to have whackadoodle brain chemistry and the lengths I go to keep everything under control. I can sympathize and support that.

However, all that being said, being trans and the needs of the transgender community does not trump being a woman or the needs of women.

I can sympathize with mental illness, but not when that mental illness is used to degrade and harm women. 

I can accept transition as a therapy, but only as a last resort, only after other options have been tried and never on children. 

I can accept that transwomen as a group are vulnerable and need support, but that support cannot come at the expense  of women. 

I can accept that certain phrases and words can be triggering (raise your hand if there are words or phrases that make your skin crawl)  but as an adult human, its your job to grow the fuck up and deal like everyone else, not expect everyone to cater to you.

I can accept that the trans community is small and like gay and lesbian activists before them, they have to be loud and abrasive to get their voices heard, but if you want allies, you also have to be an ally, esp to women. 

What I cannot accept is the idea that transwomen are women. I hated being a girl, dislike being called a woman,  rarely even think of myself as a woman, but that doesnt change the fact that I am. That I am treated like a woman, socialized like a woman and face the same threats as other women. 

Transwomen are transwomen and they face unique obstacles and issues , most of which are very different from those faced by women. There's no reason why women and transwomen can't be strong allies in the fight for safety and equality.

Except that that's not good enough for transactivists and I'm tired of the whiny little brats. I'm an elementary teacher and spend all  day trying to teach the three Rs (readin', 'ritin' and 'rythmatic to those who don't know teacher humor)  to my kids as well as more nebulous concepts like compassion, empathy, and sharing. If my students can (sometimes) get it, so should freakin' adults, 'second puberty' due to hormones is no excuse.",1527811483

My favorite thing while I recovered was getting my hair washed and braided. I paid for a ride (I couldn't drive) to have it done 4 times the first month. You can't really reach to wash your hair but you can't bend forward so a salon was the only way to have clean hair. I talked with my stylist before and we figured out a deal so it wouldn't break the bank to have it done.

Like. I could guess the next Mario Bros. game will be called Mario 2020 and will feature running and jumping mechanics with a competitive multiplayer element.

1. Innovations I would say is moving to the cloud, but we are creating our own cloud to host everything on premise. This gives us the most control of access which is important when dealing with ITAR regulations.

2. Which ties into ethics perfect since you can go to prison for breaking ITAR regulations (look this up). Being in IT means you are the gate keeper of access to all employees. Our background check is very significant for IT employees. Consequences are fines for the company and possible jail time for you. 

3. Straight forward 

1. Line of work is ok, want to be a systems admin, almost there. Place I work is awesome. I work at a rocket company. Free drinks, snacks, and sometimes beer. Bring your dog to work, pretty cool. Never downtime.

2. It depends on the task. Some tickets take a minute. Sometimes I need to order and configure 50 workstations and it takes 3 weeks.

1. I worked with the same title while going to school. School got me a couple certs and more pay. 

2. I try not to work when I'm at home

Because it's comes off like that's the only reason is was brought up, to distract from a man abusing a woman. That's the belittling. That diminishes the importance of the issue. Talk about it on its own (and I so very fucking rarely see that, in general; which is fucking sad as hell, because we do need to talk about it, but we do not need to take over other issues in order to do that). Talking about it is not diminishing the issue of plight of women; talking about it ONLY in the middle of discussions about the plight of women is (to both women and the male rape victims). You yourself only brought it up because this man got a harsh sentence, ""Would he have gotten that if he were a woman?"" That's insulting to both these real victims in the case, and to male rape victims in general. Because it gives off the impression that you don't actually give a fuck about either of the issues, you're just using it to derail a conversation about what women face. 

Most male rape victims don't want the issue to be used as a way to derail or distract from cases of women being abused by men. ",1527811486

Batman, who is defined by his no-kill rule and hatred of guns? Kills people with guns with no explanation or real backstory beyond looking at a graffiti-covered costume. If your character's central traits only exist in subtext and interviews... he's a bad character.

Superman, the beacon of hope? A few scenes with operatic score and people treating him as Jesus does not convey that, imo, but that's a more subjective thing, people have already elaborated upon how badly done Superman has been in the DCEU. 

A bad creative decision is doing the Death of Superman in his second movie (which he was already sharing with Batman) and bringing him back a year later because they realised they wasted one of his most iconic storylines before the Justice League was formed.

I was driving a 2012 Fusion, nearly paid off.   It was a great car that I bought right after starting in my professional career out of college(my college beater had died a few months earlier and I'd been borrowing my parents' extra car).    

By last summer, I was making about $70k and decided that I wanted to finally let myself have a truck.   It would enable me to participate in more of my hobbies, and I grew up with trucks and love them.  I started looking at '11-15 F-150's in the 20-25K price range...but ended up test driving a '15 in the new body style....and fell in love.   I took a few months to shop for the right deal(and the right truck) and bought mine for $31k.   I actually had the cash to buy it outright, but because I got a good rate(2.49% on 6 years), I financed it to preserve liquidity(wanting to buy a home this year, didn't want to piss away my downpayment).     So I paid off my Fusion, sold it to a relative, and am now happily enjoying my truck.  No regrets.   The payment is $460 a month, but I'm paying $1500 because I can.   I'm about half-way paid off, only a year into ownership.   I'll probably slow it up a little bit once I buy my house this summer.   

If you can afford it while still working towards your other long-term goals, I'd say do it.   We all encourage learning delayed gratification, but if you're being financially responsible there is nothing wrong with enjoying some of the fruits of your labor now.    ",1527811488

Pros: 

Solid contact and power for such a pitching focused team. The 1-5 guys are great. 

The first two starting pitchers are pretty good as well. 

The real strength of the team however, lies in the bullpen. They're all amazing, and the closer is the literal best player in the game, points wise. You can afford to take your starters out for pinch hits or if they get into trouble. There's no downside here.

Cons: 

Poor speed and defense is a bad combo. You'll give up a lot of doubles to the gaps, and grounders will make it into the outfield frequently. Also, a terrible catcher leads to a lot of singles turning into extra bases. You definitely need to be on your A game when pitching.

The bottom of the lineup is also pretty poor, especially the catcher in the 8 spot. Honestly, probably the worst player in the game for their position. The 4th starter also isnt great, but with the bullpen this can be mitigated. 

Overall, they're a small ball team that won't give up a lead once they get it, but conversely struggle to come back when down.",1527811489

So a better way to measure it would be to look at how many industrial and service jobs there were in the US before FTA‚Äôs and how many after. Then you can look at where they went and the average pay of the job that ex-employees had to go too.

They wouldn‚Äôt have stayed unemployed, simply gone into low paid and low skilled jobs. The problem with manufacturing is that once the jobs go overseas their employees are likely to old and not wealthy enough to retrain, so they end up in these dead end jobs - probably on zero hour contracts.

It‚Äôs likely to be a slow trickle as well, wouldn‚Äôt have happened over night - remember when Oreo and that company trump promised to save went to Mexico just in the last 24 months? That‚Äôs a direct result of free trade. It‚Äôs cheaper to set up shop over seas and ship the product back to the home country than it is to continue in the US. So, the effects are still being felt - it‚Äôs a long term thing, not a short term one that can be measured by x mount of jobs before a presidency and y amount of unemployment after.

We really won't. There are two axis to this, let's call them Religion's Influence and Religious Equality.

We want Religion's Influence to be very low. This is across the board, and applies to all religions. Mystic Cults have no place in running a logical and civilized society.

However, we want Religious Equality to be high. If the government is going to treat one Mystic Cult one way, and others in diminished ways, this creates a scenario where the powerful religion grabs for more and more political power while alienating and demonizing rival religions. See what has happened here in the US of A.

Ideally, we want all religions to be politically unimportant private systems of belief, that certain folks with a need for such ""spiritual guidance"" can ascribe to should they feel necessary, and for all these belief systems to be treated equally.

Does that help clarify?

The writers should inform the rest of the team so the animators can estimate their capabilities and create a product with a reasonable threshold of quality. IF the animators judge that they do not have the manpower, time or resources to effectively do a scene or otherwise hold the quality of all the scenes to the pre-established threshold, the writers should alter the writing to allow for something more plausible given the circumstances.

With the above in mind, the writers must present a clear vision of what is to happen so the animators (or animation director) can distribute their resources accordingly throughout the production process. The script itself does not need to be completed, but the animators must be aware of all that is expected from them during production so they can allocate resources accordingly. If they deem it unlikely to reach the intended quality threshold, the writers must rewrite the events so they are plausible for the animators. ",1527811492

theres just so many things that come up in quick succession, the sounds and sights of an object coming down from the sky, the 4 angels with 4 wings each that are held out straight while flying and folded flat while landed does sound like a quadcopter unit, then the wheels come out and the description is perfect for omniwheels, and the descriptions of all the materials, the eyes, the lights on the belts that look like ""rubys with fire within"" the ship takes ezekiel up with it and flies him around etc etc etc

and then those kids built that carcopter and you see what an organic and sensible and useful design it is and yes i couldn't help buy say hmmmmmmmm

its the only ancient astronaut case that makes me wonder really. maybe the sumerian stuff too but they dont have anything like this to point at.

is there any benefit to a quadcopter having 4 blades on each motor vs 2? would that make any sense on a ship like this? i was wondering if that points to credibility or nonsense at all.

The first CL double then threepeat in history is going to be a very, very tough act to follow. My guess is the direct replacement has a rough year or two, gets sacked, then the next manager has a better time. I could obviously be wrong, just my opinion",1527811493

By the time Hebrews is written (and intended for its specific audience, as are all the other letters), one must probably consider the intent, the audience, and what little we can surmise about the author.

Second, raw economic self interest of those who hold power here -- employers. They don't want to have to pay for what they see as non-productive employees. (Never mind that a rested employee who feels valued is more productive when there; that's too forward thinking for many employers.)  Third, there is still lingering ambivalence about women in the workplace; even today some people feel that the man should go to work, the woman should stay home and raise children and parental leave makes it easier for people to not follow that pattern.  This last point is changing, but not fast enough (in my ever so humble opinion).

I'd like to throw a bit of my own somewhat more cynical and less PR-friendly experience on top of that though.

First off the bottom pair of green arrows are probably only really applicable to the top 1-5% of players. Most everyone else won't get enough ""very high"" scoring games to really matter. I'd personally guess that that threshold is somewhere around 5-600 match score based on events and my own personal experience.

Second Paul threw in a very specific caveat there, which is 'slightly positive win ratio' which is, to be frank, not something everyone is going to get. I played World of Tanks while I was away from MWO and let me tell you there are some people who will never break 45% let alone 50% win rate, and really there's quite a lot of them. WoT has a *lot* of player stat tracking through their API and player efforts, and the average win rate in that game (thanks to draws) is about 49.5%. 51% is, statistically, above average and not just among new players.

At a guess I'd say MWO's average win rate among active players is probably closer to 50-51% thanks to almost no chance of a draw in most matches and the effect of players going inactive, but that still leaves a lot of room for players to plateau below Tier 1.",1527811498

I don't want to punish people for sex, you can stretch that clown-car vagina of yours all you want cunt, and i'm glad you provide a cheap and easily available cum sponge for men out there. The world needs thot sluts. If there was no other contraception available except for abortions, i'd say fair enough. But there is a plethora of options, you just want to be totally irresponsible and not have any consequences. Sorry cunt doesn't happen in the real world. Daddy may be paying for your education right now and mummy takes you to the scrape clinic to get rid of the kid you don't want but in the real world you'll be held accountable.

&gt; NO woman needs to justify to you

Yes I agree, i  don't want woman justifying themselves to me i could give a shit, but now we have a third party: This is what your missing, you keep thinking it's about me imposing my will because you yourself are so self-centered you can't even comprehend someone would be arguing for something on behalf of the innocent (the baby child) who CANNOT argue on their own behalf. How fucking self centered are you to deny someone to experience life. 

&gt; Risk death exxageration and dogma word thrown in like i'm super scholary

LOL risk death, you risk death every day, you're more likely to die in a car crash than you are in pregnancy,  the facts simply prove you've really got no leg to stand on  (and if you had to stand, that would mean having to stand and you're busy right now in a gang bang)
lol DOGMA, you fucking retard. a dogma has to be seen as an absolute moral principal, think ten commandments dumbass (you do know what  they are right?) Abortion is a much more complicated topic which is exactly why I have already granted that in cases of rape that they should be allowed. Dogma. You are the only one that is dogmatic, dogmatic to your avoidance of responsibility and accountability no matter who else pays.


You've been an insufferable  cunt who is the textbook example of why i cannot stand feminists. Always the victim, never responsible, never accountable, wanting to do whatever she wants then telling us we can't dare question her morality  because of it.

The legend was about a house in the Virgin Islands that had a pool underneath it connecting to the ocean. It turns out the house was actually used in NASA experiments in the 60s where scientists attempted to learn to communicate with dolphins in the hopes that the methods could be used to one day learn to communicate with aliens. Of course, like a lot of experiments at the time, LSD was involved. 
As it became more apparent that the project was going nowhere, it lost funding, but one woman carried on by herself. She flooded the upper level of the house and used a crane to lift the most promising dolphin, a young male, inside to spend 24 hours a day with it. Being a young male, it had certain needs, and when he inevitably started to get frisky, she would give him 'manual stimulation' to calm him down.

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","&gt;Companies failing is part of how capitalism works.

Yeah, what I should've said was that early capitalist societies failed, just like early socialist ones or early feudalist societies ect. Essentially everytime society has undergone an ideological/systemic change. In fact, mentioning companies failing is one of the causes that capitalism will eventually fail. It contributes to the accumulation of capital in the hands of fewer and fewer people(top 1% own more than the bottom 99%, 80% of people live on under $10 a day, that stuff). As well as that capitalism has proven to be incredibly unstable, prone to fluctuations of boom and bust, with recessions occurring every 4-8 years. Economist Richard Wolff talks about this a lot, I suggest you watch him. 

&gt;And those old primitive communes were very inefficient and could only support a very small population.

I wasn't talking about efficiency, or how many people they could support. I was talking about it in relation to the claim that capitalism is human nature. Of course primitive communism couldn't have lasted, the means of production weren't developed enough, that's why human society naturally goes through phases dependent on the means of production(basically historical materialism). Primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and communism is the natural development of human kind, capitalism is a necessary stage in human history. Now back to efficiency after that brief intro to historical materialism. In order for full communism to be established, the means of production have to be developed enough in order to support a global communist society. This is why previous modes of production are necessary because each develops the means of production in their own way. We're in the late stage of capitalism, we [currently produce enough food for everyone](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html), we [have enough homes to house everyone](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-skip-bronson/post_733_b_692546.html) and we [can easily produce life saving medicine for all who need it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJufEfWifqo). Essentially, our current means of production are developed enough for communism. Besides, there's enough proof that our current society is ready for communism, previous revolutions have been overall successful, and no, I'm not talking about the USSR, China, etc. I'm talking about revolutions which achieved communism or socialism. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YitdjMORoU) video gives a brief overview of previous communist revolutions, and the history of anarchism/anarcho-communism. ",1527811501

Precedent is what my whole argument has been about. If all it takes is one offended group to legislate a category of speech *then that is the precedent being set*. Any future group that is offended by your use or refusal to use their words has C16 *as their precedent* to do the same. That is what precedent means. 

Precedent doesn't mean ""X law is causing people to get locked up now"" (which is your whole argument). It means *X law sets the precedent for other similar laws*. C16 sets the *precedent* for laws that restrict *other* speech and all that is required to do so is being offended. That's the wider view counterargument. 

I was avoiding using that word because I was sure you'd accuse me of the ""slippery slope"" as soon as I used it but precedent, which you claim to care about, is the core of the whole C16 debate.

How about writers and directors Norman Corwin, Helen Deutsch, and Bill Spier. How about Danny Kaye, Mel Allen, Gerald Mohr, Elliot Lewis, Byron Kane, Lurene Tuttle, Paula Winslowe, Joseph Kearns, and Arthur Q. Bryan?

On Breaking Walls Episode 80, we present an in\-depth look at Forecast featuring interviews, insights, and episode moments.

So, that burning *hunger* you feel in your stomach is addiction. Your body wants it's fix... and it'll do everything in it's power to convince you that you need to eat or you're gonna starve.

My solution to this is:

1. Reminding myself that this will get easier and easier \(which I know because of deep research. Maybe you need to dive in to the research to fully understand what's going on at every milestone\). I guess you can call it faith?
2. Keep my 32 oz jug filled with water next to me always \(I drink 4\-5 of these per day\).
3. Breathing and mindfulness exercises as well as yoga, proper sleep, and good music to quiet the reptilian part of the brain. Closing my eyes and chilling out for 2\-3 minutes always does the trick for me.

Normally this balances, because the mass of the ice will only displace an equivalent mass of liquid water, a smaller volume. The rest of the ice sticks up out of the water. So when it melts, the level doesn't change, because the amount of ice ""under water"" is only occupying as much space as the *entire thing* would occupy melted.

If you force the entire ice under water, then it is taking up more space than liquid water would. So as it melts and becomes liquid water, the level drops.

How about this? It's a fun movie. It *feels* like the original trilogy, from the visuals, to the story, to the aliens, to the humor, without being a copy of the trilogy. It expands the universe by showing you new locations, and locations you've heard of but never seen. It's a story I didn't know I wanted, and it informs Han's characterization and  in my opinion, makes watching Harrison Ford in the OT even better, in the same way that Rogue One made A New Hope even better for me. It made me love Chewbacca even more and I didn't think that was possible. It has a hundred little references that you could spend a whole viewing just looking for those.I left the theater wanting more. More of this actor as Han, more Qi'ra, more Lando, heck, even more Enfyss Nest. It's just fun and made me feel a little bit like watching Star Wars as a kid, in a way that the sequel trilogy hasn't yet (not that I dislike the ST).

"EternalCardGame","t5_3byur","I think that an opinion that a game can be built without rotation comes from a position of experience and privilege. I don't think it's crazy that someone would prefer a format that plays like Modern, Legacy, or Vintage--a lot of great Magic players like these formats far more than Standard. But as an experienced player, its easy to forget how intractable, difficult, and downright *unfair* these formats appear to a less experienced player. It's most obvious with Vintage: the concept of a turn 0 kill sounds absolutely crazy to a new player--the fact that you have to be able to interact with someone before you've *even had a turn yet* is so fundamentally weird and outside someone's expectations for a card game. Obviously these things don't exist in Legacy and Modern, but the effect is similar. The larger a format is, the more it demands of your rules and game knowledge to even play proficiently (not even *well*, just *proficiently*) and the more experience you have to have to really appreciate the intricacies of the format.

CCGs need a Standard-sized format as the jumping-off point for newer players. While the debate over what really should be the de facto competitive format is a little more complicated, a rotating format is absolutely necessary for the core play experience, because the inevitable power creep of a nonrotating format is simply not sustainable for the new player experience.",1527811507

You don't get to credibly pretend in 2018 not to be aware of the cultural baggage associated with comparing black people to apes. Here is a good paragraph on it though:

&gt;It's amazing anyone needs to explain the difference in 2018, but here we go: Slaveholders, white supremacists, and segregationists have for centuries argued that black people are ""advanced apes"" in order to justify enslaving, mistreating, or segregating themselves from black people. Similar comments have been used for centuries to dehumanize and demean black people. The same has not been done to white people. Somehow, after Barr's meltdown this week, sections of the online right are pretending this history somehow doesn't exist.

"niceguys","t5_2rvxp","I can only speak from my own experience (of being roofied, not doing the roofying)

I actually had a ""friend"" who I had for years. She was decades older than me and I trusted her, for whatever reason. We decided to go to a town about 100km north for some drinks and a night stay. Long story short, 2 guys came to talk to us. Me being a rude bitch, I didn't pay much attention to either of them and kept trying to make excuses to leave to another table. Anyway, my friend got me a drink while at the bar with these guys. I didn't think anything of it as she actually passed me her own drink. About 40 minutes later her and I went 5o the bathroom and she said ""kinda feels like I'm on something"" and I looked at myself in the mirror and felt.. weird, to say the least. 
.anyway, night became blurry blah blah blah. Wake up at some ridiculous hour to a horrific act and I was vomiting and choking on my vomit. Woke up to her screaming at me. 

Anyways, years later my boyfriend saw her out at a pub and she didn't realise who he was with his mates. She proceeded to try and sell them roofies.

Not hard to put two and two together. My ""friend"" spiked me herself and no doubt had it preplanned with these guys and put on a big act. 

Well executed stunt cos I'm sure she got a pretty penny for it. 

I honestly hope she dies and I love hearing through the grapevine that her life is still up to shit. Evil cunt.",1527811508

I not just angry at the strike in general, I'm specifically angry about how the union and it's members are conducting themselves. You can't expect people to take your demands seriously if you're acting like a circus clown while protesting, you're a representative your union and your cause. It doesn't matter if she intends to portray the union or herself in a negative light, she's doing both. Even if 90% of the drivers don't notice her the York community is paying attention to what is going on here and this just makes the school look like more of a joke. 

3903 has displayed a number of examples of gross unprofessionalism during the strike and what worse is that they've recorded it and shared it all themselves as if they're having the time of their lives, which I don't doubt that a few radicals are. The more unprofessional behaviour displayed the more it seems like it's a game to certain factions of the union. ",1527811509

Was stuck in SoCal (Inland Empire) during the '08 Finals.  During Game 4, the shitty hotel I was in had a power failure in the 2nd quarter.  You could hear guys groaning up and down the hall as we all had the game disappear from our TVs.

Emergency generator goes on; the only working TV is in the lobby. 

So guys are congregating in this Hampton Inn's lobby, in various stages of ""business guy nearly undressed for bed"" attire, cheering on their beloved Lakers.

Except me, Masshole in the Back.  

Had on a C's shirt, and got a lot of shit from these dudes, but they were mostly good guys.

And then The Comeback.  Picture it - they're in their undershirts and khakis, watching that shit unfold.  And so am I, except I'm no longer the butt of their cheerful jibes, I'm beginning to get hugely psyched for THE GREATEST FINALS COMEBACK EVAR.

And they're fucking dying.  It was like a wake in there.  No more jokes.  Just me sitting with fifteen random Lakers fans, watching their souls crumple after having them dish up a half hour of smack talk.

There were maybe four or five of them left by the end.  I now know how ""fuck this!"" sounds in several different SoCal accents.  (Surfer Dude; Bakersfield Cowboy; Ventura Agri Guy; Sherman Oaks Yuppie).

Honestly, I think it might have been better than being there in person.  It was so beautiful I still get weepy thinking about it.",1527811510

Hadanna is essential to kill several Fantasy bosses (and probably useable on Memoir ones). Having her starred up may help her survivability, but as her whole purpose is to keep the team just above fatal health, extra stars aren't all that useful on her (damage output is pretty negligible, and her other skills are mostly useless in boss fights), but 4* for Hadan may be more useful than 5* lana

Otherwise, I've always felt Ada could get nasty if they give her a solid awakening/skin. She does high magic damage, and as a front BG she can always use more stars for extra health, but she's pretty far out of meta right now

Assume you set up an iron butterfly with a spread of $3 on both the call and put side like this:

Is your max loss limited to your premium received less the difference between the strike prices ($300), the premium paid for the OTM buys, and commissions?

You can and should feel empowered to pick the vendors you feel comfortable with and who you trust. 

Most examples of trusting your planner vs. micromanaging are for day-of things. Like, how the place cards will be set up in relation to the centerpieces. Or how each end of aisle candle display should be (two bigs and a small in this specific way). Or which order the family portraits should be in. Those are all types of things that can and will maybe change on the day of the event because maybe the flow is better that way or maybe there is one more row than expected so the candles are different, or maybe the centerpieces look weird with the place cards by the champagne and then should be put on top of the napkin.

&gt; 
&gt; Herein lies my point, more directly addressed in my 2nd reply... The culture in Europe fosters riding, even from a very young age. That does not happen in the US. The US is very much a ""we must protect our kids from the dangers of motorcycles"" parenting style.

You're sort of willfully ignoring the reality - people perceive riding as being dangerous regardless of the culture. They aren't wrong. It is dangerous. 

Motorcycles are more common place because there is a more natural progression in European culture, that more natural progression being scooters. 

The amount of helicopter parenting is the same, but the result is different due to it being more economical and far more importantly, applicable.

The worries of danger tend to fall by the wayside when they make sense financially. In the US, they don't.

That money is yours and you *need* it, as you say to keep from living out of the car. 

Your parents are accustomed to whining for money and getting it. If you were starving on the street and you found 10 dollars, do you think your parents would want to take it from you?

Btw, did you ever consider using an actual Hex board? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) i.e. one with only 4 edges. I can see it maybe being more interesting since there are less symmetry lines and thus more distinctly different hexes. Especially on small boards having 4 corners might also be better than having 6.

Just looking at your policies - they look as though they are on a 'level' premium structure - and you took them out in 2015. This means that you would not be able to get anything close to those kind of premiums now, as level premiums dont increase as much as normal 'stepped' premiums - and 3 years down the track, you would need to take out new insurance, which completely goes against why you would take out more expensive 'level premiums. So you wouldnt look at getting anything more 'competitive.' You can, however, get rid (or decrease) sums insured if you desire - seems as though you would be able to, looking at your situation.

Are there exceptions like Jeremy Lin? Of course, and we love him for that. But to say that, **on average**, there are zero physiological differences between people of different races, or that these physiological differences don't impact performance, is just disingenuous. In that same way, I'm sure there are sports where Asian people have an advantage in because of their physiology (gymnastics perhaps, where having a lighter weight can be beneficial?)

You can look for foods/litters that offer rewards programs (Purina and Fresh Step each have rewards programs that are points-based), and Chewy is a good place to get better prices on a lot of things. How much and what kind really depends on your kitty (not trying to have a cop-out answer, but I sort of buy my cat new supplies whenever I'm running low, which varies depending on which items are in stock/on sale, rather than a scheduled timeline). 

A lot of things will be one-off (or just a few times in the cat's life) costs (litter box, food bowls, toys, scratching posts, grooming stuff, carrier). Obviously, you should replace these as needed, but I'd set aside a chunk of money for when you first get your cat to cover these costs, and then work on a monthly budget.

I'd also advise some sort of pet insurance, whether it be official pet insurance, or just depositing a certain amount a month into a bank account to use for emergencies.

I also notice the supply drops sometimes have TONS within a very, very small radius. I‚Äôve knocked down 4 within 2 minutes with zero contest. That shouldn‚Äôt happen. They need to be spread out a little more, in both space and time.

"Stationeers","t5_3j9tm","There are so many great ideas here. My apologies if I repeat any. These are my observations after 60 hours of game play and only just getting to setting up to capture gasses.

\- Floor hatches. I have frames under the first floor used as routing passages for pipe. I cover these with floor grates. I hate having to break one to jump down and then use jet pack to get back out. If I'm out of jet pack fuel then I have to then break walls and hack my way out. Adding flush hinged hatch as a would be great.

\- Ladders. A single block access to the other levels. Or down like from the hatch I mentioned above. Stairs are currently two\-blocks long and don't fit in my base design.

\- Elevators. Option 1, main elevator object with doors and car present, option 2 the shaft section, option 3 Main with doors but without car. Perhaps just an up or down button to cycle through the main stops.

\- Grief protection. It would be great to have more unpassworded servers to visit. A host or admin could grant build access. Other players could simply help dig and deposit ore while not being able to build...or just visit and look around. Visiting players could ask to join the build. Right now I haven't seen a server list which tells me how to request access. Surely this is already on someones TODO list...but mentioning to reinforce the need.

\- Craft\-able battery\-charger. You only get one...which makes it difficult to have multiple bases on a single server.",1527811525

And Jacques Cartier in 1917 bought the building of his store on 5th Avenue in New York, giving two strings of beads. Often a pearl necklace was an indispensable part of the dowry, the most expensive thing in the casket and the last resort to get money in case of urgent need.

The fact is that in modern times pearls kept on rising and rising in price - for example, during the first half of the 17th century it tripled in price, and by the cost of turnover at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, it even stood in the first place among the jewels. So, a pair of earrings-zhuzhuzhin, which in 1821 the Grand Duke Nikolay Pavlovich (the future emperor) bought, cost 29 thousand rubles - a colossal sum for those times.

Hex is a strategy board game for two players played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11√ó11 rhombus. Players alternate placing markers or stones (Go stones make ideal playing pieces) on unoccupied spaces in an attempt to link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain. One player must win; there are no draws. The game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.

However it does not take 30 days, it used to take up to 3 months but lately the time have gone up to 5-6 months. As of right now USCIS is looking into the ones received in December 10 2017 ( [sauce](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/ ) (choose i765, National Benefits Center ) .
Starting this year also they will send your SSN with your EAD if your opt to, so there is no more adding waiting time for that)

You can go straight to a green card interview on a k1 on less time, or sometimes they don‚Äôt even send you to an interview and you will get your greencard right away. Or it can take more than 1 year. 

Anecdotally I moved on a K1. My EAD arrived about 115 days after USCIS received our process, I started a job about  3 weeks after that, honestly I work with tech so it‚Äôs easier and there is always job, but some of those K1 fianc√© the shows is portraying still have some struggles with English as well as not being high skilled. 

Depending upon how much you‚Äôre making you‚Äôre not really adding that much into your households so it‚Äôs better to invest on a higher education/trade school than spend that time working minimum wage. Also most of them want the American spouse to support them.

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","&gt; I just love making people so angry without ever doing anything but pressing the square button

This type of mindset (in anything, not just games) is just so confusing to me.

Serious question as I'm trying to understand, not start an argument or anything;

You get off on making other people miserable/angry, Why? Why does other people's misery give you satisfaction? Why does ruining someone else's experience with something bring you satisafaction?

Anecdotal questions; 

Is your own life experience that pathetic/sad? Are you someone who just gets off to the misery of other people like some sort of sociopath? Did someone wrong you in some way and you feel the need to wrong others as some sort of coping mechanism? Is your ego so fragile that you need to make people in a video game feel terrible to make yourself feel better? What is it exactly?

I'll never understand this mindset with video games and gamers in general. In any other medium you'd be considered as having a serious mental issue or labeled as a sociopath for saying something like this.

I just don't get it. But then again there is so much I don't truly understand in regards to other human's mentality.",1527811528

"networking","t5_2qkaf","&gt; 1) Capturing graphs/statistics of overall link utilisation.

Precisely what are you measuring to produce data on link utilization? Over what time period do you average data? What level of utilization is considered saturated or approaching saturation?

I'm not being snarky--I really don't understand.

For example: I suspect a certain (real) link needs upgrade, based on three things:

1. Several reports of intermittent slowness from clients accessing both sides of the link
1. Nonzero output drops on most interfaces in the pathway between affected endpoints
1. A general intuition that 1Gbps is simply not enough for this kind of traffic

I'm looking at a graph from SolarWinds Orion for the main interface in this pathway. Over the past 3 months it shows average tx/rx around 250Mbps and spikes of max utilization at around 750Mbps.

Looking purely at the graph it seems like we have lots of headroom and we're nowhere near justifying 10Gbps. From what little I know, I feel strongly inclined to the contrary: that 10Gbps is mandatory. But I can't prove that in concrete terms. And maybe I'm wrong.

&gt; Alright, I'm not taking issue with any of the claims in the paper except that the SOV and MOE functions are separable.

He didn't say they were separable, but you wouldn't know because you didn't read it. 

&gt;And you yourself are claiming it never actually even meant to say that, despite you claiming that they are separable (which I then took issue with you for, not the paper you claimed didn't make that claim).

I didn't claim this and neither does the paper. Strawman harder.

&gt;Unlike you, I do not have the hubris to imagine that I can time the market. 

Just looking for a rough estimate on a deadline. Not exact timing. 1 year out? 5 years? Never?

&gt;All I said was when the market dictates the hashrate will abandon the BTC chain, and that will be its death warrant. 

Users (hodlers) dictate profitability, not miners themselves.

&gt;That is a fact. I do not know when it will actually happen, simply that it will.

You *know* this will happen? And you claim you don't have hubris? Lol.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","Our voting blocs, except for the federal Senate, are equal in population -- +/- 10%, and anything approaching 10% is going to be getting some serious legal challenges.

The population density of King County, WA, for example, simply means it will have many more representatives -- they have a bit less than 1/3rd the population of Washington State and something like 14/49 state legislative seats...the numbers are close to the proportion of population.

The Republican/Democrat split nationwide is tempered by rural / urban divide -- urban areas are more intensely left wing than rural areas are right wing which hurts Democrats ""vote efficiency"" -- those 14/49 districts in King County may be voting 70-80% or more Democrat...while only a handful of Republican districts are that intensely Republican and many are voting Republican 55-45.  So Democrats rack up more votes but fewer seats.  

Folks complaining about Republican gerrymandering largely advocating for replacing it with Democrat gerrymandering like recently happened in Pennsylvania where a redistricting plan imposed by the (elected, Democratic majority) state Supreme Court consistently put their thumb on the Democratic side of the scales when deciding how to fix what was clearly a strongly Republican gerrymander.  Neither party advocates a technocratic solution of simply creating districts based on (1) Census Tracts (which are designed to be about 4,000 residents in size); (2) arranged in the most geographically compact form possible to (3) create the most equal in population districts in a state ... this wouldn't favor the Republicans quite as heavily as some state gerrymanders currently do, but it also would not radically change the situation for Democrats due to the voting efficiency problem.",1527811532

"WoT","t5_2rdg1","&gt; Someone else pointed out I was wrong about balefire, and I am not sure how I missed it

You weren't wrong - you just referred to the idea put forth in the text by some character (was it Moiraine? I don't remember offhand). But that was their opinion, not a hard fact. They were mistaken. 

&gt; If humans give in to dark emotions, the dark one gains control over the pattern and the wheel and has his way with reality

Not really. The way to opening the Bore back in AoL was mostly paved by strive for bettering the human condition and uplifting the society. Noble goals and feelings, if anything. 

&gt; And again, Mashadar... where did that come from? It wasn't the dark one. It wasn't the creator. It wasn't the power. 

The text does not give a clear answer, so we are left to guess more or less. This power was surely channeled by the people, but nothing rules out the possibility of it originating from either One or True power. Since all magical phenomena in WOTverse tie in to one or the other (or both), it's a safe bet. 

&gt; Is it a coincidence that the Finn who feed on emotion and the one power are reality manipulators? 

Finn don't feed on emotion, though - they primarily feed by leeching One Power off channelers, which is what was done to M in the tower while she was imprisoned. This bargain game is not representative of their society at large, it's just a convention that they have signed back in Age of Legends after their first encounters with humanity.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","There's no benefit to the US in becoming a bi-lingual nation. Indeed I'd argue that the US should press to eliminate Spanish as a commonly spoken language and have English be a nation-wide official language for a few reasons:

* Putting Spanish as near equal-footing as English leads to a lot of unnecessary work for the government including translating laws, getting bi-lingual teachers, bi-lingual signs, etc. 

* Spanish has no real cultural significance to the majority of the US, all major works of American literature have been written in English, the constitution was written in English, the laws of the US are written in English, we've never had a (primarily) Spanish speaking president 

* Depending on the state, Spanish is either a major language or a minor one, some states such as Maine have less than 1% of their population as Spanish speaking, while others such as North Dakota have Spanish at nearly identical languages such as German 

* Spanish has no real chance of really disappearing, this isn't like, say learning Irish in Ireland or learning Gaelic in Scotland or Welsh in Wales and Spanish doesn't have the cultural heritage as those Celtic languages do 

Spanish should be begrudgingly accepted, but should not be encouraged -- I don't see that the US has anything to benefit from being a bi-lingual nation.

It's no secret that upstate NY is suffering. Outside of NYC more people are moving out of the state than in due to high taxes and low employment opportunity. Businesses have instead left to places like TX. The majority of farming in upstate NY isn't in that great of shape either. It's been like this for at least twenty years now but the Democrats don't pay much attention to upstate in comparison with NYC and it's problematic. 

Fact is, if Republicans hitch their wagon this time to Trump it'll hurt them in upstate. They should stick with their tried and true mantra of ""Democrats and NYC don't care about you, we do"".

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; punitive measures are for the most part uncalled for.

I disagree.

&gt; Do even you find that convincing?

Absolutely I do. The lengths some people will go to migrate is almost unfathomable. We are always striving for something better. If we ""hunting"" isn't good where we are, we move to improve our quality of live. Human history is migration. So no, I argue I am very much correct in this.

&gt; If the only option for immigrants were the US or their country of origin this would hold true. But they have several options.

You understand that this isn't a good argument, no? We are not only the first stop, but we are the closest to many of the communities looking to improve their quality of life. We are a buffer between those populations and Canada.

&gt; I am not sure why you are so quick to dismiss this.

I don't dismiss prosecution of business who hire illegal workers at all. I think they should have the book thrown at them. I'm just pointing out that there will continue to be a market for the labor these folks provide. Criminal businesses will weigh risk and reward same as the people crossing into the country. 

&gt; Your insistence that they must be handled as criminals (they are, but we aren't required to handle them as such) and that crime can exclusively be handled with through punishment seems to derive from a desire to punish.

You admit that these folks are committing a criminal act, are criminals, but state that they should not be handled as if the are? Please explain - I do not understand how this makes sense. They did something wrong - should they not be held accountable, same as anyone else? Should they not face consequences? 

&gt; But I would ask that you examine your own motivations, whether the idea of illegal immigration makes you angrier than it should, etc.

I don't have a desire to punish. I would prefer people would respect the law and simply abide by it. But I understand that sometimes a fear of real consequences can have a motivating effect on peoples' behavior. Illegal immigration puts people at risk of violence and exploitation, in addition to being against the law. Personally, the labor of immigrants who are here illegally only bolsters a system I benefit from. I know for a fact that undocumented immigrants don't commit more crime than naturalized citizens. It doesn't matter. None of these facts make it okay for folks to ignore the law. I am not angry at the people committing the crime - I understand why they do it. I really do - and a lot of them suffer horribly to even have the chance to sneak through. I am angry, though, when people get enraged over our government doing what every other country does - enforcing the protection of our border.

Does that make sense? I also didn't take your comment as an attack, I understand why you asked what you did. I am typically on the other side of these kinds of arguments.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I mean, to be fair, he is also a nightmare for the Republicans, too.

They're all about chasing that damned car and the Democrats are demons for not letting them catch the car that will solve anything if only they can catch that car.

And now they accidentally caught it.

So hopefully it's clear that while I'm horrified by Trump, I also believe the Republicans have slipped over into treason against our country for some time. Or at least have strongly pushed us to the point where we're almost successfully broken. That's on Republicans. Although Trump is also an additional level of nightmare. ",1527811534

"SBU","t5_2sa4t","1) I had McDonnell for 215 and 220 (Spring and Fall 2017, respectively). The biggest thing is that he wants you to learn how to properly approach the problems commonly seen in 220 and other systems-based courses, and because of this, he can ramble for a pretty long time. Showing interest during the course makes his day a little, and in turn it does help you learn the material. Systems are conceptually simple, but actually going through systems problems is challenging (coming fresh off of CSE 320). I found the class interesting, but tedious and challenging. Writing MIPS assembly isn't hard, but it's tedious, and if you don't comment your code properly, you're likely to forget where you were after a night's sleep or a break to do other courses' assignments. Check out this blog to learn MIPS to get a better hang of it (and because it's kinda fun): http://bootdotsys.blogspot.com/2016/12/mips-millions-of-instructions-per.html

2) Recitation helped a bunch for me, because McDonnell can rush through things occasionally just to stay on schedule. Even if your TA isn't the world's greatest, there's a high chance you'll have classmates or friends willing to help you figure things out. Like pannnnn said, when I took the course, recitation was 5% of the grade. Once of the recitations in Fall 2017 was right after JWong's Monday 220 lecture (lecture ending at 9:50, recitation began at 10:00 AM). If you can't get into any other recitations for some reason (conflicts, they're all full, etc.), the best advice I can offer is to hope for the best and prep for the worst (I live on campus, so I can't imagine the difficulty of commuting back and forth daily).

I have scarred heart tissue, and have already had a heart attack at age 28, so I can‚Äôt work outside (I live in Texas where it‚Äôs hotter than Satan‚Äôs asshole) or do anything physically demanding. 

I also have ASD which makes face to face conversation extremely difficult and quite challenging. Retail businesses are very hesitant to hire me because of it. 

I also suffer from clinical depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and bipolar disorder. But I can‚Äôt afford the $700/month for medication, so I just try real hard not to kill myself every day. 

You‚Äôd think I would qualify for some sort of disability from the government, but that requires 6 months of scheduled doctor visits as well as a recommendation from the doctors specifically toward the disability I‚Äôd be applying for. As I don‚Äôt have health insurance and can‚Äôt afford it, I can‚Äôt pay $300-500 per doctor visit just so I can get disability checks from the government. 

I fucking hate this country. So much. But this is my life, and I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun that I can think of in order to change it for the better. So guess I‚Äôll either finally find a way out of it, or end up killing myself. ",1527811540

"science","t5_mouw","Unfortunatly, biological populations tend to consume and grow until they exceed the ability for their environment to support them, then they start dying off. Humans are in a period of growth because our technology has allowed our environment to support more of us, but i'm not sure how confident I am that will continue literally forever. I can only see two possible outcomes in the (possibly very far) future:

1. We exceed our environment and start dying off until the population and resource consumption stabilise, possibly as a periodic event
2. We self-limit our reproduction cycles. This may be a government's job to make it 'fair' (lest selfish individuals ruin it for everyone else), but that obviously has its own issues.

In either case, humanity has a significant amount of change ahead to support a non-growing or possibly shrinking population. I'm sure this would cause all sorts of economic, political, and and even psychological issues.",1527811540

Also, it's not a big deal, but differentiate between *gems* and *jewels*.

Jewels are this game's primary currency, they're the ones that are tracked at the top of your home screen.

Gems are the colored orbs that correspond to the attributes of medals (power/red, speed/green, and magic/blue) and are used to upgrade your keyblade.

"infertility","t5_2saej","My situation is VERY unusual. I did two stim cycles back to back, in late April, then early May. (I had my ER 4/25 and started stims again 4/29 with my second ER 5/15.) I was stimming to get more embryos to transfer to my GC. 
The first cycle in April my RE noted that my uterus made a decent lining (I‚Äôm using a GC bc of a thin lining, and probably due to this I‚Äôve failed all six transfers I‚Äôve done.) The April ER netted 7R, 5F, but no embryos made it to day 5. 

The longer second stim resulted in 5R, 5F, 5 still going at day 3. My uterus looked good at retrieval, with a thick lining, so we decided to put all FIVE day 3 embryos in me, on 5/18. It‚Äôs unlikely to work, but my beta is tomorrow, so we shall see. . . .",1527811542

That whole stance against beliefs thing -- they are poison.

https://spritdesign.wixsite.com/sprit/kailhsprings

When I ordered some 63.5g MX spring and 55g Kailh Box springs from SPRiT, I learned that it was operated by a Korean so I shared current community opinion on SPRiT as a retail vendor. He admitted his past mistakes and told me he is trying to make up for it, going through the messed up orders. I think he said there are about 30 remaining.

My order was filled promptly, with photos to show what was sent, and is on its way. Will update when it arrives.

UPDATE1: Just noticed the bot-attached reply with warning. Would've been nice if same warning came up before I ordered from GeekKeys (my most recent burn). Are there information on how vendors with bad reputaiton can redeem themselves?

UPDATE2: Received the springs from SPRiT today: 3 x 100 63.5g MX springs + 1 x 100 55g Box springs. MX 63.5g is mainly to see if I can improve on my main driver switch: 65g Clear-minded Bsun. And Box 55g is to try with Box Royal and Hako switches. Also came in the box were samples for: MX 85s and Box 80g springs. Packaging was good, delivery was I suspect literally by shipping. I'd order from SPRiT again. Looking forward to tinkering with these switches. ",1527811543

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Ah, this is a great example of the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) in Game Theory, with a twist. If the parties acted rationally, they'd artificially limit supply to demand to remedy accidental overproduction. However, in modern economies that would be considered a [cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel).

Now, according to Jean-Baptiste Say, a classical French economist, demand will serve as a function with production, which means that demand will meet production at any level. This was called [Say's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_law), and dominated economic thought for the longest time. That is, until the robber-barons appeared and the first real case of overproduction en masse in a non-local economy formed, with Rockefeller.

In 1869 oil was overproduced (I can't find an online source on this, it's from a book I have by Charles R. Geisst published by Oxford and doesn't have a footnote for this passage) and this was the first major real-life example of an exception to the law. (Since then, as transportation and globalization have been streamlined and economies are more interconnected than ever, this problem manifests much more often.) Demand couldn't meet production, and Rockefeller used this opportunity to get Standard Oil off the ground by forming a cartel to out-price oil companies before creating his own that was friendly to the charter (this was pivotal to the initial success of the company and was a leading reason for the initial success of John Sherman, who you may recognize as the driving force behind the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890). The monopoly itself at the time was formed as a trust, called the [South Improvement Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Improvement_Company) which created the fundamental model for future corporate integration from that point forward.

Anyway, back to the question and how this relates to game theory. Sensibly, a firm shouldn't charge lower than its cost of business, this is inefficient and unsustainable. It's basic financial theory that anybody can understand. However, in a prisoner's dilemma the two companies are unsure of the other's move (if they cooperate, this is conspiracy and is illegal under anti-trust laws. Additionally, even if they do it in secret there's still a risk the other company will violate the terms with no legal grounds to enforce it). If both firms priced sensibly, both would be better off. However, there is the worry that one firm will undercut the other firm's pricing which can lead to the extermination of the other firm. When overproduction becomes a major problem, companies will actually take losses hoping to weather the storm until production is hindered and supply returns to normal levels.

This is ultimately bad for the consumer as it can lead to monopolies as companies that best control costs are often the only ones to survive, which eliminates competition and creates a monopolistic environment for the company to function in.

This is a market example of the [""Free rider problem""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Free_rider_problem) in a public good. In this problem, by the nature of it being free people overuse the good in an inefficient manner as a scarce resource is not treated as such, which causes other people to do the same and ultimately leads to use of the resource until it's ultimately all gone. In overproduction, companies will pay less than the good actually costs to produce due to the aforementioned problems of overproduction, which then causes market failure as competitiveness can be driven out of the marketplace, which ultimately leads to more harm to those companies in the long-run.

I hope this answers your question. Feel free to ask anymore.",1527811545

I'm not sure anyone's dumb enough to not realise ""men [can] pose a real physical threat to women"". However, assuming they do as a default, and that women can't hack it, is making a victim of women. The guy serving me at the petrol station, for example, is not an automatic threat.

Realistically, how many six foot blokes do you know who can throw a punch? How many of those would be inclined to hit or harass a woman? How many would do so in a public space?

Not sure what it's like where you live, but men like that near me are few and far between. The risk of violence, as a probability, and the need for a toilet for feeling safe in each public space are way out of balance.

The group was in fall semester with 2 football players, a non athlete, and me (athlete but off season).



At the first meeting, I had what I needed, the non athlete had what he needed, one football player had what he needed, and one football player did nothing.



The good football player took the bad one in the hall and gave him a talk about being on a team and pulling his weight... it got... loud.



After that, the best group I had ever been in, that one football player put the fear of God in all of us, the only issue was that the ‚Äúbad‚Äù football player was a non-native English speaker, so we had to grammar check his work (it was a 100pg+ assignment) but all of the information was there, with citations, just a bit of grammar.



The project was divided into 3 parts, we got As on 2 parts and an A- on the final part. The last 10% of our grade was a final exam, when we sat down to take it, it was special questions about what each member said they contributed to. Like mine said something about ‚Äúgood football player said that his part involved XYZ, how did this relate to your part?‚Äù And they were worded so you would know if someone didn‚Äôt do shit.

Until it hits the dynamic update and warroom, its not a legal list to include them.

Warmachine University likes to jump the gun and add new models before they are released or their stats are final (yes sorcha0's stats are subject to change between now and her launch) which can get awkward.  Once it is final/legal it will be in Warroom (short of rules forum infernal rulings).

So.. unless I missed a insider saying that you can use them immediately (I might have, im far from perfect.) no its not legal.

African games often don't go past 2 or 3 goals a match, many end without goals; I'm not saying Asian teams are better because of that but I'm debunking the idea that more African teams would maintain the standard of the World Cup where as more Asian teams would hold out for draws. Uzbekistan and UAE are just 2 teams that can match Peru Panama and Iceland and play fairly good football, but they never get a chance to the World Cup because Japan Iran Australia and South Korea often get the only 4 spots. There are many other Asian and African teams in the same bracket and any team can show up on the occasion in the World Cup, there's still be the qualifying round to make sure the better sides go through. Also it will help raise the level of football in those areas because they'll face better sides more often.

Making it more inclusive is good for football as a whole and adds exposure to more of the World, it reaps more benefits in my opinion than risking a bad World Cup, besides the World Cup always going to have its magic. ",1527811548

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I guess I personally don't believe in good and evil necessarily. It's just the universe balancing itself out. While it is my opinion that the things I listed could be considered sad and tragic, I don't believe them to be evil.

I believe god=love and that is something that is within us all. We're born pure beings of love and then are shaped by our environments and anything that might be considered ""evil"" is just the lack of it (outside of mental disorders and the like). 

I don't believe in objective morality, just love, which is something that comes naturally to human beings and other animals on earth. Giving into things like self-judgment and judging others, giving into to our own hurts and lashing out are what causes what most people might consider to be ""evil."" We're all just reacting to our own pain.

I listed things like cancer and natural disaster because those things are out of our control. It seems to me that if there was a patriarchal god running things like you say, and that he did give us moral law, he would follow his own laws and not inflict pain and suffering on those he created. Maybe that is just my opinion. 

I'm not interested in a religious debate because I can't think of anything more pointless, and like I said before, you're entitled to your own beliefs. I was just curious about them because your comment was very vague and I've never heard anyone take that stance before. ",1527811551

Over the past few weeks I've been collecting a ton of data on developer jobs and startups, and I'm working on creating visualizations/reports that help display some of the key findings from that data.  
    
It's still a work in progress and I'm still going through the data, but thought I'd share my data on ruby/rails jobs so far.  
     
Some of the interesting take aways so far:  
**- ~91K was the average salary from 1,200+ jobs**  
**- Almost 50% of the jobs had an average salary offer over 6-figures (USD)**  
**- 18:1 ratio of jobs explicitly looking for Senior vs Junior talent**

Smart-laziness I guess.

The game looks almost photorealistic in trailers and initial gameplay? The customer is sold at that point.

The immersion-breaking ""gun clipping"" is only going to matter to even less of the game's ecosystem. Sure, most notice.. but how good it looks overshadows the blatant goofs here and there.

It's ""easier"" in a sense for the devs to just make the graphics good. That's what the people and publishers want.

Taking the time to make sure guns don't clip through walls is at most an afterthought.

I'm with you. If your graphics look photorealistic, the physics need to feel that way as well. Otherwise, what's the point?

We'll get there. I hope.

The negotiation scheme relies on the lock file.

A significant improvement would be to have user remote into the same machine hosting the files, by using the applicaiton in the same machine it vastly improves the mechanism used by access to manage locking and consistency.

In short; if possible all users should be remoting into the same machine hosting the database.

Answer: They guest\-starred, grew, or launched their careers on CBS‚Äôs Forecast!

Forecast was a summer replacement series for the Lux Radio Theatre which ran for two seasons in 1940 and 1941. It ushered in an era of show pilots for public viewing and helped give rise to countless actors, writers, and directors, as well as two huge shows: Suspense &amp; Duffy‚Äôs Tavern. On Breaking Walls Episode 80, we present an in\-depth look at Forecast featuring interviews, insights, and episode moments.

He's proven time and time again that he does not negotiate in good faith.  He's trying to apply the same strong man tactics that he's previously used in business and it's simply not working.

Knowing that that's how he operates, other countries should basically put US relations on pause until Trump is out of office.  Unless you're willing to bribe and personally enrich Trump, it doesn't look likely anything productive or positive can be accomplished when negotiating with the US led by Trump. ",1527811555

The current holster speed is fine, especially after the buff. Just make sure to immediately take out your flamethrower after launching and you should be well prepared for when you land.

Lastly, I would like it if you could control how far you go during each launch with how long you hold down M1. For example, if you hold down M1 for a second, then you will get the standard small hop to a big rocket launch. If you tap M1, however, the small hop before the launch will be extremely short followed by a weaker launch. The weaker launch will not cover as much terrain, but would be faster, giving Pyro a more diverse selection of movement options with the TT.  The weaker charges would only use half of one charge, while the bigger ones would still use one entire charge.",1527811555

The old Essence Reaver or Blackcleaver were way more Core on him then IE.You could kill tanks without IE always anyways.Especially with the new true dmg rune and guinsoo tanks are no problem at 3 items.

TLDR: Infinity Edge was never a good rush on tryndamere and never will be.Early Attackspeed through Shiv/Phantom and then hitting 30 or 40% CDR is the ultimate Build.The Nerfs to Cleaver and the new essence reaver hurt him.

The effective difference only comes about when accounting for drag and rolling friction, which are independent of the angle.

I'm not sure what you are purporting with the pendulum esque rails though, the mass only matters in your example video due to it being a rigid pendulum instead of a simple one (i.e. the length from pivot to effective center of mass changes)",1527811556

Canada has no leverage over the EU who themselves have quite the 'protectionist trade policies' which is part of the reason why we created NAFTA in the first place.

Second, I gave the Salmon Roe + Garlic + Nordic Barnacle recipe because that's the most valuable potion in the game; according to the Garralabs Alchemy calculator, with all perks maxed out, the base value of a SINGLE potion of Roe/Garlic/Barnacle is... over 12,000 gold. (For the record, Roe/Garlic/histcarp is second at 11500 and the Roe/Garlic/Chicken's Egg is third at 11,000.

Third, I still think that it's a more efficient use of time to level Alchemy using Blue Mountain Flower, Lavender and Hanging Moss. Using Major Slack's strategy, all you need to do is spend less than 10 minutes running around Whiterun for ONLY those three things, go to Solitude for another 10 minute flower picking run, and then 10 minutes clearing and loosting the Solitude Catacombs for a LOT of Hanging Moss. Then,it's simply a matter of going to Whiterun and leveraging buying lessons from Arcadia and then selling her the potions you make thereafter. Level, rinse and repeat, and you should be easily able to reach 70 from that single potion... at which point, with your perks properly invested, your Roe potion would have a market value of 4000 gold per potion.

Not saying there's anything wrong with fishing up some Histcarp, as they're plenty useful on their own. It's more that I find it to be easier the other way.",1527811558

Anyway, even if they never said it was going to be historically accurate, dice/ea are still in the wrong because all they'd need to do is say  ""While we are trying to make Battlefield V historically accurate, we are taking creative libertys to make it as fun as possible. If we must a sacrifice accuracy for fun, we will. We are sorry for the confusion."" or something along those lines and most of the controversy will vanish. Sure people will still complain about forced diversity, but they'd have a much weaker argument because they can't lean on historical accuracy anymore.

We all know they'd never do that though because a selling point is a selling point. Even if it is barely true. Keep in mind, a lot of gamers don't use reddit or keep up to date with the games that peaks their interest.

You or I can pick up a rock or other heavy object and toss it more or less where it needs to go without a second thought because of this. The game can't simulate weight, density, body position, stance, balance and millions of other little inputs. A throwing arc is a reasonable substitute for this.

"food","t5_2qh55","Recipe:

The crust is a crumb crust made with Maria's biscuits and graham crackers. I used 1.5 cups fine crumbs, 6 tbs butter, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/2 tsp each of ginger and cinnamon. Press it into a tart pan or pie pan and bake for 15 minutes at 325. 

Lavender sugar:

Cut your lavender and dry in a warm but turned-off oven for about 20 minutes. The stems should feel brittle. Remove the buds--they should be dry but still purple. Take about a tbs of the lavender buds and put it in the food processor. Pulse a few times, then add 1 cup of white sugar and continue to pulse until the sugar is fine and the lavender buds are finely chopped. The sugar should taste floral bur shouldn't be overwhelming. You can save this in an airtight container and use it in different things. 

Filling:

2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (around 3-4 lemons)

zest of three lemons 

2 eggs + 2 egg yolks

1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk

1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

1/3 cup lavender sugar

Whip the eggs and sugar together until they start to thicken. Add the lemon juice and zest and continue beating. Mix the cream with the condensed milk and then slowly add it while continuing to mix on low-medium speed. You'll have a thick, pale yellow filling that should pour easily. Pour it into your cooled crust. Bake at 325 for about 18 minutes. The filing should be set, with just a teensy bit of jiggle in the middle (it will firm up completely as it cools). 

The cr√®me chantilly on top was just very simple, with no flavoring added. I used 1 cup whipping cream and 2 tbs powdered sugar because I like the stabilization powdered sugar provides. Garnish with dried lavender buds. Serve cold! ",1527811563

As a result, duplicate posts, or similar posts around the same topic will be removed - with the first submitted allowed. However, official posts made by Epic or the Mod team take priority, and removals of these duplicate threads will be made at a moderator's discretion.

"Transhuman","t5_2qh2k","I have a different question for you: Do you accept evolution or do you believe in creationism, intelligent design, etc.?

If the former, do you really think humanity is the *only* intelligent species that could evolve, ever, and that if it died out it would never be replaced?

If you say yes, why would you think that? Evolution is dynamic, there could be other species out there with similar behaviors yet distinctly different anatomies and with radically different environments. What prevents *them* from engaging in similar, or worse, destruction?

&gt; I personally have a stance that consciousness doesn't exist.

If we are talking about consciousness in the ""soul"" way, I agree. Otherwise if you mean ""consciousness"" as in ""ongoing process of a mind collecting and collating data"" I disagree. The reason should be self-evident but I can elaborate if you wish.

&gt; The brain is merely a compilation of memories and innate biological habits.

It is also the processing of external and internal stimuli, along with learned behaviors.

&gt;  You CAN'T upload a continual process that we call consciousness( hate the word) into another substrate. Even if it were possible, you're not immortal, a neurological template of you is. SO you're not gaining anything.

Completely true. However I do not agree with ""mind uploading"" at all, so if this were the entire of your argument I would only be in disagreement about the first part.

&gt; Devil's advocate though, lets say you can move to another substrate, it IS you, not a copy. What is the function of immortality? Nothing.

The function of immortality, I assume, is to continue experiencing life, even if in a different form or time. To me it is not a problem because A. I have a firm belief that I will die long before such technologies even emerge. B. I have experienced enough things to know eternity is not for me.

&gt;  We're organisms, we are going to be negatively impacting the ecosystem and other species by leaving nature and living forever based on a selfish need.

Make no mistake: *Every* organism wants to take from nature and living as long as possible. Ultimately all actions are conversions of energy and it could even be said that existence itself is pointless and a waste - the difference lies in the methods not in the goals.

&gt; So the desire for life extension is based on your emotions, not rationality. The technology that could possibly exist is derived from human logic, but you're desire is just that, a desire.

Continuing from my previous point: The issue here is that this is not a trait distinct to humans. Imagining themselves being immortal, perhaps, but there *are* species out there who are effectively immortal and perform similar actions.

Desires ultimately come from biological drives, it is not just a nebulous ""want/want not"" which you can alter at a whim, this is also why changing habits is so difficult. The issue is that having solved many critical wants/needs we now find ourselves with *new* needs: To end boredom, to explore, to know, to think, etc... This is not an alienation from our nature, it is the natural evolution of it. If cats and dogs changed over time to develop intelligence rivaling that of humans, you would see them doing the exact same things - if with some variance given their different forms.

&gt; There's also these questions. In the future, these potential technologies are going to be controlled by a select few. 

Most likely, but not necessarily. Remember: *Nothing* is inevitable. We could see a new wave of communism or socialism battling elites and reforming society, AI could come along and usher in a post-scarcity era, a nuclear war could wipe out life in the planet, etc....

&gt; There's also these questions. In the future, these potential technologies are going to be controlled by a select few. What if you need a loan for immortality? You are immortal now and have a loan to pay. If you don't pay the loan, can the robot police come and shut you off or impose some torture on you? I say this because the technological substrate you inhabit is not ""yours"" it belongs to a trillion dollar corporation. SO you are accepting financial and technological slavery at the cost of your fear of death.

Sounds like a cyberpunk dystopia. It is possible, but in all honesty? Unlikely, just as much as the wave of revolutionary communism I mentioned earlier. Why? Because things like Basic Income, Job Guarantee, MMT, etc. are gaining momentum. These policies and ideas benefit society, and now even rich, well-off people are beginning to see them as useful.

&gt; These are pretty logical points. I can't wait for the horde to berate me.

I do not think that you are a bad person, but you seem to be looking at this purely from a negative angle. Even a true cynic looks at the truth unfettered (this is what the original cynics of Rome and Greece did in fact). 

The points I have made are valid: I.e.: Even if you just killed humanity off, evolution would ensure others would rise. You kicked the can down the road.

Nobody ""needs"" to live on a strictly individual sense, society already has plenty of people, we already have a lot of humans rendered superfluous by technology.

But the will to live is an innate biological trait, desiring to prolong life as long as possible (even forever) is the culmination of that, ambitious, yes, but no more selfish than willing to live in the present time.

Moreover, while your point is that intelligent life is an inherently negative thing the truth is that it does not have to be. People are often careless and ignorant, yes, but this need not remain constant forever. As I said before, nothing is inevitable, including doom and obscurantism.",1527811567

"Games","t5_2qhwp","""Ape"" is a general insult to me.  
  
Overwatch is just a shitty dumbed down version of TF2  
Diablo 3 is just a shitty clicker game dumbed down version of itself  
HotS is just a shitty dumbed down version of all MOBAs that came before it  
Hearthstone is a shitty dumbed down version of a TCG  
Starcraft 2 was killed  
WoW was killed as well  
  
None of these games are particularly ""horrible"" but they're either boring and forgettable mindnumbing passtimes like Diablo 3 or HotS or they're just fucking annoying and full of stupid shit like Overwatch. Not to mention, Battle.Net is a complete fucking mess of a program that somehow manages to be less consistent than Steam and Steam is also shittily programmed, the Overwatch matchmaking has been bad from day one and all of their choices seem to push it into becoming an even worse game, WoW has been alienating its fans for years and Starcraft 2's competitive scene(which was kind of the whole point after some time) kinda just died. Blizzard may have been good at some point but recently they're just a lazy company that can't game design for shit and their current strategy is just to take some other trend made by other, better devs and make it dumber to appeal to a wider market while using their name to boost the marketing potential.  
  
Riot has been burning me with their recent changes, but at least LoL is well optimized and my memory of ""Riot is good"" is more recent than Blizzard. They've been putting in work and talking to their fanbase, but they're misguided. They're a misguided company, while Blizzard comes across to me as a complete cancer that lost its way. ",1527811567

I think you should reconsider the way you worded this statement. I *think* I understand what you were trying to say (I.E. limit calls to the database), but someone might get the wrong idea.

 With regards to application performance, well written SQL can be a great performance improvement. Case in point, I just rewrote some sales data algorithms that were largely PHP powered (with nested calls to the db) into optimized SQL queries that would only query the DB once, and the processing time went from 244 seconds down to 3 seconds.

ORMs are also notoriously bad at performance when developers don't realize that doing certain actions in a loop triggers a query on each iteration that could be avoided if they simply hand-wrote a SQL query to handle everything at once.",1527811567

## How do I submit images or screenshots?

You may submit your post as a [discussion (self) post](/r/Overwatch/submit?selftext=true) with some context - more than just a single line of text - speaking about the image. If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

## How do I submit a gameplay highlight?

You may submit your gameplay highlight by uploading it to a GIF/video sharing website and submitting the link to /r/Overwatch. We do not support uploading gameplay highlights directly through the Reddit app/website at this time.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I‚Äôve been looking into a new camera lens or body to improve indoor low light or night photography. I enjoy taking portraits the most but I also do street photography, I currently use a T6i with a 40mm f/2.8. I really like the look of portraits from pairing with a 50mm f/1.4 but the auto focusing was just awfully slow but possibly a bad copy? I‚Äôve used just this T6ix40mm set up since the T6i came out, and I saved up spare money to invest


Lens I have interest in from greatest to worst:
Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM
Sigma 30mm Art f/1.4 (I heard portraits are badly distorted at 30mm?)
Canon 50mm f/1.4
Sigma 50mm Art f/1.4 (price is $950 when a canon 1.4 would be only $350 and suits me fine). Open to suggestions, anything to help my T6i in low light, nice build quality, reliable for portrait shots. A plus would be full frame compatible for future upgrades but not required.


Or should I upgrade body then sell my T6i? I have interest in a 6D classic, 5D classic, or 7D classic (7D is not FF), or maybe a 80D. Open to suggestions but preferably canon. Should I just keep my T6i and put the money into upgrading lens? Wait for new bodies to drop?


Edit: also should note, I have rented the 50mm f/1.4 out but not the 1.8 STM, I have read from previous threads that the 1.8 STM would be just fine and to put the other money (~$250 difference) into a different lens. I have not rented out any camera body yet but I have tested some out in stores, 5D mark II/IV are great cameras but I think for my shots a 5D/6D would be just fine if found with low shutter count",1527811568

**Removal Reason:** The automoderator bot has auto-removed your post because your account is new on Reddit. This is a precautionary measure since the vast majority of new account holders posting on reddit are spammers OR they are new users who often haven't bothered to read the rules and therefore submit problematic posts. Subreddit limitations for new account holders is a common policy for subreddits and is a stated rule in this one (see the sidebar or the rules post at the top of the subreddit). The age of any other Reddit accounts you may have is not a factor since the age rule is based on a per-account basis.     

**What you can do** -  If your account is less than a week old OR your post contains a link, then you cannot appeal the removal. The best option is to spend some more time learning about reddit and then come post again. If your account is more than a week old AND your post contains no links, commercial references, or mentions of any works you have affiliation with then you may appeal this removal by kindly messaging the moderators of this subreddit (see link in the 'Moderators' section of the sidebar). You need to include a link to the removed post in the appeal message.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Dak Prescott.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into football in the last couple years. So you never watched Dak in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: football isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""QBR"" or ""Pro Football Focus"" I know they know nothing about football. 

Dak's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest QB ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that Carson Wentz is better than Dak Prescott, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Dak in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched  football for a significant amount of time, so I know that Dak is better.

You might be jealous of Dak's Rookie of the Year award, or jealous of his status as the greatest passer in NFL history, or whatever. Unless you're a 49ers fan who watched football in the 80s, or a Pats fan who watched football in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win football looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Dak isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Carson Wentz The Best Player in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Dak talk to the adults. Fair?",1527811572

"GCdebatesQT","t5_3bm34","And I mostly agree with that (even if not the details or wording), but I don't think it's society as a whole, I think it's parts of the trans community. Many trans people seem to be finding spaces online that actually accept them and acknowledge them, but like all groups some of these spaces are toxic garbage. I would say that dysphoria makes trans people more prone than average to creating insulated echo chamber ""pockets"" which seem to have a way of warping their perception of things. 

So now we have a growing network of insulated spaces where people are getting the acknowledgment they desperately crave without having to deal with outside negative opinions, so when they run into opposing ideologies we get legitimate feelings of persecution and hatred which turn into calls for violence and such.

Maybe ""crazy"" isn't the right word, but it seems appropriate to describe desperate people with warped views on how things work. ""Pockets"" I stand by, as these people are a subset of trans people. ",1527811572

 I used reg/rec exactly as you stated. My version of a reg is a player who will beat 50NL+ and is able to adjust their game to the table. A rec describes a standard losing, possibly breakeven 1/2 player who plays a very passive game, doesn‚Äôt understand certain MTT specific spots and isn‚Äôt able to adjust properly. 

I completely agree with you about the easier to beat the standard 1/2 player than a complete fun player. They have the basic knowledge but lack the understanding of spots  that profitable players have and for them it will typically take years to develop to those ideas without online play and a lot of study. 

I remember my times at the micros when I first started playing at 18 and live poker in these types of games give me the same vibe. Any raise on the river is likely to be good, typically no knowledge of ranges, board textures, when to Cbet and when not to etc. They almost gift you opportunity‚Äôs to outplay them.

The whole tournament poker ‚Äòscene‚Äô is full of these types of players right up to the 1k‚Äôs (1k‚Äôs are the highest I‚Äôve played live) they don‚Äôt study at all, their concepts and ideas of poker haven‚Äôt shifted at all since the day they started playing and they tend to play their hands face up.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","So quick backstory,
My R6 got parked in my dad's garage in December '14. I know he started it around Jan/Feb '15.
Since then it has sat. (On kickstand)
I did a oil change about 600 miles prior to parking it since I knew it was going to be a while until I get to ride again.
Dad let the battery die, I ordered another battery and he let that one die too. I don't have any idea of when it had last been started/run but I know, with the exception of it being wheeled across the street to my sisters fiance's mom's house after my dad sold his house, it hasn't moved at all. I had just put new Q3s on it maybe 800 miles ago.

I just sent my sister a battery to see if it will at least turn over but I'm not sure that's a great idea now when I think about 3 year old gas/oil.

I'm trying to get it registered and shipped, running or not, to me on the east coast (VA).

Any help is appreciated. I just want to ride again.",1527811576

I found him on roommates.com after posting an available room in a home my family had invested in as a rental property. The mortgage was high and I was in a hurry to get the room filled after a previous roommate had moved out. New guy seemed like a fairly normal person at first - nice, quiet, clean. But after a few months a rent check bounced, he apologized and took care of it right away, but then a couple months later it happened again. That time I got a sob story about him getting his identity stolen, but after that the money he repeatedly promised never appeared. I served notice and swallowed the court fees to start the legal eviction process. During this time, he would hide out in his room with the door locked anytime I was home.  

I think around this time he tried to break into my room upstairs because the door frame near the deadbolt on my bedroom door had small indents in the wood that looked like pry marks that weren't there before he moved in, though I had no way to prove it. 

One night I was cooking dinner and heard my dog chomping on something while hiding in the corner. I discovered it was a chicken wing bone. I hadn't had wings anytime recently but thought maybe our other roommate did and was a slob that dropped it on the floor. I took it away and went back to cooking, but then a few minutes late she had another one. What the hell, right?

I searched the living room and they were no other bones in sight. I returned to the kitchen and pretended to keep cooking while watching her   and after a few minutes she goes trotting down the hall to the roommate's door and there I see it...a chicken wing partially covered in a bit of powder being slid under the door.  

I pounded on the door and considered if I should break it down and murder him, but I took my girl to the vet instead and filed a police report.  They never concluded what she ingested but since it was so little and I caught it right away she was fine.  

The court date for the eviction hearing came soon after and at it he was arrested for his outstanding warrants for fraud committed before moving in. The eviction was granted and when cleaning out his room we found all sorts of pills, rotting food and trash everywhere. Oh and bottles taken from our recycling bin that have been used for urine during his long hideout sessions.  He later had additional charges added for the check fraud he tried to commit with my accounts.  

I'm sure he's out of jail by now but I've long since moved away from that town and have never pursued trying to recover the money that was lost. I doubt that he even has income above the table that could be garnished.  

A background check would have been enough to know not to ever let that guy near us. Luckily we all had the chance to live and learn!",1527811577

"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","&gt;A different manager might have elected to go 4 at the back to keep the team balanced while still using a 3 man midfield

It's not really easy to switch from 3atb to 4atb. Especially considering we did not really have decent fullback options (I believe only Azpi was capable of playing fullback). Conte did start with 4atb last season. Conte himself in his playing days played in 4atb formations at Juve, so claiming that he does not know how to play 4atb is nonsense

So either you have a problem that Conte plays defensive or that he plays 3atb.

But lets assume that we had a coach who would switch to 4atb to maintain midfield balance. What would your reaction be if we kept conceding too many goals and lost points due to lack of full backs? I mean if you keep conceding goals, wouldn't your first action be to play more defensive or fill defensive gaps to stop conceding them or would you rather attack more and hope to score more than the other team? At which point most fans would again rant due to playing defensive

Now this other coach who switched to 4atb complains about the lack of good fullbacks to play 4atb. And the board chooses to buy more extremely mediocre fullbacks and we still continue to concede goals and points.

I say this as a fan of 4-3-3 formation I personally like and have liked since Mourinho's first season . In fact when we bought Bakayoko the past summer I hoped/wanted us to switch to 4-3-3 as I like watching that formation. But I can understand why the coach chose to stick with 3atb",1527811578

who says nothing but simply takes out,

rather carefully a watch from his pocket,

seeming unaware of everyone about.

&amp;nbsp;

They address the monster in unison,

what do you think about all of this?

What do you think he should get,

neverending chaos or a forever of bliss?

&amp;nbsp;

It clears its throat and finally speaks,

Look around us, just take a glance.

It says, in a deep, booming voice,

Does this person really deserve a chance?

&amp;nbsp;

He earned loads of money and power,

but he was selfish and always self serving.

Yes a long, exciting, adventurous life,

But focused on himself and never observing. 

&amp;nbsp;

His life is almost over, and you can see,

he is all alone now, not a single soul around,

he probably has a lot to say right now,

but there is no one to listen to his sound.

&amp;nbsp;

Measure a man not by his wealth or youth,

but by how many he loved and how many loved him.

And also by how many come to him in death,

So sadly, his chances of bliss are awfully dim.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus spoke time, with quite some finality,

rose up, the watch closed hanging from its chain.

And the man breathed his last with a gasp,

and the bright blue eyes closed, never to open again.",1527811578

"medical","t5_2r1b9","Never ever use peroxide on a wound. Peroxide kills tissue. Stop using peroxide.

Wash the wound once or twice a day with mild soap and water. Put some antibiotic ointment on it and a fresh bandage. Technically you don't even need the ointment. The bandage keeps dirt out of the wound and prevents it from rubbing on clothes.

It looks like you would expect a scrape to look. Is it hotter than surrounding tissue? Is there green  pus coming out of it? Does she have a fever? Does she have worsening pain? Are there red streaks around the wound? Does it smell really bad? Is the tissue around the wound red and inflamed? If not then keep doing home treatment.

Also, one thing that helped break me out of my snoozing was having concrete early morning things I needed to do, something like ""I'm meeting so and so at 8, so I need to get up now so I can shower and get there in time"".

Another was setting two different alarms on my phone! If you have the pandora app (even the free version) you can set the music to play as an alarm in the settings, and set a volume and station it'll automatically go to. Then I have my normal alarm app go off 2-3 minutes later. If the music wakes me up, I know I can relax for a song or so, but it's engaging enough to keep me up. If it doesn't wake me up, when I do hear the alarm go off it's something to hold on to so I don't go back to sleep!",1527811578

Jews did not break into Palestinians homes to kick the Arabs who lived there and live in those homes instead.

Jews are smart, not lazy, and they know how to build houses very very well. It's faster, cheaper and much less risky to build a new home instead of the hassle of chasing Arabs out of their old homes to live in an old house in a former Arab village or city. Am I right or wrong?

**Which neighborhood or city of former Arabs is not populated by Jews who live in former Arab homes?**

Please let us know!

On the other hand, plenty of Arabs, for example in Hebron, live in homes and houses of Jews who were mascaraed by Arabs in 1929, all the Jews!!!! All Jews were expelled from their homes in Arab and Muslims countries in 1948. Guess who live in those homes today.

So the story is that is land is Jewish land, and despite that, Jews happily live with 20% of the Israel's population being Arabs, more than a million people, the luckiest Arabs in the world. The only Arabs who enjoy democracy, freedom, human rights, equal rights, freedom of religion and liberty.

### No duplicate posts, one post per topic

When something big hits, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see dozens of posts on the same topic fill the front page at the same time. Unfortunately, this means that content creators or community contributors don‚Äôt get to share submissions they have spent time on. As a result, duplicate posts, or similar posts around the same topic will be removed - with the first submitted allowed. However, official posts made by Epic or the Mod team take priority, and removals of these duplicate threads will be made at a moderator's discretion.

Furthermore, I'm not going to de-value art merely because it comes from a person who thinks differently than I. Almost all art made before now was made by people who believed very backwards things, plus a lot of the art made now too.

There are a LOT of ""progressive"" people out there who need to actually own up to their own rhetoric and start acting like they actually have the moral high ground instead of just constantly asserting that they do, then turning around and acting like children the first chance they get. 

Edit: The downvotes here are really just proving my point. I'm not conservative but merely refusing to denounce all of them makes me look bad apparently. It's weird, you people will take someone at their word when they express an opinion, but you won't take their word when they say they either don't think that way anymore or never really did to begin with.

&gt;you just converted from Islam on the spot and now worship the constitution written by and for people who had nothing to do with you?

It doesn't matter who wrote it and for whom - the consitution benefits the citizen in specific ways, and it benefits the public in certain ways; if the citizen agrees with the way this value system benefits him and the surrounding population, he adopts this value system.

Your problem is that you're so entrenched in identitarianism you can't think in any other ways or imagine how anyone else could - do you think most whites nowadays like the American constitution and its European imitators because it was written by white euros for white euros, or because they like what it does to a society?

Just trying to avoid a situation where I apply and get hired in with maybe 30 other new conductors in Smithers, then potentially all of us getting laid off in a few months. Laid off because there are enough conductors right now for a normal work load, and they're simply hiring because of a temporarily (maybe only a few months) increased work load. I'd be interested in finding out whether they've laid off recently at that specific terminal or whether they're regularly as busy as they are.

I admit to not being familiar with corn pops so I don't know how bad the sugar is, but if it's like most cereals for kids, she should probably stop buying it all together. I don't mind how much cereal my kids eat in the mornings because I don't buy cereal I don't want them eating. I feel like that is common sense.

Wentworth, David and Aubry are going to be able to run circles around the newbies on their tribes no matter what. Russell, so far, is literally the only captain to never make the merge and that was more because his reputation preceded him.

The *other* contradictory thing is that Kylo kills Snoke to save Rey.

That's pretty subjective though, I'm sure that for you it doesn't add anything, but for other people it does. 

&gt;You and others replying are talking about real anxiety that actual humans go through. 

Can't speak for others, but I'm just talking about a series where a 13 year old kid with no 'magic' powers, with no 'real' combat training is going up against fire breathing/lightning spamming/ninjutsu using opponents, and it's broadcast on TV infront of thousands of people, across multiple countries. Having anxiety at that point isn't surprising at all.  

&gt;  I am talking about the NINJA UNIVERSE

And I mentioned that universe has changed in the last 20~ years so ninjas aren't as cutthroat as before.

&gt;I don't care if it's a time of peace man.

I suppose if you choose to ignore what you don't like then a lot of things will seem odd.

&gt;If you are so peaceful that you can't perform then you should not be trying to be a ninja

Metal does want to become a ninja, all he needs to do is overcome his anxiety. Telling someone to stop something because their anxious is one of the most defeatist mentalities you can have.

&gt;Metal should be over this by now and if he isn't then there definitely shouldn't be multiple ninja with anxiety

He's like 12/13 years old, fighting crazy ninjas infront of thousands of people, it's not like a few months/years of growth would be unreasonable for a kid that young. ",1527811591

Here is how I see things: Russia not only is a super power (terrorist state or otherwise), but is the one super power in our backyard. Fear of Russia may be the one thing keeping NATO and the EU together in the future and as soon as the discontent of its members is greater than that fear, then the whole thing comes tumbling down. The state we are currently in, supposedly as bad as the height of the cold war, is in no way entirely the fault of Putin's Russia. It takes two to tango.

And as far as the situation in eastern Ukraine is concerned, the Russians are protecting their interests after the revolution backed by our so-called allies, protecting minorities and the like.

I have found that this definition of ""lesbian"" to be far more applicable to the lesbians I actually know. It is far more threatening to men and their handmaidens. It is a definition that persists in a world where men say ""If you fucked me I could take your identity away.""

For me, this definition includes a ""sexual orientation"" to females exclusively. And it includes and invites women to call themselves lesbian in the present regardless of their pasts with men. It focuses on the present and future, and brings lesbians together regardless of our pasts.

This is a long\-winded way of saying I want to agree with the OP, but focusing a definition on the individual sexual pasts of other women who call themselves lesbians will not built a lesbian culture.

Otherwise, the differences in the race are more for roleplay color than anything else.

And, to compensate, all humans get a one point increase to all stats. \(Before they didn't get any stat increases or decreases.\) 

As for skills and abilities, you may want to avoid any race that takes a penalty in sunlight.

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","CodingPhase.com, your boy's back and I done did it again! Guys, The video tutorials on CodingPhase are quick and dirty project tutorials that teach basic concepts and syntax in several languages and libraries, certain things will get skipped or overlooked, like making sure a site is perfectly responsive, or in the instance of something like the React tutorial, teach the basics, but not go into things like actually connecting it to an API. As a developer though you should know where to look for further information on any missing parts.

I appreciate the quick and dirty style, where the curtain is never pulled back/you never really get in deep in order to get you up and coding faster than more involved tutorials. 

Colt Steele's course is very outdated at this point and CodingPhase.com is one possible resource to get a little more caught up with modern practices. At $10/mo for all of the courses is a pretty good deal for a new developer. I usually recommend several Udemy courses though that go a lot deeper into their respective technologies.

The solution is to push to grow the economy and you do that partly with cautiously managed debt, which future growth in revenues should help cover the interest on. This is not ‚Äúfiscal incompetence‚Äù, nor is it a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù, it‚Äôs a conscious decision that Alberta made with the advice of world leading economists.

Oh, and the right starts bawling every time someone suggests finding more revenue. So if you‚Äôre mad about the deficit, consider that maybe that‚Äôs part of the problem.

Like you with Nah, I've always related to Vanessa for multiple reasons. Like me, she's the youngest sibling, and she often feels like she lives in her older sister's shadow. I often feel the same way about my brother, though my brother (like Syrene) always has humbling things to say to me. We're brothers after all, so it always works out. Vanessa also talks about how she can't help but overwork herself when faced with a lot of responsibility, which is something I have to work on. I know they're just characters, but a role model is a role model.

  When you attempt to use a technique or practice as means to an end, you lose the end, because you're attempting to use them in hopes of achieving a goal. 

  Stillness (I'll just use your phrase) doesn't need you to do anything for it to be itself. It has no reliance upon you at all, and the idea that you need to do anything in order for stillness to come, is when stillness is lost, because even the idea of letting go of conceptual thought is a conceptual thought. 

  I believe that everyone at one time or another, no matter if they are spiritual or not,  has ""touched"" stillness so to speak. This is because stillness is, we just keep getting in the way of our own selves superimposing our ideas on reality to experience it. It is ironically when we get out of our own way, not consciously with a goal in mind, that the awareness of stillness comes to us. ",1527811599

It's not some ""other"" entertainment or filler that they're playing on stream when they don't have content. It ***is*** the content, usually indistinguishable from match #1. Occasionally it needs to be sped up, but only when the 2 matches are long enough to fill the whole time block for the round, which is a huge plus.

If you count time walk matches as other, you should count the second match SCG streams go to as ""other"" as well. They both have commentary and are the backup match for the round. The GPs just have a better system and instead of jumping in live, they've been recording it and go back to the beginning or the start of a game. It might as well be live.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","&gt;So the few huge counties and cities dont control the election every year.

Except that the EC doesn't prevent this... Imagine a world where every state except California has a majority of the vote cast consistently for the same party every time such that no candidate receives 270 votes. In that world, California decides the election every single time, even though the EC dilutes the number of electoral votes they receive. If that's too much of a stretch, do the same with California and Texas or any other big states. Those two states could easily decide the entire election by themselves under the current system, there is nothing actually stopping that.

The swing states aren't any particular size by design. Any state, no matter its other properties, will become a swing state as long as there is a near even partisan split. Doesn't matter how big or small it is. In the EC the election is decided only by swing states, and thus in the EC any set of states can decide the election, with little input from the other states. If I were to chop California into smaller, extremely partisan, ""chunks"" to make new states, it would have next to no impact on how politicians ran their campaigns, same if I combined all the safe mid-western red states into one giant state. No matter the size of the states, the strategy is always the same, campaign in the states with the closest vote totals, because they will decide the election. 

The EC actually makes a situation where a very large state (or a small set of them) decides the entire election far MORE likely than less likely, because if a very large state has a near even partisan split (the only thing needed to be a swing state), because the winner takes all system, it would attract far more attention from candidates than other swing states. All that matters as far as state size is size relative to other swing states, not relative to the size of the country as a whole. Our hypothetical California as a swing state may only have 10% of the EVs, but if they account for 50% of the EVs in all swing states, then they'll attract far more than 10% of the attention.

It takes the ten most populace US states to equal more than half the population of the US and hundreds and hundreds of cities before you get a majority of the US populace. (It takes 11 US states to get 270 electoral votes FYI). Each state's EVs are handed out through a popular election already, so shouldn't we already see any issues with large population centers within the swing states themselves? No one in a swing state gets ignored, because they all matter if you're going to win the election (especially now that TV, radio and the internet exist so appealing to EVERY demographic is possible), in a popular election, you've shifted that from a small subset of the populace of swing states to the entire country.

In a popular vote system on the other hand, while it would result in a massive shift from our current political equilibrium, in the long term, elections could effectively be decided by any group, anywhere at any time.

If I was setting up this room, I would create privacy around the bed by placing a room divider type screen (https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10400837/ painted your favorite color, or something like https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00398321/ and hang a piece of decorative cloth over it... or dry your towel... or hang a houseplant with large leaves and vines... Break the line of sight from piano to bed, since the piano is first and foremost a work space for you. (OK, actually I'd get a canopy bed frame and hang curtains around the entire bed in a space this small, but that's just me liking cozy places and forgetting my homework exists when I can't see it)

How's the acoustics of the dorms you're staying in? If the walls are thin, consider heavy fabric wall hangings in your favorite colors rather than just the canvasses you've rendered. 

I notice that you have neither a closet nor a bookcase. While you'll get a bit of storage under your bed, lots of garments need to hang to look good. I would consider replacing the armchair with a freestanding wardrobe if that's the only way to get one in the room. 

Finally, to make it feel warmer, add indirect light sources and more texture. Mood lighting is easy: Just get a string of white holiday lights (sometimes sold as fairy lights to the pinterest crowd) and wrap them around a picture frame or across the top of your piano or whatever. Texture is pretty easy too: Consider a fuzzy or chunky knit throw pillow or blanket for the bed or chair. Don't be ashamed to bring a favorite stuffed animal from your childhood as a decor accent, either... it adds a lot of character and can help your room do its job of making you feel at home. 

It's unglamorous, but get a laundry hamper that you can just throw laundry at if you want your floor to have any hope of staying clean during stressful times with a heavy course load. 

Make sure your desk chair is as comfortable as possible, because you might be sitting in it for a whole lot of hours. Choose function over form, then dress up whatever ugly but ergonomic thing you end up with with a cover or throw to match your color scheme. 

Finally, consider a low-maintenance houseplant. English ivy always looks good across the top of a piano or along a desk, or you could put a succulent on the window sill. Having a bit of nature in your room is good for you, and the extra oxygen can't hurt either :)",1527811602

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","But often the issues that feminists address would also fix the issues that men face. Here are some examples:

**Suicide**

As you mentioned, suicide is something that men die more often from. It‚Äôs partially because men tend to pick more physically direct methods (guns are the big one, but also includes hanging/forcible asphyxiation), whereas women tend to use less violent and more passive methods, like overdose, and this is also reflected in homicide cases, weirdly enough. But it‚Äôs also partly because men don‚Äôt feel safe seeking help. 

Feminists fight for the idea that women aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmore emotional‚Äù than men (because men have just as many feelings) and that, regardless, being emotional isn‚Äôt a negative. Feminists think that our current cultural gender expectations/roles of men being ‚ÄúTough, Strong, Stoic Manly Men‚Äù and women being ‚Äúemotionally unpredictable, often hysterical, weaker beings that need to be coddled and protected‚Äù is harmful to everyone. By addressing that, it also gives men space and permission  to *be* emotional, to show pain, to talk about their feelings. The goal is to make it okay for people of any gender to ask for help, to seek therapy, to need emotional support, and to stop seeing that as weakness. 

If it were no longer so taboo to talk about their feelings, men would be able do it with their friends, family, and mentors. They would be able to break out of the regressive gender role where men don‚Äôt cry, where depression is really just weakness, etc. 

**Military Service**

Feminists generally believe that either everyone should be subject to the draft or that no one should be (ideally no one). It‚Äôs also been feminists arguing for the military to allow women to fight on the front lines (as long as they pass the same physical ability tests as the men do). Historically, it‚Äôs been conservatives who‚Äôve argued against that, not liberals. 

**Custody &amp; Parenting**

So feminists fight the idea that women are naturally made to be nurturers, or that our place as women is in the home. The other side to that  stereotype is that men don‚Äôt want to parent, don‚Äôt know how to, and that their job is in the office making money. By addressing the fact that those gender roles are outdated, that gives men the opportunity to take on more of a parenting role. But you do need to realize that judges weren‚Äôt going to give full or equal custody to a parent that spent no time parenting. Male or female. The reality is that even ten years ago, [fathers were spending far less time with their kids than mothers were, *even when they both worked full time*.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/men-women-work-time/1983271/) Women are also the ones who were taking sick days when their kid got sick, and were doing a tremendous amount more housework. As that‚Äôs changed, so have custody rulings. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: nowadays men are more involved, and the fathers that actually ask for equal custody are getting it. Part of that change, of fathers taking a more active and equal parenting role, is because of those strict gender roles being broken down. And you have feminists to thank for that. 

The patriarchy hurts everyone. Both men and women uphold the patriarchy, as well; it‚Äôs not something Men are doing to Women, it‚Äôs a word that describes the way our culture was structured, and the effects of that which continue hurting us all today. ‚ÄúToxic masculinity‚Äù is a feminist term which describes the negative effects of patriarchal values on men. It‚Äôs not saying that *masculinity* is bad, not in any way. It‚Äôs saying that this bullshit, overblown stereotype of What A Man Should Be is toxic to men, that it hurts men (and women.) 

And beyond all that...look, at a certain point men need to step up and start doing work on these issues for themselves too, not just trying to pull down feminists. Feminists aren‚Äôt responsible for fixing the whole freaking world. Feminists are trying to make women‚Äôs situations better, yes. But they‚Äôre absolutely not trying to make men‚Äôs lives worse, and are not responsible for these issues. Feminists aren‚Äôt out there rallying for men to have no custody, or for more needless wars to kill more men. Work *with* feminists, don‚Äôt let yourself get sucked into the MRA (not Men‚Äôs Liberation or other actual advocates, specifically talking about the /r/MensRights ‚ÄúI hate feminists‚Äù types) crabs-in-a-bucket mentality. Feminists are not your enemies. They‚Äôre your allies. ",1527811603

"TheHandmaidsTale","t5_3fhbh","Of course I care about June and all the other women experiencing horror.  But I don't see them as heroes or anything of that sort.  The best there is - some secret network trying to help people leave Gilead, but there is no real underground movement or resistance... at times I don't care about June at all....... FOR ONLY reasons that her character is written so poorly.  She's walking around an abandoned building with a hammer..... because I guess to the writers that means she has some ""power"" as if she could stave off one Gilead agent with that hammer or something.

Then she becomes distraught over the Boston Globe staff who were I guess murdered in the basement and that damned SHOE... she finds the match to it.... and goes around building some shrine and then prays.  

I really don't get this.  Have women not come far enough to even mirror SARAH CONNOR from Terminator that she spent all that time body-building with her cot turned on its side so she could at least use her brute force when there came time for escape.  But June is only wandering studying coffee cups and watching Friends.

No dig on June, that's how she is written.  Sadly written.  She makes ill choices to try and command the eye guy who impregnated her to give her his gun and car and she is going to drive right out into the streets to surely get caught.  But then, true to this twisted anti-feminist form, she ends up staying and demanding his orgasms even when he is so worn he can't go any further.  But June must be satiated because THAT is what such a woman does when having a moment of escape from her captors: she wants to frak endlessly.  Not find ways out, not make plans, not making reasonable decisions for her better safety and that of her unborn child, but frak and frak and frak until the well is literally dried up.

Are any women ashamed at the way June is written?  In situations like Gilead, that would turn even the weakest female into a tour de force (or it should).  Yet, June more often cries and bleeds instead of getting physically stronger or more shrewd at fooling/evading her captors.

The violence is inexcusable.  The blood is overwhelming.  And I KNOW the baby she is carrying is going to meet some horrific end or trauma that I personally have no interest in seeing.  It's like the show cannot wait to plan out and vividly portray the violence on women.  It is not incidental.  It's planned.  I don't care if women or men are writing this show, they are fostering endless sadism and it ain't right.",1527811603

Another solution would be the previous Raikage's lightning armor which also enhances reflexes to a high degree. But for someone who masters the lightning armor, Chidori is frankly unnecessary.

I personally strongly believe that Sasuke will end up teaching Boruto the Chidori at some point. The Byakugan's insight is generally stronger than the Sharingan and is also able to follow high speed movements and to maintain a perfect field of vision while performing high speed movement (such as Kaiten). So, there is a good chance that Boruto would be able to fully leverage the Chidori once he unlocks his Jougan (since it was hinted that the Jougan is an evolution that retains the abilities of the basic Byakugan).",1527811604

Here‚Äôs a snippet

&gt;Crowley‚Äôs campaign manager, Vijay Chaudhuri, bolted out from the back of the office and glared at her as they stood toe-to-toe in the middle of the office. When Ocasio-Cortez told him who she was, he snapped, ‚ÄúI know who you are!‚Äù

&gt;Chaudhuri‚Äôs outburst was a revelation. Crowley‚Äôs campaign had not publicly acknowledged Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs existence even when she had recently stunned some observers by submitting more than 5,400 petition signatures to win a place on the ballot ‚Äî more than four times the required amount. But after months of wondering if she was too insignificant in her opponent‚Äôs eyes to even be noticed, she had her answer.

&gt;Ocasio-Cortez repeated her request for a debate and Chaudhuri promised to pass it along. Ocasio thanked him for his time and left feeling emboldened. ‚ÄúIt was the first time I looked the opposition in the eye,‚Äù she told The Indypendent. ‚ÄúIt made me feel this was more possible than I already thought it was. I saw not the certainty that I thought I was going to see.‚Äù

Snip

&gt;On May 26, the Ocasio-Cortez campaign officially opened an office. Located on the second floor of a strip mall by the 90th Street subway stop in Elmhurst, the room was filled with a bustling, diverse crew of 40 mostly-millennial volunteers. Along the walls were maps of all the neighborhoods in the 14th District, from Astoria to Flushing, Throgs Neck to Morris Park. The day before the office opened, ***Crowley‚Äôs campaign announced that he would debate Ocasio-Cortez on June 15 at the New York 1 television studio.***

None of these solutions hold any utility for most people (who want to have kids and want to have cars), so they're not gonna agree to that. That's game theory 101. Sure, we can speculate this is how it's gonna be 1000 years from now, but that's long overdue if we want to save the planet, which kind of needs to happen right now. If we ever go childfree or carfree, it's gonna be for different reasons which I'd rather leave to sci-fi writers' imagination. By that time we're already gonna save the planet - by running 100% on renewables, for example (cars and other machines aren't the problem, fuel is), becoming vegan and / or growing meat in labs (the technology is almost here), simply having less children on average (already happens in some western countries), etc. No need for taking anything away from people.

"titanfall","t5_2xh0g","1. Don't ever call a Titan. A guy like me will melee you to death in the domeshield and you'll spawn across the map while your Titan gets wrecked by my teammates.  Always SPAWN INTO TITAN.

2. Don't go solo.  Always, always, always stick behind another Titan and provide flanking protection and fire support.  Tone is an excellent Titan for this, as other Titans can hide behind your particle wall. 

3. Continue to support your teammates by punching enemy Pilots off of them and using harassing fire on Pilots in windows/on buildings to keep their heads down.  This lets your more experienced teammates focus on the enemy Titans.

4. You need Titans with at least Tone-level mobility.  Ion, Tone, and Monarch are excellent choices.  The others are either too slow or too fragile; you won't get to make more than 1 mistake in those before you lose your Titan.

5. Go after AI in Attrition.  Keep Reapers off of your team's back and you'll build core and get some firing practice.  Grunts are easy to stomp on and can provide points, core and practice to you. 

6.  Stay in your backfield as much as possible. I make a particular effort to melt inexperienced Titans that want to play big boi on the front lines. 

7.  Eject immediately at doomed state or even when about 1/2 bar away from Doomed.  Most noobs see the full doomed bar and don't realize it's basically just one little regular life bar stretched out.  You'll get executed or sniped across the map. 

8.  Never use auto-Titan.  Ever.  Unless you can set a trap with a Thunderbolt and coordinate it with your team.  I have called an auto-Titan down before and me (on a building with TB) and 2 friendly Titans sat behind a building and waited for 2 turkeys to show up for roasting...but that is pretty rare.

9.  Have fun!  Titanfall 2 is a frustrating game so enjoy the rare good moments when you get them.  If you punch a Pilot, get an execution or block a shot meant for a friendly Pilot, congratulate yourself!",1527811606
"guns","t5_2qhc8","Yes. They were a huge mess when they came out, and they stopped importing them for a period, but I haven't heard much about them since they started coming back in.

The initial problems were numerous. I personally watched one die 150 rounds in, the slide stop spring broke and must have been out of spec because CZ had to replace the whole pistol. People also reported the classic functional failures (failure to eject, extract, feed, etc) and more creative failures, like the magazine release both being too stiff to use reliable, and the pistol dropping the magazines under recoil; various slide stop failures; the magazine feeding under the feed ramp or somehow forcing a cartridge 90 straight up; failures to go into battery, etc.

Like I said though, I haven't heard of any real problems since they started importing them again. The hype was totally killed off immediately after launch, but the people who have them now seem to be happy. I'd personally never touch one again after seeing first hand how fucked up they were, but you *shouldn't* have any problems now.

I have owned a 19X and fired the M&amp;P2.0 Compact quite a bit. Both are stellar pistols and I'd feel good recommending either one. I feel that, even if the glaring launch issues are fixed on the P10C, it's still a lower quality pistol. CZ isn't wizards, they had to cut corners to get that low price point. The construction, fit, finish, and quality control are all a step below S&amp;W and Glock. I *wish* they put more effort into it and released it as a full-price competitor, but that's not what happened. Again, it's probably an OK pistol not, but the M&amp;P and Glock are better.

**What is the problem with this,** ""requiring responsible persons of such trusts or legal entities to complete ATF form 5320.23, National Firearms Act Responsible Person Questionnaire and to submit photographs and fingerprints when the trust or legal entity files an application to make an NFA firearm or is listed as the transferee on an application to transfer an NFA firearm;"" **Please watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N118jYj2cA) The ATF already has the hardest way to track people. This isn't going to some crazy database, it goes into the same parts the ATF keeps all the records. Honestly you should have to fill out paperwork, that is the reality of what we do now. I lease a car and the paperwork took me ages to go through. This shouldn't be any different because it is just paperwork on a dangerous item. People can't even buy cough medicine OTC because of criminals.** 

&gt;m855

**ATF** ""The proposal cited the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-408, known as ‚ÄúLEOPA‚Äù) and referenced discussions with law enforcement agencies across the country about whether ‚Äúgreen tip‚Äù ammunition could reasonably be construed an exempt form of sporting ammo under the 1986 guidelines. The publicly available document noted that handguns made to employ the potentially affected ammunition were not available to civilians at the time the exemption was initially granted, and that the ammo type in question did not appear to meet the standard for a sporting purpose exemption:"" **to upgrade a single caliber (which we have tons of different types of anyway) into the next class up? That isn't that bad. It isn't even a slippery slope because it was just the ""green tip"" (just the tip).** 

&gt;Mag restriction part of AWB (tried)

**Yeah this was totally retarded but it came off the coat tails of Sandy Hook. Don't forget a stupid ban happened this year with bump stocks after a tragedy. It isn't whataboutism, same catagory of stupid. Emotional reaction (which every president, current included, has very often.)**

&gt;social security restrictions

**This was for people on disability who CANNOT HANDLE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS. Do you think the government would think THESE people are a threat to a takeover? What advantage does the government have in this fight besides stopping disturbed or extremely handicapped people to have guns. If they cannot handle their affairs,** ""‚Äúmarked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease‚Äù:"" **In that capacity they are already being cared for (we hope, we all know how America is with healthcare), and shouldn't NEED to own a deadly weapon. These same people probably shouldn't have cars and drive right? They are beyond help enough to be on disability in THAT capacity.**

&gt; Obama didn't restrict the 2A or even try [/s]

**You mean like an executive order or the 2 years he controlled congress? again; stopped people on the terrorist watch list and those who are mentally ill from owning firearms, thats all he got accomplished despite vast power and influence. He could have, he didn't.** 

&gt;Fast and furious 

""By 2009 the Sinaloa drug cartel had made Phoenix its gun supermarket and recruited young Americans as its designated shoppers or straw purchasers. Voth and his agents began investigating a group of buyers, some not even old enough to buy beer, whose members were plunking down as much as $20,000 in cash to purchase up to 20 semiautomatics at a time, and then delivering the weapons to others."" **Illegal guns were going to Mexico and to cartels through straw border purchases. I don't want the Sinoloa cartel to have guns, and you better HOPE they were investigating ANY way they could.**  ""They say they seized weapons whenever they could but were hamstrung by prosecutors and weak laws, which stymied them at every turn.

""Indeed, a six-month Fortune investigation reveals that the public case alleging that Voth and his colleagues walked guns is replete with distortions, errors, partial truths, and even some outright lies. Fortune reviewed more than 2,000 pages of confidential ATF documents and interviewed 39 people, including seven law-enforcement agents with direct knowledge of the case. Several, including Voth, are speaking out for the first time."" **yeah it wasnt Obamarunningunstothecartels!! It was the FBI investing Americans running guns to Mexico and most importantly the cartels.** 

&gt;Choke Point

**This was about payday loans, and firearm shops were involved in the investigation. The SAME thing probably investigated pawn shops. Notoriously sketchy businesses showing up in a notoriously sketchy business investigation? It happens all the time.** 

-----
------
Yeah, not as bad as you made it seem. The first was a pointless gesture, which is what politics IS. One was idiotic, yet to this day we have idiotic responses regarding firearm laws. FF was doing what they SHOULD be doing and keeping guns out the hand of the cartel. Go on r/watchpeopledie and check out the cartel videos. These people are monsters and embedded investigations like this better happen. Choke point was about payday loan fraud and fuck those people.

However, when I hear him rapping it come off, to me, as either whiny or the stereotypical angry white rapper. I know he raps well but to me personally, I feel as if his style is too pop for me to like, a bit formulaic for my liking, and I feel like I‚Äôve heard his style before so it‚Äôs a bit stale to me.  Aside from his rapping, the production he raps over is a bit generic and I‚Äôd probably like him a bit more if he experimented with his sound.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","It's all about that plausible deniability and risk avoidance; making a comment during incest porn is so obvious and so hard to excuse as 'that's not what I meant, oh what an embarrassing misunderstanding' if you react negatively and openly confront her about her coming onto you.  But letting you 'accidentally' catch her nude is flirtation 101; there's nothing accidental about it, but she can always claim it was, and you can always believe it was.  

You think women haven't been 'accidentally' letting people they're sexually interested in catch them nude in the hopes that it leads to something ever since clothes were invented?  I've had two girls come onto me the exact same way by letting their bra straps slip down their shoulders; the first time a girl did that, it was 'is she coming onto me?  Is this happening?  Where did this come from?  I thought we were just friends' and the answer was yes, she wanted to and she did fuck me.  The second time a girl did it, it was 'oh this again, ok she wants to fuck' and we did.  They never said anything about fucking, they just let one bra strap slip down their shoulder a little bit.  That's how infuriatingly subtle women are and why every guy ever has stories to tell about the time they realised 2 weeks later that a girl had been hitting on them and they missed their opportunity.

Asking if you want to masturbate with her was a move that took some balls, but even with something that obvious, it's not so obvious that you haven't been able to pass it off in your head as something far more innocent than your mum wanting to bang you.

Asking if you're fine with her undressing is totally a safe, deniable thing; if you go 'omg mom, wtf?', she can respond with 'we're family, I've wiped your butt and you've seen me naked before, it's no big deal, I don't know why you'd think it was sexual'.  

Covering herself; you know what's happening under there, she knows you know, but it's under a blanket so it's all perfectly ok, or so you seem to have decided, and if you don't take that hint, she's not going to whip the blanket off and ask you to play with her pussy because apparently you'd just go 'omg mom, what are you doing?  I never realised you had those feelings about me, this comes as such a shock, I thought we were just doing normal family stuff like watching lesbian and incest porn together while you get yourself off under a blanket, goodbye mom, I can't deal with this, I'm too innocent for this depraved shit'.

&gt;There's things she could have said to give more hints.

Like ""want to watch porn and masturbate with me?"".  Dude, she could sit on your face and you still wouldn't get it and would think she just had a mole she was worried might be cancerous and wanted you to take a really close look at it in case she needed to make a doctor's appointment for it.  Your levels of innocence and naivety are off the charts.

We know Stan now has that doubt, but we have no idea how it affects him. Presumably, he does one of 3 things:

1. Rejects the idea, and goes back to his marriage
2. Accepts the idea, feels betrayed by her, and ends the marriage
3. (By far the most likely in the long term) neither accepts nor rejects the idea, but rather lets it stew and eat him alive while he builds up more and more doubt and distrust in her until everything blows up.

I'd have liked them to make number 3 just a bit more explicit. Like he walks into the bedroom, goes to kiss her, stops, walks out into the kitchen, drinks a beer, then goes back to the bedroom and gets into bed with her. Demonstrate his waffling and uncertainty a little more clearly.

I wouldn't worry about being ""old dad"". First if all, it's becoming more common. Second, you're gonna feel old anyway. I'm always tired, my back always hurts, and somehow in the last 18 months ive started bitching about kids these days and I don't understand everything on the internet anymore.

I think the ""right"" age is different for everyone, Generally I think having kids in your teens or early twenties is a bad idea, but that doesn't mean people who have kids then are destined to be bad parents. As you get older you're more likely to be more stable in life. This can be big. But depending on the age of your parents, waiting longer could possibly take away a potential support system. And trust me, you want a good support system. We don't have much of one, and seeing the kind of support some of our parent friends get, life could be so much better for us and our son if we had a good support system.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The Satanic Panic was somewhat real. At least in my area of South Texas. After the discovery of the gruesome sight across the border in Matamoros (Mexico), the area went into a panic with supposed followers of a mix of Palo Mayombe and Santer√≠a threatening to kidnap and sacrifice local school children. I was 9 at the time and schools in the area would corral us into cafeterias and gyms and force parents to head to schools and sign us out in person. A local church called the Church of Fire was burned down because it was thought to be a satanic church - it was a Christian church. 

""On March 14, 1989, University of Texas at Austin student Mark Kilroy was kidnapped in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, while vacationing during spring break. He was taken by his abductors to a ranch where he was tortured and sodomized for hours before being murdered in a human sacrifice ritual. Kilroy was killed with a machete blow and then had his brain removed and boiled in a pot. His killers then inserted a wire through his backbone, chopped off his legs, and buried him at the ranch along with 14 other people who had been killed there before him. Adolfo Constanzo, the leader of the cult, told his followers that human sacrifice granted them immunity from law enforcement for their drug smuggling operations. The killing drew worldwide media attention and initiated an international police manhunt because of the unusual circumstances of the crime.""

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Not exactly the same, but I got into it with my grandfather when I was like 16 or so at Thanksgiving.

It was an argument over communism. He has brought up the cold war ""Better dead than Red"" time period and was spouting a ton of shit that was just plain wrong. I just so happened to be going over that stuff in High School around that time. Told him the parts he was wrong about \(not advocating for communism, more correcting that people weren't forced to eat their own children, and did in fact do that en masse\). 

He got irate as fuck. To the point that we didn't speak for years after. He would ignore me at Christmas, Thanksgiving, whatever. 

For me, time fixed it. We mended our relationship by just pretending it didn't happen and avoid politics as a subject all together. I had a lot more time with him. He's 83 now, this was almost 15 years ago. 

For you, I'd say apologize. Not for your views or the things you said \(unless some of it was ad hominem\), but for allowing yourself to get worked up enough to argue and become angry. He may be at fault too, but the guy's 93. Be the bigger man, respect your elders, and apologize even if you think he was more in the wrong than you were.

From there, just don't engage him in politics. If he tries to bait you tell him you don't want to talk about it. If he badgers you over it, just walk away and cool off from \(what I'm sure would be\) righteous anger at someone being a huge dick to you. If he can't respect that then it should become clear to everyone that he is being a major dickhead to you.

That's just my two cents. Good luck!",1527811617

I tried to tweak my coil builds to use less juice, and though I did succeed, those modified builds just didn't satisfy me. I decided to get a separate above ohm MTL. I believe it was 1.4ohm prebuilt coil head in a Nautilus mini. I'd just vape 50/50 high nic juices on the little guy, and occasionally hit my subohm RDA when I wanted that knock your socks off vape. It seemed to cut my juice consumption down pretty well without having to stop vaping as much. (However, I vaped 18mg juice out of it for a while and just couldn't handle that nicotine pepper taste.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Imposing vast tariffs on allied nations is objectively unethical and reckless from a political standpoint. If you are unable to come to terms with this, there is no point in further discussion because everything I say past this point is contingent on you basing your opinions on reality.

Yet, it's the standard quo for a great number of countries, both for internal problems as well as a means of influence over bad actors such as Iran.  The more dire step is sanctions, and then war.  

It would be great if everything ""just worked"", but it doesn't. Disaster happens, or people turn a blind eye(this case, since no one has lifted a finger to help the steel industry being undermined).  This is one of many possible corrective measures. It may kinda suck for some people, but it's better than the alternatives.

Especially in metal's markets where this was a well known thing and places could have been scaling back slowly instead of ramping up and undercutting steel even more.

OF course, there are also subsidies, but that is very often far worse because it develops different fragile dependencies.  

&gt;We're talking about a ""don't mind me I ate your food you were saving in the fridge"" situation.

Not at all.  It's more akin to:  The US not utilizing the fridge and other people beginning to keeping it full, so when the US gets a leader that *does* want to use it, he's got zero room.  Clearing out some of the old moldy food, he takes a corner for himself.  And then people get all pissy and start throwing out his food in retaliation.  That's goes beyond being inconsiderate, it is downright spiteful.

That's the thing people aren't seeing.  The old situation was damaging to the US.  Doesn't mean it's somehow due to last into perpetuity, and the US is now #1 evil for trying to rectify it.

If we're all about ""getting along"" ala globalism, we should allow some room for self improvement.  If rectifying our problem now means Canada has a problem, maybe Canada should scale back it's over-production, own up to the mistake of over-production and settle up their own accounts.

So I would do planks, bridges, weighted crunches, trunk rotations and then I would do a full battery of shoulder exercises like rows, flys and a couple others.  It was all super light weight but I found that if I did all my exercises daily before work I kept having less and less pain until one day i went a whole work day without having to go for a stroll because of pain.  There were ups and downs but i came to believe that recovery was possible and i can sit here today and tell you it is indeed.

[However,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/09.png#sprite) I will not allow this listlessness  to prevent me from ensuring that their saboteurs are brought to  justice, fo'sho'!

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/19.png#sprite) suppose it would be best to start with what I did after our breakfast meeting. After putting away the guidebook Monokuma gave us into my cottage, I decided to go to the library with Yumeno-san and Kiibo-san rather than investigate the new supplies.

[We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/03.png#sprite) arrived at 8:15, where I spent the morning reading and learning magic's intriguing history from Yumeno-san!

[And](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/14.png#sprite) during my time there, I recall Kiibo-san leaving with Iruma-san a 9 o'clock for repairs, Shinguuji-san arriving at 9:15,  Yumeno-san's departure at 9:30, and Ishimaru-san arriving shortly after.

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/01.png#sprite) planned to head back to the hotel at 10:35, when I saw Tanaka-san tending to the animals at the ranch. So instead I decided to help him, and we spent the time together until we took a lunch break at 11:50.

[When](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/19.png#sprite) we arrived, those that were already present included Iruma-san, Saionji-san. Koizumi-san, Ouma-san, Akamatsu-san, Saihara-san, Mioda-san, Ishimaru-san, and Harukawa-san. The rest of the group arrived shortly after Saionji-san and Koizumi-san left for the amusement park, around 12:10. Tanaka-san left about ten minutes later to satiate the hunger of The Four Dark Devas of Destruction. 

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/05.png#sprite) also recall Mioda-san and Akamatsu-san announcing a concert...My apologies, but Novoselic superstition is that the nation will crumble if a monarch's ears ever hear the combination of Bach and sick guitar solos!  

[I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/02.png#sprite) decided to go back to the library instead, where I had a lovely conversation with Amami-san when he arrived at 1PM.

[1:20](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/19.png#sprite) signaled the arrival of Harukawa-san and Souda-san, though Souda-san left soon after when I declined to have a drink at the diner with him.

[The](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/13.png#sprite) remaining three of us left the library together at 2 o'clock, where Iruma-san soon lead us to Souda-san's body...

[When](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/04.png#sprite) we heard the explosion and learned Tanaka-san was the other victim, I wanted to rush over to the scene faster than a Novoselic purebred on an open plain! However, Harukawa-san convinced me that it was important to investigate Souda-san's crime scene throughly.

[...Unfortunately,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/sonia/14.png#sprite) we only managed to find one piece of evidence in the end. A plastic wrap-covered metal bat, hidden under one of the diner's seat cushions.

That was the ridiculous part of the original post I replied to.  My response to you was intended to be rather tongue-in-cheek.

You cherry picked sentences out of my already short post to take out the part where I said at a default level men are biologically stronger, as well as that I have seen compelling arguments for why women shouldn't serve on the front lines (not that I always agree with them, but I see some merit and recognize there are legitimate concerns).  And that's where you're arguing the basic strength/endurance comparison that doesn't really line up with what I was trying to point out (seriously our pelvises are quite strong).  

And really, you're probably doing to me what I did to the original post I replied to, in fixating on an argument that perhaps wasn't the posters original intent.  No, I will not be working out 12 hours a day for a year to be able to engage you in an anonymous discussion on reddit.  I have taxes to pay to our wonderful nation.  I will continue to lift my standard 10 hours per week though.

3- I pull my butter to room temp (soft), about 4 pounds each 1qt of liquid. (you can dice it cold too)
4- I wear gloves and I just smash with my hands(no need to dice or whatever) all the butter into the pot of boiling liquid.
5- Blend with the immersion blender(hand blender) and keep it warm at all times, if its too hot its gonna break, too cold its gonna break, so when blending it, you're cooling the sauce down and incorporating air in it, so make sure its always WARM (thats very important, keeping it always warm)",1527811625

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","My issue isn't with the media spin on him, it's his actions and policies. I've found them to be more bravado than brains. I also don't think he's fighting for us. He's gets mired in twitter fights daily and is constantly claiming he didn't collude as more and more evidence comes out against him. Regardless of whether he colluded he's blatantly obstructed justice, which is a major issue. This doesn't even mention his track record with women, his fight against planned parenthood etc. 

I just haven't seen a single thing he's done that inspires confidence, especially his horrendous botching of the north korea summit (which was never going to happen because NK is a dick) 

The problem I have with Trump isn't mixed news, it's polarized news that he's helping create by fighting literally everything that comes his way. Couple that with his terrible economic policies, riding Obama's economic coat tails and claiming they are his; his absolutely terrible track record on business both his own and his dealings; don't forget they just rescinded that 3% growth to 2.2%. 

Whether I liked or disliked Obama's policies, I could ignore him and go about my life. Trump will not shut the fuck up for the life of him and if he shut his fucking mouth I'd like him a lot better, but he doesn't and is incapable of doing it. I don't dislike people who voted for Trump, but how long am I supposed to friggin wait for any victory whatsoever out of him when we are supposed to be constantly winning. As of today he's a loudmouthed egotistical racist with shitty policies, no attention span and no ideas for the future other than parroted ideas.

And there's plenty of historical evidence to where I can see why they would think this (the track record for people in power to treat others with brotherly love is not a great one). 

But, honestly (and as you mentioned) I'm really not the person to ask on this . I'm personally very much not religious , and I still find it surprising to see people who believe in God to be anarchists -- but such people certainly do exist, and I have found many of them to often be very good and dependable people.

* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

Trump does [love reinforced concrete](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910).

&gt; Salerno, Castellano and other organized crime figures controlled the ready-mix business in New York, and everyone in construction at the time knew it. So did government investigators trying to break up the mob, urged on by major developers such as the LeFrak and Resnick families. Trump ended up not only using ready-mix concrete, but also paying what a federal indictment of Salerno later concluded were inflated prices for it ‚Äì repeatedly ‚Äì to S &amp; A Concrete, a firm Salerno and Castellano owned through fronts, and possibly to other mob-controlled firms. As Barrett noted, by choosing to build with ready-mix concrete rather than other materials, Trump put himself ‚Äúat the mercy of a legion of concrete racketeers.‚Äù

&gt; Salerno and Castellano and other mob families controlled both the concrete business and the unions involved in delivering and pouring it. The risks this created became clear from testimony later by Irving Fischer, the general contractor who built Trump Tower. Fischer said concrete union ‚Äúgoons‚Äù once stormed his offices, holding a knife to throat of his switchboard operator to drive home the seriousness of their demands, which included no-show jobs during construction of Trump Tower.

.. 

&gt; There was something a little peculiar about the construction of Trump Tower, and subsequent Trump projects in New York. Most skyscrapers are steel girder construction, and that was especially true in the 1980s, says John Cross of the American Iron &amp; Steel Institute. Some use pre-cast concrete. Trump chose a costlier and in many ways riskier method: ready-mix concrete. Ready-mix has some advantages: it can speed up construction, and doesn‚Äôt require costly fireproofing.",1527811629

Your share price will obviously change over the course of the game. Victory points, however, are a function of how many shares you actually own.

Farmers need a ton of equipment to handle modern demands, they don't make that themselves anymore. The people that make their equipment need a strong network of suppliers, shipping partners, and sellers to get the equipment to a farmer that needs it. All of those people depend on a further enormous and diverse list of things called a **fucking economy** to function.

And yet, from what I remember, as soon as episode 4 there was an alien planet with a fountain and rivers and such of flowing water (or, well, there was, before it all exploded).

The pilot opened up a potential for what I think would have been an interesting arc for the first season or so where they were just in a large region of space where water was scarce, and they had the means to replicate it, and so they could leverage that to make generous gifts or trades of water to friendly species, and have to fight off unfriendly species for that water.",1527811630

There was no trilogy plan in motion when the second one filmed, hence why it runs more like a cheap episode on tv where they don't really care what happened the previous week as long as it looks good because they know people will watch whatever they put on the next week.

Whatever vision you think people have for this 'trilogy', is wrong. It's not hyperbole to claim that- you just need to follow the news of what they have straight out said.

Being ""simple held and consistent within his actions and beliefs"" just isn't enough for a character to be cosidered well written. 

&gt;Me saying Mai is the worst character isn't a diss towards Mai btw. The bar set in ATLA is incredibly high, she's not bad but she's the worst, these two are not the same. It's just that I can't think of a flat out bad character at all because all characters in ATLA are so amazing. So me using ""worst"" doesn't mean ""objectively bad"" per se.

I would probably understand this better if I knew your scale of ranking the characters. Like how do you find something bad and then how you distinguish ""your bad"" and ""objective bad"".

&gt;Katara ending up with Aang or Zuko not being decided from the start of the show is a fact, outlining this makes me automatically a Zutara fan? The Mai part was my speculation but you can look up the statements of former writers and the inconsistency of Bryke regarding the matter

The story ending with Zutara would have to develop differently from the beginning. Changing the mind about it mid-show wouldn't be possible. Kataang must have been accepted by the whole crew before airing of the first episode

&gt;But it's telling, I mean I don't even know what this is supposed to mean? If I were a Zutara shipper, does that make my arguments in any way less or more right? Or are Maiko fans so insecure about the ship that they feel the need to repel criticism by any possible dismissal of the criticizers, even when being a Zutara fan doesn't add anything to the discussion since I didn't mention that ship at all?

If somebody hates Mai so much, he hates Maiko despite him liking Zuko (which I assume you do), and also likes Katara (which I again assume), I'd say he's shipping Zutara.

Also, when someone doesn't consider some ship good enough to be canon, even though the creators probably do, he either suffers from the illness called ""being a better writer"" or just really supports the other ship. ",1527811632

I think they do care, they do know, and *that's* why they switch off. Imagine dumping someone who has always been wonderful to you without even bothering to give them a chance to try to fix this thing that you've suddenly decided is wrong with the relationship. It's cowardly and cruel and awful. It's a fucking betrayal to not talk to someone, to decide behind their back that it's over while faking your happiness so they won't guess your intentions. So instead of feeling that guilt, they deflect, they disappear, they force it out of their heads so they don't have to think about it or feel it.

They go cold because it's easier than facing how much they've unnecessarily hurt an innocent person who loved them and would have done *anything* to make it work if they'd only been asked.

They know what they've done and deep down they probably feel fucking awful for it -- but the less they think of us, the less they have to face their own guilt. 

It doesn't mean they hate us or are indifferent or never loved us. It's just the ultimate self-preservation. ",1527811634

Like listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_NgkfRmUPk) and the similarities are obvious. 1788's just cranked up the distortion and loudness way further.

There's a lot of french artists who were into this sort of sound years and years ago like [J.A.C.K](https://soundcloud.com/listentojack/j-a-c-k-everest), [uppermost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cC0bL2pgf0), and of course [Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKzWLUQizz8) who are the origin of this type of sound imo.

I don't think 1788-L's success is unwarranted or his music is bad necessarily, but he certainly shouldn't be considered the creator of this type of sound. While his music is nothing new, it is still distinct though. Justice are the original developers and innovators if anyone is.

anyway, the only John-centric parts are the Albuquerque NM chapters, so you can just skip to that; she managed to interview him almost accidentally, and he's pretty candid. i found it telling that even though she was obviously and self-professedly completely obsessed with Anthony, she wrote this as kind of a prologue to her interview with John: 

&gt; *John is a true angel walking our Earth and I love him. Not that Anthony wasn't what I expected him to be, he was absolutely wonderful and more, but for a long time after all this insanity I wished it was John I had fallen in love (or whatever that feeling was) with.

So, good thing the sequels killed him off then, considering he had no further story to tell. But Lucas, Hamill, Abrams, Johnson, and Lucasfilm in its entirety would disagree with you on that.

&gt;Or they could build on ROTJ's ending. Have them grow up during the New Republic and New Jedi and combat new threats. Instead of rehashing the same story. You don't need to turn the old characters into failures to prop up the new ones. Kanan didn't need to suddenly suck to pass the torch to Ezra

Because a Jedi Order combating threats to a Republic wouldn't be rehashing the same story? It'd be rehashing the *most recent* version of the story, even.

"WeddingPhotography","t5_2rdee","In the market I'm in I get the question half the time what camera I use or do you use Canon or Nikon.

Some photographers will only hire second shooters that have full frame and the brand they use.

Some photographers think they need full frame and their work is really bad won't say any names. But I've seen one of the best Micro 4/3 wedding photographers and there are people that would not even hire him. Check this link out.

[http://1kcreatives.com/stunning\-wedding\-photography\-w\-micro\-43\-system/](http://1kcreatives.com/stunning-wedding-photography-w-micro-43-system/)

Some photographers will name you need Canon or Nikon because they want the colors to match when they edit and I can understand that. But when it comes to you need full frame because clients think that's more professional that's what drives be crazy. Also can't stand when the lead photographer is full frame and won't hire a crop sensor photographer because they said I need someone that fits my style but their photography is really nothing to brag about.

I'm a low end wedding photographer and I know one photographer that shoots Micro 4/3 but he had a studio with large prints and he said once people see his work they don't even care.

The one thing I have notice using Micro 4/3 Olympus for the most part when people ask what camera I use or do I use Canon or Nikon it seems to weed out the crazy people. I had one groom wanting to know all the lens in my bad. People like that are not worth booking if you ask me.

I don't know what will happen to the market next year with Canon and Nikon full frame mirrorless. I might buy into one of those systems maybe or invest in one DSLR. I do want to keep my Micro 4/3 system just because I'm very heavily invested into the system and own a lot of the lens and its a pain to sell it all and try and replace it and I could only really sell it on the off season anyway.

Weaknesses are, however, really important in regards to the 3 types of combat. A lot of monsters have high resistances to certain combat styles and so you should always try to use Melee/Range/Mage if they are weak to it.

But overall, until you hit I would say level 70, don't worry too much about gear. Buy the tiers up to there and then you should either have enough game knowledge yourself to make decisions, or you can just come back here and we will happily help.

Good luck!",1527811638

Free speech covers any and all speech I may intend to have. You're free to post what you want and I'm free to respond to it, up to and including saying I don't think it's appropriate. Indeed insisting only one side can participate, I.e. the one that wants to speculate about the family, is also curtailing free speech by your definition.

And this board isn't for wild speculation with little evidence. There's barely even any indication that the ex-wife was involved besides the barest of circumstantial evidence. How well have the JJD was the Zodiac posts done with this board, despite there being about as much evidence to support that as there is to support the accomplice theory? There's some indication that the brother may have been involved and I've seen almost no pushback on discussing him.

I'm not going to breathlessly claim that JJD's family can't be discussed. But I think the ""how dare you"" people have a point.",1527811638

I hadn't read your 2nd sentence before writing that first one, but it has the same problem. Tear everything down, no solutions... That's hardly a solution. It's just a different problem and in every case we've seen it experimented with, it's resulted in atrocity.

It just doesn't align with the way we think and operate as humans. It requires wishful thinking that we can exist without hierarchies but it's simply an aspect of our natures that we seek them out and where we don't find them, we create them, out of a need to cooperate better.

PURE and unfettered capitalism is unsustainable because the divide between the haves and have nots becomes unstable and violent revolution eventually occurs. But then, we don't have pure capitalism.

I get the impulse to rebel against anything that feels authoritarian, I never give in to domination tactics or coercive strategies, but this basically gets back to the ""Wise King"" vs. ""The Tyrant"" and more important than the hierarchies themselves are the people you place into leadership. Most managers don't even understand what effective leadership is nor what it looks like. It's a massive hole in our education system at all levels. But that failing has nothing to do with hierarchies themselves.

Most people are also not confident enough to defeat their ego sufficiently to become effective leaders. Nor are most people willing to work as hard as it requires to be an effective leader. Even a middle manager (key word: effective). You have to put yourself last and be secure enough in your thoughts and person that you don't engage in covering up your own failures and remain vulnerable in that respect within your position. 

Quite often, people think middle management is an easy job, until they are put into a middle management position themselves and have to contend with all the conflicting personalities and priorities and needs among their teams. ",1527811641

Because groups and societies evolved as cooperative technologies for addressing what would otherwise be individual vulnerabilities.

I have to chuckle at this one. I was literally born with one kidney. You'd have to seek elsewhere. :-) 

That said, we're not talking about body parts, we're talking about resources. Obviously, due to the scarcity of vital human body parts and the complexities of surgery, no one could be expected to give up a vital organ.

The longest trip a UEFA team has ever traveled *in the history of UEFA * was between Benifica in Portugal and FC Astana in Kazakhstan a total of **6300Km round trip.** 

A one way trip between a West Coast city and an East Coast City(Boston) will be around a hair under **5000km one way**. And almost every MLS team will make at least 2-4 trips per season, every season.

Ignoring the fact that ""Latin Romans"" didn't exist in the 11th century, the Great Schism was largely the result of centuries of *western* change and reform, compounded by centuries of political conflict, not the eastern Church splitting itself off. The New Roman Church of the 11th century was much closer in organization and creed to the Nicaean Church of the 5th century than was the 11th century Catholic Church, which had since added a phrase to the Nicene Creed, switched to unleavened bread for the Eucharist, prevented Priests from marrying, and elevated the Pope of Rome to place of unprecedented ecclesiastic supremacy, alongside a whole host of other reforms. 

&gt;During the last 100 or so years of the Roman Empire the rift was so deep religiously, culturally and politically that you can barely see western and eastern Roman people as one people.

This simply isn't true. The religious differences between late 4th/5th century Latin- and Greek-speakers were insignificant, both groups were culturally Roman - in dress, in material culture, in social structure, in morality, in familial structure, in identity, etc., and on the political level the two groups were seamlessly mixed and integrated, with a huge amount of overlap as far as knowledge of the two languages was concerned. While it's true that the western realm encompassed mostly Latin-speaking territories and the east mostly Greek-speakers, the actual administration in Constantinople was, like the city itself, bilingual, and Latin remained the language of the Court and the Emperors in both.

Adolf Hitler basically treated his contention with the Jews as a war and, whaddya know, it sucked for the Jews, big time. I don't need Capitalism's supposed crimes or Communism's crimes to figure out that treating Jews as an enemy like that is asking for violence down the road; no one does.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","It's Kiin's first split and his playstyle is more reserved. Hes not even the primary carry for AFS, he doesnt play carries as well, he doesnt abuse a lead as well as Khan or Smeb. He is better at playing from behind (ie in losing match ups and in deficits). So the fact that hes the best must mean hes wrecking people without getting many resourcse (objectively false), and the fact is he played well in the playoffs - unfortunately not well enough to warrant him being the best top laner.

Youre the first person ive ever seen call this guy the best, and its basically a default best top laner in the world becasue Khan had a bad showing at MSI.

First of all Kiin didnt even go to MSI, so theres that.

Secondly this is his first split on a good team. Yeah hes definitely one of the best, but this just feels like a placeholder knee jerk reaction because Khan played so badly.

It's hilarious how many people are writing off all the KZ players who themselves absolutely annihilated all competition in the LCK, and now suddenly after losing in the final of the MSI their player are immediately worse lol.

I never said Khan was the best, i dont think there is a clear best top laner, i think that each of them have great strengths and worrying flaws. But i certainly dont think Kiin is the best just because he 'outperformed' smeb and Khan in 2 bo5s. Does the regular season suddenly not count or?",1527811651

This is [shawarma](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/09/26/6a/al-dayaa-shawerma.jpg): meat with sauce wrapped in thin, brittle bread, then grilled again, and cut. NO VEGGIES. Maybe a pickle (singular), but nothing else. You can have a platter of gyros and d√∂ner, but shawarma is always [wrapped](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/92/68/6f/chicken-shawerma-with.jpg).

And I define [gyros](https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ca55jZ2S3ilzxCfV1FjcBw/o.jpg) as meat wrapped with tzaziki and onions (cabbage if necessary) in soft, thicker pita bread, which is then NOT grilled. 

[D√∂ner](https://cdn.theculturetrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault3-1024x682.jpg) is meat, veggies (specifically: tomatoes, cucumber, onions, white AND red cabbage, lettuce), tzaziki, in a variety of breads, the best (objective fact, empirically proven) is the kind in the photo I linked to.

Sources: 
Shawarma - I used to live in Jordan. Gyros and donair: I'm German. I feel very strongly about punctuality, bread and d√∂ner. (You may define gyros differently, but above is the description of the universal d√∂ner ideal, also empirically determined and objectively true.)",1527811652

"pearlsjewelry","t5_3g5mf","Long ago, the extraction of sea pearls was conducted in China, Tahiti and Sri Lanka. Today, pearls are mined mainly in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, as well as off the coast of Sri Lanka, Japan and Polynesia. Freshwater pearls are mined in Germany, Russia, China and the countries of North America learn more on peals at [pearl necklace]( https://pearltradition.com ) blog and latest news.

When Europeans first discovered the island of Tahiti (1767), natural pearls were already known in Europe. Rare - black pearls were then called ""pearl queens"" and ""queen of pearls"". So, Catherine II possessed a necklace of 30 black pearls, the largest of which weighed 3.9 grams. History knows many examples of truly gigantic pearls. However, none of them has reached our days: pearls do not live more than 150-200 years.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, not only the extraction of natural pearls, but also the cultivation of pearls on an industrial scale (primarily in Japan and Polynesia). Today, there are entire farms for cultivating pearls. Such pearls are inferior to ""wild-growing"", but its cultivation is very difficult ...

I like the Nannycam idea.  (Preferably nested Nannnycams - one watching the other so that should anyone meddle with the first you get a record of it.)

Having said that - it's time to seriously think about some of the consequences of that, before you put it in place.  What is going to happen when you present your DfH with the evidence that Rerun has stolen your underwear?  If you don't get an immediate abject apology plus a promise to get reparations from Rerun, I'd say the *least* you would need to consider is couples counseling.  It's not just that he's blaming you for this - one way or the other he's showing himself to be willing to lie to protect his mother.  Worse it's a fucking *stupid* lie.  Like he either has no respect for your intelligence, or he's so desperate to protect his mother from the appearance of blame he doesn't care what he must do to protect her image.   

That's kinda scary for me to contemplate.   

I get he's in the FOG and that he needs to be approached with care.  Which is why the Nannycam is the idea I suggest opening with, but if he's still in denial even after seeing the evidence such would give him?   You've got some hard questions to start asking yourself.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","God now speaks to us directly through Scripture alone. The Holy Spirit certainly works to keep us in The Faith by pointing us to and only speaking of Christ. What does the Holy Spirit speak of Christ? Only that which is revealed to us in scripture so that we know it is of God.

Consider Heb 1:1-2 (ESV)

&gt; 1Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, 2but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.

Consider 2 Peter 1:16

&gt; 16For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 17For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, ‚ÄúThis is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,‚Äù 18we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. 19And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, 20knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone‚Äôs own interpretation. 21For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

These words were written by Peter shortly before his death. What was Peter saying here? We are not to rely upon new prophetic words or internal voices, but on the sure and certain written Word of God.

Consider:

&gt;Isaiah 8:20

&gt;Jeremiah 23:21

&gt;2 Timothy 3:16

And consider 1 Cor 13:8 (ESV)

&gt; Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.

If you're a singer I think you'd have fun with it, but you'd probably be using it here and there to add some interesting background textures and transitions. I would think it's more of a vocal transformer rather than a vocal effect. The midi function makes it like playing a synth with your voice.

If you're looking for something that isn't focused on transforming the voice, but adding effects, you could check out Izotope's Nectar. That's like a whole all-in-one vocal production package (compressors, eq, pitch and formant controls, delay, reverb, etc).

&gt;She was led by the sergeant into the Commandant's office, where he sat with his hands folded in front of him, clearly distressed by something.

&gt;‚ÄúCorporal Belladonna,‚Äù he said, gesturing to an empty chair in front of his desk, ‚Äúplease, take a seat. I'm afraid I have some very bad news.‚Äù

&gt;Oh God. This was worse than she thought. Her stress levels rising, she took the seat offered to her, setting her bag off to the side.

&gt;‚ÄúWhat...what's happened?‚Äù Blake asked, struggling to find her voice.

&gt;Commandant Ozpin sighed heavily, handing her a phone. ‚ÄúI don't have adequate words for it. Please, just listen, Corporal.‚Äù

&gt;Blake took the phone in her hand. Even before she had put it to her ear, even more situations passed by her, each one worse than the last. Was Mom okay? Dad? Or was it about *ojiisan*?

&gt;‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Blake said, even more worried than she had been before.

&gt;‚ÄúBlake? Honey, is that you?‚Äù Oh God. It was Mom.

&gt;‚ÄúMom? Is everything alright? I'm in the Commandant's office-‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúBlake, sweetie, I'm so sorry. *Ojiisan* passed away.‚Äù

&gt;She didn't even hear what Mom said after. Blake gasped quietly, clasping a hand to her mouth in a fruitless effort to stop herself from making any noise as tears rolled down her face. She thought she heard something about him passing peacefully, in his sleep. None of it mattered. What did matter was that *ojiisan* Saito had passed, and she wasn't there to say goodbye. It tore her apart knowing that, even if *ojiisan* didn't recognize Blake when he saw her, she couldn't sit next to him just one last time and say goodbye.

&gt;Through tears, Blake confirmed that yes, she'd do everything she could to get home for the funeral, and yes, she'd be alright for the moment.

&gt;‚ÄúCorporal,‚Äù Commandant Ozpin said once she had said bye to Mom and hung up the phone, ‚Äúplease, let me know if there's anything I can do for you. Take all the time you need.‚Äù

As for the second game, Antoine the chef was pretty irritating with his health regen. He does a lot of damage with his frying pan, and the knifes he throws are hard to dodge. TK is also pretty hard, due to not having any weapons to fight with, or food to heal with, although if you're a high level and have a lot of unarmed skill moves, he's not so bad.
