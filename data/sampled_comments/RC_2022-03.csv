"hockeyplayers","t5_2vs1b","You‚Äôre talking like I‚Äôm trying to egregiously board people. Is it that wild to ask if you can just ‚Äúpush‚Äù someone? To me, ‚Äúpushing‚Äù and ‚Äúhitting‚Äù is apples and oranges. So I‚Äôm just trying to find where the line is. Didn‚Äôt exclude it‚Äôs not-contact on purpose, my mistake, and seems like most beer league is anyway. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole, that‚Äôs the whole reason I‚Äôm on the Internet asking questions. The alternative is to do these things everyone seems so horrified by in my games, is that better? Like I said, my semipro league was like The Longest Yard, haha, very physical, very ornery, all kinds of brawls on and off the field. So I perceived beer league as something very different. I‚Äôm disappointed by that, but I‚Äôll adjust.",1646092800

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","Don't feel too bad.  Learning and growing and being curious is a good thing.  The important part is that you now recognize a more proper way to treat others with respect, because you've learned as you've grown.

All in all, yours was a pretty benign mistake, especially if you didn't make it twice.  Empathy is important, and I think understanding is (or should be) given to those who are experiencing something new for the first time.

I say this as a white person, so I obv don't wanna speak for any of your AA friends and their experiences.  But I think learning how to interact with each other and different cultures and backgrounds is something we should all strive to do more of, and we should grant patience and understanding to each other when it happens.

Not the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm feeling peckish and need a choc bar hungry‚Äô but full on nothing to eat for at least 4 days. I had to do it once on a hike and it cured me of fussy eating for life. Fucking horrendous at the time, but I was with three others and literally all our waking hours was talking food, big, juicy steaks, burgers the size of dinner plates, you name it we discussed it while we walked.

Trying to sleep is the worst, your stomach gives you the most horrendous stabs of pain basically telling you to fill it with something, anything but all we had was the odd wild garlic bulb. So after 4 days not only could we eat a horse, but we stank of garlic as it sweated out of our pores.

We got back to our base camp which was a mill, high in the Pyrenees and the four of us raided the kitchen and ate a 5Kg catering can of corned beef with spoons and I hate corned beef, but on that day it tasted absolutely divine.

""i really do welcome a competition without Russian skaters not only because of their government‚Äôs invasion but also because we wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with the rampant favoritism, overscoring, corruption, and the looming thought of who could be doping""):

""They dope and they cheat, in addition to (or because of?) being the tools of the war-crazed propaganda machine.

Therefore, their absence will not only feel morally right, but also finally allow for a ""clean"" podium.""

Quote 2 that had the overscoring which I already told you skaters have nothing to do with anyways and simply thinking someone might be doping with no evidence is not a reason to ban them.  The statement is pretty laden with ""dislike""

So I (20f) came to spend a few days at the beach with two friends (19 and 20f). Before coming here I knew they are closer friends than I am to either one of them, but it‚Äôs a nice beach house and I like their company. However, since it‚Äôs summer where I live, a lot of my friends are at the beach as well. We‚Äôre staying here for 5 days. They started excluding me, whispering and stopping when I‚Äôm not around, not giving me a towel, not inviting me to join them to do things. That‚Äôs fine, they‚Äôre not required to do everything with me. On the second night, I spent the night at another friends house because I was tired of being left out. I told them I was going and they were fine with it. The next day when I wanted to come back they ignored me the whole day and I was forced to spend the whole day out of the house until it was dark out. Then, on the third day I was invited to go hang out at the beach with some uni friends (we‚Äôre at the beach but they dont want to actually go to the beach). I invited both of them to go with me but they chose not to, which is fine. But now I got home from the beach and they‚Äôre borderline ignoring me, and they took all my belongings and put them in a separate room (I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor of their room). It seems like they‚Äôre mad at me for not staying at home and doing nothing with them, even though they made it clear they didn‚Äôt want me there. AITA for leaving these both times even though they didn‚Äôt seem to want my company?

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","&gt;Yeah, as someone who has played a lot of JRPGs, MMO RPGs, and Western RPGs I don't sincerely don't consider Fetch Quests, or like you said ""Side Quests,"" an improvement to the Pokemon formula. It's just busy work for you to do on top of the already busy work of completing your Hisuian Pokedex, the only real goal of the game.

I don't know why you wouldn't considering many of the fetch quests directly relates to one of the points of the game, which is having people and Pok√©mon living together without fear. The side quests that ""aren't an improvement to the formula"" help the villagers as well as the village itself.

Legends Arceus is a more story-based game, so not counting side quests, despite the correlation, doesn't really seem right, even if you don't like the idea of side quests in general.

&gt;Bad Guy Team? Not in there.
Gym Battles? Not in there.
Elite Four? Not in there.
Breeding Pokemon? Not in there.
Online/Local Pokemon Battles? Not in there.
Follower Pokemon? Not in there, despite there being no reason to not be there.

The bad guy team in Legends is about as irrelevant as the bad guy teams in many other games. They cause problems and help the story along to the climax, in the case of Legends its the thieves in the Growlithe story.

Yes, there's no gym battles, Elite 4, or breeding. We're set in a time period where those things didn't exist, and while Pok√©mon don't follow you (well, your own Pok√©mon don't anyway), you can send multiple Pok√©mon out and interact with them, or have them interact with each other (and even watch them sleep).

&gt;So all PLA does is remove things from the game and add superficial things to make you think they're making improvements to the formula when they actually aren't.

Well, no. Legends Arceus provided mini-bosses in the form of Alpha's, are now giving Alpha outbreaks, bosses in the form of raging Nobles and the legendaries, an actual difficult boss in the form of ""a certain someone"", and doing the new ""test of strength"".

Did it ""improve"" the formula? Not necessarily, it strayed off from the typical formula that we've had for years, which was the entire point of Legends Arceus.

&gt;At this point I think you just really don't even wanna play Pokemon the way it's intended to be played

I don't even understand how you came to that conclusion, lol. The way it's intended to be played? You're gonna have to clarify that bit.

&gt;If you actually want to play a JRPG that is worth your time you can play Xenoblade or Dragon Quest and you'll get an infinitely better story and more entertaining experience.

He wanted to quickly decapitate the government and a swift victory would feed into the story that the Ukrainians didn't put up a resistance because this was a liberation operation. The military failure is not only embarrassing, but it also means he is in a difficult position; to win Kyiv it is clear he must escalate his methods, but doing so will most likely result in losing control of the narrative. Even with Russia's tight social media regulations, it is very difficult today to enforce fully censored media. As the footage gets back to the Russian people, the narrative that this is a peacekeeping mission becomes more farcical. He is clearly worried about this as he has escalated the censorship of social media. Even a quick would have resulted in an endless insurgency as you said. Furthermore, he completely underestimated the weaponization of the US dollar, the unity and depth of sanctions by the west. He has galvanised it. As well as the macro economic effects, Russia's wealthy and influential are watching their fortunes burn. As if this isn't enough, the last piston of the Russian economy is selling resources to China. China have price control and I would imagine they will plunder Russia's resources at cut prices. They are also reliant on credit lines from China and there are a few indications that they may not be as forthcoming as he hoped in light of the severity of the sanctions. I really don't see a way out of this for Russia with him as the leader. I just feel terrible for all the Russian people who are going to suffer horrifically due to this absolute clusterfuck of a decision. I hope they remove him internally, that is the quickest way out.",1646092805

I haven't had covid, but based off of what I've read, your symptoms could be a result of either. Your TSH results lead me to believe you're experiencing hypo symptoms primarily, but I wouldn't be surprised if covid caused some inflammation that is still causing lingering issues, especially since you're experiencing asthma flareups. Do you have your T4 numbers by any chance?  


Psychiatric care can't hurt, but typically you'll want your TSH as close as possible, or below, 2. Your T4 is also important. Your symptoms could resolve with a higher dosage of levo, so you may want to wait. HOWEVER, if you feel as if you can't cope with your symptoms, definitely communicate that to your primary doc and they may be able to prescribe something for your panic attacks and anxiety temporarily. I think it will probably be a personal decision on that one, as only you know how bad you feel. Therapy also never hurts, even when you feel your best.

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly.

Before listening to a DME's pitch and buying a mask view this overview video to be better informed..   https://youtu.be/fWSSyrkRfYI

The pressure you are setup for is pretty important for mask type and sealing issues.  The higher the pressure setting the more difficult the seal becomes.  The nasal pillow type mask will have more difficulty as the pressures get higher.

I have slept under 9cm of H2O for nearly 3 decades using nasal pillows.¬† The rig feeds me air from over my forehead, so turning in the bed has the least chance for sanging a hose and pulling my mask away.¬† Note also with the tube coming centered over the forehead a SO can still cuddle up and not easily get tangled up in a hose.   See if your brand has something similar to this rig.¬†https://www.bettymills.com/adam-headgear-1-ea-ac133341

My rig and some others came with different pillow hardnesses or stiffnesses.¬† It took about a week to get used to the pillows I chose.¬† Think my nose touchines needed to firm up or learn to tolerate the nose inner canal touching.¬†

If your nose pillows are an issue check to see if your mask model has different firmness pillows available.",1646092811
"CurseofStrahd","t5_9pba2","A lot of people here are saying that playing strahd ‚Äúby the book‚Äù is the way you should do it‚Ä¶ personally i have given strahd many abilities some would find‚Ä¶. Unnatural. 

I have treated Barovia as it‚Äôs own space in reality and given it it‚Äôs own set of rules and characters.   I‚Äôve made the mists a living entity, constantly toying with the party in its own way (it‚Äôs messed with space time, ubducted party members(when players miss sessions), it spawns twisted undead, captures certain events in loops, it even adapts to players trying to escape it and changes its tactics.)  I have interpreted strahd as the lord of dread as the master of this demiplane.   He has terrified the party by doing things such as changing a full moon to a crescent moon to help the party escape some werewolves, changing the weather to suit his mood, ect.

It‚Äôs ok to twist some of the rules or add abilities if it‚Äôs creating the right atmosphere, my players are hooked on COS because of these small things I‚Äôve done.  Making strahd feel like not just another enemy is what has made him feel so unique, he should be present in the story and invoke terror at the thought of displeasing him.  

When it comes to the actual fight‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs important to have all of the abilities you will use on paper, if you‚Äôre going to modify his abilities don‚Äôt do it as you‚Äôre fighting him.  Strahd is a narcissistic genius, treat him as such.",1646092811

Estonia is certainly a threat, but it's not as critical as Ukraine would be

Ukraine's border is only 500km from Moscow. NATO would have short-range ballistic missiles stationed near the border and aimed at Russia in the event of any future misdoings Russia would like to commit. Also, Ukraine is the buffer country' between Russia and the open plains into Kazakhstan. 

Those giant plains are Russia's 'soft underbelly'. Given it's natural open fields, military units can mobilize very quickly on any part in the regions. It's mostly why Ghangis Kahn was so successful with his ongoing hordes of Mongolians. They were able to traverse the plains with ease.

I usually just walk past them and go patrol generators and get in chases with their teammates. Depends on the killer I‚Äôm playing. If they‚Äôre clicking and/or t-bagging they usually are pretty confident. You can ignore until they get too close or far away from a loop and then you can injure them. They won‚Äôt be able to bodyblock either, and if they do you just got a free down. If they keep following you when injured, and you know you‚Äôre in a good spot for chasing, you can down them.

Like when I see they‚Äôre not in a good place for looping, I down them and hook them. They can‚Äôt click if they‚Äôre hooked. Sometimes they keep going to me right after being unhooked, and I don‚Äôt like tunnelling, so I just keep patrolling generators since the survivor following me is making this a 3v1.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","&gt;I've heard all this comments being said about Eastern Europeans coming to Ireland.

It's funny, isn't it? In the same vein, I always find it funny how for example Turks fall for the exact same right-wing populist rhetorics against Arab immigrants as other Europeans, and other Europeans still claim that Turks are a totally non-European culture. This is bad in Western Europe aready, but even more obvious in the formr East. At least they take in these Ukrainian immigrants now with inspiring compassion, even though it's a bit of a shame that it's selective compassion still.

The real answer here is still religion. Ukraine, Poland, and Romania are all still very Christian, on a level almost comparable to the US (not unlike Ireland up until a few years ago), and have therefore much more reservations against non-christian immigrants. It'll take time, but I'm convinced that they'll adapt to EU multiculturalism ever so slowly. To be patronizing about it probably won't help, it's a difficult process and also a lot easier for stable and wealthier societies, so investments in education and financial solidarity re still the way to go, I think.",1646092812

Ever since then I had contributed this to the extreme heat as it hadn‚Äôt happened since. It only lasted the three days with the beat.

this is probably true -- there is a maximum temperature for the camera assemblies to work at, and I presume with an outside temp of 116 the interior temp after sitting in the sun was probably closer to 130.

&gt;Well about a week ago I started having ignition problems. My car starts up normally, but after sitting at a light and my engine shutting off, it wouldn‚Äôt start back up after taking my foot off the break. 

Your car is equipped with Auto-Stop/Start right? (shuts itself off to conserve fuel while idling.) Typically if it shuts itself off but can't restart, that would suggest a battery problem, though I'd expect it to also struggle to start when you first get into the car as well. As a temporary solution, you can disable the auto-stop system; by your left knee should be a button with an A and a arrow circling around it (like an @ symbol with a capital A). Press this once to disable the engine shutting itself off. It will reset itself each time you start the car, so you'll need to hit that button each time you want to disable it. Then, get yourself a load-cell battery test as soon as is convenient -- at the dealer, we use a machine called DCA-8000 for all our warranty battery testing, and this is probably what you need to have them do.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","As far as any content goes you have to fullfill at least 1 of the criteria that people actually watch you:

-You have to be good at the game (a lot lower requirement if you do YouTube than when you livestream...""everyone"" is good on YouTube but you still need to be capable to get good footage) 

-You have to be very entertaining as a person yourself/ have entertaining/ funny """"unique"""" ideas

-You have to produce really high production quality content

If you do at least 1 of those you should be on a good path, if you tick multiple of those check boxes you're golden and just need to upload frequently (ideally always during about the same time and same weekdays) and then you done your best you can do any just have to hope people actually like what you're doing and the YouTube algorithm serves you well.


Edit: To give you a few ideas what I'm talking about with those check boxes I'll give you some CC examples from the War Thunder Community;

1st kind: DEFYN (YouTube), Copsi (Twitch) ... Both top players in the game, that absolutely know what they're doing and what they're talking about, not the particularly most fun/ entertaining to watch in terms of personality, but the entertainment comes from the fact that they're just good (and also an educational factor)

2nd kind: hard for me to pick one of those, because I personally don't watch that kind of CC basically at all, but I guess people like Squire (YT) would fall into that category... probably also channels like Many Miles Away (YT) with the ""super unicorn reviews""

3rd kind: First that comes to my mind would be Pandramodo (YT) ... Specifically the ""update trailers""/ cinematics (ignore the shorts) ...but pretty much every channel that makes high quality montages or cinematics would fall into this category

There's also some kinda in-betweens, for example Zetaris (YT) videos with the style ""This Video is about ""X"" in War Thunder"" are kind of an in-between of 2 and 3 (not saying he's not good at the game, he actually is, but that's not really focus of the content).

Also, some kind of originality ALWAYS helps, being too generic is always a bit ""eeeh"".",1646092812

**I call it a ""God Bath"".**

It is very, very simple:  
Regardless of the circumstances you face, for just a few minutes a day - as often as you can muster it...lay down...and gently close your eyes.  

And very quietly in your inner mind or your outer voice -- simply repeat:

** ""I choose God"".**  

You can alter the tone of it and say it in as many variations as you like.  

**I** Choose God.      
I **CHOOSE** God.    
I Choose G**oD**....    
  
Just quietly and sincerely -- keep making the choice.  

No matter the storms in your life, the heartache in your heart of the battles you must face -- simply KEEP choosing.

**I choose God!**  

Experience what a little ""God Bath"" can do..!

**I CHOOSE GOD.**  

* So freeing.    
* So reassuring.    
* So healing.

"entp","t5_2qoy3","&gt;By the way, you mentioned suicide and the death penalty which makes me curious about your thoughts on euthanasia/medically assisted suicide? I am guessing you‚Äôre most likely in support of it (generally), but I wonder what your thought process was when coming to your decision to support it. Personally, I support assisted suicide but am a bit more iffy on the death penalty, but I also like to know different perspectives here, especially if they tie more into philosophy (I am into jurisprudence, after all). 

I genuinely believe in assisted suicide, I think people should have the right to die if they want to. Cases like terminal illness, I think the family is selfish for trying to keep someone alive instead of letting them peacefully fall asleep. For me? I'm not sure. But in the real world, assisted suicide should only be if every other option was already tried, and the individual genuinely doesn't have any other choice, or if they don't care and want to die anyways. Stuff like that is their choice, who are we to intervene.

For the death penalty, it's very much a gray area. I would never trust today's world to judge fairly who gets to die and who doesn't. But in a perfect world, this would be a good way to deterr people from crime and delinquency. It won't stop everyone, and it really isn't the best option, especially considering how the justice system handled this concept in the past.

&gt;For whatever reason we like to adjust our use of words and meaning of words for tolerance, or clarity, or whatever, but then more problems with other words and meanings just pop up. ... I am thinking many people would subconsciously go: ‚Äúevil as a commonly used term and concept has been around so long, that something has to fill its place more closely‚Äù ...

Evil as a word should be rejected, but not completely. We should be able to educate people more on what true evil is, versus someone who genuinely doesn't have high emotional intelligence. When you don't have a good understanding of morals, is it really a choice to be immoral? Do you punish someone who didn't know the rules in the first place? Do lions get punished for killing prey?

I'd never say this is an excuse to just go shoot up a building, but I think we should definitely take into consideration the motives behind it, and learn about what makes people commit delinquent behaviour. I'm a very violent person myself (blah blah childhood trauma), so while I don't condone it usually, I'm pretty sure I would still hit my child as a punishment, because it's how I was raised. Without context, this would look evil to other people.

&gt;Then EQ gets complicated because it is VERY abstract and very unexplored compared to IQ ...

Neurodivergent people are associated with low EQ, and nobody bothers to understand their psyche other than ""those people are nuts"". I think this is a cause of a neurotypical world, because empathy and sympathy is something that's just expected naturally out of someone.

I got into MBTI, because it was a quick and easy way to judge the framework of a person. It's not always accurate, but it helped me socialize in a more consistent and efficient manner, whereas normally I would appear weird and distant from other people.

But I don't possess the idea of ""understanding someone"" naturally, and I have to use artificial tools to help me judge someone's character.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","That's all true - but it also has to be balanced against leaving an incentive for players to actually grind something - whether it's pure rng god roll guns (old system) or red frame versions of the thing you want to craft + mats (new system).

If you could just make a god roll version of whatever weapons they added to the crafting pool in week 1 of the DLC, the system would have spectacularly failed. Even more so if any of those weapons happened to be so good (in terms of their base performance) that they were BiS/meta defining (because then you wouldn't just be removing the grind for a perfect version of that weapon, but potentially a perfect version of an entire weapon archetype).

I think for these reasons they are starting small, with what appear to be average base weapons. It'll be easy for them to add more weapons to the 'craftable' pool over time, but they'll have to do it with care.",1646092814

In werkelijkheid kijkend naar zijn aantekeningen is de 97% niet alarmistisch, maar het er over eens dat het klimaat altijd veranderd en dat de mens er een (niet gespecificeerde) invloed op kan hebben.

Consensus in in de wetenschap sowieso een ongeldig argument, een enkeling kan het gelijk aan zijn kant hebben. Dat moet hij niet monddood gemaakt worden met het argument ""er is een consensus dus houdt je mond dicht"".

We zien alarmistische posters van Greenpeace met tsunami's. Wat hebben tsunami's met klimaat te maken vraag je je dan af. Dat is gewoon met een mooie Engelse term ""fear mongering"".

We zien allerlei misleidende grafiekjes waarin er toenames worden aangetoond van droogte-periodes, stormen, hittegolven, bosbranden, overstromingen, met steevast een startpunt gekozen op een minimum. Bijvoorbeeld voor bosbranden het minimum in de jaren 80 waar na sindsdien een lichte stijging te zien is (door minder beheer). Er wordt bewust verborgen dat er aan het begin van de vorige eeuw gemiddeld per jaar wel honderd keer meer oppervlak aan bos in de hens vloog.

We worden bewust voor de gek gehouden, want alarmisme verkoopt. Zelfs het IPCC zegt niets over stijgende trends, maar dat wordt weggemoffeld, want het geld moet wel hun kant op blijven rollen. Als er geen probleem is hebben zij geen bestaansrecht. Het uitgangspunt van het politieke UN-IPCC is om aan te tonen dat menselijk toegevoegde CO2 een belangrijke factor is dat voor opwarming van het klimaat zorgt. Dat is de voor ingebakken conclusie waar ze koste wat het kost naar toe werken. Met integere wetenschap heeft het weinig te maken.

We bevinden ons in een vicieuze cirkel, waarbij de politiek wil horen dat er een probleem is, waarna er heel veel onderzoek wordt gedaan specifiek om dat te bevestigen. En alleen na zorgvuldigcherry picken wordt alleen dat onderzoek wat hun doelstelling min of meer ondersteund meegenomen in de rapporten. De IPCC- rapporten zijn duizenden pagina's lang, het echte realistische niet alarmistische verhaal wordt zo goed mogelijk verborgen. Commentaar van kritische peer-reviewers wordt gewoon genegeerd en weggelaten. Vervolgens maken de politici van het IPCC daar nog een zo alarmistisch mogelijke samenvatting van, van een paar velletjes, voor de politiek en de media.

De media doet hier dan nog een tandje bovenop. Op zoek naar sensatie, wordt het nog verder aangedikt. Vervolgens is de politiek weer aanzet. Die willen dan doorgaans draconische maatregelen, want de planeet moet gered worden. Ze kunnen nooit afgerekend worden op hun daden, want het resultaat is altijd minimaal 15 jaar in de toekomst.  Zij zijn de redders. iedereen die twijfelt, is immoreel, en moet de mond gesnoerd worden.

Een kosten-batenanalyse wordt nooit gemaakt. Al ga je uit van de berekeningen van het IPCC, dan nog heeft het totaal terug brengen tot ""net zero"" geen meetbaar effect op het verloop van de verwachte temperatuurstijging de komende honderd jaar. Waar ben je als politiek dan mee bezig. En waarom worden de oren gesloten voor dit argument? Antwoord: ""Je moet toch iets doen?"" Nee dat is een heel dom antwoord.

Ook alleen nog universiteiten die meegaan in het alarmisme en de 'duurzaamheid' hype krijgen nog financiering. De wetenschap gaat dus weer hard aan het werk om het probleem aan te tonen, en om nutteloze CO2 reducerende technieken te ontwikkelen. En weer worden er door westerse regeringen bakken met geld over gemaakt naar de VN voor het volgende rapport. De hele wereld vliegt weer, liefst met priv√©jet, naar de volgende conferentie. Om daar naar experts zoals Greta Thunberg, Al Gore, Bill Gates of Leonardo Di Caprio te luisteren. Ze geven staande ovaties, aanbidden deze 'experts' en sporen elkaar aan om nog drastischere maatregelen te nemen. En zo begint de volgende cyclus van het circus.

De wetenschap wordt compleet gecorrumpeerd. Als we over dertig willen uitzoeken hoe het nou echt zit met het klimaat kunnen we helemaal opnieuw beginnen want er is zoveel met data gerommeld dat alles is besmet.

Here‚Äôs an example from my own life: I offset my taxes with ~115k$ deduction from R&amp;D credits for my self employed work. I currently report 250-260 yearly. If i was to bump that above 275, I lose ALL eligibility for those credits. So instead of paying taxes on 115k (because those deductions are pre-tax!) I pay taxes on 250k, despite doing the exact same thing and just making 25k extra.

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","&gt; So to sum all that up it‚Äôs over 200 amps if everything is on. But not everything is going to be on at once

It's not just ""if everything is on"", it's also that most electric device won't draw anywhere close to their maximum rated current. Just because your amplifier is technically 1200W doesn't mean it draws 10A. And even if it did, for the purposes of power calculations that would be 5A, I think; as it only is a single phase. But in fact, more likely than not, it will draw less than 50W with very brief peak surges, if it doesn't have good capacitors to filter those out. And those surges wouldn't trip a breaker. Breakers are intentionally quite slow to trip.

And the same type of argument can be made for the majority of other appliances. People who monitor their whole house energy consumption regularly state that they have never seen more than 40A for their entire house, despite nominally having rather power hungry appliances.",1646092816

"farmingsimulator","t5_2vej0","Early on I had a plowing contract on field 57 that the money for was insane, like 85K pay or something like that. I'm on hard mode, I was all about that. Borrowed the gear and took the plow out there and because of the angle I was barely able to pull the plow at 1-2 mph. No way I could finish it at that pace so I cancelled it. Not that many months later I see another contract to cultivate it for 65K+ and again, I remember thinking, ""it couldn't short me on borrowed equipment twice in a row, right?"" So I pulled the trigger.

I got the Rostselmash heavy tractor (RSM 2375) and the Rostselmash cultivator (K-12200,) for the borrowed gear. I drive out there and head up the hill and it's chugging before I can even get up the hill and start some cross slope cultivation swaths. Again,  the 375HP tractor could barely pull that cultivator at 2-3mph. 

I had to walk away from it and think about it a while, came back and did a lease on the largest mod Fendt Vario 900 with the largest engine it had available, 415HP. Just one day for the lease was 20K. And I went up and thankfully pulled that cultivator closer to 10mph and struggled through a few hours to get that done. Again, in hard mode, I was driving that myself to save money. 

Afterward I've now made my peace with that property. NEVER again. If you can throw a LOT of money at that field it is angled, but doable. But you've gotta bring the big boys or you'll never get that done in a day.",1646092816

Also, the Ukrainian media/government has promoted some propaganda of their own (for example, confirming the Ghost of Kyve was real when it was faked).

Know what other countries weren't in chaos at the time of invasion? Libya and Iraq. Both had functional societies, problems for sure but still provided a decent quality of life for many of their people. They were never at war with the west until the west decided they had something they wanted, they even lied twice to get into Iraq. Why the need to lie if it is so justified? Niether of these nations were at war with the west so I'm confused as to what you mean by peace and why you think America has a right to decide a countries direction.
All nations deserve the right to self determination whether they have internal problems or not.

So can we invade America seeing how unstable it is? There is no peace there and is as divisive as fuck so that is justification enough right? They have never been at peace so you must be on board with any potential invasion of America, that is the criteria right?

What about the numerous Latin American countries that were at peace and that elected leaders democratically only for America to support a right wing coup descending the nations into chaos, what bullshit excuse for that?
Why can America set up military bases around the world yet when someone tries in their backyard, say Cuba, they get geared up for war?

Racist? Against who exactly would I be racist? White people? So because I can see the hypocrisy and double standards somehow that is racist? Yet you can't even justify these double standards because you know it's racist. These countries having internal strife is none of Americas business and is not a justification for them to steal resources and kill civilians. America isn't at peace so I guess 9/11 was justified? Just following your logic here since it is apparently ok to attack nations not at peace. Or do you maybe want to rethink that stupidity? 

Nah, likely call me a racist or some other insult never actually addressing what I said. Right wing, left wing, doesn't matter because extremists are all the same.

So when are we invading Israel and supporting the Palestinians? It was there land first until part of it was given to European Jews. Instead of sharing they are attempting to genocide the Palestinian people's because they want all of the land for themselves.

I regret trying to be civil and giving you the benefit of the doubt because clearly you cannot and have no desire to.

I'm racist for pointing out the hypocrisy and contradictory behaviour when it comes to white people and poc? Interesting logic.

I recently purchased the Floga and used it three times now. It did help minimize the smoke and ash debris but it did end up limiting the usability of the fire.  If there is a way to integrate a grill plate with the Floga that would be ideal. I'm not sure how it'll affect the airflow but would be nice to have the best of both worlds.

I highly recommend purchasing the coal bed. It allows you to use less charcoal (lump or briquettes) and have an even flat surface to grill.

There is a few things that go on with passages like this.      


1- Some people think that that is an Old Testament  time period where god showed his wrath and through ""progressive revelation"" They now see god more clearly, more nuanced sides of him in ""grace"" and ""Love"" .   They believe he still has that Wrath side, and it will come out in the end of days against all of us, the gays, the socialists, etc.  when we burn in hell,  but Jesus saved them from it- yippie.    Yes, there is a lot to unpack there.   


2- There is cognitive dissonance as most Christians don't even know deep theology of what they believe and words like progressive revelation, or why large parts of the Old Testament are ignored.  (There are whole tales of spin attached to the why that should be ignored if you are a Christian) but Christians as a whole don't' really care about digging deep and substance.  


3- A few progressive Christians like Peter Ends who don't see the bible as infallible see the ""War-crimes Texts""  as the nation of Israel trying to please god as they thought he existed- not how he actually was or desired to be worshiped, Pete says they were wrong to murder and kill.  Pete Ends is in a minority of christian thought though.... .     He doesn't go as far as many of us here to say it is all made up.",1646092819

"EDH","t5_2scee","&gt;The scenario you described would be even worse for the CC player without CC out

Which is why I conceded that CC has some, *limited* impact. I never said it was a do nothing card, my position is that it's not good enough at what it's trying to do. As an analogy, I could make an argument that [[Rite of the Serpent]] stops creatures, which is technically true, but you would be correct to point out that there are much better options for what I'm trying to do.
By the same token, I never said that CC has no negative impact on land strategies. What I'm saying is that it doesn't have a strong enough impact to justify using up the card slot for it, and it comes with enormous risk of enabling massive landfall combos. 

&gt;The other cards you listed are good, but are more expensive

Yes, but the majority of them are only one mana more expensive. Being a 3-drop isn't a big enough downside to make them unplayable, and they deal with the problem more effectively than CC does.

&gt;do not cantrip

The vast majority of good cards in magic don't cantrip. I'm not sure why you bring this up? Cantrips are generally just a cherry on top unless you're specifically making a deck that needs it. (Storm, Cheerios, Enchantress, etc). Flashing out Mindcensor in response to an opponent's [[Scapeshift]] is a damn good answer, cantrip or not.

&gt;and most importantly are in different colors.

Fair point. I'm dubious that there's *nothing* better in Mono-blue to deal with lands, but for the sake of argument I'll concede that CC might be an okay solution in one of the 34 possible deck color combinations.",1646092821

Well, I'm not one for writeups, but here goes.

I'm still kind of stunned I actually watched this show after Zaph unwittingly ""tricked"" me into joining this rewatch. Hopefully I won't accidentally join anymore rewatches.  
[](#laughter)

This show was pretty good fun. The designs were fun, and the interactions were fairly enjoyable. I don't like Shamirin as much as the show would hope, unfortunately. It feels like a bit of a standard show, nothing really special until the end. I will probably watch season 2, whenever that airs, because I think the show has finally found its footing. Time shall tell.

I enjoyed talking about it with all'y'all, and I hope everyone had a good time.

Finally, thanks to /u/raichudoggy for hosting. If he weren't, I wouldn't have watched this show.

It's fine to have gripes - not everyone is going to be happy with everything all the time. That's definitely something I've come to learn. Very recently, you were singing our praises because of all the Ducks content that you were getting.

That being said, when you don't like something or don't get any Ducks cards.. I'll be honest, your comments just immediately go to the far extreme of negative.

Instead of going so high and so low, why not just mellow out and try to be more even-keel about things? You just had a great run of content, not everyone can be kept happy all the time unfortunately. You'll get more Ducks content, and the other 31 teams in the league will also get more content. It's only the beginning of March. We still have a long ways to go.

He was a soldier, statesman, idealist, philanthropist, and abolitionist.¬†As a teenager, Lafayette ran away from France to join the American Revolution. Returning home a national hero, he helped launch the French Revolution, eventually spending five years locked in dungeon prisons. After his release, Lafayette sparred with Napoleon, joined an underground conspiracy to overthrow King Louis XVIII, and became an international symbol of liberty. Finally, as a revered elder statesman, he was instrumental in the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the Revolution of 1830.¬†From enthusiastic youth to world-weary old age, from the pinnacle of glory to the depths of despair, Lafayette never stopped fighting for the rights of all mankind.

Without a human being watching every single round there is no way to tell if that smoke, slow, or heal was the whole reason you won the round, we are never going to get something capable of that, at least probably not in our lifetime.

Kills are also not the only variable, but your support isn‚Äôt going to, and did not win the match. Your whole team probably lost between 19 and 26RR that game.

The fact of the matter is, without kills, your team will never win a game. Without abilities, in lower ranks you easily can still frag out in games. Once you get into higher ranked games, everyone will fuck you up whether they are a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù or not. That‚Äôs the entire point of the game.

You aren‚Äôt contributing as much as you think you are, and your team could not compete against the opposition, you all lost RR. If you are good enough to rank up, you will. You shouldn‚Äôt even be looking at your rank, pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist.

I was completely caught off guard, I did not agree to this weird experience and I definately didn't enjoy it. We had an argument and he said I killed the fun with my reaction but he already knew how I felt about it. He's still hung up on the fight saying I overreacted for no good reason at all but I don't know. I found it really unpleasent and just weird.

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","I tend to be lukewarm or dislike open world games but Elden Ring does open world and the want to discover/explore really really good.  Maybe it's because I generally like the art direction of Souls games but seeing these huge looming spires or mysterious dark structures at night shrouded by a light layer of mist gets the ""I really want to see what that is"" part of my brain going.  

That is probably the best part.  You don't have mere scenery to gawk at, all the places you see you can actually go to.  The challenge also adds heavily as I often feel many open world games are rather easy to figure out and there's no true sense of danger out there.  

This could all just be some elaborate honeymoon period but I get this feeling where you know deep down you're playing some seriously good shit.  The moment that sealed it for me was fighting the Night's Calvary boss in the middle of a rainstorm.  Fun gameplay, cool looking enemy, spontaneous atmosphere, hard to not love.",1646092823

BoJack and the rest of the Horseman family might be good for Swords. I think of pain when it comes to the Swords suit.

It might funny to have Judah represent Cups, because he's fairly flat in expression and Cups are emotions.

Sarah Lynn or PB might be good Wands. It delves into passion, and they both are passionate in good and bad ways.",1646092823

Reddit should start their own country. Think about it: it would have a much higher IQ than most other countries. We could ban tik tok and fortnite, and every computer sold has to come with Minecraft preinstalled. We could also ban emojis too.

We all have very good ideas about society and government, so I think we would be far more efficient. I've seen so many posts with so many good ideas, not to mention our country would be the most progressive and other countries would look to us for direction. We would easily become the next superpower. If everyone left America for a new country, we would easily surpass America.

We could make Keanu our president and have PewDiePie on the flag. It would be the most wholesome country too!

Those are just some ideas I have and my own opinion.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","so how federal tax works in Canada (I looked this up really quick) is:

For the 2021 tax year, the federal basic personal amount is $13,808 (for taxpayers with a net income of $151,978 or less). This means that an individual Canadian taxpayer can earn up-to $13,808 in 2021 before paying any federal income tax.

so basically for the first $13,808 you make, you don‚Äôt have to pay federal tax.  you still have to pay provincial tax to BC but no federal.  all federal tax that was withheld you would get back.  then from $13,808-$49,020, you would pay 15% tax on anything over $13,808.  so say you made $20,000 total, you would pay $20,000 - $13,808 = $6,192 * 15% = $928.  if you were making less than $13,808 at either of the jobs you had in 2021, they were probably withholding a very little amount of tax or none at all from your paycheck.  but if your 2 jobs total together make more than $13,808, you need to pay 15% on anything over $13,808.  your 2nd job that you got did not know how much you made at your first job, so they didn‚Äôt withold enough tax.  if that makes sense.  when you work two jobs in one year, you basically wanna make sure they withold a little extra in the second job to make up for the money you made in the first job so this doesn‚Äôt happen.  

I have no idea how much you make though.  over $49,020, you have to pay 20.5%.  so say you made $60,000 total with both jobs, no tax on the first $13,808.  15% tax on the $35,212 up to $49,020 ($5,282), then 20.5% on the $10,980 over $49,020 ($2,251).  another possibility is that your second job took you over $49,020 in total income and bumped your tax rate for additional income up to 20.5%.

this is a lot of math and accounting, sorry, long story short, if you work more than 2 jobs in one year, when you get the second job, they will give you a form to fill.  you basically want to put something on the form where they will take a little extra tax each check for tax.  any you don‚Äôt owe you will get back the next year when you file taxes.  but this way you will never owe extra money which is a shitty surprise.  hope that helps.",1646092824

And it was good. You get shy, ""trying to figure out how to have sex with a human"" Garrus, which is beyond adorable. And the Citadel DLC with him... Well Kaiden is still my favorite there, Garrus quickly shot up to second place on his romance playthrough.

"ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM","t5_3o0h8","No it doesn't. You seem to have a very one dimensional view of the situation. The only US war nato has ever been involved in is the war in Afghanistan. NATO DOES NOT = USA OR IMPERIALISM. NATO is a series of treaties designed to deter war and aggression in Europe from the USSR (Russia). Its been and still is a primaily defensive alliance. And it's done a great job of doing just that defending from potential invasions from Russia with the sheer size of the alliance. NATO has done nothing imperialistic aside from accepting more member nations after those nations vote to join themselves. NATO has no economic responsibility or restrictions aside from having some version of capitalism and most if not all members economic layout is some version of a mixed economy. This war was not the sole fault of Russia but don't be delusional and say that they don't bear a vast, vast majority of the blame. Idk how you can think that this is just to help the rich get Richer there is not a single rich person anywhere who wants nato and Russia to go to war. This war is Russia's idea and Russia's fault there's no two ways about it. You're actually spouting Russian propaganda please stop",1646092825

But we definitely don't get ice like that lol!

"rust","t5_2s7lj","&gt;  Interesting, I imagine switching just the at-rest types from kstring to compact_str might cause a slowdown because after taking a quick look at the kstring source, it seems like converting from String to KString is O(1), but with a CompactStr it would be O(n) because it would cause an allocation. Making this O(1) in CompactStr is something I plan to do, just haven't gotten to it yet.

I've tried digging into `String::into_boxed_str` and I'm unsure if it allocates or not.  I assume so because it drops excess capacity but if it allocates, then I'm unsure why its needed because someone can do the conversion themselves.

&gt; Just today a PR landed that adds a From&lt;Cow&lt;str&gt;&gt; impl, I'll make a new point release tomorrow and try migrating the parsing logic from String to CompactStr

While at first a dick as big as the Eiffel tower may seem to be a dong of immense magnitude, when taking into account the sheer size of earth, the lucky one to be fucked by this dick, we realize that it is not as spectacular as the young MC claims it to be. The Eiffel tower stands at 1063 feet, while the diamater of earth is approximately 41.804 million feet. If Kendrick inserts his Eiffel penis into the earth, his dick would only take up .000025 percent of the earth's vagina. That is pathetic. Kendrick is not fucking the world for 72 hours with his Eiffel tower micropenis. The Earth will get bored after 10 minutes and finish herself with a vibrator the size of Argentina. Be better Kendrick.

Overall, I have rather mixed thoughts on the series. If the entire show was like episode 12 I would have loved it, and if the entire show was like the first two episodes I would have dropped it in the first four. Overall, I think I find the series OK, as I have some fond memories of it, but there's also practically zero chance I'd ever want to rewatch it.

I think Demon Girl's largest problem is the same problem a large portion of isekai and harem series have: its main character is simultaneously the least interesting character in the show and the one we focus the most on. I do not find Shamiko to be a compelling character. For that matter, I don't really even think she's a character so much as a few different characters shoved into one body with the appropriate one chosen on a scene by scene basis. This makes it harder for me to appreciate her growth, as while the more interesting parts of her have grown, there's still a decent portion of her trapped into the gag manga ""hurr durr I have 6 iq"" personality that is static, uninteresting, and yet continues to come out decently often.  
I think Shamiko functions far better as our eyes than our focus. While the problems I have with her don't simply disappear, putting the focus on another character makes them fade nearly to the point of irrelevancy. Shamiko becomes a bundle of tools that can be used to explore the issues and insecurities of the more interesting characters around her, a role she fits quite well. I just wish it did not take us 12 episodes to get to this point. I understand the need for setup, and I'm not claiming that spending a significant portion of the runtime on this setup was a bad decision. I simply wish that the setup was less about watching Shamiko fail, ""grow"", then throw that growth away completely in half the scenes she's in.

As far as other characters are concerned, Momo easily carried the show for me. While I must admit I have have a massive weakness for magical girls with tragic pasts (Homura, Tsubasa, Fate, &amp;c.), I think that that is hardly the sole reason she was the most compelling character. She appears to have a much more fleshed out past than any other character in the show. In some ways, she is the traumatized soldier, left wanting to not engage with the world and form deep connections after war took away her friends, blaming herself for being alive when they aren't. Watching Shamiko slowly draw her out of her shell and teach Momo how to enjoy life again was a blast.

As for the rest of the cast, I don't really have a strong opinion on any of them. We just did not spend enough time on them for any of them to develop much past their use in jokes. That's fine, but I hope it changes somewhat in the second season, particularly with Mikan.

I think I'll watch the second season when it airs. Particularly if it's more like the last episode, I believe I'll enjoy it a good deal.",1646092825

"TrueLit","t5_2982c7","Its a 'ethnic hierarchy' that is so fundamentally removed from what was created under actual colonialism to be a completely different thing. Ukrainians and Russians (and ditto for English and Scotland--you can't be handmaiden to European imperialism and then cry about being colonized) have a much longer and complicated relationship with each other, including a shared origin, than the Cree and the British. Unilateral aggression from a foreign invader for the primary purpose of extracting resources and labour under the threat of genocide is not what is happening Ukraine, and that's what colonialism is.

My point is that is that the Eastern Ukraine isn't a Russian colony in the same way that Canada is a British colony. And I'll remind you Ukranians [aren't unfamiliar with ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia). Framing the conflict, long-brewing and much more complicated, as colonial one not only makes the current definition of colonialism much to broad to be useful, it flattens what's actually happening, and why it happened.

I don't think Russia should be in Ukraine, I don't think they should have invaded the Crimera in 2014, and while I don't agree with sanctions as a useful tool of politics or warfare, I do think the international community is correct in hold Russia accountable. What I don't think is happening here, is a colonial invasion--this is a regional conflict between two sovereign nation-states, if this is colonial in nature, then all war ever is colonial, and there is literally no point in having the term.

edit: and just to make this abundantly clear--actually racialized and colonized people are in Ukraine and how do we know that? Well they are being abandoned on borders so the 'real' (i.e. white, Christian, nationals) Ukrainians can escape.",1646092825

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Honestly, the video in the OP said so.  I read a bit more about it and the LHR was both announced a while ago (05/2021), and the entire purpose behind it was to make the GPU less desirable to miners so that gamers would get a chance to purchase them on the primary market so they didn't have to pay a premium on the retail price, and the plan seems to be working...

Until these hackers fuck it all up, if they're for real.  

Since the LHR was made public almost a year ago, this may just be a group of pissed off miners trying to bluff Nvidia into reversing the change.  Who knows?

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.

Here is the only other computer on the entire internet that is close to it at the same price.




The biggest difference is the newer, nicer, bigger screen with the new 16:10 aspect ratio which in my opinion is a huge factor. 




The zephyrus has a better battery life but who cares about that in a gaming laptop amiright? It also has a slightly better processor I guess but that makes no difference at all. People bug about that tiny 1 to 2 % difference in some weird benchmark but i guarantee you would never ever tell the difference in any uses we would put them through



I keep going back and forth on these. It's interesting that neither one of these companies make the exact same specs in a 17.3 inch monitor anywhere near the same price range, it all of a sudden jumps to around 2k even though the monitor is maybe only 10$ more.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","I feel really bad cumming on my turtle. Why the fuck would I do that. I should have never masturbated in front of my turtle. So basically I was watching porn in my 55 inch tv and my turtle was next to me in the couch. The porno was really old. It was a DVD from 2002. It was probably the hottest porn I have ever watch and honestly I'm probably going to watch porn on dvd instead from the internet. The only reason I had my turtle with me was because whenever I cum, I feel really depressed and lonely, so I thought that if my turtle watched with me I wouldn't feel lonely. Well I started stroking my willie, I used lotion, I took all my clothes off, but my dumbass forgot the tissues. I realized that I forgot to grab tissues but it was too late. I was going to cum. I didn't want to cum everywhere so I had to think fast. It was when I saw my turtle that I realized what I had to do. I came like a motherfucker. My turtle was painted with my cum in his tiny little face and all around his shell. He didnt say a word about it, he didnt move, he just stood there looking at me like I killed a bunch of children. I would never forget the look my turtle gave me. His dissapointing face broke my heart. I put on my clothes, I took my turtle to the bathroom and cleaned him off. What happened, happened. But my turtle would never forget what happened. My turtle, Tommy, would never forgive me. Today, I passed by him, and I know he still remembers what I did to him three hours ago. My only wish, is that one day, Tommy the turtle will forgive me for my horrible sins.

I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!

May I know the exact reason why you guys are immediately removing my posts on r/shitposting? I tried checking my internet connection and all is well. Why do you guys hate me in particular? This is outrageous, this is unfair. I'm able to post on every other subreddit but r/shitposting. I tried posting on r/shitposting and it got removed by you guys. Literally 1984. Is this because of automoderator or something? Because it gets removed just after some seconds I post it. So I don't think an actual human moderator can remove my post in such a short amount of time. So I think it is because of automoderator as bots are able to do these kinds of stuff.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","Montreux was a revision of the regime of the straits under Lausanne. The regime had a League of Nations commission that was supposed to govern the it and the entire area was DMZ'd. During war, the straits were to be kept open to belligerents. The restrictions on outside ships were also less stringent.

The basic aims of the Montreux treaty are to guarantee the naval security of the Black Sea states against outside powers, dominance of the then-USSR, the freedom of civilian shipping and Turkish control in the case of war.

Turkey got militarization and the abolishment of the commission, therefore became the sole administrator over the straits. The USSR shut possible belligerents out of the Black Sea and ensured its dominance. Britain at the time agreed to said revisions because it didn't want neutral (and back then hopefully future ally) Turkey to move closer to the fascists.",1646092828

I(26M) live with two girls, one of them (25F)(E) is my good friend and the other(22F)(A) is someone we both know from university.

E and I always share our thoughts about everything. She really is one of my closest friend if not my best. She can tell when I'm upset, and I usually tell her why even when it concerns her. But this time I feel like it's unfair and unjustified.

A messed up my summer and turned my workplace against me. At this point, I just want the lease to end. In my opinion, A is one of those person where they try to please everyone so they like her back and whines that people don't like her. Every discussion always end up talking about her whenever she's there, to the point where she interrupts people. She always talk as if she knows everything. She cries if you point out a mistake, or lashes out at you telling you you're mean and rude and she doesn't deserve that. She always tries to help, expecting something in return. I've told her to stop doing stuff for me, I don't want to owe her if that's how she sees helping. I really despise these kind of person and I know I can be quite curt to people I want nothing to do with.

For the summer I got A a job at the summer camp where I worked for. Stuff happened and she ended up being directly my coworker. It was a nightmare 24h/7. We were supervising a team of summer camp counsellors. The same team. It was her first year and it was my 8th. So I know I tend to do stuff solo, and I was bad at communicating my actions and coordinating what we should do. But I could never, ever, tell her she did something wrong. She would cry, she would bring how I'm mean, she would call me a bully, in front of the staff, our employers, E, etc. It was impossible to work with her (and with me to a point from her point of view). So it was decided that we would split the team. I was seen as a bully because she would rant about me to everyone (highly unprofessionnal) and I didn't want to indulge in this petty shit, granted it's already petty.

I'm pretty upset that the workplace considered me a bully and she casually called it harassment. All this time, E was stuck between a rock and hard place, A would always rant to her about me, I would too. She didn't want to take a side and I understand. But I was really devastated about being thought of someone who harass people. E understood that. So when I make plans with her and she casually invites A, it bothers me. When she tries to make me be friend with A, it bothers me. But now, it's to the point where she sometimes mentions her doing stuff with her when we were supposed to hang out.

So WIBTA if I told her why I'm upset. I feel like this is pure unhealthy petty jealousy. I'm upset that she acts like she did nothing to me.

TL;DR : petty shit with one roommate that I never really forgave, now my best friend hangs out with her and it irritates me and wonder if I should tell her or just suck it up.

set a filter for vassals, not your faith

first select children, they are dumb so usually they accept, if you are old their hooks won't matter either, especially in tribal

then select adults, this will ignore kids, so you can select females.

when you are done, select males.

you can also reduce the number with other groups, like dynasty members first, or the religion or culture groups. while you ask the first few the others answer on 2 speed so you got  a smaller list. you can also press ascending to descending on the list.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","It was a saturday afternoon, and I was exhausted after an intense 17-part masturabation session to dream minecraft manhunt, when i suddenly had the urge to go outside. I was scared. It's been so long since i've left the warmth of my parents basement with my dream body pillows. I didnt know what to expect. Clutching my dream figurine in front of my chest, i pried open the door to the outside world. The gleaming sun blared through the door, bequeathing a brilliant warmth on my cum-covered boxers. I quaverly took a step outside. My body flintched from the strange feel of the dirt under my feet. And then i saw it. The lustrous field of grass, covered in a light sprinkle of water from the noon rain shower. And then i realized. Dream... grass... the trees... it was all coming together. Grass is green, just like Dream. Dream is everpresent, in the grass, the flowers, He was there. I immediately new what to do next. I flinged off my clothes faster than the speed at which i would click on a new dream rule 34 post. My dick was already throbbing as i leaped onto the field of grass, dorito dust stained shirt getting carried away by the wind. I dug a small hole in the ground, and passionately thrust my 7-inch erect cock into it. I knew, this was Dream. His spirit was in this grass, and he felt my dick in his man pussy as i fucked that grass. I lost track how long i was there. Hours went by, day turned to night, but it didnt matter. I was finally together, with Dream. Nothing could separate us. I took a long stem of a flower, and forced it in my asshole. I imagined it being Dream's hot penis being lustfully forced into me in bed. I stayed there on my front yard for god knows how long. Until my butt was sore, balls drier than the Saharan desert after a long drought. The lawn looked like there was a layer of fresh snow on a Christmas morning. Trudging indoors, i had a enormous smile stretching across my face. I couldn't wait until tomorrow, when i may go outside again and be with Dream.

For years I felt less than, or an afterthought socially as a kid ‚Äúoh TriggerPif he‚Äôs the funny fat guy‚Äù.  I had some pretty girl smile at me in a very flirty way while walking to work one day and I was so taken aback at the gesture I looked away quickly and when I looked back she looked upset.  Random lady, you‚Äôre beautiful I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt your feelings!  

Fixing that mentality, that is the hardest for me personally.  The ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm the fat guy‚Äù.  

Anyway super congrats on the weight loss and surgery!

Edit:  also I think it‚Äôs a good idea to let people know who are considering bariatric that since it is rapid weight loss, it can definitely contribute to loose skin.  I don‚Äôt know the science behind it, but I have heard that resistance training and exercise helps burn some of the fat that ends up being stubborn and sticks around.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","Wowwwww, you meow like a cat! That means you are one, right? Shut the fuck up. If you really want to be put on a leash and treated like a domestic animal then that‚Äôs called a fetish, not ‚Äúquirky‚Äù or ‚Äúcute‚Äù. What part of you seriously thinks that any part of acting like a feline establishes a reputation of appreciation? Is it your lack of any defining aspect of personality that urges you to resort to shitty representations of cats to create an illusion of meaning in your worthless life? Wearing ‚Äúcat ears‚Äù in the shape of headbands further notes the complete absence of human attribution to your false sense of personality, such as intelligence or charisma in any form or shape. Where do you think this mindset‚Äôs gonna lead you? You think you‚Äôre funny, random, quirky even? What makes you think that acting like a fucking cat will make a goddamn hyena laugh? I, personally, feel extremely sympathetic towards you as your only escape from the worthless thing you call your existence is to pretend to be an animal. But it‚Äôs not a worthy choice to assert this horrifying fact as a dominant trait, mainly because personality traits require an initial personality to lay their foundation on. You‚Äôre not worthy of anybody‚Äôs time, so go fuck off, ‚Äúcat-girl‚Äù.

"RHOBH","t5_zddrx","Kim is abusive towards Kyle. Being genuinely hurt by accusations that aren‚Äôt true from your own sister is not playing victim. They both signed up to be on the show for money/fame to some degree, that contract comes with putting your life and dirty laundry on television and they both do it willingly. Maybe Kyle outed the alcoholism, but only after Kim accused her and Mauricio of stealing her home- when that was so far from the truth, Kyle had to defend her and her husbands livelihood and being honest about why Kim would have that perspective was the only thing that made sense and gave Kims bizarre behavior an explanation and empathy towards her. 

Kim was being rude on the trip and its clear Kyle was alarmed with the sketchy bf. A sister would not let bad behavior slide and passively allow alarming behavior, camera or no camera, she actually holds back a lot until she literally cant and hits a breaking point. Addiction or not, You‚Äôre still accountable for how you treat others and there are consequences for you and those around your path of destruction. The right thing for Kim to do was not go on camera and skip the trip to seek help, at the end of the day it was a trip for Mauricio and Kim was not in a good place to go.  shes a grown person and Kyle cant control her, what is she supposed to do shut her mouth and watch the train wreck? Thats such an unfair expectation especially when Kim treats her like a punching bag when shes not sober. 

I love Kim, shes funny and genuine and i hope shes in a good space in her life today. But you know, addiction is no joke and its unfair to hold Kyle to the standard of being a perfect bystander, its her sister, its hard to keep your mouth shut when its someone you love, and it takes an emotional toll through the years. I dont see at all how Kyle plays victim when she is trying to be proactive and stay steps ahead of Kim, resistance is literally futile but Kyle at least doesnt give up on Kim and is there for her as soon as shes ready to turn it around.

Kyle isnt the villain everyone thinks she is. These are 2 people broken by a difficult childhood and upbringing doing the best that they can. With the added complication of being sisters who care about each other.",1646092829

Use a screwdriver to straighten out those jagged edges sandpaper after to smooth it out and sand(with sand paper obviously)about 1‚Äù away from the ding. Sanding it out before repair is crucial as it give the resin something to grab on to. Fill gouge with resin hardener and filler mix, allow to dry. Sand again then coat with resin hardener, allow to dry, sand again to smooth. If you think it‚Äôs not thick enough repeat. Usually for a ding like that I‚Äôd do one filler sand the cover atleast twice to ensure an airtight seal. Hope this helps, if not go to your local surf shop and see if the can recommend someone that does repairs.

If your position is that survival is not an objectively good premise for a species from it's own perspective you're just wrong. Period. There is no argument to be had there. Genetics programs every species to want to survive. That is fact. It's not up for debate. It's not subjective. Every single species has a genetic imperative to survive. The sole genetic imperative of every species is survival. The base function of life it self is survival. That is not an objective premise. Survival is the most basic function of all life. No living thing can not achieve anything else without first achieving survival. Even procreation requires that a species first survive. So if you can't understand how survival might be considered an objectively ""positive"" outcome for a species then we have nothing to discuss. Again.. this isn't my opinion nor is it up for debate.

Georgia was different in the matter that Russian peacekeepers were already there at international mandate, but Russian actions were considered an overkill. Nowadays it's considered as plain offence.  

The sick reality is that dissolution of USSR created more than enough territorial disputes and ethnic grudges at it's former territory for everyone to exploit. 

The endgame is always a speculation, and unfortunately the history tends to erase the details and just look at the last event in the pile. Like, who'd remember the whole thing about implementing the Minsk accords as they no longer matter? With them at hand every, absolutely every side had an option to resolve it peacefully at the cost of their own reputation. Noone did. USCE did not push on supervision to make sides at least pretend they play nice, Ukraine desperately gave up the whole concept of federalism, Putin kept pretending he's a passer by at Donbass even when the dumbest loyalist realized it's wrong.",1646092830

&amp;#x200B;

To extend, you'll go to your local immigration office and bring the following;

* Exactly 1900 baht in cash (No change is given)
* At least one 4x6cm passport style photo
* Photocopies of your passport's info page, the page where your entry stamp is, and your departure card. Most if not all immigration offices will have a place where they will do photocopies for you at like 3 baht a page, it's a good way to make use of the 1 baht coins but may greatly extend the amount of time spent at immigration.
* Your TM.30 Notice of Residence. - This may or may not be requested, it's really up to the immigration officer/office if they ask some are known to be very consistent while some aren't.
* A blue/black pen
* Your printed TM.7 form (Optional, you can just ask for it at immigration and you fill it out there, it takes like 5 minutes. At the very least it's good to google it and see what it looks like.)

&amp;#x200B;

A few points to add is that if you're staying at an AirBnB, often times the host won't file a TM.30 and may not want to since their worried of getting fined or being charged tax on their AirBnB revenue. If it is requested at immigration or you just want to be safe, you can always book a night in a cheaper hotel as they almost always file a TM.30 online, just be sure you ask for your TM.30 receipt when checking in.

As a caveat, if you‚Äôre planning on extending in Bangkok, you‚Äôll have to go to the Temporary Extension Centre in Muang Thong Thani. This only applies to those who entered on visa exempt, if someone has an actual visa they go to Chaengwattana Immigration Office.",1646092831

"WholesaleRealestate","t5_2ofp53","This was something I was wondering myself for some time.  I've read a few books and watched lots of YouTube and found a few different ways people estimate renovation costs: Some people use low cost (only needing carpet/paint), mid (carpet, pain, kitchen, bath), and high (full gutting). From what I've seen, mid has been around $20K range. Obviously this changes depending on size of the property. I've also seen the Rule of 5s - so for everything you see in the property that requires renovation, add 5K to your renovation costs. This will also change a bit depending on size of the property and area you live.  I've read about  having a square footage estimator: so multiplying the sq ft by a fixed repair cost. In the book I read it was $5 min (used even if the house seemed like it didn't need renovations). Then this fixed cost can be bumped up if the house needs more repairs (i.e. using $15 - $20 for a medium sized rehab).  I think you should try a couple methods and see what you like/what works for your area and tweak it as you go. Hope that helps!",1646092831

But looking back I'm glad I did it even if it wasn't for myself necessarily. I'm only 24. I have plenty of time to work on my current problems. It's stupid to end my life just so I don't have to deal with them. Being in a suicidal mindset is pretty scary.

"GreenPartyOfCanada","t5_3cto7","The article you posted says nothing worth saying. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but you are being very obtuse here. Until the courts sort this out, it's totally unclear what is going on with this. Even the wording of the claims is obscure. If this were an article about a person hired to gin up popular support for a wind farm or solar installation, and they were fired for unclear reasons - it would be equally useless. The only reason this made any news at all is because it's in the nuclear field - even though it has no health implications at all. 

I don't really care if people THINK the nuclear waste site is safe, I care if it IS. And that isn't a question you answer with your gut.

You keep posting articles that do nothing but sow unreasonable fear of nuclear power. You continue to avoid saying what you think should replace nuclear power. If you don't think it can be replaced, then we had best wrap our heads around doing it the best way we can. The nuclear industry in Canada has an excellent safety record.

There's a fresh link to the podcast transcript I attempted before. I linked directly to the podcast. And yes, an emergency room doctor that has deep environmentalist roots has produced over 100 episodes of this podcast now, simply because he is so pissed off that the environmentalist community is so wrong about nuclear power. There are plenty of Greens that are totally fed up with the rampant energy illiteracy in Green circles. The guest he interviewed was Geraldine Thomas, from Imperial College in London. The difference here is that I linked to an interview with a couple medical professionals that know what they are talking about.

From an 'effectiveness perspective', it would make sense for a strike to occur in March before final classes and exams. It could also make sense to hold up the summer term. I hope it never gets to that point as I don't want to see York students having to go through a strike - ever - and most certainly not now when I am a member of YUFA. 

Unfortunately, we can't provide any real information about dates that students can depend on. The best we can say just now is that the Executive will only call a strike if negotiations are stuck, so here's hoping they will move along!!",1646092833

In addition, data scientists are trained to explain things in an easy to understand fashion. Not everyone is good at this but that's a common expectation for the job.

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","You have to look up the requirements to unlock each Job. You just do. The game doesn't tell you and having this information is totally essential from the start, IMO.

I also recommend building at least 4 characters from scratch that you stick with at the beginning, so you can craft and mold them however you see fit (if one of them dies and turns to crystal in battle, you lose them forever so just reset and try again if this happens). To me, this was more effective than using the story-based characters that join your team at various points in the adventure (with one exception, a character who's insanely overpowered but won't join until late).

Also, to add to the Bravery/Faith notes: you can permanently increase these stats by using two Mediator abilities. Each successful cast of the ability that raises your Brave results in a temporary gain of 4 in battle (mostly useless, I say) but it's a PERMANENT gain of 1. Same goes for the Faith-raising ability.

Lastly, and also related to this, to find some of the best items in the game in the Deep Dungeon, you not only have to look up the location of each, you should know your chances of picking up the ultra-rare awesome item (versus the common item) are based on your Brave...but reversed. In other words, if you have a Brave of 80, you only have a 20% chance of getting the rare item. It sucks, but in order to make sure you get the good one, you have to knock your Brave down to 10 for one character, which gives him/her a 90% chance of getting the rare item. After you get everything, you can raise the stat back up.

"swrpg","t5_2vzmi","As my last offering on the subject, here is the preliminary write up for the fluff side of the species.

The R≈çm
A species of near-human spacer vagabonds, the R≈çm have been traveling the galaxy longer than most species recorded history. Thousands of years of persecution has taught the R≈çm to remain on the fringes of society, an invisible culture that exists right under the noses of the galaxy. There are Catina tales about these space vagabonds, but they are universally considered a myth, a fact the R≈çm themselves do everything they can to reinforce.

Physiology. As a near-human species, the R≈çm, on average, appear essentially human. The few who have studied the R≈çm believe the species to have descended from the Sephi, as many R≈çm display the genetic marker of pointed ears. However, due to the species‚Äô habit of blending in with local communities, the R≈çm are highly diverse in appearance. Genetic markers from many of the galaxies near-human species appear in R≈çm children from time to time. Zabrak horns, being born without eyes, unusual skin tones, etc. are all possible among the R≈çm (any such deviations are superficial only, and will not affect the capabilities of the individual R≈çm).
   The R≈çm have average lifespans of over 200 years, with many living vital lives into their forth century. Due to this, the R≈çm have come to make extensive use of cybernetics as a way to support their extraordinary lifespans (spacer life can be VERY dangerous). Unlike species such as the Gank however, the use of cybernetics by the R≈çm is generally subtle and unobtrusive, but it becomes more of a complete cybernetic transition over time. The prevalence of implants is so ubiquitous, it could lead others to believe the R≈çm are born with them.

Society. As an itinerant species, the R≈çm tend to gather cultural tags from the people they live among, or regularly interact with. Extraordinarily familial by necessity, R≈çm culture is based around semi-autonomous clans who all recognize a single monarch. Each clan holds sway over a certain area of space, although this division has not seemed to cause much conflict among the R≈çm, it does establish scavenging rights. Thousands of years of persecution have led the R≈çm to adopt hidden subculture that is invisible to most members of the galactic community.
   R≈çm culture is built on recycling and repurposing. Since they have no homeworld, the R≈çm have a limited access to the resources they need to survive. Thus, the R≈çm have become some of the galaxies best scavengers, rivaling even the Jawas with their creativity and ingenuity in crafting makeshift machinery. Nearly every bit of gear any individual R≈çm carries will have been salvaged or repurposed by the R≈çm themselves, they waste nothing.
   Although space travel is intrinsic to R≈çm culture and society, the vast caravans of the species past have given away to hordes of mixed R≈çm and non-R≈çm crews spread across the galaxy. The clustered caravans made the R≈çm easy targets for prejudice and repression, as such, they were abandoned in favor of a more integrated and thus invisible existence. There are still a few massive R≈çm caravans hiding in the most remote corners of the galaxy, however, the species has learned to ‚Äòblend in‚Äô, commonly telling others they are ‚Äòorphans‚Äô who don‚Äôt know much about ‚Äòtheir people‚Äô. This ‚Äòsub-cultural‚Äô approach to R≈çm society has helped maintain reasonable anonymity for the last thousand years, while still providing a strong sense of cultural identity.

Homeworld &amp; Language. The R≈çm have never claimed a homeworld, nor any land for that matter. They are, in the truest sense, a spacer species. At one point in their history, the R≈çm made use of a language that was their own, however, over the millennia, the species slowly transitioned into using a form of Galactic Basic that conceals meaning through metaphor and linguistic code.

Perception of the Force. Although likely false, it is a common belief that the R≈çm have a higher concentration of force sensitives among their people than is the ‚Äògalactic standard‚Äô. While this has never been confirmed, nor disproved, the R≈çm do place a great deal of cultural significance in those who demonstrate a gift as diviners or seers (generally skilled in the farsight, foresee, or sense powers), or those who possess a natural affinity for machines (manipulate). There are also countless stories of crazy spacers cursing people, but no one believes that such curses are real.",1646092833

I cut things out of my life that added to my stress, like recently I stopped seeing a therapist because I was having so much anxiety surrounding the visits that they were more stressful than productive.

I have a very supportive partner who has finally convinced me that he truly doesn‚Äôt hate me for not working (he never indicated that but I convinced myself for a long time that I was a burden and they were better off without me) so right now I don‚Äôt work and I don‚Äôt force myself to try to get a job.

Determined to keep her subjects from fighting, the Ruler of Oz, Princess Ozma, along with her dearest friend, Princess Dorothy Gale (formerly of Kansas), embarks on a quest to restore peace.When the Supreme Dictator of the Flatheads refuses to cooperate with Ozma, she and Dorothy seek out Queen Coo-ee-oh of the Skeezers, hoping she will be more reasonable. But the queen imprisons Ozma and Dorothy in her grand city and then traps them by submerging the whole city under water. Now it is up to Glinda the Good to save the day. She assembles all of Ozma's counsellors--including such beloved Oz friends as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, Patchwork Girl, Shaggy Man, Tik-Tok, and Wizard of Oz--and they set out to rescue their friends. Will the magic powers of Glinda and the Wizard combined be enough to free Ozma and Dorothy?A rousing tale of suspense, magic, and adventure, Glinda of Oz is the fourteenth and final Oz book by L. Frank Baum. It's a grand conclusion to his chronicles of America's favorite fairyland. This deluxe gift edition features all twelve of Oz artist John R.

Originally, I was planning on testing collisions using a box for the ball, but after testing point-based collision, it looked ""good enough"". So, all I'm doing is:

1. Determine the tile index at a point near the centre of the ball
2. Look up the level map if there is a brick at that tile index.
3. If there is:
   1. Clear the brick in the level map
   2. Render the cleared brick
   3. Invert the vertical direction of the ball.

That's it!

I could do as above with a few points (at the four corners of the ball), but it seems fine as-is.",1646092834

"whitecoatinvestor","t5_ky4cc","Hi! Premed and Finance major here from a good business school. Congrats from being a savy investor, already ahead of the curve! I wouldn't touch the Vanguards, they are already golden. It's good to have a taxable account in case you need to liquidate anything. I agree you should convert what you can into Roth IRAs without triggering huge taxable events since you soon won't be able to contribute to a Roth when you get an attending salary. Contribute the max 6k per year during residency and hold onto it until you're 60 and now have a huge tax free account. When opening the account contribute 6k for previous year AND 6k for current year (most brokers have a setting for you to distinguish which tax year you're investing in). I am not familiar with TSP accounts but like I said convert whatever accounts you can into Roth without taxable events. Once you're in residency make sure to take advantage of $ match on the 401k if they offer it, max that out. If you have anything left over to invest (make sure you're living comfortable or within reason, no need to be penny pinching here) put the rest in the Vanguard funds, not individual stocks.

What other animals are seen as unclean? And what does unclean mean? Are these animals shunned? Is there an active dislike? I always hesitate to draw lines between differing faiths, but is it an inverse to Hindus and cows? 

Is there a possible historical or cultural (cultural being 5-8 century Arabic because that's what would have been dominate during the birth of Islam correct) basis to the reasons these animals are seen as unclean or is it firmly rooted in faith?",1646092835
"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","It has ONLY been used by racists huh? That's a very broad assumption to make. Have you seen every instance of the meme? Because I've seen a lot of them and most of them aren't used in a racist manner. I've used it before and I'm not racist nor am I anywhere in the same galaxy as sympathizing with Nazis. Does this make me racist by default?

Again, yes you can find racist variations of it but that's because it originated on 4chan. 4chan will be 4chan. It's not an inherently racist meme and it's ridiculous to paint everybody who uses it with the broad brush of ""racist"". Every time the word ""racist"" gets thrown around with such reckless abandon in order to use it as a cudgel to brow beat and discredit political opponents, it loses meaning. Racist, fascist, Nazi, wHiTe SuPrEmAcIsT, all meaningless words in 2022. All because people want to be intellectually lazy.",1646092835

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

&gt;Putin didn‚Äôt just invade the Ukraine on 2/24/2022, he officially ended the #petrodollar system. How? Remember, Russians don‚Äôt do anything without a plan. They and China have been prepping for this moment for years and are now ready:

&gt;-Russia has stated NATO expansion into Ukraine was a red line.
-They knew their invasion of Ukraine would be inevitable and would have strategized that the US/West‚Äôs response would be SWIFT $ system exclusions/sanctions, sanctions which started today.

&gt;-Reasonable to expect that Russia‚Äôs next step will be to shut off oil/gas pipelines to Europe, as Russia has built up huge Yuan, gold &amp; commodity reserves.
-This will cause massive price and supply disruptions (war level) to the western markets &amp; monetary system.

&gt;...

I feel the crucial flaw in this logic is that so far Putin has put his economy on pause in a desperate hope Europe just gives up and returns to the status quo.

There‚Äôs static enemy level mods for Skyrim, but the problem I run into with those is that high level enemies tend to one shot you and you have to hit them 30 times. (And in practice I just delay doing quests until I‚Äôm high enough level for them). In soulsborne it feels more like they 2 or 3 hit kill you and you can kill them in 10-15 hits or so - hard but not impossible.

Quaxly: water/flying water/steal or water/fighting It's a bird so of course flying is on the table but it looks militaristic a little bit so it could go war boat themed and be steel or fighting, I hope not steel because of empoleon but if fire/fighting taught us anything it's that they'll repeat starter types, I don't want water flying it's just too basic and would be the most boring route for Quaxly to go but a militaristic water/fighting type seems very cool.",1646092837

All-in-all, I have a great time with this show. I'm looking forward to the impending Season 2.

Quick question for source readers: [Machikado Mazuko]&gt;!Did I just make up the idea of Momo having lost her sense of taste, or is that a future spoiler that I apparently read at some point?

**Kuzu no Honkai ‚Äì Episode 1 ‚Äì First Timer, sub**

Heard a lot of things about the show, but very little about the plot. 

Starts out quite beautiful and already seeding a lot of drama, very early and intense kiss with nice cinematography and an MC who does her best to sound like HanaKana (so much that thought it was her). OP also good, especially for the genre. --- As an aside, I know that Onii-chan is hard to translate, but instead of ‚ÄúBig Bro‚Äù Commie could also just go with ‚ÄúMy dear brother‚Äù or something. 

Fireworks has a lot of bile in her. Seems like Fire Flower fits her as a name. Did she really hope to get with her ‚Äúolder brother‚Äù if she just stares at him long enough from afar?

So far we have puppy love and Electra Complex and maybe grooming that went on in the background. 

The start between Mugi and Hanabi is already a toxic mess, almost hatefucking by proxy. How can this get worse?

Good ED. Feeling a little called out already. This has a lot of room to run.",1646092837

Not that long ago Canelo would never fight Golovkin until he did. He fought Kovalev but wouldn't dare fight Bivol until he did. Long time ago it was Trout who Canelo was avoiding, then it was Lara. It's the same story, the haters will keep moving the goal post.",1646092837

&gt; How many disappeared in this cartel &amp;quot;Extermination site&amp;quot; on the outskirts of Nuevo Laredo, miles from the U.S. border? After six months of work, forensic technicians still don&amp;#039;t dare offer an estimate.

&gt; Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called &amp;quot;The dungeon,&amp;quot; in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel.

&gt; According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 &amp;quot;Extermination sites&amp;quot; have been found.

&gt; # [Violaci√≥n grupal en Palermo: seis detenidos por abusar de una joven en el interior de un auto](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/BH3LeyIW6pi7RJztwUBmiOcHsiw=/1200x628/filters:format(webp\):quality(85\)//cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/N3AHRIX2DZEPNJ2MMB27YIJ2TY.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; As√≠ deten√≠an a los 6 sospechosos por abusar sexualmente de una joven en Palermo
&gt; 
&gt; Todo comenz√≥ este lunes feriado por la tarde, en **Serrano al 1.300**, entre Niceto Vega y Cabrera, en el barrio porte√±o de Palermo, cuando una denuncia alert√≥ a las autoridades sobre una violaci√≥n grupal. Seg√∫n pudo saber **Infobae**, cuando los polic√≠as llegaron al lugar se encontraron con seis sospechosos: cuatro en el interior de un auto Volkswagen Gol color blanco y dos afuera que hac√≠an ‚Äúde campana‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; En el interior del coche, los agentes tambi√©n encontraron a una mujer de 20 a√±os, quien estaba semi inconsciente. Sin embargo, la joven les lleg√≥ a contar a los agentes que **hab√≠a sido abusada sexualmente en el interior del auto por cuatro de los hombres antes de que se la llevara el SAME al hospital Rivadavia**, donde tom√≥ intervenci√≥n la oficina de violencia sexual del centro m√©dico y se le practic√≥ el protocolo que se utiliza en estos casos.
&gt; 
&gt; Para ese altura, los vecinos comenzaron a agolparse en esa esquina de Serrano y Niceto Vega, alrededor del Volkswagen Gol, para repudiar a los sospechosos. Celulares en mano, varios filmaron lo sucedido. **As√≠, captaron el momento exacto en que los seis varones, de entre 20 y 24 a√±os, eran detenidos. Los acusan de ‚Äúabuso sexual‚Äù**.
&gt; 
&gt; De fondo, en los videos que circulaban este lunes por las redes sociales, se escucha c√≥mo les gritaban: **‚ÄúVioladores, violadores...‚Äù**. Tambi√©n les sacaban fotos e, incluso, hubo algunos que intentaron sortear a los polic√≠as para increpar a los detenidos. En ese contexto, uno de los sospechosos intentaba ocultar su rostro, pero los otros cinco desafiaban a la gente al grito de ‚Äú**Dale, filmame**‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; [Los seis detenidos fueron detenidos al costado del auto donde estaban abusando sexualmente de una chica de 20 a√±os ](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/jiTqUqQ2qPJA7iSARzfySjRBOOo=/420x236/filters:format(webp\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/ERJKLFCHLNDDVDYCHD2DU3NGXA.jpg 420w)
&gt; 
&gt; Los seis detenidos fueron detenidos al costado del auto donde estaban abusando sexualmente de una chica de 20 a√±os 
&gt; 
&gt; Seg√∫n se conoci√≥, en el interior del VW Gol blanco se encontraron **cuatro envoltorios con picadura de marihuana (un poco m√°s de 11 gramos), una pastilla de LCD y siete celulares**. Todos los elementos fueron secuestrados por la Polic√≠a de la Ciudad.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúLa persona que hizo la denuncia es una mujer que trabajaba en un comercio de la cuadra. Primero vio a los chicos fumando y tomando algo en las inmediaciones de su negocio, pero **despu√©s not√≥ que el auto blanco empez√≥ a moverse muy bruscamente**. Ah√≠, se acerc√≥ y vio que estaban turn√°ndose para abusar de una joven que estaba dentro del veh√≠culo‚Äù, cont√≥ una testigo a este medio.
&gt; 
&gt; Ante esto, de inmediato llamaron al 911. La mujer refiri√≥ que cuando la Polic√≠a lleg√≥ al lugar y rescat√≥ a la chica abusada, ella gritaba desesperadamente y dijo: ‚Äú**Me dieron algo para tomar**‚Äù. ‚ÄúEstaba como perdida, no sab√≠a como hab√≠a llegado ah√≠. Los otros seis estaban muy ‚Äòpasados‚Äô‚Äù, acot√≥. La testigo tambi√©n dijo que hab√≠a vecinos que intentaron pegarles.
&gt; 
&gt; [La Polic√≠a Cient√≠fica trabajaba sobre el auto de los detenidos](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/2m1XFu_W0ZxjoiDy30kLvOeGt9g=/420x236/filters:format(webp\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/XLHXPDDOMJCFDMUKBWSU77SW2Q.jpg 420w)
&gt; 
&gt; La Polic√≠a Cient√≠fica trabajaba sobre el auto de los detenidos
&gt; 
&gt; La vecina cont√≥ adem√°s que, este lunes 28 de febrero, m√°s temprano la Polic√≠a ya hab√≠a estado en Serrano al 1.300, porque ‚Äúhay un boliche cerca y hubo mucho movimiento de madrugada por el feriado: varios chicos salieron borrachos‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Para el atardecer en el auto de los detenidos trabajaba la Polic√≠a Cient√≠fica. En el caso interviene el Juzgado Criminal y Correccional N¬∞21.

I was at ar50 sth. I believe there is nothing left to explore (only need 100% dragonspine) so decided to just play the abyss. At first i hate it because i cant get 36 star and i keep challenging the abyss to get 36 star only. Primos not my concern although i do want mhy to at least increase the reward at some point.


I got my first 36 star in 1.6 after i finally bench diluc and just run national sucrose. After i got my first 36 star, ive been building some meta team like taser, freeze or just double geo and constantly getting 36 star since tday. Lol even new abyss is a joke for meta team.

Now im bored, i just got 36 star on new cycle in like an hour. Probably will crown miko and bring her to abyss again and wait for ayato to come.",1646092839

Waterpik: Brand is actually important. You wanna use the fine tip which I think they call the ‚Äòpick pocket‚Äô. You need to trace slowly along the gumline, pointing that tip at a 45 degree angle into your gums. Be sure to do  both sides of your teeth, the lip side and tongue side and behind your last tooth. Don‚Äôt force it anywhere but the tip should be kinda gently riding in the groove of your gumline. Start out pretty gentle flow, check the directions for max from that tip. Obviously, pay special attention to problem areas and funny corners.   If it is the counter model, you will probably need to refill at least once. It it is the dinky cordless, maybe four or even five times.   People in braces should then trace all around their brackets.

If you find you aren‚Äôt getting answers consider going to a dental hygiene school for evaluation by the students and their teachers, they will analyze and help you a ton with the latest science and equipment and it is often very cheap (but trade off is time because the students get every step checked).

He has NEVER been for globalism. He is a nationalist to the core, Xi is guaranteed to strike Taiwan, and take away probably much need computer parts for their AI systems they've been building. 

I personally see them as two devout nationalists to their own nations, and think themselves to be fighting for the existence of their empires and nations for generations. 

I think they hold a belief structure that makes this situation THAT more fucked up and tense. I think Putin is once again pulling a KGB triple nipple and China is going to SWARM Taiwan and not leave any time for a response. They know many of our nations are in societal shambles from the NWO shit and that's why we're reluctant to put boots on the ground from these Western nations.

&gt; La joven comparti√≥ una serie de **violentos y amenazantes mensajes que recibi√≥** tras aceptar la designaci√≥n de la Municipalidad comandada por Marcelino Iglesias.
&gt; 
&gt; [Image](https://elsol-compress.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/files/16460689763868.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; ""¬°C√≥mo te da la cara de aceptar estar en la Vendimia! Sos cualquiera, a nadie represent√°s. Aguante Julieta. Ella s√≠ se gan√≥ la corona. Vos sos un estorbo"", afirma uno de esos mensajes. ""Yo no te conozco y das asco. **Te merec√©s el peor maltrato del mundo por lo que le hiciste a Julieta. Si decid√≠s seguir adelante te deseo lo peor de todo y rez√° que la gente no se vuelva loca**. Ya el 60% de los vecinos de Guaymall√©n te odia"", agreg√≥ el mismo usuario.
&gt; 
&gt; _**Ver tambi√©n: [La pol√©mica sin fin: la reina de Guaymall√©n no estuvo en el arranque de la convivencia](https://www.elsol.com.ar/mendoza/la-polemica-sin-fin-la-reina-de-guaymallen-no-estuvo-en-el-arranque-de-la-convivencia)**_
&gt; 
&gt; El tono de los mensajes es similar: con fuertes ofensas, le piden que renuncie y que **le deje su lugar a Julieta Lonigro**, la ""reina blue"" elegida en una fiesta paralela organizada por la Comisi√≥n de Reinas de Guaymall√©n (Coreguay), que no cuenta con el aval del municipio.

&gt; 
&gt; ""Ten√© un poquito de dignidad y renunci√° porque est√°s acomodada""; ""Deber√≠as renunciar a ser nuevamente reina. No seas ego√≠sta. Encima sos horrible""; ""La palabra representante y/o reina te queda gigante. **La reina del pueblo es Julieta**, vos sos la representante del intendente y toda esa porquer√≠a"". Esos fueron otros de los agravios recibidos por Grangetto, quien hizo un duro descargo en una historia de Instagram.

&gt; 
&gt; ""A vos te digo, a vos que me critic√°s, me juzg√°s sin conocerme. Que conden√°s desde el absoluto desconocimiento. No pretendo ir como reina, y mucho menos competir con alguien. Simplemente, quiero transmitir un mensaje distinto a partir de la experiencia que pas√© en el 2020. **Hay que terminar con esta violencia y cosificaci√≥n hacia la mujer, donde te exponen en una vidriera como si fueras un producto.** Soy consciente que hay que hacer un cambio cultural, sin reina. Es una nueva forma de vivir Vendimia. Hoy me encuentro parada desde otro lugar y cumpliendo otro rol, como mujer y como representante"", escribi√≥ Grangetto.
&gt; 
&gt;  _**Ver tambi√©n: [La reina que no quiere ser reina y una fuerte cr√≠tica: ""Estoy ac√° obligada""](https://www.elsol.com.ar/mendoza/la-reina-que-no-quiere-ser-reina-y-una-fuerte-critica-estoy-aca-obligada)**_
&gt; 
&gt; La representante de Guaymall√©n ya demostr√≥ su malestar con la situaci√≥n que le toca atravesar. Lo hizo este domingo, durante la Bendici√≥n de los Frutos, donde afirm√≥: **""Estoy ac√° obligada, no por voluntad propia. La Justicia nos obliga a venir"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Este lunes tambi√©n fue protagonista de otra pol√©mica, al convertirse en la √∫nica de las 18 candidatas que [se ausent√≥ sin aviso en el inicio de la convivencia de las reinas](https://www.elsol.com.ar/mendoza/la-polemica-sin-fin-la-reina-de-guaymallen-no-estuvo-en-el-arranque-de-la-convivencia)en un hotel c√©ntrico.
&gt; 
&gt; ## **Otro reclamo judicial**
&gt; 
&gt; Por otra parte, Maximiliano Legrand, abogado de Lonigro, adelant√≥ este lunes que **recurrir√° nuevamente a la Justicia para que se modifique la resoluci√≥n de la sala 2 del m√°ximo tribunal** que oblig√≥ a Guaymall√©n a participar en los festejos vendimiales con una representante, aunque dej√≥ en manos del intendente el sistema de elecci√≥n.
&gt; 
&gt; Como se sabe, Iglesias decidi√≥ que Grangetto sea esa representante. Para Legrand, esa decisi√≥n **""es ilegal porque no hay reglamento que lo determine ni algo que el pueblo quiera. Est√° claro que el pueblo quiere a Julieta Lonigro"".**

"badhistory","t5_2wo26","&gt;What is not being talked about with regard to the overall objective and amassing of troops by the U.S. (under the guise of their NATO alignment) is the paranormal/ET angle.  What I am getting is that this entire maneuver by US and Russia to create a ‚Äúwar game‚Äù and war scenario where Russia is seen as the ‚Äúinvader‚Äù is a ruse to cover the necessary actions these two super powers must take to deal with the ET race or races involved in both Ukraine and Crimea and handle the fall-out from their presence.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, we know that Crimea contains 9 pyramids along the coast as well as a particular highway running between mountain ranges along the valley where anomalous occurrences happen often.  Specifically where military vehicles and even groups of vehicles can be seen to simply disappear off the highway as if having driven into a portal into another dimension something like what is reported in the Bermuda Triangle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, in Ukraine, I was told there is a mountain which is considered by the Illuminati to be where ‚Äúthe devil lives‚Äô.  This mountain is considered a center of dark magic.  Whereas I would tend to translate this into the likely case where this particular mountain is home of a group reptilians and possibly other races aligned with them.  Which makes it a sort of ‚Äòcommand and control‚Äô center.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both situations are what one might call ‚Äúextraterrestrial‚Äù and are the real reason for the necessary amassing of troops.  In essence we have evidence of a kind of invasionary force which is alien.  And it is highly likely that the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù of Ukraine has called on Russia (and the US) for help in dealing with this incursion. There may also be a relationship between the aliens involved in Crimea area and the mountain in Ukraine.

&gt;‚Ä¶. even substantiates that the Covid experiment had achieved its objective and they got their critical mass of vaxxed worldwide..took down economies, and delivered the TRANSHUMAN INJECTION so that a critical mass of humans now are carriers‚Ä¶. The graphene oxide and spike protein delivery system‚Ä¶jumps from thing to thing person to person according to a deep black source.  And futher substantiated by Michael Crichton‚Äôs well known novel PREY.  Chances are enough people will either die of the injection or become transhuman in the coming days to give them plenty of bodies to engage in the fight.  
&gt;  
&gt;In reality, it‚Äôs completely possible that the Ukraine situation is a perfect set up for a war where the Transhuman soldiers can now be tested in a battlefield scenario, a kind of war game where those playing it are very likely already vaxxed.  And growing more transhuman by the day and so this will be war gamed in real life a further way of testing how successful their program has become. All the worlds a stage‚Ä¶and a game field and the puppet masters will likely move to the next stage in their experiment.

&gt;  **_Nos reservamos el derecho de impugnar la decisi√≥n de la FIFA y la UEFA de conformidad con el derecho deportivo internacional._**
&gt; 
&gt; ## **La reacci√≥n del Spartak**
&gt; 
&gt; _La Uni√≥n Europea de F√∫tbol (UEFA) y la FIFA han decidido excluir al Spartak de la actual Europa League._
&gt; 
&gt;  _As√≠, los partidos de octavos de final ante el Leipzig, que estaban previstos para el 10 y 17 de marzo, no se disputar√°n. El club alem√°n recibe autom√°ticamente un boleto para los cuartos de final._
&gt; 
&gt;  _El duro veredicto de la UEFA y la FIFA est√° relacionado con la posici√≥n de las organizaciones con respecto a los eventos en el territorio de Ucrania._
&gt; 
&gt;  _Adem√°s del Spartak, todos los clubes y equipos rusos est√°n excluidos de las competiciones internacionales._
&gt; 
&gt;  _**La decisi√≥n de la FIFA y la UEFA, por supuesto, nos molest√≥, aunque era de esperar.** Desgraciadamente, el esfuerzo de nuestro equipo en este sorteo de la Europa League est√° tachado por motivos lo m√°s alejados posible de lo deportivo._

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  _Spartak tiene millones de fan√°ticos no solo en Rusia, sino en todo el mundo. Nuestros √©xitos y fracasos unen a personas de decenas de pa√≠ses diferentes, e incluso en los momentos m√°s dif√≠ciles, el deporte, desde el punto de vista del club, debe construir puentes, no quemarlos._
&gt; 
&gt;  _Se tom√≥ otra decisi√≥n, con la que no estamos de acuerdo, pero estamos obligados a obedecerla._
&gt; 
&gt; _Spartak se centrar√° en la actuaci√≥n en el campeonato de rusia y la copa del pa√≠s. **Esperamos lograr la paz que todos necesitan lo antes posible.**_
&gt; 
&gt; ## **No fue lo √∫nico‚Äã**  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; M√°s all√° de las reacciones oficiales, tambi√©n vale recordar que antes de esta decisi√≥n de la FIFA, la UEFA ya hab√≠a anulado la sede de San Petersburgo para la final de la Champions: se jugar√° en Par√≠s.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Valeri, el t√©cnico de Rusia, dijo tras conocer la decisi√≥n de la FIFA: ""Esper√°bamos que la clasificaci√≥n al Mundial de Qatar 2022 se dirimiera en el campo de juego. Es una pena para los jugadores que so√±aban con esa posibilidad y ahora han perdido esa esperanza. Decir que el cuerpo t√©cnico est√° decepcionado con la decisi√≥n que tom√≥ FIFA es decir nada. Espero que las sanciones de la FIFA y la UEFA se levanten lo antes posible y que el f√∫tbol ruso regrese a la escena internacional"".

&gt; 
&gt; Del contrato original firmado entre Argentina y Rursia por unas 30 millones de vacunas contra el coronavirus, a√∫n quedan por recibir 9.020.665 de dosis de Sputnik (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic)
&gt; 
&gt; A medida que avanza la invasi√≥n de Rusia a Ucrania, **se acrecientan las sanciones y restricciones econ√≥micas** impuestas por los integrantes de la OTAN al gobierno de Vladimir Putin. El cerco econ√≥mico a las instituciones y empresas rusas se extiende, y **abre inc√≥gnitas sobre qu√© pasara con la distribuci√≥n y comercializaci√≥n de la vacuna Sputnik V. ¬øCu√°nto impactar√°n las restricciones en los insumos necesarios para la producci√≥n?**
&gt; 
&gt; En las √∫ltimas horas, el Departamento del Tesoro de los Estados Unidos **prohibi√≥ a los estadounidenses realizar transacciones con el Banco Central de la Federaci√≥n Rusa**, **el Fondo Nacional de Riqueza de la Federaci√≥n Rusa y el Ministerio de Finanzas de la Federaci√≥n Rusa**. **El presidente Joe Biden hab√≠a ordenado** la semana pasada a la secretaria del Tesoro que imponga[**sanciones de bloqueo**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/02/27/background-press-call-by-a-senior-administration-official-on-imposing-additional-severe-costs-on-russia/)**total al Fondo Ruso de Inversi√≥n Directa** (RDIF, por sus siglas en ingl√©s). Seg√∫n explic√≥ la Casa Blanca, ‚Äú√©sta es una entidad financiera de propiedad estatal que funciona como un fondo soberano de riqueza y atrae capital; su objetivo es atraer capital a la econom√≠a rusa en sectores de alto crecimiento y alta tecnolog√≠a‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Siguiendo esas instrucciones, la **Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros (OFAC, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) que depende del Departamento del Tesoro de EEUU**,**sancion√≥ al Fondo Ruso de Inversi√≥n Directa (RDIF, por sus siglas en ingl√©s), con exposici√≥n al sistema financiero de los Estados Unidos y a su director ejecutivo (CEO), Kirill Dmitriev.**
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúPutin y su c√≠rculo √≠ntimo han confiado durante mucho tiempo en **RDIF** y **Dmitriev** para recaudar fondos en el extranjero, incluso en los Estados Unidos. Al restringir a√∫n m√°s a estas personas y entidades del sistema financiero estadounidense, **Estados Unidos contin√∫a demostrando su compromiso inquebrantable de apoyar a Ucrania**, imponer costos al c√≠rculo √≠ntimo de Putin o a aquellos conectados con Putin y su elecci√≥n por la guerra, y evitar que el r√©gimen de Putin aumente su capital para financiar su invasi√≥n de Ucrania y otras prioridades‚Äù, **expres√≥ el Departamento del Tesoro norteamericano, a trav√©s de un comunicado** publicado en su portal web.
&gt; 
&gt; **Los desarrolladores de la vacuna Sputnik**
&gt; 
&gt; [Hasta el momento, la distribuci√≥n y comercializaci√≥n de la vacuna Sputnik en Argentina sigue el curso pautado (Europa Press)
&gt; ](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/ZbSGyTPltnvnKkLQfTNHrbpylQE=/420x280/filters:format(webp\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/E5XX32TWMJBHBHFGTORKFVQPNA.jpg 420w)
&gt; 
&gt; Hasta el momento, la distribuci√≥n y comercializaci√≥n de la vacuna Sputnik en Argentina sigue el curso pautado (Europa Press) 
&gt; 
&gt; Con las recientes sanciones econ√≥micas al Fondo Ruso de Inversi√≥n Directa, se abre el **interrogante** de **cu√°nto va a afectar el bloqueo a la provisi√≥n de insumos y la producci√≥n de las dosis en Rusia** y su consiguiente distribuci√≥n internacional. Tambi√©n falta determinar si estas restricciones pueden afectar la provisi√≥n del componente activo con el que la empresa nacional Laboratorios Richmond envasa la f√≥rmula en el pa√≠s. Hasta el momento, **la distribuci√≥n y comercializaci√≥n de la vacuna Sputnik en Argentina sigue el curso pautado.**
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto a las dosis que espera recibir Argentina, **del contrato original firmado con las autoridades rusas por unas 30 millones de vacunas contra el coronavirus**, a√∫n **quedan por recibir 9.020.665 de dosis de la vacuna Sputnik**. El Ministerio de Salud de Argentina estimaba recibirlas en el **primer trimestre de este a√±o**.
&gt; 
&gt; Rusia fue uno de los primeros pa√≠ses del mundo en desarrollar una vacuna contra el coronavirus al lanzar la Sputnik V en agosto del 2020 y **la f√≥rmula desarrollada por el Instituto Gamaleya se utiliza en m√°s de 70 pa√≠ses del mundo.**
&gt; 
&gt; [La Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros del Departamento del Tesoro de EEUU, sancion√≥ al Fondo Ruso de Inversi√≥n Directa con exposici√≥n al sistema financiero de los Estados Unidos y a su director ejecutivo (CEO), Kirill Dmitriev (REUTERS)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/OZ487cJ8MhTd9kZttiO3q6VnIao=/420x280/filters:format(webp\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/OCQQTXM3U3ATYELTJ3TX2NBUOE.jpg 420w)

&gt; 
&gt; **Sin embargo, hasta ahora no ha sido homologada ni por la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ni por las autoridades regulatorias de la Uni√≥n Europea**. Un situaci√≥n que provoc√≥ inconvenientes en millones de personas que se ven imposibilitados de ingresar a destinos que exigen una pauta completa de vacunaci√≥n con una f√≥rmula avalada, al menos, por una agencia sanitaria internacional.
&gt; 
&gt; **En diciembre de 2021, el director ejecutivo del RDIF, Kirill Dmitriev, adelant√≥ que la f√≥rmula rusa ser√≠a eficaz contra la variante √ìmicron y que se encontraba en ‚Äúbuenas negociaciones‚Äù con la OMS.** [Dmitriev, habl√≥ con Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/ciencia-america/2021/12/06/la-aprobacion-de-la-oms-llegara-en-breve-dijo-a-infobae-el-desarrollador-de-la-vacuna-sputnik/) en diciembre, sobre los alcances del desarrollo ruso frente a las nuevas variantes y sobre la inminente autorizaci√≥n por parte de la OMS y dijo: ‚ÄúNuestro Ministerio de Salud est√° trabajando muy de cerca de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud (OMS)‚Ä≥.
&gt; 
&gt; Sin embargo, la invasi√≥n a Ucrania cambi√≥ por completo el tablero mundial, y ahora quedar√° por ver c√≥mo impactan las sanciones econ√≥micas a los desarrolladores de la vacuna y a la posible autorizaci√≥n de Sputnik por parte de la OMS.

Incidentally that's another thing about scaling in Vampire.

Similarly a character who has spent 100XP might have put it all into disciplines to make them an unstoppable mincing machine, or put it all into skills that come up once every couple of games.

&gt;   Los 5 lugares m√°s afectados por el cambio clim√°tico 0:56 
&gt; 
&gt; **(CNN) --** El cambio clim√°tico va en camino a [transformar la vida en la Tierra tal como la conocemos](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/09/17/planeta-encuentra-trayectoria-catastrofica-calentamiento-global-informe-naciones-unidas-trax/) y, a menos que [se frene dr√°sticamente el calentamiento global](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/08/09/reporte-ipcc-cambio-climatico-calentamiento-global-trax/), miles de millones de personas y otras especies llegar√°n a puntos en los que ya no podr√°n [adaptarse a la nueva normalidad](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/11/04/el-mundo-no-se-adapta-lo-suficientemente-rapido-a-la-crisis-climatica-segun-informe-de-la-onu/), seg√∫n un importante informe publicado este lunes.
&gt; 
&gt; El informe, respaldado por la Organizaci√≥n de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) y basado en a√±os de investigaci√≥n de cientos de cient√≠ficos, concluye que los impactos del cambio clim√°tico provocado por el hombre son mayores de lo que se pensaba. Los autores del informe dicen que estos impactos est√°n ocurriendo mucho m√°s r√°pido y son m√°s perturbadores y generalizados de lo que los cient√≠ficos esperaban hace 20 a√±os.
&gt; 
&gt; Los autores se√±alan la existencia de enormes desigualdades en la crisis clim√°tica, al constatar que los que menos contribuyen al problema [son los m√°s afectados](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/12/07/sudan-sur-sequia-inundaciones-trax/), y advierten de impactos irreversibles si el mundo supera los 1,5 grados cent√≠grados de calentamiento global.
&gt; 
&gt; El secretario general de la ONU, Ant√≥nio Guterres, calific√≥ el informe como ""un atlas del sufrimiento humano y una acusaci√≥n condenatoria del fracaso del liderazgo clim√°tico"", y advirti√≥ que ""demorarse significa morir"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""Los hechos son innegables. Esta abdicaci√≥n de liderazgo es criminal"", dijo Guterres en un comunicado. ""Los mayores contaminadores del mundo son culpables de incendiar nuestro √∫nico hogar"".

&gt; 
&gt; Tambi√©n dijo que los ""acontecimientos actuales"" mostraban que el mundo depend√≠a demasiado de los combustibles f√≥siles, calific√°ndolos de ""callej√≥n sin salida"", en una aparente referencia al conflicto de Ucrania y a la crisis energ√©tica.
&gt; 
&gt; Estos son los puntos clave del informe:
&gt; 
&gt; ## Un calentamiento superior a 1,5 grados podr√≠a traer consecuencias irreversibles
&gt; 
&gt; [[Cambio clim√°tico](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132643-02-ipcc-report-climate-restricted-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info&amp;w=1024)](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132643-02-ipcc-report-climate-restricted-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info)
&gt; 
&gt; Blanqueamiento de los arrecifes de coral alrededor de la Polinesia Francesa en 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Los cient√≠ficos llevan d√©cadas advirtiendo que el calentamiento debe mantenerse por [debajo de 1,5 grados cent√≠grados](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/08/09/reporte-ipcc-cambio-climatico-calentamiento-global-trax/) respecto a los niveles preindustriales.
&gt; 
&gt; El informe de este lunes, elaborado por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Clim√°tico (IPCC) de la ONU, muestra que si se sobrepasa ese l√≠mite algunos cambios ser√°n irreversibles durante cientos, si no miles, de a√±os. Y algunos cambios pueden ser permanentes, incluso si el planeta vuelve a enfriarse.
&gt; 
&gt; Seg√∫n las estimaciones del IPCC, consideradas conservadoras, el mundo es ya 1,1 grados cent√≠grados m√°s c√°lido que antes de la industrializaci√≥n. Ahora nos dirigimos r√°pidamente hacia los 1,5 grados.
&gt; 
&gt; Seg√∫n el informe, con cada acontecimiento extremo, los ecosistemas se ven m√°s empujados hacia los llamados puntos de inflexi√≥n, m√°s all√° de los cuales pueden producirse [cambios irreversibles](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/10/14/la-gran-barrera-de-coral-ha-perdido-la-mitad-de-sus-corales-en-3-decadas/).
&gt; 
&gt; Con un calentamiento de 2 grados, por ejemplo, hasta el 18% de las especies terrestres estar√°n en alto riesgo de extinci√≥n, seg√∫n el informe. Con 4 grados, el 50% de las especies estar√°n amenazadas.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Con 1,5 grados ya hay muchos retos para varios sistemas que conocemos"", dijo Hans-Otto P√∂rtner, codirector del informe y cient√≠fico del Centro Helmholtz de Investigaci√≥n Polar y Marina del Instituto Alfred Wegener.
&gt; 
&gt; ""En el caso de los arrecifes de coral, debemos decir que en muchos lugares ya est√°n m√°s all√° de los puntos de inflexi√≥n. Est√°n en declive"".
&gt; 
&gt; [[Cambio clim√°tico](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132641-01-ipcc-report-climate-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info&amp;w=1024)](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132641-01-ipcc-report-climate-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info)

&gt; Un hombre trabaja en los Alpes suizos en el glaciar del R√≥dano en octubre de 2021, que est√° parcialmente cubierto de espuma aislante para evitar que se derrita debido al calentamiento global.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Los ecosistemas altamente vulnerables del [√Årtico](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/groenlandia-hielo-derritiendo-aumento-nivel-mar-pkg-nuestro-mundo-cnn/), las [monta√±as](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/02/03/everest-hielo-perdida-trax/) y las [costas](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/17/us/filipino-american-history-louisiana-climate/index.html) son los que corren mayor riesgo de sufrir estos cambios, dicen los autores. El derretimiento de las capas de hielo y de los glaciares provocar√° un aumento acelerado del nivel del mar, irreversible durante siglos.
&gt; 
&gt; Los [bosques](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/selva-amazonica-alerta-ambiental-co2-carbono-cambio-climatico-alejandra-oraa-cafe-cnn/), las [turberas](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/22/europe/grasslands-carbon-storage-climate-cop26-intl/index.html) y el [permafrost](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/curiosidades-crater-tundra-siberiana-gas-metano-cientificos-cnn-redaccion-buenos-aires/) -lugares donde se almacenan naturalmente los gases de efecto invernadero- corren el riesgo de verse empujados a una situaci√≥n en la que emitan esos gases a la atm√≥sfera, provocando un calentamiento a√∫n mayor.
&gt; 
&gt; Revelan c√≥mo las aves se adaptan al cambio clim√°tico 0:52## Nos estamos quedando sin formas de adaptarnos
&gt; 
&gt; La ""adaptaci√≥n"" consiste en encontrar formas de vivir con el cambio, como levantar muros para evitar la [subida del nivel del mar](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/01/18/futuro-bajo-agua-aumento-nivel-mar-ciudades-mundo-trax/) o aplicar nuevos c√≥digos de construcci√≥n para garantizar que las viviendas puedan soportar un [clima m√°s extremo](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/12/13/ccrisis-climatica-afectando-tornados-estados-unidos-trax/).
&gt; 
&gt; Los cient√≠ficos se√±alan que algunas de nuestras adaptaciones han atenuado el impacto de la crisis clim√°tica hasta ahora, pero no son adecuadas a largo plazo. Nuestras opciones de adaptaci√≥n ser√°n a√∫n m√°s limitadas si alcanzamos 1,5 grados.
&gt; 
&gt; [[Cambio clim√°tico](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132645-03-ipcc-report-climate-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info&amp;w=1024)](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220227132645-03-ipcc-report-climate-super-169.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=info)

&gt; Un muro de defensa contra inundaciones en construcci√≥n en el lado este de Manhattan, en la ciudad de Nueva York, el 11 de diciembre de 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Y aunque el mundo natural se ha adaptado a los cambios clim√°ticos a lo largo de millones de a√±os, el ritmo del calentamiento global provocado por el ser humano est√° llevando a muchos de los sistemas m√°s cr√≠ticos del planeta -como las selvas tropicales, los arrecifes de coral y el √Årtico- al l√≠mite. Un clima m√°s extremo no solo afecta a los seres humanos, sino que est√° [provocando la muerte masiva](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/02/11/algunas-colonias-de-pinguinos-en-la-antartida-han-disminuido-mas-del-75-en-50-anos/) de plantas y animales.
&gt; 
&gt; El crecimiento de la poblaci√≥n y el desarrollo, que no se ha llevado a cabo teniendo en cuenta la adaptaci√≥n a largo plazo, tambi√©n est√°n atrayendo a las personas hacia el peligro. Hasta 3.600 millones de personas viven en lugares que ya son muy vulnerables a los riesgos clim√°ticos, algunos de los cuales aumentar√°n m√°s all√° de la capacidad de adaptaci√≥n una vez que el planeta alcance la marca de 1,5 grados.

El agua ser√° a√∫n m√°s escasa con temperaturas globales m√°s altas.
&gt; 
&gt; Con 2 grados de calentamiento -que los cient√≠ficos prev√©n que el planeta alcanzar√° a mediados de siglo-, hasta 3.000 millones de personas en todo el mundo sufrir√°n ""escasez cr√≥nica de agua"", de acuerdo con el informe. Esta cifra aumenta a 4.000 millones de personas con 4 grados.
&gt; 
&gt; La escasez de agua ejercer√° una enorme presi√≥n sobre la producci√≥n de alimentos y aumentar√° los ya graves problemas de seguridad alimentaria del mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; En el oeste de Estados Unidos [ya se est√° gestando una crisis del agua](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2021/08/us/colorado-river-water-shortage/).

El lago Mead, el mayor embalse del pa√≠s, cay√≥ a m√≠nimos hist√≥ricos en los √∫ltimos meses, amenazando el suministro de agua para decenas de millones de personas.

[Vastas franjas de √Åfrica](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/14/africa/climate-change-southern-africa-intl/index.html) tambi√©n han sufrido en los √∫ltimos a√±os una prolongada sequ√≠a.
&gt; 
&gt; El informe se centra en la interconexi√≥n entre los ecosistemas de la Tierra y los seres humanos, incluyendo c√≥mo la crisis clim√°tica est√° alterando los recursos h√≠dricos.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Lo que realmente quer√≠amos mostrar es que los ecosistemas y todos los sectores de la sociedad humana y el bienestar humano dependen fundamentalmente del agua"", dijo a CNN Tabea Lissner, cient√≠fica de Climate Analytics y una de las autoras del informe. ""Y no es solo el recurso h√≠drico en s√≠ lo que desempe√±a un papel importante en la seguridad del agua, sino tambi√©n de qu√© forma y en qu√© calidad podemos acceder a ella, y mostrando realmente la cantidad de formas diferentes en que el cambio clim√°tico afecta realmente a los seres humanos y a los ecosistemas a trav√©s de diversos canales"".

&gt; Los pa√≠ses que menos gases de efecto invernadero emiten, principalmente los del [Sur Global](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/10/11/punto-ciego-cambio-climatico-trax/) y los territorios insulares, suelen ser los m√°s perjudicados por los riesgos clim√°ticos, seg√∫n el informe.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Vivimos en un mundo desigual"", dijo a CNN Eric Chu, uno de los autores del informe y cient√≠fico de la Universidad de California en Davis. ""Las p√©rdidas se distribuyen de forma poco equitativa entre las comunidades, especialmente las que hist√≥ricamente han estado en desventaja en la toma de decisiones, y ahora estamos viendo que parte de esa desigualdad se manifiesta tambi√©n en las opciones que tomamos para adaptarnos"".
&gt; 
&gt; Camille Parmesan, ecologista de la Estaci√≥n de Ecolog√≠a del CNRS y una de las autoras del informe, dijo que, a medida que el cambio clim√°tico empeore, [m√°s ind√≠genas perder√°n la tierra](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/12/24/amazonas-mujeres-indigenas-trax/), el agua y la biodiversidad de la que dependen.

&gt; ""Cada vez hay m√°s pruebas de que muchas comunidades ind√≠genas que dependen mucho m√°s de los sistemas naturales para su alimentaci√≥n y su sustento no solo son las m√°s expuestas, porque esos sistemas naturales est√°n sufriendo un fuerte impacto, sino que son las m√°s vulnerables porque a menudo est√°n en zonas con mucha pobreza o poco acceso a la atenci√≥n sanitaria"", dijo Parmesan.
&gt; 
&gt; A medida que avance la crisis clim√°tica, m√°s personas se ver√°n obligadas a desplazarse, lo que a√±adir√° tensi√≥n y vulnerabilidad a otras regiones.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Cuando la Tierra no sea cultivable, la dependencia en los medios de vida que tienen las comunidades de la agricultura y la producci√≥n de alimentos, no solo se perder√°n los ingresos, sino que se perder√° esa seguridad alimentaria"", dijo Vivek Shandas, profesor de adaptaci√≥n al clima y pol√≠tica urbana en la Universidad Estatal de Portland, quien no particip√≥ en el informe. ""Se perder√° esa capacidad de sobrevivir cada d√≠a. Como humanos, a lo largo de la historia, nos hemos desplazado de lugares menos habitables a lugares m√°s asequibles y habitables"".

Telling Mark to bring his volume way down and speak softly when most of the time she is so loud and aggressive.

Despising the eyeball roll and facial theatrics which she did with Alyssa.

Talking about keeping it classy but refers to sex acts, reveals sensitive stuff about Mark, makes a fool of herself on the plane or any social setting.

&gt; 
&gt; Turqu√≠a vet√≥ el acceso al **B√≥sforo** y al estrecho de los **Dardanelos** a todas las naves militares, inform√≥ el lunes el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores, **Mevlut Cavusoglu**.
&gt; 
&gt; **‚ÄúHemos advertido a los pa√≠ses ribere√±os o no, que no permitan el paso de buques de guerra por el mar Negro.** Estamos aplicando las disposiciones de la Convenci√≥n de Montreux‚Äù, que conf√≠a a Ankara la gesti√≥n del acceso a estas dos v√≠as mar√≠timas desde 1936, dijo el ministro.
&gt; 
&gt; El presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, precis√≥ justo antes la posici√≥n de Turqu√≠a, miembro de la OTAN: **‚ÄúNo abandonar ni a Rusia ni a Ucrania‚Äù, y tampoco ‚Äúceder sobre los intereses nacionales‚Äù de Turqu√≠a.**

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú**Hemos decidido usar la Convenci√≥n de Montreux para impedir una escalada de la crisis**‚Äù, justific√≥ el jefe de Estado turco tras la reuni√≥n de su gabinete.
&gt; 
&gt; El primer d√≠a del conflicto, Ucrania hab√≠a pedido a Turqu√≠a, su aliado, **que impidiera el acceso de nav√≠os rusos. Ankara rechaz√≥ hacerlo en su momento.**
&gt; 
&gt; La Convenci√≥n de Montreux garantiza la libre circulaci√≥n en esas dos v√≠as, **pero en el art√≠culo 19 estipula que Turqu√≠a puede bloquear a los buques de guerra en caso de que haya un conflicto**, y sobre todo si la propia Turqu√≠a se considera amenazada, salvo que estos buques tengan que regresar a su puerto-base.

&gt; 
&gt; El texto se aplica no solo a los beligerantes, **sino a todo el mundo, record√≥ el ministro.**
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú**Rusia nos pregunt√≥ si aplicar√≠amos el Convenio de Montreux en caso de necesidad: les dijimos que lo aplicar√≠amos palabra por palabra**‚Äù, a√±adi√≥.
&gt; 
&gt; Turqu√≠a ha condenado varias veces la invasi√≥n ‚Äú**inaceptable**‚Äù de Ucrania. Por un lado, ha vendido **drones** de combate a Ucrania, su aliado, y por otro, **depende de Rusia para el suministro de gas y cereales.**
&gt; 
&gt; Ayer, Turqu√≠a reconoci√≥ oficialmente **‚Äúel estado de guerra‚Äù** entre Rusia y Ucrania, lo cual la autoriza, en virtud de la Convenci√≥n de Montreux de 1936, **a limitar el acceso de ambos beligerantes a los estrechos del B√≥sforo y de los Dardanelos, entrada al mar Negro.**
&gt; 
&gt; Turqu√≠a controla el acceso al Mar Negro en virtud de la Convenci√≥n (tratado) de Montreux, rubricado en 1936, que **garantiza la libre circulaci√≥n de los barcos mercantes en tiempos de paz y le otorga el derecho de bloquear a los buques de guerra en caso de que haya un conflicto, y sobre todo si la propia Turqu√≠a se considera amenazada, salvo que estos buques tengan que regresar a su puerto-base.**
&gt; 
&gt; Al menos seis buques y un submarino de la Armada rusa han navegado por (los estrechos de) el B√≥sforo y los Dardanelos **durante las √∫ltimas dos semanas**, regresando desde el Mediterr√°neo.

I also like the idea of seeing more Lakon vessels in the black, so it'd be cool if system authority in Alliance space used Lakon ships. Sure the Type-10 can't really compete with a Corvette or even really a Cutter, but on the other hand a squad of Chieftains, Challengers, and Crusaders sounds terrifying!",1646092842

&gt; # [La batalla judicial de la reina ‚Äúblue‚Äù: en Mendoza, interpondr√°n un amparo para que participe de la Vendimia](https://resizer.glanacion.com/resizer/BQOOb84lZvmgc5y5G9BraScMrPs=/768x0/filters:format(webp\):quality(80\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/lanacionar/KZZSP7GV4REXPDR26JM6SXHPQ4.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; MENDOZA.- Fue un duro rev√©s para [Julieta Lonigro, la reina ‚Äúblue‚Äù de la Vendimia de Guaymall√©n](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/mendoza-insolita-el-debate-por-la-prohibicion-de-un-concurso-de-belleza-llego-a-la-corte-provincial-nid14022022/ ""Julieta Lonigro, la reina ‚Äúblue‚Äù de la Vendimia de Guaymall√©n""), el departamento m√°s poblado del distrito. A pesar de que la Corte provincial habilit√≥ d√≠as atr√°s la participaci√≥n de la joven en la fiesta nacional, al dejar sin efecto una ordenanza municipal que prohib√≠a el ‚Äúconcurso de belleza‚Äù, la comuna decidi√≥ oficializar a la soberana que hab√≠a sido elegida en 2020, Sof√≠a Grangetto, lo que complica las chances de Lonigro para competir por la corona en la ceremonia, que se realizar√° el s√°bado pr√≥ximo en el teatro griego Frank Romero Day. Sin embargo, aunque le queda muy poco tiempo, la joven, que fue designada por los vecinos en una fiesta departamental ‚Äúparalela‚Äù, no desiste en sus aspiraciones y sus abogados **ya preparan una nueva presentaci√≥n judicial para demostrar que la soberana de 2020, seg√∫n el reglamento provincial, no puede participar dos veces de la contienda.**
&gt; 
&gt; La decisi√≥n de la municipalidad, comandada por el radical Marcelino Iglesias, va a tono con la propuesta realizada por el gobernador Rodolfo Suarez, uno de los principales mandatarios de Juntos por el Cambio. Ambos, a ra√≠z del fallo del m√°ximo tribunal, consideraron que **la representante del departamento tiene que ser Grangetto, lo que gener√≥ sorpresa y malestar entre los vecinos que eligieron a Lonigro**, algo que se evidenci√≥ con fuerza en las redes sociales.
&gt; 
&gt; Mendoza ya empez√≥ con el calendario oficial de Vendimia. El domingo pasado se realiz√≥ la tradicional **Bendici√≥n de los Frutos**, con la participaci√≥n de las m√°ximas autoridades provinciales y las candidatas al reinado nacional, entre las que estuvo la soberana de Guaymall√©n de 2020, que, sorpresivamente y sin los atuendos caracter√≠sticos, afirm√≥ que estaba en ese lugar por ‚Äúobligaci√≥n‚Äù. Esto gener√≥ mayor malestar en Lonigro, que se considera la **‚Äúreina del pueblo de Guaymall√©n‚Äù.**
&gt; 
&gt; Grangetto fue contundente con sus declaraciones, aunque no desisti√≥ de participar de las actividades oficiales para abrirle camino a Lonigro. ‚ÄúEstoy ac√° obligada, no por voluntad propia. La Justicia nos obliga a venir. ¬°Basta de Reinas! Tengo otra postura. ¬øPor qu√© se pone a las reinas como si fuesen un producto? Podemos representar a nuestro departamento desde otro lugar. No vengo como reina, vengo como representante del departamento. No vengo a competir, no vengo a sacarle el sitio a nadie‚Äù, indic√≥.
&gt; 
&gt; En tanto, **Lonigro no baja los brazos, aunque sabe que se agotan los tiempos**. Sus representantes legales insistir√°n esta semana en la Justicia provincial con una nueva presentaci√≥n, con el aval de la Comisi√≥n de Reinas de Guaymall√©n (Coreguay), unas de las principales impulsoras de la elecci√≥n de Julieta. De hecho, la asociaci√≥n fue reconocida por la Corte d√≠as atr√°s, que solicit√≥ al municipio, no solo dejar sin efecto la ordenanza, sino disponer de una representante vendimial para la contienda final; caso contrario deb√≠a definir el Ministerio de Cultura y Turismo.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúSe ingresar√° un recurso de amparo por no respetar el reglamento provincial. Si bien celebramos la suspensi√≥n de la ordenanza y que haya una representaci√≥n oficial con Sof√≠a Grangetto, la gente reclama por Julieta‚Äù, cont√≥ a este medio Mar√≠a Luz Fern√°ndez, presidenta de Coreguay. ‚ÄúBuscaremos ahora ante la Corte que se declare la nulidad de la resoluci√≥n de Guaymall√©n que designa a la reina de 2020, en virtud de contradecir el reglamento provincial, que es una ley de mayor jerarqu√≠a‚Äù, sum√≥ Maximiliano Legrand, abogado de Lonigro.
&gt; 
&gt; En tanto, desde el m√°ximo tribunal indicaron a **LA NACION** que es v√°lido el planteo de las soberanas, acerca del incumplimiento del reglamento, aunque entienden que la decisi√≥n final est√° en manos del Ministerio de Cultura y Turismo, que dif√≠cilmente se expida en los pr√≥ximos d√≠as.
&gt; 
&gt; De acuerdo al reglamento dictado bajo la Ley 8740, en su art√≠culo 2 establece: ‚ÄúDe las reinas departamentales se deber√° elegir la reina y virreina nacional, merituando si la candidata re√∫ne suficientes cualidades que respeten el concepto esbozado en el art√≠culo 1¬∞ y los par√°metros que hagan a la patrimonialidad, tradici√≥n, usos y costumbres en la manera de elegir a las reinas vendimiales, contextualizada en los est√°ndares sociales, tur√≠sticos y culturales de la provincia de Mendoza, no podr√°n presentarse nuevamente las reinas departamentales que ya han sido electas‚Äù.

&gt; 
&gt; En Europa, se√±alan que la falta de liderazgo pol√≠tico y el escaso sentido de la urgencia son algunos de los obst√°culos que hay que superar.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero se trata de obst√°culos que pueden superarse, y los autores afirman que todav√≠a hay una ventana de oportunidad para aplicar medidas significativas, aunque se est√° cerrando r√°pidamente.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Hay oportunidades para adaptarse de aqu√≠ a 1,5 [grados]"", adem√°s de reducir dr√°sticamente las emisiones de combustibles f√≥siles que atrapan el calor, dijo Chu. ""Pero a medida que vamos m√°s all√° de 1,5, el espacio de oportunidades se vuelve mucho m√°s restringido y reduce la eficacia"".

&gt; Lissner dijo que el informe es ""un llamado urgente a la acci√≥n"" para que los l√≠deres mundiales avancen hacia un desarrollo resistente al clima: reducir las emisiones lo m√°s posible y al mismo tiempo invertir en la adaptaci√≥n para hacer frente a los cambios que ya vemos.
&gt; 
&gt; Los responsables de la toma de decisiones tambi√©n deben ser intencionados a la hora de ayudar a las comunidades y pa√≠ses m√°s desfavorecidos, para que nadie se quede atr√°s en el proceso.

Yeah, the conflict was largely instigated by NATO. However, Russia is an imperialist nation that is undertaking the invasion for imperialist ends that benefit the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs also spurred on by anti-Communist sentiment by Putin, being predicated on the rejection of self-determination. He explicitly said Lenin was wrong in one of his justification speeches.

Yes, the duty of American and generally Western communists is to oppose NATO. It is also to call for peace and oppose imperialism internationally.

I'm happy to accept that both the US and Ukraine are 'liberal democracies', in the materialist sense. That is, they have similar modes of production, characteristic systems of free markets and corporate capture of institutions. They occupy similar positions in the web of global finance. I won't go into too much detail here, but I hope you understand in some sense what I mean.

Are you using the phrase in a different sense? Or do you think that this particular mode of production imbues a country with moral virtue?

Because I read your comment as using 'liberal democracy' as a sort of mark of virtue, saying that the invasion of Ukraine is \*particularly\* bad because it is a  'good' country, one that respects human rights: a thriving liberal democracy. Please correct me if I have missed the mark.

The intent of my first comment was to inform you of the crimes of the Ukrainian state. Perhaps I could amend my statement to

&gt; How many disappeared in this cartel &amp;quot;Extermination site&amp;quot; on the outskirts of Nuevo Laredo, miles from the U.S. border? After six months of work, forensic technicians still don&amp;#039;t dare offer an estimate.

&gt; Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called &amp;quot;The dungeon,&amp;quot; in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel.

&gt; According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 &amp;quot;Extermination sites&amp;quot; have been found.

Like when my dad bought a boat instead of buying a boat he borrowed the money from the bank, and now he just carries a debt to the bank on the balance sheet against his portfolio and pays them a handful of dollars maintenance a year. 

Even when Elon sold last year he ended up with more shares due to how those options vesting sales worked. If one of these guys wants to sell they don't dilute themselves. They split the stock then the company buys back stock then they sell. 

Like its always better to take the loan the sell the stock because borrowing money when you're that rich is FREE. Banks give it to you for rates that are like 1/4 what you're probably paying for a mortgage. I think the rate on my dad's boat loan is 0.6% if I'm recalling correctly.",1646092844

I didn‚Äôt transition when I was young because, well, I didn‚Äôt really know it was an option, then I tried to make do with being gnc, and then I got buried in some life crisis and physical health stuff for ten years.

&gt; How many disappeared in this cartel &amp;quot;Extermination site&amp;quot; on the outskirts of Nuevo Laredo, miles from the U.S. border? After six months of work, forensic technicians still don&amp;#039;t dare offer an estimate.

&gt; Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called &amp;quot;The dungeon,&amp;quot; in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel.

&gt; According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 &amp;quot;Extermination sites&amp;quot; have been found.

"RimWorld","t5_2yjxo","You should only cut one of his hands off under a very specific condition :

Locked 1x1 wooden room.

Put him and his removed hand in the middle of the room.

That way he'll have to use his hand to set fire to his hand, which will then lead to the room burning and his other hand also burning.

If the first attempt doesn't re-educate his pyromania away then repeat the process until you're either missing the pyromania trait, the hands, or the colonist.

That, or straight up just get the Evolved Organs mod and the Questionable Ethics Enhanced mod, pull his hands off, burn them in front of him, grow him new hands and attach those onto him just to take them off him again and burn them again, if the trauma doesn't turn him catatonic then give him more arms and more hands on those arms and then keep cutting them off and burning them.

It's all about the first rule of parenting : Positively reinforce good behaviour and negatively reinforce bad behaviour.

If he researches a tech he gets a hand back, if he sets fire to 150k units of stored and stacked chemfuel then he gets to start back at 0 hands again.",1646092847

He often would say in the primary that it might even make him less appealing, within a Democratic primary. It comes up a lot in Trust where he talks about more appropriate revenue structures to sustain good government and examples in other countries.

In terms of deficit reduction, what we had planned to do -- and what Joe Manchin was prepared to do -- was to reverse some of the extreme Trump tax cuts on corporations to pay for every dime of what was planned. In other words, it's on the revenue side that the changes would be made, not the spending side, and that's what Biden ran on. But Sinema would not accept it.

but i mainly have issues with many spells being weaker/slighty stronger versions of themselves for an astronomical fp cost.

Firstly, move armies apart and get boats back to port so they can both sit in low maintenance safely. Check your crownland, the tax reduction it likely doing some damage but if you have autonomy ticking up you will be getting weaker and weaker. Make this a priority to resolve (seize crownland asap and do it whenever you can). If you are able to get the 1% loans from the burghers to pay off your normal loans (interest payments will be much lower). Spend papal influence on the tax one and interest one if you can. Get stability to +1 so you can start the tick up of prosperity. Look through your states and see if there are any that you can turn off. Keep your advisors cause as long as you can afford them they should always be a priority (not going to help your economy but just probably a good idea). Lastly, often with trade you will want to only be collecting from one node where you have the highest trade power, is the furthest downstream and has the most total money in the node. If you don‚Äôt have much power in the English Channel yet you could move that merchant to another place (like Bordeaux) to keep funnelling into Champagne which may become more valuable. Also collecting from multiple nodes gives you penalties to trade power (not sure if this still affects your home node though).",1646092848

Now this really should be obvious but: when your country is being invaded by Russia, or arguably if it is likely to be invaded by Russia, then its a good idea to get guns. 

Is the USA likely to be invaded by Russia? Is there in fact the remotest likelihood of the US being invaded by anyone? No. 

So there is little reason for random Americans to have or need guns, if that‚Äôs what you are arguing for.

"cryptocurrencymemes","t5_3psfm","&gt;Okay, what are more examples of the enforceability you‚Äôre referring to outside of law? I didn‚Äôt see you accepting any other examples.

you tried to claim that acting according to your own beliefs is enforceability. lol, no. you can't enforce something on yourself. examples outside of laws include adverse actions by licensing boards, ostracizing from social groups, and gaining compliance through internal stress from non-compliance

&gt;Are you referring to enforceability where you actually force people to behave a certain way? 

depends on how you define force 

&gt;If not, why is practicing/enforcing your own moral principles such as ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs wrong to cheat on partners, therefore I will not.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs wrong to treat animals as commodities, therefore I will not buy animal products.‚Äù and those ideas spreading into communities not valid examples of enforceability?

because that's not enforcement. see above.

&gt;Never said this. Anti-vegan fallacy. 

yes you did. it's cute you're trying to parrot with ""anti-vegan fallacy"" but a vegan fallacy is a strawman fallacy. an easy example is where you falsely claimed I stated only legally and built an entire argument around it. I noticed how you have nothing to respond with about that btw. what's an anti-vegan fallacy?

&gt;Example 1: Having a moral belief and wanting to influence a change in society

&gt;Example 2: Having a moral belief and wanting to influence a change in society 

&gt;You: False equivalence. 

&gt;Yeah, you‚Äôre being moronic. 

really? I'm moronic? because by your logic you just admitted it would be accurate to compare you to Hitler. since example 3: having a moral belief and wanting to influence a chance in society. 

pretty fucking stupid isn't it?

&gt;Okay and? 

&gt;That‚Äôs like arguing which athlete is better, but you blankly stating ‚Äúwell, this athlete‚Äôs shoes are better.‚Äù

vegan fallacy. it's like pointing out one has won competitions and the other has not.

&gt;That means nothing on its own. Do the shoes make the athlete better or what? Repeating ‚ÄúHe HaVe BeTeR ShOes‚Äù on its own doesn‚Äôt actually contribute to the argument. 

vegan fallacy. see above.

&gt;Does having enforceability and influence change what we should believe in? 

it changes what you will believe. please tell me how you are going to make an argument of what we ""should"" believe in without treating morality as objective or an absolute?

&gt;No, you didn‚Äôt answer. I asked whether stomping on puppies in a vacuum [disregarding effects on society] is immoral. You never answered that. You copped out by answering with ‚Äúit‚Äôs immoral because it negatively affects society!‚Äù when my question is ‚Äúis it immoral because it negatively affects the dog?‚Äù

yes I did. see where I already addressed this question. I specifically did answer whether it was moral or not dud to how it impacts the dog. I believe more than once. 

you're just continuously lying now :) 

&gt;Seem‚Äôs you‚Äôre having trouble admitting you think the action in of itself of stomping pups isn‚Äôt morally wrong. Never fails to just allow fanatical anti-vegans to keep talking until they inadvertently promote veganism by offering their own alternate views. 

vegan fallacy. again I already addressed this.

it's funny you call me fanatical when you treat your views like they are absolute moral truth. 

&gt;Or is it just that you don‚Äôt want to admit you hold moral consideration for an animal thus invalidating your arguments?

already addressed this. you can scroll up and see it.

&gt;Do you want me to flip the coin on your behalf?

again already addressed it. you don't have a gotcha. just further proof that you fail at basic reading comprehension. 

what you can do is quote what I have already said on this.

btw are you arguing that dogs have inherent moral worth? think about this before you answer.",1646092850

"GenshinImpact","t5_12p40m","There are event specific 5* characters and standard banner 5* characters. Event specific 5 stars can only be obtained during their events, and they have an increased chance of getting them if you wish on that banner. 

In Genshin, the 50/50 system is that when you pull on an event banner, you have a 50% chance of getting the uprated 5* character and a 50% chance of getting a standard banner 5* character. Since you lost 50/50, on the next event banner when you pull a 5 star character, it is guaranteed to be the updated 5* character. This is called hard pity. 

Pity accumulates after you pull a 5* item, whether it be a weapon or character. At 90 wishes, if you haven‚Äôt yet received a 5* item, you are guaranteed one. 

The standard banner 5* characters have been listed in other comments: Diluc, Mona, Qiqi, Keqing

The characters you can pull are never hidden from you. Also, since 4 star characters need more investment, it‚Äôs great to get multiple constellations. For instance, I continually pulled on the zhongli banner and got an additional 3 Xingqiu constellations. However, I also would have liked getting Zhongli as well.

If you don‚Äôt want the 5* but do want the 4*, it is much less worth it (especially since you lost 50/50, so you would get Yae Miko guaranteed if you hit pity/ got a 5*)",1646092850

"interestingasfuck","t5_2qhsa","That's a lie perpetuated by the Ukranian government.

This independence sentiment predates the conflict and has its roots in post Soviet politics, in 2001 (iirc) over 50% of Russian-Ukranians had already voted for independence from Ukraine, this would only increase with Ukraines distancing &amp; would come to a head in the wake of the revolution in 2014.

This same scenario has played out in various post Soviet ""frozen conflict zones"".

There are varies reasons why foreign fighters came onto the scene, some had family ties or saw it as a duty for ethnic Russians &amp; volunteered, others were mercenaries hired by armed groups within Donbas, others were proxies for Russia, who the separatists generally lean in favor towards.


The Russians were doing exactly what the Ukrianian government was trying to do, exert their influence onto the area for their political ends.

I dont lay the blame entirely on Ukranians denying recognition, it should just be noted that negotiations failed because this chip wasn't even allowed on the table by them. Not even to recognize and form a coalition within the Ukrainian government.

Things are further complicated because Russia tinges the demands so that their government will benefit on the outcome.",1646092851

Post submitted by **\/u/Chase-a-bear** to **\/r/wallstreetbets**

They will probably try really hard to minimize civilian casualties as it would tarnish the ""one people"" narrative. But if these happen they will blame it on ""separatists"" and ""Nato operatives"" as necessary costs of defending mother Russia from ""NATO aggression"".

NATO will just stand on the side and nervously smoke a blunt or in case of the US a free crack pipe. 

Position: NQ shorts üåàüêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è

\******including anyone from key figures in Ukrainian military and government to lowly button pushers on his payroll, Putin already controls Ukraine*

One example is the book calls upon dividing US from Europe using domestic issues regarding race in the US (sound familiar) and then chumming up to Germany and basically dividing eastern Europe (this is the step we are at). But instead, Putin failed we voted out his agent Trump, Germany had no interest in budding with Russia beyond Nordstream (which is now cancelled).

If you put a simple happy guy in front of a home or something really standard, your CTR will likely be below 0.5% (Which is not good). A bad CTR lets the algorithm think your ad is irrelevant to your targeted audience which translates into drastically higher CPM. You'd be burning shit tons of money in ineffective ad spend. In contrast, an image like the one above would be more likely to grab your attention (CTR 5%+) and get you a better ROAS. Marketing is my business, not my hobby. That's why I take it seriously and validate assumptions with my target market before spending money. I was looking for feedback, not get insulted.

But I'd be lying if I said they all got the highest level of care all the time. It's not easy to admit that you're not capable of taking care of something, so you've already taken that step.

Giving your animals up doesn't mean you don't love them. If this is a problem that you see continuing for a while (cause let's be real, getting your life on track is a pain sometimes), it might be better to rehome them. It hurts to take that responsibility, and it might seem counterintuitive, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong.

There are lots of ways to rehome animals, whether through friends, shelters, advertisements, etc. Maybe just start by looking through your options, get a feel for what would be the best choice for your situation. And don't beat yourself up. We've all bitten off more than we could chew before.

That said, you've squeezed your response into a pre-existing narrative. That's not a slam, I'd have to do the same sort of thing. Only if I'd just learned of new and relevant information, can i imagine responding in any other way besides *rationalizing*. 


You say she should be shocked (if she were innocent). But she knew she was hunted, she knew hunters were at the gate, she knew they'd created a disturbance, and now she learns they'd talked to the db - who came right over to confront her! She's not *surprised*, this is WORST FEARS becoming realized. 


So your narrative is already askew, headed off the rails. 


I have little doubt that you'd return the favor if I were to tell how her behavior would differ if she were guilty.

The user does have a point that (I don't know if they have a coherent point I'll just steelman them) that the majority of the strongest alliances, ones that are are based on more than momentary convenience, are those that are based on mutual history.  Western nations for a long time were colonialist so that mutual partnership obviously doesn't exist.  The colonial lines dominate, but as we move farther and farther from decolonization their effects are increasingly less.  Even between the U.S. and former colonial subjects like the Philippines the relationship is more complex than just the need for basing in the south pacific.  That of course exists and is a continuation of the reasons why the U.S. occupied the Philippines in the first place, but there is a distinct Filipino mark on U.S. institutions like the U.S. Navy with a comparatively large proportion of the diaspora serving in it.  As a consequence there is a low lying perception of obligation to the Philippines to a greater extent than to other countries.

There a different levels of relationships that are built through decades of history.  The 'special relationship' between the U.S. and the UK is different than the relationship between Japan and the U.S. which is different from the growing relationship between the U.S. and India which is at this point nearly purely transactional in the face of China.",1646092852

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Ok, so if I‚Äôm explaining it like you‚Äôre a five year old‚Ä¶. You have 5 cookies. You‚Äôre forced to give me _two_ of your cookies so that I can use the cookies to help stock our snack cupboard. Of course, since you‚Äôre giving up 2 valuable cookies, you‚Äôd want to be able to help pick, or at least be allowed to suggest, what should be bought for the snack cupboard. You‚Äôd also want to be able to have some things from the snack cupboard too. After all, you‚Äôre giving me _two cookies,_ you‚Äôd want to get something in return right? Now picture this situation: I take two cookies from not only you, but also your friend. Then I tell your friend since he‚Äôs giving me two cookies, he can take _three_ snacks from the cupboard every day and he can make requests for what we buy for the cupboard. You get excited and ask if you can have 3 snacks too, because you also gave me 2 cookies. But I tell you no, you can‚Äôt take anything from the snack cupboard and you can‚Äôt ask me for things to put in the cupboard either. But that‚Äôs not fair, is it? Why should your friend be allowed to take snacks from the cupboard and ask for things to be added, but you can‚Äôt, even though you both give me two cookies? Well, he shouldn‚Äôt! You should also have access to the cupboard, and you should also be allowed to ask for snacks to be bought for it. That‚Äôs basically the gist. Historically, only the monarchs/nobles got to make any decisions about the people and how the taxes are used. People had to pay taxes without having any kind of representation in the governing body, and so they were paying for something they didn‚Äôt get to have any kind of influence over. And, in the case of colonies like America, they didn‚Äôt get any of the benefits of their taxes either. They didn‚Äôt get to benefit from improved infrastructure or the kings soldiers because they didn‚Äôt live in England. Regardless of their lack of benefit and their inability to voice concerns and suggestions for the laws that govern them and the funds they provide, they still had to pay taxes to the king. They had to give the ‚Äúcookies‚Äù, but they didn‚Äôt get to make requests for the ‚Äúsnack cupboard‚Äù and in some cases they didn‚Äôt even get to eat any ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù from the ‚Äúcupboard.‚Äù",1646092852

&gt; The universe includes all of these things and is composed of all these things. That means subjectivity and objectivity have no clear delineation.

What? No? Why would that be? The objective truth makes all those things happen. The fact that you can hold delusion doesn't make ""objective truth"" unreal.

"mathmemes","t5_3fz4c","Infinite vectors are actually conceptually not too crazy. A 3D vector would be like (1,3,5), where we‚Äôve specified an amount of distance (or whatever unit) in the first direction, second direction, third direction. Now, with a countable infinity, you can just extend this: how much in a fourth direction, fifth direction etc. 

Now imagine plotting this on a graph. Along the x axis, we put our directions, along the y, the distance in that direction. So the 3D vector from before is like: 

|                                .
|
|                 .
|
|  .
|____________________
   1.           2.           3

Now imagine filling in the 1.5th direction and 2.5th direction (who cares what these mean for the minute, we‚Äôre just assigning numbers to i-th dimensions). 

|                                .
|        .
|                 .
|                          .
|  .
|____________________
   1.           2.           3

Then fill in for 2.75th direction, and the 1.57th, and the 1.0000001th etc etc. Eventually, you just get a function f(x), where each value is the ‚Äúamount of distance‚Äù in the direction x. Hence a function is in effect an uncountable infinite vector, and much of your vector maths can be done and applied (eg. Orthogonality of vectors still exists).",1646092854

Their marriage had been consumated many times but she had always kept her bra on.  The couple by then were middle aged or elderly and the husband had come to accept the situation although he said he wished she would take it off.  How the hell this became a TV news story I have no idea.

Also when Stephen from Boyzone died I remember loads of reports that he'd died from excitement during a gay orgy although those seem to have been retracted later.

another one about a middle aged man who lived with his mum.  The man ordered a dildo and shoved it up his arse while his mum was out.  It got stuck up there and he couldn't remove it.  He was too embarrassed to tell anyone what he'd done so he just left it.

"bayarea","t5_2qjyy","Spot checking the weekly Sprouts ad vs the weekly Safeway ad, Sprouts is around 25% more expensive. Safeway has cucumbers and green bell peppers, 4 for $5, and Sprouts has cucumbers 2 for $3. Seedless grapes at Safeway are $3.99/lb, Sprouts is $4.49. Red seedless grapes are on sale 2 for $5, and Sprouts is still $4.49.  

Boneless Chuck Roast at Sprouts is $5/lb, Safeway has it for $4.15 a pound. Boneless strips are $12.99/lb at Sprouts, and 10.99/lb at Safeway.

Plus it's my recollection that everything else for your day to day - your TP, your Doritos, that extra tube of toothpaste you forgot to get at the drug store - is going to be much more expensive at Sprouts than Safeway.

So yeah, I stand by my comments to find a cheaper place to get your hair cut, and shop at someplace cheaper than Sprouts.",1646092856

"customhearthstone","t5_30mve","Note this says 'Destroyed at the end of your NEXT turn.'

Why do I think this keyword is good enough to share on the reddit? I think of it like this.

Minions are a long term way to spend mana. The maximum amount of value you can extract is keeping them on board for as long as possible, and making good trades with them. Minions without rush/charge are usually quite slow and at least some of their cost is due to them having stats and an impact on board.

Spells are the opposite. They are very short term. They can be seen as a 0/0 minion with some extra synergies. All the mana your spending is being spent on the effect of the spell. Spells can be a lot more powerful and wacky than minions. But they don't often leave a lasting impact on board,

Minions with Spectral are in between. They do impact board in some way, for one turn or two. They can make trades, they can impede your opponent. But as they are never going to stick like minions it gives the design space of putting some powerful effects on them too. Unstable Forcebender is an example of this. 3 mana deal 3 damage isn't great, but a lot better than most battlecries you'll get at that mana cost. It has a 3/3 body temporarily that can make trades! It feels impactful and strong, even if it will die. And it feels quite fair if done right too.",1646092857

"bestoflegaladvice","t5_34iym","It's a contract. What you're describing are clauses that explicitly state that there is no term - that either side may terminate at any time. I know that's the default in most states, but that doesn't mean that an employment contract can't inadvertently create terms by way of necessity for other clauses, or create liability under theories of estoppel. That's what gives rise to the explicit disclaimer of at-will status, and even that isn't always sufficient (for example, look at the current state of non-compete case law).

Contracts only require mutual assent, consideration,  legality, and capacity. ""Term"" isn't a necessary part of any of those elements. ""Customary"" also isn't one. """"Enforcement clause"" isn't one. Telling LAOP that his wife didn't have a contract because it isn't a contract for term or because she lives in an at-will state is nonsense; neither of those things indicate whether a contract exists.",1646092857

Other factors that could have caused today's crazy bull run are as follows. Last night at midnight, stock market futures were a disaster. The Asian market is smart and they sold down heavy. I expected price to fall further when the US markets opened and even stopped fast trades where I could have made money.

What also happened in the middle of the night; news announcements about Russian ban from Swift was going to be very likely, as well as more aggressive world assault on Russian oligarch wealth.

In an alternative theory, BTC falling could have reversed because of short sellers closing their positions (hitting their target) and causing a short squeeze upward. In addition, money being sent to Ukraine has been in the millions and growing. That too could rise BTC.

What convinced me that it was more than these other theories, was the aggressive chasing of oligarch money today, yachts being moved in the morning and the final announcement of Russian money being blocked from Swift.

As I kept seeing this repeated throughout the day, I knew that the only safe haven for these Putin cronies were crypto exchanges. And the CEO of Kraken even said that there is nothing they can legally do about it.",1646092858

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","A lot of people care. Baseball already has an issue keeping people interested because of how long games take to finish. Last year‚Äôs playoffs didn‚Äôt end until November and that‚Äôs been the trend lately as well. We would be going from early Nov to mid/late November if we add more teams. Which entails the likelihood of a cold weather team playing baseball at home in November. People are getting bored with how long it takes and they‚Äôd be throwing in 30 degree night games on top of that? Players won‚Äôt want to do that and fans won‚Äôt want to go to the games. I love my Tigers and baseball. I live roughly an hour away from Comerica and would LOVE to see them in the playoffs. But I‚Äôm not going to a game in November and freezing my ass off to watch a 2-1 game. 


That being said, yeah if it comes down to 14 teams or no season, I‚Äôm 10000% taking the 14 teams. But if the goal is to expand baseball and make it more marketable to a younger generation, they‚Äôre going to lose to basketball and football in November and may not recover from that.",1646092859

*****
&gt; Turkey said Monday it was blocking warships from the key Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits in line with a convention that gives it control over the passage of military vessels in the strategic area.

&gt; It grants Turkey the right to block the passage of warships in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, that connect the Aegean, Marmara, and Black Sea, in wartime if threatened.

&gt; Ukraine had last week officially asked Turkey to close the Dardanelles Strait - and thus access to the Black Sea - to Russian ships.

https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/speed-tunes-4/New-Budget-Maneater---3-Bosses-only-1-Comp

Each guide has a video associated with it and a calculator which shows exactly in which turn order the champs need to go, like this one: https://deadwoodjedi.info/cb/401f571c8e5ac270013f08f5bb922b291a143fc9

You'll need to max out Maneater and Pain Keeper obviously and for DPS I'd recommend Geomancer and Fayne - both are top tier CB DPS. For the stun target you can probably throw in one of your already maxed champs.

Speed tuning itself is pretty damn complicated at first and is unlike anything else you do in Raid (and quite annoying IMO, but some people enjoy it)

Meta Tilt:  LIGHTWEIGHT 171g.  Pink stamp.  Meta plastic is kind of clearish to blue/purple with good veins (as seen in the second picture), but reflects super bright to blue and purple.  $55 BIN.

Calvins:  Both penned as max weight.  Incredible swirling on the orange/yellow disc with the halo, and on the bottom as well.  Even a little bit of green in there if you look closely.  The Blue purple has some good swirls as well with darker blue/purple and white streaks,  Both of these are domey as hell and very grippy, not a very rigid flight plate for a max weight disc.  Super comfortable discs that will bomb but these are beyond my arm speed.  BIN $60 each.

\*\*SOLD for $55\*\* LH2:  Max weight.  Kind of a super bright lemon yellow color with a subtle orange swirl around where the plate meets the rim.  Shiny red stamp.  BIN $55.

\*\*FD has sold for $40, MD2 still available\*\* S line FD and S line MD2:  Both penned at max weight.  Plastic feels supple, grippy, fantastic.  It hurts me to sell these but I also realize I will never throw them, so someone else should enjoy them.  I dont want to get hooked on them and never be able to find them.  The stamp is a little worn from storage on the FD, but the disc is 100% brand new and has been sitting on a shelf for a very long time.  BIN is $40 for FD and $35 for MD2.

Solar Wraiths:  Max Weight.  You might lose it on your first throw, but you will look really cool as you do it.  $40 each.

WB Hades $30

Used Original P2s:  Selling as a pair for $30.  Id put the condition together as between 6 and 7/10.  The blue stamp is more like a 7, the red a bit below that.  Tons of life left in these and no dings/dents that feel awkward in your hand or cause you to rotate the disc around.  Just normal wear/tear for dx plastic.  These feel great.",1646092860

* there are photos from locals showing Ukrainian forces hiding combat vehicles behind civilian buildings (in one case even behind a kindergarden) and sometimes even infantry inside

En t√©rminos de inversiones, qu√© te valga madre lo que hagan los dem√°s. A menos de que seas de la escuela que busca al Greater Fool. S√≥lo as√≠ te puede interesar que comprar√°n los otros, de otro modo, debo decirte que una inversi√≥n es menos redituable entre m√°s personas est√©n interesadas en ella. Por qu√©? Pues porque entre m√°s personas inviertan, tendr√≠as que dividir las ganancias entre m√°s, as√≠ como los efectos psicol√≥gicos de que las expectativas de crecimiento entre m√°s compren ser√°n m√°s grandes, por lo cual es menos probable que la inversi√≥n satisfaga a todos y m√°s bien salga debiendo. 

Invertir a largo plazo es tener que estar preparado para nadar a contra corriente. Por mucho tiempo.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Really really. Now, you can have a great game with a story literally could not matter less. There are several games that I love purely for the gameplay: it takes two, celeste, most roguelikes. Things like that.

However, I would make the argument that video games allow us to tell stories in a matter in which no other medium can properly capture. And I appreciate video games that use that opportunity to tell compelling tales. And I'm not talking about do ""do good things get good ending"" kind of stuff. I'm talking something a bit more nuanced. I'm talking about when the story feeds into the gameplay and vice versa.

Let me give an example: Pyre s an indie game developed by supergiant games. In this game you play as a group of outcasts and purgatory trying to earn your way back to society. You do this through a series of competitions where each character has their own game style, strengths, and weaknesses. Now, throughout the course of the game you will earn the right at various points to send those characters home to their family and loved ones. However, when you send those characters home they are gone forever. You can never use them again to win another contest. Now the obvious decision is send the characters you don't like to play with home, so you can keep the ones whose gameplay fit you the best. However, the writers are super giant have created several incredibly compelling characters all of whom ""deserve"" to go home. So I found myself repeatedly making decisions that would make the game harder for me because I would send home characters that I had grown attached to and I believe deserve to go home. And because of that it affected the gameplay of not being able to use those characters anymore.

There's also games where the story is just really compelling. I'm talking about games like Bioshock infinite, the last of us, or the newest god of war. You're right as a standalone movie, these stories would be pretty compelling. And the gameplay and story don't really mesh. But I'd like having a compelling story, cuz it helps me have context between what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. I'm not just playing a game to get good, I'm playing it I want to see how kratos' story ends. And I am earning that right by mastering the gameplay.

Now if you play the game just for gameplay, cool I'm not trying to poo-poo that. I'm just saying that for me the moments that I look back on in my gaming hobby career that have really stuck with me, it's mostly been story moments that caught me off guard or held my actions accountable in the realm of the story.

But there are some video games out there with really good gameplay and just crap stories lol so I totally get skimming over the cutscenes for those just to get to the next fun part.

Make it clear that next time this happens the package ends up in trash with no notification (assuming they paid for whatever contents that should be incentive enough).

&gt;In the 100 nuclear explosion case, following [41] with a 0.75-Mt total yield could produce about 7 trillion grams (Tg) of soot, regardless of the target country (excluding island countries). This would be more than sufÔ¨Åcient to produce the lowest temperatures Earth has experienced in the past 1000 years‚Äîlowerthan during the post-medieval Little Ice Age or in 1816, the so-called year without a summer. It would result in a 20% drop in sunlight and lead to a 19% drop in global precipitation (more extreme insome areas‚Äîe.g., 40% precipitation decreases in for example the Asian monsoon region [41,42]). As the impact would be global, not only would food production decrease in the aggressor country, but also in all other countries, so the ability to obtain food from other countries would largely diminish.


&gt;The radiative forcing by nuclear-weapons-generated soot might persist for a decade, but even with a relatively optimistic 5 year cut off [48], the impacts on food supply would be severe. This is because even a small change in temperature can lead to a large change in agricultural output. Using the1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia as an analog, the impact can be predicted. That sun-blocking crisis resulted in frosts occurring in every month in New England (even though the average temperature dropped only a few degrees) thereby preventing any crop from obtaining maturity before it was killed by frost. This crop death caused the price of grain to skyrocket and a mass migration began from New England to the Midwest, as people followed reports of fertile land there [42]. Ironically the price of livestock plummeted as farmers sold the animals they could no longer feed. This was a short-lived crisis known as ‚Äúthe year without a summer‚Äù, but the 100 nuclear weapon case would cause a longer crop growth problem.

I saw you say that you don't want to add in non-Gusto monsters, so there's not much tweaking you can do. Do consider Wynn like what the other guy said - Wynn+Griffin is an OTK on 2500 atk monsters if you can pull it off.

Consider Forbidden Droplets instead of Divine Wrath, so that you can turn off negates even on turn 2. Much more expensive to craft, though.

Kaijus are also non-Gusto, but they make the OTK much easier, while also removing problem cards on the field.

But you can easily play devils advocate and say, why do people frame and put sports jerseys on their walls? Why are they not wearing the jersey instead? Why do people put vinyls on walls?.. You can view a graded game as a collectible, cause that‚Äôs what it literally is at that point, and not as a playable video game anymore. Once graded it‚Äôs purpose is no longer to be played.

Good Fabric is expensive

Its also because people are willing to pay it, or in this specific case not really so its on sale...

If I had to guess labor and parts/fabric its probably ~$60 to produce a zip hoodie for them. Since they aren't DTC they have to sell wholesale which cuts into margins. Hoodies and t shirts are often about 50% price on wholesale but this is in general and not assured. Outerwear and more expensive, harder to sell pieces, are often 30-40% of the retail price as wholesale price.

My opinion on how the right has been cozying to Putin has been shaped mostly by ATS, especially over the past week or so.

\[edit\] I'll admit I just checked public Facebook as I do to get a sense for how the dumbest of the dumb politically view a given topic, and conservatives there do on the whole are against Putin, which surprised me.

I think you are in a very common situation. I have had quite a few subs that discovered kink only after long marriages for example, simply because they were never exposed to anything about bdsm and so they couldn‚Äôt even contemplate if it was something they liked. In my case, it took a few years of feeling very weird about my sexuality until I was exposed to the right terminology and resources in order for things to click. So I think it‚Äôs completely normal for someone to not contemplate bdsm, simply because they do not know what it is and have not been exposed to it in the right way.

I also think it‚Äôs important to think that maybe the bdsm vs vanilla approach is very binary. People do things that are ‚Äúoutside the norm‚Äù all the time and do not approach it through what‚Äôs defined via bdsm.",1646092864

I‚Äôd say that you should love and trust your partner enough to let them keep what they want, I encourage my partner to keep things from her past relationships and even encourage her to be friends with her ex.

The fact he secretly kept things is one of the biggest problems, the other is you making him get rid of things he didn‚Äôt want too. 

He should have put his foot down and said, he‚Äôs not happy to get rid of these things. You should have then put your foot down and said your not happy to move into a new place together with these things. Then you compromise. You asked him to keep them at his parents, when he said no, I‚Äôd have asked him why, tried to explore what his thinking was behind it. Rather than making him feel bad for wanting too. I don‚Äôt blame you for being insecure about him keeping things from his ex, lots of people would be. I‚Äôm just pointing out that it doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt love  you or is going to run away with his ex.",1646092865

"ebikes","t5_2si7q","Are you talking about picking between the BBS02 and BBSHD? The BBS02 from Luna actually has a 25A controller, so in theory you can get potentially as much as 58\*25 = 1.4kW out of it with a 52V battery (or 1.3kW with a 48V battery).

I've built 2 ebikes with BBSHD and 1 with a BBS02. My partner uses a BBS02 and it's fine. I went for the BBS02 because that ebike is just used occasionally. When it is used my partner twists the throttle when taking off from stop lights and it's holding up just fine with occasional periods of full-power, and more typically cruising at &lt; 500W.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'd say you'll have no problems with BBS02 and will have plenty of power on demand if you ever want it, but I wouldn't make a habit of running it hard for long periods of time. Unless you're putting a really high capacity battery on it (which seems unlikely since you're budget minded) you wouldn't get much real world use out of running it at &gt; 1kW for long anyway.

Honestly, I wouldn't bother with fiddling with the software. Just get it on the hot rod setting from Luna, and then use your PAS levels to dial in a good comfortable cruising assist level for you, you can twist the throttle to add more power when needed on hills. Don't use the throttle like a binary switch, just apply as much as you need to get the job done.

&amp;#x200B;

edit - you really can't compare the torque (in terms of what it feels like as the rider) to a scooter because it's a totally different riding experience. Having said that, I have a little escoot that is maybe 250 or 350W, and it is slooooow compared to even my BBS02 build.",1646092865

*****
&gt; Turkey said Monday it was blocking warships from the key Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits in line with a convention that gives it control over the passage of military vessels in the strategic area.

&gt; It grants Turkey the right to block the passage of warships in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, that connect the Aegean, Marmara, and Black Sea, in wartime if threatened.

&gt; Ukraine had last week officially asked Turkey to close the Dardanelles Strait - and thus access to the Black Sea - to Russian ships.

"Mediacom","t5_2t6sy","Great suggestions. Logging in as admin to the UI is a great idea.

Turns out that the modem was such an old model (even though it was supplied as new from Mediacom), it was just too slow.  I pay for 1GB internet, and have three Eeevo devices connected.  The tech said over 400 mpbs would start to drop packets.

So, it was indeed connected, and aggressive caching sites like facebook and youtube could buffer enough to keep the connection alive.  But things like Alexa or any other IOT would just drop.

The new router sped everything up considerably.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Mediacom had used the cable from an older dish TV that was in the house before I bought it.  So, that connector is really too long to transmit the signal.  At Medicom they always had trouble pinging my router. That was the reason. Swapped that out.

I have too many VPNs!  But one that I was really worried about here was a new one - not so much a VPN as a filter, is Falcon.

"arcane","t5_2re2c","&gt;Yeah, I've read about Silco having Jinx murder children. The problem I have with this is that it's not in the series. Let's just talk about the series.

I'm not gonna lie, I find that incredibly hard to deal with.

In the show, yes, Jinx murders people, but it's done either

1. in combat. Vs the firelights, for example.
2. Against the people who have oppressed her her entire life, and who in her mind are largely / completely responsible for the absolute shit and misery she's been in. The Enforcers, and the Council.

I can relate to both those times. But if she literally lined up children and just shot them, then holy fuck... There will be absolutely ZERO redemption possible for her. So I really, really hope that that's simply not true. Any sympathy anyone would have for her would just go ""poof"".

But as you said, since it's not in the show, it may not be actual canon.

As for Silco's love, we'll agree to disagree. :)

His patriotism, I think, at some point, may have been real, but there's nothing behind it anymore. It's now just something he crows to justify all the absolutely horrible shit he's done. All Silco wants, imo, is to expand his drug empire. In the end, he's running the Zaun version of the Sinaloa cartel.",1646092865

"ChrisChanSonichu","t5_327ub","One surprising thing I‚Äôve found over the years in learning about assassinations/high-profile murders is how many of them are barely or even not at all motivated by the attacker‚Äôs fear or hatred of their target(s). Take John Hinkley, for instance, who attempted to murder President Ronald Reagan just a few months after he took office in 1981. Hinkley appears to have been almost completely apolitical, but fully delusional, believing that assassinating a US president would somehow win him the respect/attention of Hollywood actress Jodi Foster, whom he was creepily obsessed with. The investigation into the Reagan shooting eventually revealed that, the previous year, Hinkley had explored the possibility of targeting then-President Jimmy Carter for the same reason. Had Carter not lost his re-election bid to Reagan, chances are that Reagan would have faded into relative obscurity, and a second-term Carter would have taken his place in Hinkely‚Äôs crosshairs.

Then there are other attackers who will profess to having ‚Äòbig-picture‚Äô reasons for targeting the people they did, but their performance is inconsistent and unconvincing. Mark David Chapman, for instance, who murdered ex-Beatle John Lennon in late 1980. The senselessness of Lennon‚Äôs death cemented his posthumous image as a sort of martyr for the cause of world peace‚Ä¶which I‚Äôm not convinced Lennon in life would have totally embraced. (Very complex and contradictory man/artist). Anyway, Chapman has often made himself available for press interviews over the years‚Äînothing better to do when you‚Äôre serving a life sentence, I suppose‚Äîbut when inevitably asked to provide a solid *reason* for gunning down this beloved, legendary musician in cold blood‚Ä¶he usually hedges a bit. Under questioning, he might allude to Lennon‚Äôs distaste for organized religion or the sense that ‚Äòimagine no possession‚Äô John Lennon was materialistic, and therefore a hypocrite, but even Chapman himself seems unconvinced by what he‚Äôs saying. The more honest answer seems to be that he can‚Äôt pinpoint any strong reason for killing Lennon in retrospect, vaguely regrets doing so, and has accepted his life in prison sentence as just punishment.",1646092865

"FortNiteBR","t5_3oeyf","do you want to hear my pain?  


i started playing in chapter 1 season 2  
my favorite POI was dusty depot + factories  
dusty got hit by the meteor  


starting season 4 my main drop was moisty mire, it was a small POI with not that many players AND it had just been upgraded with a movie set (throughout this list you are gonna notice that many of my favorite POIs are small pois with few players)   
moisty got turned into paradise  


season 5 my favorite POI was loot lake. season 6 loot lake would become leaky lake and then loot lake (but with grass). this is the only time i liked the revamped version of the POI better than the original. Also season 5 and 6 i landed greasy grove A TON  


in season 7 greasy got destroyed and replaced with polar peak, another favorite poi of mine (still a downgrade to greasy)  


season 8 the IO dug up the vault at loot lake, making it super lame. I hated the vault version of loot lake.   
\*time for irony\*  
at this point in time, id been playing for 6 seasons and started getting really good at the game. I started landed at big populated pois. I wasnt just playing to win, i was playing for the fighting. i had 3 main drop spots  
i shit you not  
tilted, retail, and polar peak  
the unvaulting event was hard to watch that day. the game got alot worse in the matter of minutes.  


season 9 was really bad imo. lootpool was good but the map was doodoo. my favorite poi was polar peak at the start, which then got destroyed by the monster. after polar peak got destroyed i stopped playing until season X  


SEASON X was no no  
it was nice seeing so many of my old favorite pois return, but most of them were doodoo because of epic's gimmicks in each POI.   
i mostly landed power plant as it was easy to see if a mech was coming and you could use a thermal vent to easily outrun mechs.  


chapter 2 time  
season 1 favorite POI was craggy cliffs (it still had 100% chest spawn rate so it was nice)

the reason my main drop spot wasnt retail row was because chapter 2 retail was way to far from circle. Also part of the reason i like a POI is if it looks aesthetically pleasing. I hated the way the bottom right of the map looked. it was this ugly green. nasty.   


season 2 favorite poi was Slurpy Swamp, the reason i didnt land craggy anymore was because they removed the 100% chest spawn rate. this was the first time they didnt destroy a POI i liked, they just ruined the loot at it.   


season 3 is my favorite season of chapter 2 (or atleast in a tie with season 7)  
my favorite poi slurpy had been flooded, but this season i loved the whole map besides the bottom right area AND slurpy made a return at the end of the season. my main drop was the fortilla.   


season 4 destroyed part of the fortilla. sad. i still liked slurpy alot but started landing the authority alot. the authority was a more chill version of the agency, and i DONT CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY IT IS BETTER. the ruins were also really cool.... until galactus literally ripped this POI out of the ground with his bare hand.   


season 5 made me angry  
salty towers was nice addition but it just reminded me of how much i missed chapter 1. this was the season i really started to see the difference in quality between chapter 1 and 2.  
i would land slurpy, rotate to logjam/greasy, and then head to circle. i loved going greasy this season.  


season 6 is the worst season in fortnite history.  
boney burbs was bad. collosal crops was bad.   
at this point id been landing slurpy so long that it had become so memorable. i memorized everything inside out in that poi. the game started feeling really dry because every game was literally the same thing. land slurpy, go greasy, get mats at greasy/logjam, go to circle, die to a stupid primal shotty or something  


season 7 was a nice breath of fresh air  
i loved corny complex. any underground POI is cool.   
what pained me was halfway through the season, they stole slurpy. that made me mad. I started landing corny complex every game until they started abducting that before the event. i hated the half abducted pois with the floating islands. they were hard to navigate around.   


season 8 was weird. i started liking boney burbs. it wasnt so ugly without the orange primal grass and not that many players went there. besides that, the map had been trashed.  


chapter 3, the return of the king  
greasy is back  
tilted is back  
logjam is amazing  
cavern is amazing  
sanctuary is amazing  


all the other pois are also really good  


everytime i like a POI and make it my main landing, epic eventually remove it within a season or two. i hope this cycle doesnt keep repeating lol",1646092866

So the gold price is under assault, the volume is very very high. I feel very good because nobody cares about gold and when nobody cares that means nobody's watching and when nobody's watching that's when things are about to get crazy good. You can buy an ounce of gold in the futures market for $60/ounce but can't take delivery. An entire year's worth of supply turned over in the futures market which is highly unusual. None of that is real gold,  it's all paper and so when you see that then it's getting ready for a move. There's no reason why gold can't walk back over $2,000 and make a new high in the coming months.""  ,

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","**Dominion** 2x3p - a couple of easy wins for me, since I tend to build more efficient decks than my roommates. We all love playing the game however.

**Hansa Teutonica** 3p - first time playing for all three of us. I thought for sure that I was going to win, but another player snatched the East-West bonus before me, rocketing ahead in points and ending the game suddenly.

**Nemo's War 2e** 1p - explore motive. I made it to the finale card, barely holding on... and it was a finale that I had to put on the bottom of the deck and keep playing. So I lost in the very next placement phase. Nevertheless, it was a great time getting to that point. This is an excellent game.

**Coffee Roaster** 1p - I don't know how I feel about this game. I've played it several times, and I feel like in order to do well you have to really memorise what's in your bag, and I just don't find that enjoyable. I don't think I'll hold on to this one.",1646092867

&gt;I don't want to break up with him as I know he didn't mean to hurt me

Yes he did.  He did mean to hurt you. Or rather, **at the very least, HE DID NOT CARE THAT HE WAS HURTING YOU.**  I know you feel like you need to tell yourself (and us) otherwise, because the truth feels unfathomably awful: that this man who is supposed to be your partner, to love and care about you, would be completely indifferent to your fear and pain. It's a terrifying thought. It's a lot easier, and safer, to tell yourself that it was the alcohol. That it was a one-time thing. Or maybe a two-time thing. That he didn't mean it. That he would never KNOWINGLY hurt you.

But here's the problem with that: **you told him no. Repeatedly. And he sexually assaulted you anyway. He aggressively violated your body despite your repeated and vocal lack of consent.** Sweetheart, all the alcohol in the world doesn't excuse that. And he WILL do it again.

You could never, ever be the AH for not wanting to be intimate with him now. Why WOULD you want to? Why would you want to trust someone with your body who violently violated you? I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. But you have a bigger problem, and that is that this man is going to assault you again. He doesn't believe that he needs consent to be with you, he doesn't care if he harms you, and you are not safe with him. Please, please take that seriously and put some distance between you. You deserve so much better than this.",1646092868

You know you are incompatible and you know where this is headed, now you just have to choose your timing and you can include him in this discussion.  You say he knows the same things and is a great guy so he probably has these same concerns.  Make a plan to sit down and talk for a few hours and warn him what it is about so he can bring thoughts to the table.  I will add that if you are delaying the breakup because you are concerned about how to meet someone new that is not a good reason.  You are intelligent and a great person.  You will need some time to be by yourself but still have fun if you want.  The internet is great for meeting people.

I am probably what people would describe as someone who bottles up frustration and anger rather than release it through physical aggression or by verbally abusing others haha. I usually listen to music and try to rationalise other people's behaviours or actions in my head, and that helps me to see things from a wider perspective. 

I think eventually, if someone or something really does get to me, eventually I will cry and open up to someone close to me! It takes a hell of a lot to get me to that stage.",1646092869

Not really asking anything specific just generally anything that you notice would be better or any tips you have to share would be much appreciated.

The one question I did have is would these fish prefer real plants and if so how hard are they to maintain?",1646092869

Gazprom has financed environmental movements, NGOs for example, which have pushed to shut down nuclear power, which has had the consequence that Europe is more dependent on Russian energy, says Dominique Reyni√©. - Among other things, the Belgian Minister of the Environment has links to such Russian-funded movements, he continues.

Belgium, which has two nuclear power plants with a total of seven reactors, announced in December last year that it would close its nuclear power plant by 2025. The driving force behind the decision was the country's Green Party, which also holds the post of Minister of the Environment in the coalition of seven parties that govern the country.

Or 2) you acknowledge your feelings haven‚Äôt changed after all the effort and time, respect that it‚Äôs okay to still be upset, and leave her. 

You have to either forgive her and move on from the incident or simply move on from her. Cheating is so hard to deal with - I‚Äôve never been able to stay with a partner after they cheated.

First we sort the list in desc order then we do an INDEX-MATCH with MATCH()'s last parameter set to -1.

From the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093378?hl=en):

&gt; -1 causes MATCH to assume that the range is sorted in descending order and **return the smallest value greater than or equal to search_key**.

"manga","t5_2ql0i","&gt; Does it though? 

a series with a good natural conclusion having a sequel for no real reason? sounds exactly like boruto

&gt;Zatch bell never came close to the popularity Naruto has sales wise. If they wanted a cash grab, there are better options out there, especially considering its age.

a few problems with this line of thinking

1. zatch bell was popular, it may not have hit narutos highs but thats an extremely high bar, there are still plenty of people to sell the nostalgia too

2. just because you dont think its a good cash grab doesnt mean that others dont see it as one

3. this could be them scraping the bottom of the barrel, they may have tried those other options you assume exist and defaulted to this one

4. this might have been inspired by Boruto, they see the money its making and decided they could cash in too",1646092872

"dating","t5_2qhb1","a mole or an annoying tic, the former is just something shallow people would call a flaw and the latter would be a personal trait to overcome 

unacceptable flaws are abuse etc

surface flaws vs deep and dangerous flaws

tbh the differences are always kinda obvious to me, dont date a gaslighter etc

and maybe an annoyingly talkative person is a deal breaker and it's whatever, annoying is annoying and unattractive is unattractive, no shame at all in looking for what you're looking for

just be self aware if your dealbreaker is a bad hairline that's on the ""personal preferences duh everyone is turned off by something but definitely a shallow end type deal of yours not some deep flaw and you could probably find something in their character to make up for it"" 

but then also, if their bad hairline is because they wont listen when their doctor tells them that their receding hairline could be helped by not smoking a pack a day... oh that tidbit turns it into a red flag eh? 

there's a difference between a flaw and a preference, self awareness and honesty with yourself is kinda important in sorting flaws from acceptable character traits in others

and there are a lot of things people treat as flaws that aren't 

like ""omg they're too short/got a mole/ears look like a bat etc"" dawg that's not a flaw, that's a preference and its not wrong of you to be unattracted to them but dont fuckin call it a flaw

but ""omg they drive so bad"" or ""they refuse to match their belt to their shoes"" yeah those are flaws and tbh im not into it, which is why i so wholeheartedly support spending on public transit and thrift stores.

if this started as spitballing it ended with me facedown in a puddle of drool but i think i made the point that this is where the line between subjective and objective flaws simultaneously blur and become obvious",1646092872

My first therapist (when I was at uni) also said something along these lines. He was working as a counsellor in his retirement but had actually been a clinical psychologist his entire life, so he was a bit cheeky and made our sessions more therapy-like than counselling-like. And he said that he'd never seen a case like mine and he thought I had somehow managed to get to the age of 20 with no primary attachment whatsoever (among other things that I can't remember)

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require post titles to be more descriptive, to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era/Year | Genre | Style | Artist type | Artist name | Music video information | Source name`  
`Language/Country | Lyrics/Content | Cover art | Description | Known/Possible song name`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.).
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

Is athletic ability the defining characteristic? Are eSports a sport?

But music is music. Even Phillip Glass played the occasional instrument in-between his attempts to classify silence and banging on pots as music. Its impact and influence, even on cheerleading, cannot be overstated. Would you rather never hear music again or never watch sports again? How do you think most people answer that?

"MicrosoftRewards","t5_3fwr7","Townscaper will give you 12 easy achievements for about 2 mins time per day. Follow the Maka91 guide on Youtube. Pop the achievement, exit, do the next one the following day and so on.

Day of the Tentacle is good for fairly quick/regular achievements between each one. Follow WelshHunter's guides on Youtube. Similar for Full Throttle and Grim Fandango. Takes on average 5-10 mins per day and follows the story which is quite good (and brings back memories if you can remeber them when they were first out). Get an achievement, save game and return the next day to do another one. These were all on GamePass but might have left now, not sure.

Also Killer Instinct on GamePass will give you pretty much 3 super easy achievements for each character. Do in this order, one per day:

Day 1: Fight Vs CPU with character
Day 2: Fight vs CPU with character until Lvl 3 with that character (gives you a ""colour"" for the character)
Day 3: Fight on Survival vs CPU

Then just rinse and repeat for the next character. Check TrueAchivements for a full list.

There are one or two characters that don't have these achievements. I think you can get around 50 achievements though by just doing this - so gives you nearly 2 months AMEM if you do them one per day.

If anyone has any more suggestions, I'd love to hear them as rapidly running out of easy ones!!",1646092874

&gt; The 193 members of the UN&amp;#039;s General Assembly held a minute&amp;#039;s silence on Monday for the victims of the war in Ukraine as delegates met for an emergency session to discuss a resolution condemning Moscow&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Aggression.""

&gt; Unlike the more prominent Security Council, where a single vote against from veto holder Russia can thwart any motion or resolution, as it did in Friday&amp;#039;s emergency session, the General Assembly can move on a two-thirds majority vote rather than a unanimous one.

&gt; Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN, compared Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine to the invasion carried out by the Nazis during World War II. He accused Moscow of targeting residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, which he condemned as &amp;quot;War crimes.""

But I'm wondering too, do you guys think its worth it to continue farming hero trials (a ranks) just for extra shards?
I don't really feel it is because you only get 8 shards so you need 12,5 runs for a single shard for a limited char after you get your first ones (which means more than 300stamina). But what is your opinion? Anyone continues with hero trials after sss+ all basic characters?",1646092875

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","Yes, but they do it half-assed and try to get out of it all together. My cousin rented a townhome in the city. It was an old place, not sure when exactly it was built. Anyway, there was a mold buildup under the sink. It was so bad that it was like sponges. His water bill was also strangely up by about $200 more a month. He reported it to the landlord. About two months later there is no word from the landlord, and he, his wife, and son are having sinus infections and a cough that won't go away. He called the landlord again and this time he sent a plumber out. Guess what? The plumber found a leak a little down under the sink. The water and mold had rotted away a lot of the wood and drywall in the sink and cabinet aria at this point and it needed major repairs. The plumber fixed the leak, but the rot and mold was another issue that, you guessed it, went another month without being addressed. My cousin ended up having to cut out the mold and repair the walls the best he could with plywood. A few months later, that issue still isn't fixed and another issue came up.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","1,2,8,12 all go together, that stuff plus a filter cartridge make up a Hang on back filter, looks like an aqueon quiet flow. To find the filter that goes with it, take the blue grid to the pet store, the filter you need should be the same size as that. 

10 and 13 go together as well, the pipe should slide into the groove on the right side of the filter, the propeller should go in a hole inside the housing. 

14 is a heater

15 is an air pump. You can use 11 (airline) to connect to a barb on the front of the air pump and then into a tank to blow bubbles

9 and 7 are filter cartridge pieces, check those with 13, id bet one fits, then use that to find the filter cartridges that go with that filter

6 looks like some homemade system to connect a hose to a faucet for water changes.


3 looks like a food clip.

"Wallstreetsilver","t5_3ug1ww","&gt;OI trend was strong and headed toward open interest exceeding metal in the vault. 

Wouldn't it be more accurate to say: OI trend was strong and headed toward open interest exceeding **current Registered** metal in the vault?

That leaves the question in my mind of:

1. Is this the way they'll now rescue COMEX each time it needs rescuing? Wait until First Notice day to see what the shortages are, and then quietly settle the necessary number of contracts outside of COMEX and call it an *adjustment*? It has worked once now.
2. Or is this -- out of desire or necessity -- a 1-time event like the time JP Morgan rode their big horse in with a shit-tonne of silver to save the day? Something not repeated again since.

The first option appears to have made 40 million ounces of demand vanish overnight. Wherever they got it from, if it was all settled in metal, that 5.5 million from SLV wasn't near enough. PSLV is still claiming to have all of theirs. And still selling at a -3.1% discount.

But now history will show March 2022 as a weak delivery month and no one in the future giving a cursory look back will see it as anything special.

And what are the chances that we might still see a spanner in the works with a strong showing for current month immediate delivery contracts in the coming days?",1646092877

"leafs","t5_2r8hf","Our 2nd line as currently constructed is a major issue especially when you consider how much they make and how that limits the D we can have on the roster.

Muzzin has played a lot of minutes with that line this year and the results have been poor. When Liljegren/Sandin played 3rd pair minutes they were putting up some of the league best xG%, they rarely played with the Tavares line. The Rielly/Brodie pair mainly played with the Matthews line and obviously their xG% has been good. The main red flag to me is ever since Muzz has been injured the Rielly/Brodie pair has taken a lot more responsibility defensively and that includes more minutes with the JT and their xG% has tanked for the past 2 weeks. The only D-Pair that has had success with the JT line this year is Muzzin - Brodie who were together for like 3 games max.

Obviously everything is fluid, but it seems all the D-Pairs are putting up really good analytics until they play major minutes with the JT line. So even if Chychrun could play RD with Muzzin that still doesnt necessarily fix the issue. The issue is the Tavares line itself. That line needs a big forward that can play the cycle and set up pucks down low so JT can play a game better suited to him. At that point any of our D is capable enough to make plays in the O-Zone to retain possession. 

As currently constructed whoever plays with them will play a bunch of minutes in their own zone because the forwards are useless at keep possession. I believe that our coverages aren't amazing, but they're being exaggerated because of how much we're playing in our own zone because of the JT line. Plus our bad goaltending lately hasn't helped.

That's just the conclusion I've made based on players numbers throughout the year and such. I could be wrong and it could be as simple as getting a D, but I find that unlikely seeing as all our D have struggled in some capacity with that line.",1646092878

"thinkpad","t5_2qvhj","Do you seriously think businesses upgrade the RAM of their laptop fleets these days? They do not. Users who upgrade RAM are irrelevant for Lenovo money-wise. 

Soldered RAM increases costs, by forcing the laptop manufacturer to produce many different mainboard SKUs for different CPU/GPU/RAM combinations. Sockets are cheaper, and regular DDR memory is cheaper than LPDDR memory.

&gt; My claim is that fewer options = worse. Only in a revenue/sales-focused world is that claim untrue. If you have that viewpoint that's fine. It's just not relevant when discussing what's good for the customer.

Who is the customer?

The customers are corporations, who buy laptops for their employees. These corporations have a particular set of interests - the laptops have to be reliable to last through a 3 to 5 year lease. They have to be lightweight, so employees can transport them. They have to offer security features and they have to be easy to use. You know, so the employees can be productive.

And also, they shouldn't be too expensive. Because when you buy 10,000 laptops, 10 $ can make a huge difference in pricing.

This is the field in which Dell, Lenovo and HP operate with their business laptop lines. You know what they can not do with their enterprise models, which includes the T series? Build in fluff, features that their customers never or almost never use. Because those customers want the low price. What is good for those customers? A low price is. Superfluous features are not.

""More is more"" is true in the consumer market, where users buy their own laptops and a 50 $ difference is nothing. But we aren't talking about consumer laptops here, we are talking about business laptops.",1646092879

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","Juice box is actually an OD! I haven‚Äôt played out with the JC yet (yay Covid) but it is surprisingly loud and clean with no OD channel (hence my search for a stereo gain stage pedal) so it depends on how you are pushing your current amps. Without the bright switch on it is mellow with the highs pleasantly rolled off. Bright switch on and it almost feels like a keyboard amp except without dedicated tweeters. It really works well with translating high fidelity chorus and reverb tones. The big issue running a stereo rig in the venues is the backline usually mics you up mono so you either have to insist on stereo DI or get the sound guy for the night to scrounge up another sm57 in his Box ‚Äòo Crap under the mixing board cabinet. Either way you should be prepared to bring your own DI boxes, cables/snakes, mics, etc. For smaller spaces and if the band isn‚Äôt trying to out-volume each other you can probably get away without micing it.

Honestly this may remain a recording or practice setup since the stereo field isn‚Äôt as prominent within a a live band context. If you see how I spaced the DC and RV I have enough room to unplug the patch cable to convert it to mono. Doesn‚Äôt sound as cool but most of the time the audiences are oblivious anyway.",1646092880

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","&gt; cheese will be effectively be priced in British Pounds

do you know what the price of cheese in British pounds is?

Looking at [cheese prices in the UK](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/search?query=cheddar%20cheese), your standard blocks of cheddar seem to sell for GBP 5.50 to 8.50 /kg, which is NZD 11 to 17. At countdown, the cheapest essentials cheddar blocks seem to [sell for $14/kg](https://shop.countdown.co.nz/shop/productdetails?stockcode=434914). We're already paying the same prices for cheese they are.

...which...I don't know, does undermine the story that our exporters will suddenly all be rich.

I think the balanced story is that primary produce will get a bit pricier in NZ, but on the other hand, there'll be all sorts of things we can buy from the UK which will be more accessible--cheaper cars, for instance. And producers in NZ will make more money, which means more tax revenue to pay for government services, and more and higher-paying jobs in all the things that the rural sector needs to support their work, in accounting, tech, law, construction, retail, food processing and manufacturing, etc.",1646092880

Tom Cruise as a current Jeff Gordon figure of a major team (Rowdy Burns' team from the end of the film?) makes a lot of sense. Maybe it's the inverse of the original film or a little Cobra Kai. They have the a young, hothead driver that doesn't pan out (a la Kyle Busch) who jumps ship and becomes the film's antagonist with a rival team. They give a shot to some talented no name (it's a movie after all). 

In terms of the technical aspects of the film, a lot has changed since 1990 on both the filmmaking side and NASCAR side. Even though Tony Scott was a visionary ahead of his time, even that style is dated so it would inherently feel like a different film (see: new Top Gun).

The problem that I see from a lot of people talking about what DoT got wrong about the sport, there's never going to be a 1-to-1 translation. What makes a good film doesn't make for 100% accurate racing and vice versa. Before you start shouting ""so good it felt like a movie"" moments from NASCAR's history, show me how that translates to a proper 3 act structure that is broad enough to warrant what would presumably be a $50-100 mil production.

I had evidence that showed I was in a group during the time she said it happened.  After a week, the girl finally confessed that she made it all up.

Even when the truth came out-- people still couldn't accept the truth: that this girl lied.  Instead there was always this nugget of doubt that ""something"" must have happened, or, that I had been inappropriate in some way. I was engaged at the time and my fiancee broke it off like a month after this.  I could tell she ""wanted"" to believe but yet there was this little doubt that again I must have done *""something""* inappropriate.

My only saving grace was that this was prior to social media. I quit my job and moved to a new state and no one ever knew about what had happened.  Had it been a social media thing I probably never would have escaped the stigma.

They found the baby measuring 6 weeks even with a heart rate of 106. I was beside myself inconsolable. I've lad 3 losses previously so I was convinced that this was the beginning of the end. 

I spoke with my RN a few hours later and what she said to me really gave me a little hope. She said that the tech is trying to measure a baby that is the size of a grain of quinoa and that the measurement can easily be off by a few days. The heart rate was a little bit low, but the heart is like an electrical system that just kicked on and it needs a little time to figure itself out. The results weren't bad but they're sending me back this Thursday when I should be 8+2 to confirm everything looks good and the heart rate is normal.

Don't give up hope yet. I know how hard it is, I've been there. But like another commenter said, right now you're pregnant and stressing about it is not going to change the outcome.

On the subject.

It is weird a question to ask even for 1922 as slavery did not exist any where, and that it does not even start with ""Can a muslim man own slaves?"". The answerer, Hafiz Roshan Ali, was held in high regard and was a companion. It could assumed that his answer is just giving a pure 7th century answer. Why would he do that? well I lot of indian-muslim scholars wrote similar questionable stuff in that era, he is just another one of them.  
  
While one could be 100% sure that people didn't have concubines in Qadian in 1922 (don't ask me to prove it!), I don't understand why the answer simply isn't ""Slavery does not exist anymore so this question is moot"". It was against the law in india, so there was no way for one to acquire a slave. Also what was the need to go into so much minutia of verses and what body parts are ""owned""?",1646092882

Not that the fic was entirely bad. I enjoyed how much the fic used Chekhov's Gun and made fantastic callbacks of jutsu and information. There were good ideas all around, but the execution of which sometimes felt boring.

"movingtojapan","t5_3fy6c","First, you need to be married to get a spousal visa. Once you're married in Japan, you can apply for the spouse visa. 

Second, income plays a role more so to prove to the visa officers that you (as the spouse) will be able to comfortably live in Japan. Neither of you don't need a job, but then you need some way of financial security. Savings is one of those, so if you can prove you hold those savings with bank statements, it's down to the visa officers to approve of the amount. What amount is good? Who knows. I think you have enough. And of course show your wife's income/tax documents, and bank statements. Additionally, you can apply with job offers, and have her family guarantee financial security. 

For example, my wife doesn't make a ton, around 3.5mil yen, a year and the visa officer said that was more than enough. He didn't need my bank statements, and they gave them back to me.",1646092883

"nrl","t5_2qn90","Bulldogs star Tevita Pangai Junior has avoided suspension after was put on report and sin-binned following a bizarre blow-up on Monday night.

Pangai Junior connected with Sharks prop Royce Hunt in a big hit in Monday‚Äôs trial game but then started pulling at his jersey and seemingly making it even harder for his two Dogs teammates to bring Hunt to the ground.

As a couple of players ran in to settle it down, a fired up Pangai Junior looked as though he attempted to punch Hunt but was stopped by players from both teams swarming in.

‚ÄúThat just bubbled up out of nothing,‚Äù Fox League commentator Dan Ginnane said as a Sharks trainer brought out a replacement jersey for Hunt.

The NRL opted against sanctioning Pangai Junior but Bulldogs coach Trent Barrett admitted his players must get that dirty play out of their game.

Expert analyst Cooper Cronk enjoyed the initial hit Pangai Junior put on Hunt but couldn‚Äôt understand why it went the way it did.

‚ÄúHe wanted a piece of that from the word go because he took the hand-break off and just launched at Royce Hunt. And he didn‚Äôt stop there, he ripped the shirt off the big fella. I liked the intent... but then just carried on,‚Äù he said.

Pangai Junior was put on report for striking and sent for 10.

The Fox League panel were baffled by the incident.

‚ÄúPangai Jr lost the plot in that first half,‚Äù Braith Anasta said at half time.

‚ÄúWhat was he thinking?

‚ÄúHe has got to add more value to the team. It could prove costly. He could be suspended.‚Äù

Greg Alexander agreed.

‚ÄúWe spoke about him pre-game and said if he can focus on what needs to be done on the field and what is important,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt make contact with the head he went within a whisker.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt on a mission to run hard and tackle hard. He was on a mission to get sent off.

‚ÄúHe will come that close to being suspended. He was fortunate the elbow and the two punches did not make contact with Royce Hunt, but he was trying hard.

‚ÄúWhat is he thinking?‚Äù",1646092883

"teachinginjapan","t5_3c154","I don't think many ALTs really understand how dispatch companies work. That seems to be a failing of training procedures, but I suppose when you're just trying to pump out people who can adequately teach using MEXT principles, it's the last thing you remember to talk about.

Dispatch companies work the way third-party agencies do in terms of contracts. You can only get paid if you have clients willing to pay, and your employees are your own, not the BOEs. If you lose a BOE, you have a surplus of employees with no placement. If there is another BOE spot that's open in a different location, the dispatch company can guarantee employment if you don't mind moving. It's in their best interest to keep all their employees, since they've spent so much time training them. 

However, if people DON'T want move, then that makes it more difficult because a dispatch company doesn't have an opening in that area. It sounds like this particular branch is trying to advise their employees who don't want to move as best they can - between complete unemployment (and for some of those, that means not having a visa) and having to go to their competitors, they would advise the lesser evil, even though it means taking a hit. Likely, they are thinking towards next year (or whenever Kawasaki's contract with Heart ends). If they win back the contract, and the conditions are more favorable, they will likely hire their same people if they are still in the area with better salaries than Heart.

In my opinion, the lack of BOE funding across the board is to blame. Because the clients pockets are fairly shallow, dispatch companies are always undercutting each other in order to win the business, which is AWFUL for ALTs. Fucking hate it. But it's either do that, or not win the business at all (no one gets paid). If there was a way to provide more funding for education at a city level, being an ALT might  be more manageable. But funding also depends on the city mayor and how much they want to allocate taxpayer dollars so...probably just better to not be an ALT long term. Private schools and direct hires pay way better anyway...",1646092885

*Here's a quote from Wikipedia:
&gt; During most of the 20th century, Ukraine was referred to in the English-speaking world as The Ukraine. This is apparently because the word ""ukraina"" means ""borderland"", and so would be translated as if ""the borderlands"" ‚Äî the Ukraine ‚Äî like how Nederlanden, meaning ""low lands"" or ""nether lands"", is translated as ""the Netherlands"".

&gt; The appeal from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published on the Ukrainian presidency&amp;#039;s website early on Sunday, said the Ukrainian armed forces were in the process of setting up a foreign legion unit for international volunteers.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,&amp;quot; the statement said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.""

By your logic, there can never be an end to the masks. Someone could always be unknowingly contagious with *something* and could pass that along to somebody else who might be vulnerable. That is never going to change.

However, the automoderator thinks you're asking a question about the situation between Ukraine and Russia and so has removed it (sorry!). It's natural to have questions about the situation going on right now, like:

* Why is Russia invading Ukraine?

* How is this different from when Russia seized Crimea, or when the US invaded Iraq?

* Couldn't Ukraine just join NATO? Why is NATO doing nothing? 

* Should people in nearby countries like Romania or Poland be scared?

* Is the USA going to join the war? Will there be a draft? 

* Can I join the Ukranian army if I'm not Ukranian?

* Is this all going to lead to nuclear war? Will Putin actually use nukes?

* Why do some people say 'the Ukraine' and others 'Ukraine'? Is it 'Kiev' or 'Kyiv'?

All of these are questions that come to mind easily! *Too* easily. We get each of those multiple times a day, and our users are a little tired of it. So we've created a megathread where you can post your question instead!  **Feel free to post your question in the megathread**!

Why spend $x,xxx,xxx.xx on a heavy, clumsy vehicle that makes itself an opportune target when you can get the same protection/firepower from a light vehicle?

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","I would like to partake in this rather educative conversation. I have at best, moderate historical knowledge and a very poor sense of politics.
Nevertheless I had pondered about a ""bigger scheme"" that Putin had set in motion some time ago and is just now coming to the light of day, since (at least from my perspective and knowledge) this felt too ""sudden"".
 My worries lie not in the scheme it self, but in what the endgame of this whole situation is. Do you believe, for example, that Russia is trying to monopolize natural resources and in doing so forcing nations to come to terms with them, or that Putin himself is a pawn in example to the Chinese. I apology if this comes out as paranoid, but the whole nuclear war concept seems hollow to me, and at the same time I have read many different statistics about how much Ukraine can really offer to a country like Russia even if it came under its wing, furthermore, ""making Russia great again"" seems partially comical to me.

Got someone to take me to the dr (I rarely/never go, except for my annual check-up).

They diagnosed me in about five minutes. Said I was an easy diagnosis.

They knew exactly what to do in order to trigger me into spiraling.

They prescribed me some meclizine, and that was that.

I think I was on it for a month, maybe?

It either helped me get through it, until it went away on its own... or it helped it go away.

I'm not sure. Either way, I was able to 'wean' off of the meclizine, and I only have very minor, low-level tinnitus &amp; BPPV now.",1646092892

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Big question is, even if the launch is ordered, will people really launch it?

Yes. 

The people that are in a position to receive such an order are the most loyal and ~~brainwashed~~ indoctrinated ones you can possibly find. That's the case for the US and you can assume the same for Russia.

And even if someone doesn't follow the order he'll just be executed and replaced delaying the launch by maybe 5 minutes.

&gt; Another big question is, is the Russian nuclear arsenal maintained well enough to actually take off? Chances are it will blow on site.

That's what Western countries would like you to belive and personally I'd love for this to be true but it's almost certainly not the case.

And even if that were to happen its not like Russia just has 1 launch site / warhead.


Additionally dreams like Putin getting assinated by a pissed of oligarch / officer are also extremely unlikely. If we can think of / hope for that happening so can Putin and he'll definitely have a shit ton of countermeasures.",1646092893

However, that should be the end of that segment that you're only allowed to say I love you once and that's when you get to see the person and leave with them.

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","i have the p10 and also an ob6 to compare. There's no way i'd want to play live with a p5/p10. It has a much larger footprint, obviously with one more octave than a p6 but it's just deeper, taller, and heavier. This would be pretty heft if you put it in a traveling case. 

Other reasons why I wouldn't gig with it: 1) there is no octave up/down button on it, so you're burdened with a much slower method of twisting both OSC knobs to get to change octaves. Fine for the studio but less than ideal overall. 2) I don't what causes this, but i find myself needing to tune the P10 way more frequently than the ob6. Not a huge deal since you just press one button and it runs its course, but I feel like you'd really have to make sure the instrument has enough time powered up on the stage before the gig starts to really warm up and settle in. 3) Lastly, the tuning button is in a very precarious position that is VERY easy to hit accidentally, and it immediately goes into the self-tuning sequence. This means that for about the next minute or so you won't be able to play the instrument at all and there's no way to turn the sequence off. So just imagine tapping that button mid-song.

On the flipside, I have a rev2 keyboard and use it live, I think it's great as a stage instrument. Having an OLED screen with the ability to give your presets a meaningful name is really useful on stage. And the mod matrix allows you to do a hell of a lot of performative effects with the mod wheel that you can't do on the more vintage-inspired synths. 

These are my two cents as a guy who gigs a couple times a year and doesn't have roadies. If I was in a touring band like WOD and I had 12 keyboards at my disposal than sure.. the p5 could have a place on stage :)",1646092894

"uklaw","t5_2qonh","There are a few different possibilities.

First, an organisation like this would be the perfect spot for someone who likes lawyering and wants to do it at a senior level but isn't that keen on BD and definitely does not want to deal with the admin, management and tax headaches of partnership, or the crazy slog it takes to get there.

There are lots of these people, some of them are among the brightest I've worked with. For all the bullshit every firm puts out, there is rarely a long-term sustainable spot for them in a partnership firm. If they're lucky they'll be kept on as a niche subject specialist on something like sanctions.  But they will not be running deals or leading litigation. The partners need to maintain their face-time with the clients, and the ambitious young associates climbing the greasy pole need exposure to the best work.

In a non-partnership firm, these types can merrily carry on with their legal careers, being paid well but not at the level of partners elsewhere, and they're content. These people are the engine room of listed firm profitability.

Secondly, it's not necessarily true that a listed firm will be distributing less in the way of profits to its senior staff than a partnership will. Often the investment case is more about growth than it is about present cashflow. And the growth in these firms belongs 100% to the shareholders; they don't have to buy retiring partners out of the equity (which often inflates significantly in value between when a partner buys in and when they cash out). So if the firm is growing, they can continue to pay their ""partners"" as if they were a traditional partnership, and the investors still make money by capital appreciation.

Thirdly, a firm that is listing is effectively betting that by changing its capital structure it can improve its profitability generally. Just by way of an example, a listed law business is likely to have better access to cheap debt than a partnership, to finance its working capital (i.e. WIP and A/R). They can also use this access to cheaper equity/debt financing to spend on capital investments that will grow the pie. At that point, the overall firm is making more money - so it can afford to pay the ""partners"" just as much as they were taking home before, and leave profits left over.

Finally, look outside our industry. People called the end of an era when Goldman Sachs (and all the other merchant banks) moved from an equity partnership to a listed bank, and said that the best talent would never stay. What's happened is that they have become massively more profitable because of their ability to scale. They (and other IBs) have also shown that investors will accept enormous staff compensation bills relative to revenue (if grudgingly), in the interests of maintaining the firm's position. The banks have shown that we can basically run exactly the model we have today, but allow institutional investors to provide all the capital and carry all of the insolvency risk.

I'm not saying listing is a Good Thing. Honestly I'd probably want out of MdR. But, much like ABS, Direct Access and Higher Rights, it's not going to be the end of the world - and people who figure out how to make it work well are going to get very rich while the rest of the industry slowly ploughs on as before.",1646092896

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.  This post we didn't see your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification

When I was growing up we all knew right from wrong... Well when I was growing up we were told what was right and wrong. You were ashamed of doing wrong, and if you weren't ashamed you still refrain from doing wrong because you were afraid of the repercussions. Because there were repercussions.

"whatsthisbird","t5_2tb3z","If I misspoke by saying that they can aspirate on their own, then I apologize. But I still fully and 100% stand by my original comment which you responded to which said exactly ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give stressed, captured, injured, or sick birds water. Just take them to a wildlife rehabber.‚Äù I was extremely respectful with my advice to OP, which again you decided to respond to with very unhelpful advice. For the 5th time: please encourage people to take animals to rehabber a immediately. I am shocked that as someone who claims to do bird rehabilitation you would have anything wrong with my original comment. 

I am tired of people thinking that they‚Äôre ‚Äúhelping‚Äù when they‚Äôre actually killing animals. That‚Äôs not jaded, that‚Äôs realistic. I will (again) repeat what I said: we have had people call in and say that they ‚Äúoffered‚Äù the bird water. We say not to force water on them, and not to feed them at all. Then they come in or call later saying the bird died, because they did the exact opposite of what we said and they tried to force water on the bird because ‚Äúit looked dehydrated.‚Äù Frankly, the people who use google instead of professionals and end up killing animals by feeding them a bunch of crap or forcing water are idiots. I‚Äôm sorry that you think that‚Äôs too harsh, but it‚Äôs quite literally a very selfish and stupid thing to do. These are the same kind of people who want a wild animal to be their pet to cuddle and care for. 

Telling people they can give water to birds (often birds that they‚Äôve kidnapped) is horrible advice. The only advice that guarantees the best care is that they should IMMEDIATELY take the bird to a licensed rehabber. When you give people any instructions on how to care for an injured or sick animal, they will take it into their own hands and attempt to do it themselves. If you‚Äôre so experienced, I am absolutely sure that you have seen this first hand. I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with giving the advice to not give birds water, just take them to a rehabber (which again, is literally what I said that you responded to).

It's a mid-to-upper class young American guy, who doesn't even have a fully-formed pre-frontal cortex yet, not dealing very well. I am over the romanticising of escaping into nature to find yourself, but in terms of the actual person who's behind this story, he didn't have the resources he needed from society or his family.

&gt; The appeal from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published on the Ukrainian presidency&amp;#039;s website early on Sunday, said the Ukrainian armed forces were in the process of setting up a foreign legion unit for international volunteers.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,&amp;quot; the statement said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.""

It‚Äôs possible I would have had this issue with just a mastectomy as well, but I suspect it was worse because of the lymphedenectomy. I was barely able to lift my arm up at all afterward, and the armpit incision and missing tissue looked more jarring to me than the breast incision and tissue removal. It‚Äôs less jarring now, and I believe that when my tissue expander is exchanged for an implant that hangs more naturally, my armpit will look almost normal. 

However it‚Äôs not even 3 weeks past my surgery I have about 75% of my range of motion back in that arm, and it gets better every day as I continue doing my assigned exercises. 

So far, the hardest parts of treatment were (1) initial diagnosis panic mode, (2) surgical pathology tailspinning, (3) chemo loading dose. The mastectomy and lymphadenectomy don‚Äôt even rank in my worst 3 treatment experiences. The allergic reaction to surgical draping adhesive, and the drain dressing/stitches irritating my skin and tugging at my flesh were annoying.

But overall? If you can do a trick on hard wheels, you'll be able to do it on soft wheels, at worst it's a small adjustment.

I agree that we should spend more on defense - and be more appreciative of the USA - but also please stop blaming your lack of universal healthcare on lack of defense spending in Eastern Europe (with economies that barely registers on the scale of the USA). Lack of political will is the reason.

There are also other factors to consider in regards to the USA defense spending, like your ability to project power abroad and the fact that much of that money is reinvested in your economy through all defense contractors and being one of the largest employers in the world etc. Then consider that Europe buy lots of US equipment, which further benefits you.

""She would yell at me for small things"" so she tried to communicate with him in an ineffective way. Okay so she could communicate a little better assuming she didn't try to in the first place.

""She would actively ask for kisses, hugs, sex, and tell me she loves me"" so before she tried to ""communicate"" with him she did these things. But after she ""yelled"" at him for ""small"" things she seemingly stops being so loving....hmmm....don't think so. 

You and OP can pretend there isn't a communication issue and act like it's suddenly only about sex and intimacy but we all know that's likely not the case.

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Need Proctored PSI EXAM help.

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

Your phone should be a good backup camera device.  That 35mm f/1.8 I hear is a good normal lens for DX Nikons, but you might be lacking for wide angle and telephoto.

"RealTesla","t5_3mgxy","&gt; How exactly is saying you've made 1 million cells lining up perfectly with the leaked document saying they made 6250 cells that day

Well, we know their first entire year was beset with all kinds of technical problems and their yields were very low. And we can _assume_ that as production lines came up they increased production over time. Each line adding 1/n to production.

So, either they increased production over a year and arrived at 6k cells recently, OR they did absolutely no production at all, ran the line at full tilt for 160 days and came out with the 6k cells. Which of those seems more likely to you?

The rest of your questions are nonsense, unfortunately. So I'm not really going to spend any time answering them. Suffice it to say that they aren't producing mixed chemistries on these lines, and it's unliekly they're producing any exotic chemistries at all anywhere.

Also, my production numbers have been generous to Tesla because they presume 52 week runs and we know that isn't reality.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt;Does that mean I‚Äôm a bad person?

No, that would be a ridiculous thing to jump to.  Sports is just entertainment, there's really no actual morality to toss around one way or another.  

&gt;is this really that weird in the sports world?

It's not weird, in that it's not uncommon at all.  It's especially part of the whole sports machine, and part of the industry of generating clicks that is modern sports journalism.

But being common doesn't mean it isn't unhealthy.  If you step back and look at the sentence, ""Hey, I get immense pleasure out of wishing and rooting for others to suffer, is that bad?""  Yeah, it is.  Not bad morally, but probably bad for you in a health sense.

It's even weirder, and definitely unhealthy when you stray into ""And also if that person or team does well, *that* causes *me* to suffer and be unhappy.""  That's not a good place to be.  Nobody should just be willing themselves to suffer just because their secret dislikes aren't coming true.

"euphoria","t5_2ssjq","Character development doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they need to change or show something new. I‚Äôll reference Breaking Bad, one of the shows that is known for having the greatest character development. Walter White is shown early on to feel a sense of inadequacy and is a prideful person. This does not change at all throughout the 5 seasons, but rather gets worse and worse, until it leads to his family alienating him and his eventual downfall.

Cassie has daddy issues and needs male attention, shown in Season 1 with McKay and Daniel. She tells McKay in the S2 premiere that she‚Äôs not a good person, and you see the extent of that this season. She betrays her best friend, shits on Rue when she exposes her, moves out of home, and crashes her sisters play. You knew she had these issues, this season shows you how bad these issues actually are.

Jules got plenty of development during her special between S1 and S2. Yes, she took a backseat this season, but if this is a character driven show, people will come in and out of your life all the time, that‚Äôs how life works. Jules will most likely be more present and the show will highlight a new dynamic between Rue and Jules after Rue doesn‚Äôt use Jules as a crutch for staying clean.

Of course, I‚Äôm not defending the writing and saying it was a perfect season, but I just don‚Äôt think a lot of the complaints are as bad as people make it out to be. I think once the show finishes it‚Äôs last season and we can review it holistically, it will be a pretty damn good show.",1646092905

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Why are you putting your brother feeling bad over the fact that he's made you and your parents all feel bad? You should tell him he needs to be an adult and handle this himself so that you and your parents can enjoy something that is really important to you and that you don't get any do-overs on.

My ex used to do this same thing to me all the time. He'd get into arguments or do something to inevitably draw all the attention away from whoever had the attention over himself right before important things. I used to think there was no way it was on purpose. That it must just be horrible timing and he probably feels really bad and I shouldn't make it worse. 

I know different now that I'm out of the situation and stopped putting him before myself and others. Now I see that whether he had the thought process of ""I'm going to do A to negatively effect B"" or not, he absolutely got stressed out, or annoyed, or felt ignored, or wanted attention, or whatever it was before big events that fueled him. Then he would drink, or lash out at people, or act irresponsibly in other ways that would inevitably lead to ruining said event or at the very least really souring it. 

Let me tell you from experience, it's probably not going to stop. Your brother is 34 and he's still acting this way. So let me try to put it into perspective for you.
The next big life event after having your baby will likely be your babies first birthday. How's it gonna feel when he ruins that? Trust me when I say it's gonna be a lot easier to say something now, when you are pregnant and the hormones are fuel for honesty, than it will when you are an exhausted mother of a 1 year old trying to make a really special birthday party happen smoothly. 

You don't have to be cruel to him but you should at least be honest with him about how his actions before all the other things he has ruined have effected you. And how important it is to you that he handle this on his own at least for now so that you and your parents don't have to. If he cares even a little bit he can put his drama on hold long enough for you to have a baby and enjoy the moment with your parents. His being fired isn't going to change at all but your happiness and stress level absolutely will.",1646092905

The KKK assaults Black people for existing as Black and no other reason and 100% started the fight. 

African-Americans didn't do any retaliation iirc, and if they did I don't know of anything that *killed anybody*. 

Neither of these groups are governments or uniformed military.

People remaining neutral in this instance are usually Americans. Americans have a say and an impact on American issues because they **live there** and can vote in American Politics.

Meanwhile- 

No one can agree on if Israel or Palestine started the fight. 

Israel and Palestine's governments both have citizen's blood on their hands.

These are Governments. Not groups of citizens. Doesn't make it okay for doing what they do, but when you punish a government you punish citizens who can be innocent. You can punish individuals and small groups for crimes of individuals and small groups

With all that being said, it hampers my workflow when all of the effects I apply on the grooveboxes don't carry over to Ableton via Overbridge. I would prefer to keep what I have on the Digitakt fully intact and record directly into Ableton; albeit with more effects than the DT offers. 

Would a good alternative be to get a really powerful effects box to pair with the Digitakt so I can achieve the sound I want before recording into Ableton? I was thinking **Microcosm, Beebo or Zoia**. Record that directly into Ableton and just use Ableton for more layering with plugins and samples if necessary.

My husband lately has been working nonstop. Every single day over 12 hours everyday. Everyday he comes home, eats dinner and sleeps on couch because he says he's to exhausted to come to bed. I have asked him constantly to come upstairs with me in different ways. Even asked him to maybe go upstairs after eating so like that if he passes out, he's already in bed. But yesterday when I woke him up to come to bed he called me selfish and started arguing with me.
I feel so lonely all the time and just want to feel some sort of affection. 
For better understanding. I also work full time but from home so I get very minimal human  interaction. I suffer from depression and PTSD from my time in the military but for the last 4 years have put my own self care aside to help him with his severe depression after his business didn't take off. That was 3 years of me putting everything  aside for him (he wasn't working or doing or helping around the house). Now I feel like my mental health is extremely fragil and I need his support but he now is working all the time at this job I actually applied for him and he won't support me even in this most minimal action of sleeping in the same bed. Also, we don't need the income, so its not like he's working all this time because he has to. He chooses to and it feels like neglect. He acts like I'm being selfish and calls me toxic because I ask for more time or wake him up to come upstairs. I get he is tired and he found purpose with his new job but I feel like I should matter too. I mean, thats how I felt when it was the other way around. Am I wrong?

&gt; The appeal from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published on the Ukrainian presidency&amp;#039;s website early on Sunday, said the Ukrainian armed forces were in the process of setting up a foreign legion unit for international volunteers.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,&amp;quot; the statement said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.""

"Arifureta","t5_3et5p","First off, Yue doesn‚Äôt have transmutation, so she can‚Äôt freely manipulate minerals like Hajime can. She could have maybe broken out through sheer strength and body reinforcement, but sealstone (the material the cube was made of) is both very strong, weakens magic, and she ain‚Äôt that strong at body reinforcing anyways. It‚Äôs like the one area of magic she isn‚Äôt an expert in, it‚Äôs literally a last resort for her. The longer she‚Äôs trapped, the harder it becomes due to her weakening body.

Second, it‚Äôs not the same principle as what sealed Yue. Yue was sealed by her uncle. While he was a genius in his own right, he was nowhere near Yue in his time, who was nowhere near the Liberators in terms of expertise and strength. If the Liberators wanted to set rules, it‚Äôd take EOS Hajime to break them, and even then he needs time to figure it out.

As for what actually causes the phenomenon where Hajime couldn‚Äôt transmute a path up, I would assume Soul Magic. Oscar probably ‚Äúkeyed‚Äù a layer of rock to only respond to his transmutation, so nobody else could manipulate it like he could.",1646092909

"consulting","t5_2r121","Here's a little psychology trick. Successful people aren't confident because they are successful - they are successful because they are confident. Humans have a tendency to gravitate towards and favor those who are confident, even if they are sprouting bullshit.

So what can you do? Go to the gym, eat healthily, start using skincare, learn how to dress (you don't need expensive clothes, just acquired taste), take acting class, learn and practice public speaking, and make sure you get enough sleep. These may sound super unrelated to the work, but they go a long way, especially in client-facing roles like consulting. Give it a serious effort and I promise that you will see yourself transform.

Now on the master's. No one can decide for you, but if you're feeling insecure and worried to the point that it will distract you from your studies, ECs, and job-hunting - why not wait a year? If you managed to get in now, I can't see why you wouldn't be able to in a year. Heck, ask the school to defer your admission. In the mean time you can work on your self esteem and, if you're dead set on consulting, why not apply without doing the master's? It doesn't have to be MBB right away, but I believe you can at least get a taste of consulting at a T2/B4/boutique. Try before you buy.

Source: I was born with mild autism, super ugly as a child, and bullied to death until middle school. Decided to do something about it in high school (basically did all the above) and semi-bullshitted my way into consulting. I still remember those days of learning skincare and how to wave your hands while giving a presentation. Fun times.",1646092909

You'll need a pot at least twice the volume of your batch size and a brewing bag for that, so it's a pretty cheap way of getting into all grain. Some brewers just stick to brewing with extracts and steeping grains for added flavor and color.

In the event that you decide to stick with extract brewing, temperature control for fermentation would be the logical next step. While bottling can be a pain in the ass, temperature control can do much more to improve your beer no matter which brewing process you choose and whether you bottle of keg.",1646092910

If you're a mason and you're banned from a city, no problem, you can just become a mason elsewhere. If you're a money lender and you're banned, you have no way to recover the money you lent. Jews were very regularly banned and disowned precisely because it's much easier to strip someone of money than of anything else. So they weren't rich or powerful, but were much rather doing one of the more precarious jobs: they could just lose everything at any minute. Because they weren't allowed to carry arms and had to pay more taxes than the others (8x more in the 1700s), they had no way to defend the little wealth they had.

Breakfast: a piece of whole grain toast with about 1tsp natural peanut butter and a piece of fruit or handful of berries

Lunch (usually the smallest meal because I‚Äôm just so busy with baby around this time): 1 light babybel cheese, 8-10 wheat thin crackers, cut veggies (usually bell pepper or carrots), tbsp of hummus

Dinner: usually have chicken so 1 chicken breast with whatever seasoning I have on hand, about 1/3 cup of brown rice with some salt and pepper, and either a green salad with a small amount of homemade vinaigrette, or some roasted brussel sprouts/broccoli.

I‚Äôm not much of a snacker. I do have a cookie now and then when I‚Äôm craving sweet. But all in all I don‚Äôt think I eat too badly. Which is why I‚Äôm so annoyed that I‚Äôm gaining weight!",1646092911

"gambling","t5_2qhuo","Great write up, and I completely agree.  I think most reasonable people already realized what you say is true.  I think perhaps you're harping on the terminology a bit too much.

Slots are of course a zero sum game **for the casino**.  That is, for someone who claims to be an 'advantage slots player' is clearly just farming for some banking credit left by another player.  If I find an Ultimate X machine with a 12x multiplier left by someone, I get that advantage instead of the previous player.  If I find a must-hit-by-$500 machine at $499.50, then I will win that jackpot instead of someone else.

I'd argue that most people who claim to be slot advantage players are those who will only selectively play slots in this state, and would generally agree with your claim.  Those who believe you can time reels or that a jackpot is just due will go over to Roulette later and bet  Martingale and say they have a winning system there also.

*Edit:* It also comes to mind now that I think of it that (Although there is no way to be sure), some people may also include the value of comps, points, and cash back in this value, which would make it still difficult but more likely to hit a theoretical advantage, or perhaps just lower the threshold for an advantage in the above scenarios.  Additionally, casinos are very much more generous with comps towards slot players vs straight up video poker players.",1646092912

So extrapolating that's about 1K vehicles total to make it easy. To reach 4k dead Russians you would only need 4 people to die at a rate of 4 people to every vehicle during a war.

I'm no war expert but I imagine during a war people die at a much greater rate then 4X for every military vehicle destroyed.

My main goal now is to get my last 3 merges on Reginn in June, and I want to have 600+ orbs saved for that. Other *potential* targets for the next few months: spark on AHR, spark on TMS New Heroes (if IS remembers TMS exists), spark on book mid-point (June), spark on July Remix (L!Roy), spark on CYL, and spark on Ash and More rerun (Sept?). I'm glad most of this falls after Reginn's rerun in June so I'll know if I need to save more for her next rerun after June. After finishing Reginn, I'll start saving up to target a Light mythic (probably Ash).

Good luck to everyone saving this week!

"VaushV","t5_10to4u","I mean, i normally aint a fan of vaush much, I sub to him, but only have been watching him more recently due to his excellent ukraine coverage.

The fact is, vaush is divisive among the left, and his ideology is a turnoff to many. 

Like let me describe my politics. 

Socially I'm ""center left"". Im very live and let live and believe people deserve all of the happiness in the world and should be left to their own devices, but honestly, i HATE the woke stuff. Like full stop. it comes off as a cult and it alienates the crap out of me, even if i agree with it at least partially on substance. It's the presentation more than anything. The tribalism, the over the top virtue signalling, the idea that I have to put the concerns of the ""underprivileged"" above my own. Like, I'm not that right wing on most social issues, but i cant in good conscience be left either these days. Vaush is extremely woke and seems to be obsessed with a so called ""nazbol vortex"" from people like me (as in a failure to adopt his politics or put social issues above all else makes me in any way sympathetic with nazis), and it just comes off as obnoxious. Fyi, not being woke doesnt mean i have anything in common with nazis either. Note the whole ""center left libertarian"" orientation. 

On economics, I'm a yang style ""human centered capitalist"" with an anti work streak. I despise the democrats and their neoliberalism, but aint really a fan of literal socialism at all. But vaush basically promotes socialism and has made the same old canned arguments about inflation ive heard a billion times on his channel before. So cringe there too.

And then, despite being this hardcore anarcho communist....he simps for biden and ""blue no matter who"" sentiment. Again, to ""stop the fascists"". And honestly? I'm just a disaffected dem who votes third party. I was bernie or bust in 2016, i repeated the cycle in 2020, i voted green both times, and in 2024 i plan to vote for the forward party. I am NOT a fan blue no matter who sentiment and view it as bullying people in a democratic system to force them to vote for a candidate they otherwise wouldn't. 

Im not here to debate any of these things btw, just explaining my orientation. So you have this extremely woke ""anarcho bidenist"" as he's called and it's just...cringe on so many levels. Like....on social and foreign policy, I'm just a bog standard non woke center lefter. On economic policy I'm this yang style human centered capitalist with an anti work streak. And I'm someone who will vote for third parties and ""throw my vote away"" and have no qualms about it.

So...that said...a lot of vaush's core politics are extremely cringe to me. 

Still....to once again praise him, one issue we can find all the common ground in the world is on ukraine, and i have to say he's giving extremely good coverage on that issue. it's just that in more standard domestic politics, he's literally the ""anti me"" as far as left politics goes. He's moderate where im extreme, and extreme where I'm moderate, and he literally takes the opposite position to me on practically every issue subject to left wing infighting in the past 6 years.",1646092916

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The change in tactics of dropping the bonzai charge and also defending the interior of the island rather than trying to hold the beaches against withering fire from American battleships certainly helped the Peleliu defense, but there was much more to it than that.  The Japanese engineers had time to connect mining tunnels criss-crossing the island, dig out living quarters underground, and fortify gun emplacements at key points.

It took months of planning, moving materials, and construction to create the fortifications at Peleliu.  Were those developments influenced by the failure to retain the outer perimeter in the Pacific?  Perhaps, but I don't think the Japanese needed to lose islands to see the value in fortifying their positions.  It was a lack of time and material that didn't allow them to fortify the outer islands, not ignorance or hubris.",1646092918

She is always critizing her near perfect body. But worse yet, she is always trying to ""help"" my sister and I by suggesting diets or different activities. Instead of just accepting us for who we are. Although its caused major issues for the two of us in terms of our own body image issues, theres a few things I've come to realize about her approach:

Although, it doesn't seem like it, it comes from a place of love. It's very important and brings great joy to her life to be as fit and perfect as she can on the exterior. So she just assumes that its just as important to me and my sister.

At the end of the day, she is truly just projecting her own insecurities onto us as well.

""Mechanically complex"" and ""safe pick"" are not mutually exclusive. I never stated they were either. You can be a KDA player on a difficult champion, and needless to say, you can be a KDA player on an easy champion.

Orianna isn't easy and Azir isn't easy either. Both can be drafted and played in an extremely safe manner. On that same note, I never even criticized Fudge, let alone criticized his champion pool. All I am saying is that he's no less of a KDA player than Bjergsen is, and that is basically unrelated to what specific champions he plays (but it's worth noting that all the niche champions are in the super-safe end of the spectrum).

Welp, that's a hell of an intro. Hana sounds a lot like Satou from Happy Sugar Life in it and thus it surprises me it took me until now to watch this. High school is a little early to be settling do but that could still work. Anyways, we begin with Hana having it bad for her childhood friend/teacher and beginning to realize it won't work out, though her fuming about the other teacher is funny. We get a setting flashback to notice a lot of parents are missing and that little Hana is a savage. 

We see our MCs meet up and begin bonding over their shared doomed crushes. The sex scene is wonderful uncomfortable and rather long, highlighting why if you are having a sexual encounter where disassociation is a feature not a bug you are probably doing it wrong. But Mugi does stop it. They later decide that this arrangement suits them so we get our title drop. 

QotD: 1 I found it engaging and has the same mood as HSL

2) I never said that who was in office is the driving factor or what made Putin wake up on a Thursday and decide to invade Ukraine‚Äôs that‚Äôs you adding underlying context to my comment that never existed then making assumptions off of the context you added‚Ä¶ but when shitty dictators wanna do shitty things, they look at what the repercussions would be. No shitty dictators are scared of Biden, just like they weren‚Äôt scared or worried about Obama.

Math is possibly the dumbest way you could look at this, and is all but meaningless here.

With ICUs treatments happen on a schedule and have to be done within a certain time frame and they often have plans associated with them that tell me exactly who I need to talk to about any issue. On a surgical team each type of surgery has a specific set up and needs. And anesthesia is often the same way: certain protocols work best for certain types of patients. 

Currently, I teach at a vet tech program and that is definitely much more my speed. My coworkers call me overly prepared. I'm a knowledge junkie and I keep too much of it in my brain which helps with this job.

Cutting Zeke this year either ADDS $11.86 million to our salary cap this year beyond his current $18.22 million cap hit or adds nothing to this year (but also provides no savings) and tacks on $11.86 million in dead money into next year.


&gt; I get the money will be huge if he is somehow cut but the truth is, running Zeke and watching him struggle to get 2-3 yards and have no burst any longer is a detriment to the offense

He looked like vintage Zeke for the first month of the season, averaging 5.3 yards per carry prior to the knee injury clearly limiting his effectiveness. If his injury heals this offseason, it‚Äôs fair to assume we‚Äôll be looking at a more effective Zeke again in 2022.",1646092920

But Putin let his kgb brain view the world from a conspiratorial way. Seems that's still at play now. So we had two years of reaching out is the closest Dems have been with them in 30 years.

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","Yeah the balance seems really off on some of them. Pebble was MVP for a long while.

I swapped pebble for the swift shard, comparable damage less FP and way faster to cast. Good for clearing trash or on hectic bosses.

My main strat though is just rock sling because it hits hard and can stun like heavy attacks.

Ambush shard is really useful against shielded guys or from behind cover. FP expensive and cheesy but effective when you're hiding around a corner and get the kill.

Magic Glintblade seems quite strong but risky with the cast delay but haven't used it much yet.

Blade has some use too if you want to get close. It stunlocked the roundtable guy for me. Probably missed some other good ones.",1646092921

"itookapicture","t5_2r1tc","Hi /u/2after20. After moderator review, your submission has been removed due to a violation of *Rule 4*:

Your photograph should demonstrate an effort to teach/learn **technique** or **artistic style**, or be shared as an example of **quality photography**.

&gt; 4a. **Submitters must participate in the discussion.** Whether it's a photographer asking the community at large what they could have done better, or users asking how to achieve a look or effect, posters are expected to contribute to the comments section and keep the discussion on-topic.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 4b. **No snapshots.** Your photo should be well-composed, have an obvious subject, feature good use of color/tone and/or texture, have interesting lighting, and make purposeful use of depth of field.

Photos that often break this rule include (but are not limited to): photos out of airplane or car windows, subjects with sentimental value to the photographer, and other ""look at this thing I saw""-style photos, or if there was no attention paid to leveling the horizon, framing/cropping, or focus.

If you plan on reaching out to the moderators with questions, you must include a link to the post you're referencing, the rule it was removed under, and the reason(s) you feel the rule doesn't apply to your submission. Due to the large number of messages the moderators receive, they will not be able to help you without that information. More details available at [our rules FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/wiki/rulesfaq).

"AskMenOver30","t5_2y9pw","Your situation is complex and wide ranging. I suggest making an outline that covers the myriad factors affecting your dilemma. It should include notes about what you like/dislike about the various options you are considering, and should also include any insights gained from your previous work experiences.  Having all of the factors laid out in front of you in a condensed outline format will help you make a more informed decision going forward by hopefully preventing you from leaving any important elements out of your considerations.

Regarding anxiety, it can be mitigated significantly using techniques that have proven successful for a majority of people who commit to them. These involve directing your thoughts while controlling your breathing. Breathing retraining exercise helps to rebalance the oxygen and CO2 levels in the blood. That along with increased exercise can have tremendous effects in reducing anxiety levels overall.

Loss of confidence can be altered by becoming a keen and consistent observer of your mindset. Recognize that 'you' are not your thoughts, but you are affected by them. Your own mind can sabotage your potential by influencing your sense of self with feelings of doubt. Recognizing the foreign nature of these thoughts can help prevent you from being fucked over by them, because they are not you. A mindset that heavily incorporates a sense of appreciation at the options available to you can help liberate you from fear and open your awareness to the near limitless opportunities that await a person in your financially healthy situation with the education and will power you clearly possess.",1646092921

"KanojoOkarishimasu","t5_izi65","Ruka will tell you what she likes, what she doesn't. Sumi won't, and is apt to be a walked over. Chizuru won't, and is apt to run away.

At least with Ruka, there is communication. If things are going poorly, she'll let you know. Sumi will stew over it, and Chizuru will slug you or give you the cold shoulder.

I'm not saying that I think  relationship between Kazuya and Ruka would last. I think it would run its course. But Kazuya would be a better man for having been in it. He'd understand what a relationship requires, he'd benefit from receiving actual affection (without a price tag), he'd begin to learn what he'd want in a potential wife, and if he dropped this fantasy about Chizuru, he may even understand how transactional love is corrosive.",1646092922

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","There's a lot of content and fun in TWW but the learning phase can suck. If you are willing to go through it, I really recommend the game. It's worth it.

As for which one, TWW3 has the best tutorial, but it is pricier. You can get it through the gamepass, though. However, it is important to note that players who have all 3 games in the same store will get access to a campaign combining all 3 games . At the moment, it is not possible to get TWW1 and 2 on game pass which means that, if you want to eventually play it, you have to get it somewhere else. I still recommend to get it on gamepass as a non commital way to try the game.

For TWW2, it is more polished atm, but it won't get any updates in the future. Also, because of all DLCs and free DLCs (called FLC) TWW2 has more content for now, but expect it to change. This one is on sale frequently.

Overall, I'd recommend TWW3 because  it is more beginner friendly and that, with gamepass, it is easy to try the game before investing in it. At the end of the day, if you like the game, I'd recommend to eventually grab TWW1, 2 and 3 on the same store. The combined campaign you'll have access is definitively the high point of the series

Edit: Take TWW1 only to play on a combined map. In itself, the game feels a bit lackluster compared to the other",1646092922

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","Best practice is to always match Voltage EXACTLY. And amps equal or higher. Wattage will be a function of those two, so not important. And same polarity and connector head. 

And undervolting is usually better than overvolting. But either can cause issues long term, as the power board on your system has to work that much harder due to mismatched voltage.

Having said that, some people have used mismatched adapters for years without issue, and others develop problems shortly after. Some systems are less robust than others. Even if it seems to work, it might be shortening the life of your electronics.

I'd just match the Voltage exactly, and amps equal or higher personally for best solution.",1646092923

"Mistborn","t5_2s9ue","Sure, same time as the 3rd book, so everyone reading in publication order read Era 2 first which is normally a good indicator of what the author intended. And if you look at the official announcement on the day the 2 books were released we get:

&gt;What is Secret History about? I'll just let Brandon say, as he said on Reddit:
3) It is a companion story to the original Mistborn trilogy, and is **intended to be read after Bands of Mourning**

and then

&gt;I'm going to say this a bit more forcefully than Brandon, but: **do not read Mistborn: Secret History until you have read Bands.** The preface of Secret History will make this clear...

so I'd argue it's pretty clear what order Sanderson intended them to be read in at least, and not sure why any fan of Sanderson's would ignore his opinion in favor of random internet people's opinion on ideal order.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I can understand that mentality. You can feel like a grifter or a cheat when you do that, because we're taught not to overvalue ourselves.... but here's a secret-- we live in a society that arbitrarily assigns value to different professions based on scarcity. There was a time when I turned tools and did field repairs on machines in box plants. If you've ever eaten out of a pizza box, there's a very real chance that I set foot in the facility that produced them to install, repair, or upgrade a piece of equipment. I worked 60-70 hours a week for a salary, worked my ass off, barely had any free time.... and made a third of what I make now as a web developer. I sit on my ass all day and basically just google ""how did some other bastard do this, and how much of their work can I copy paste to do my job?"" Whoever took over my old job works *way the hell* harder than I do now, and if they're lucky, they earn $70K after raises and inflation. It's stunningly shit work, and the pay doesn't reflect it.  


Pay only reflects how valuable someone who will do the job is to the company. It doesn't reflect your worth as a human, but as a service. And rest assured-- they're going to get that value and more out of you as a worker. Your salary is at *most* 1/3 of what they're generating off of you.

They can be problematic at times and have their own flaws but 1) I grew up with them and their films so there‚Äôs a nostalgic attachment there and 2) If you look close enough you can see why they do what they do. These girls are girls with no true support, or atleast started out that way. And in this industry you have to either survive and step on others or then be nice and perish. These girls chose to survive and while they had to make choices that can be questionable and often mean to others, it‚Äôs not as much of a choice as you‚Äôd assume. Katrina was always put down for not having acting talent. Her relationships and exes have been quite ruthless towards her and her romantic history clearly left her broken again and again. She became cold and distant publically too. Many didn‚Äôt like it but it made sense. She built a barrier to protect herself. And made connections with anyone and everyone to keep her position in the industry despite everyone saying she‚Äôs nothing more than a glorified item girl. Deepika has no true ally. People couldn‚Äôt care if she fell. Other girls have been snarky towards her and many have openly showed their distaste for her. People in the industry have camps, Deepika isn‚Äôt truly part of any of them. If you think Karan Johar is her friend think again. He doesn‚Äôt care for her. She had to claw her way to the top and while that meant putting down others, it was the only choice that would also allow her to survive. The industry from the get go claimed her to be the girl that would vanish and Sonam would be the A-lister. So DP took in her own hands to change a fate the industry was so adamant a to force her into. Sonam still salty about it. DP relies on the one person she knows she can, herself. Priyanka had to climb and duck to whatever suited her. The princess Kareena would be mad if anyone else would breathe. So Priyanka made friends and ditched friends to suit her. She was ambitious and smart in her connections, her work and her talent. When the industry started turning against she built a base abroad. She kept her foundation strong regardless and made sure she was undeniable. She did whatever tactics worked to keep her in the news. To keep her films working. And love her and hate her for her antics, but she does what she needs to do to keep it going. These girls didn‚Äôt get shit handed on a platter, so they had to build it brick by brick.",1646092926

(sorry for the broken english african kiswahili is first language for me) I (16 female) and my maths professor (23 male) were both aware of my god-awful shitty grades in his class. It was second quarter of the year. I was tired of it. I got home from school and saw 12 text notification from my phone. I thought ""my god is this mother?"" I open it and it's texts from Dr. Carells. I stand back just in pure awe but look at them anyway. Long story short it was a lot of talking about his disappointment in my report card but how he could raise my grades. I decide to come over. I walk in and I grab notebook and pencil. He ask me ""What is that for Czarina?"" ""The tutor session, you're going to tutor if I'm correct uncle. Right?"" He respond sounding horny  ""Something like that..."" He then grab my shirt, rip it open and from there on out you can image it. I did not know what professor had actually wanted to do thinking it was an actual tutor session. Not that had not have the talk already, I just thought that was inappropriate to think of when grades were on my mind. I then heard a nasty rumor going around about it. I did sleep with him but not willingly. I was shocked to find out it was Dr. Carells himself who started the rumor. People call me nasty names from then like ""slut"" ""whore"" ""cheater"" among others. The principal found out and didn't do anything to Dr. Carells but threaten to penalize me instead. This made no sense. I ended up leaving next week and had a girl post nasty stuff about me on her facebook to hers friends but it had not matter anymore. What do you think. AITA

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Yes, I and others from our group have contacted the other guy and he won't respond to any of us. That's what makes me suspicious.

The contents of the bag wasn't anything too valuable. I had a beard trimmer, which was most likely the most valuable thing in the bag, a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, deodorant, melatonin, benadryl, chapstick, gum, a brush, a phone charger, and a water bottle.

I don't know any other people the home owner knows, but there was no one else in the house from our group that has initials similar to mine. It's possible he knows someone with the same initials as mine, but for him to assume it belonged to someone else he knows besides me, the one person in our group with those initials that was staying as a guest in his house that would obviously have travel bags, is highly unlikely in my opinion.

"futebol","t5_2tfgu","Acho que sim, tem muito mas muito mais caso de doping no futebol comparado com o que √© divulgado. Isso que a gente precisa lembrar que cada campeonato individual tamb√©m tem os seus h√°bitos de test anti-doping.

A BBC fez um documentario interessante sobre doping, ou os testes anti-doping, no futebol ingles muitos anos atr√°s. Citaram casos em que jogadores de outros esportes, tipo Rugby, foram banidos por mais tempo que jogadores de futebol para ter violado as mesmas regras. O que eu achei mais interessante foi quando um ex-jogador irland√™s, ningu√©m famoso, ofereceu dar opini√£o dele sobre o assunto. Na epoca em que ele jogava no Championship, depois que um clube comprou ele por alguns milh√µes, o mesmo clube, durante meses, dava p√≠lulas para ele tomar. Ele n√£o perguntou o que era e nem falaram para ele mas era justamente naquela epoca que ele atingiu o pico dele, pelo menos estatisticamente. Ele falou que apesar de que ele n√£o pode afirmar se ele estava dopando ou n√£o, em nenhum momento naquela epoca ele foi testado.

Isso que eu ja conheci pessoas que trabalham como seguran√ßa para certos clubes e ja falaram para mim que certos jogadores tomam droga mas conseguem evitar os testes.",1646092928

"euphoria","t5_2ssjq","The Play wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwatching season 1 over again‚Äù that is simply factually untrue as the events of the play take place before s1. It‚Äôs a prequel. 
Liking the play or not is subjective but I would disagree that it didn‚Äôt push the story in meaningful new directions. The play was central to pretty much every character. The bonding between Lexi and Fez talking about the play. Fez getting ready for the play before getting shot. The play put Rues trauma in perspective for her allowing her to see her life play out in front of her to face it without the lense of her own bias and drug fog. I would imagine it was quite therapeutic for her which she seems to elude that it was in her conversation with Lexi after the play. The play was Cassie‚Äôs breaking point to erupt and spiral down to rock bottom, a catalyst for her s3 arc of either doubling down on being a villain or finding a way to redeem herself and mend her relationships with her family and friends, as well as the opportunity for the Nate/Maddie/Cassie drama to climax and resolve. The play was Lexis method of taking more agency and asserting her place in the story rather than accepting her role as a ‚Äúside kick‚Äù. 
The show could have done several other things to play out all of these stories without the play, but the play provided a connective tissue for all of them.",1646092929

This wasn‚Äôt even a fancy crazy expensive private school, tuition was like $1k/year.

We're 4 women whp live together me, 21, A21, B21 and C20. A and B are both in relationships. We were all friends vefore we moved in together. A har her boyfriend over most weekends and usually goes out etc. B, has her partner over EVERY night and every day for lunch. 

It's come to point where C and I might come home from the gym and can't shower because B's partner is there. Or we'll watch a movie at night and B's partner will come in and make food at around 23.

B keeps complaining that she feels left out, because most afternoons A, C and I will play a board game amd she'll always watch and flail hr arms and we'll invite her and she'll go ""Oh my partner is coming over, I can't"" we'll invite her and her patner to play but her partner has a low social battery which is fine. However we constantly invite B to do stuff and she says no,  which is fine BUT it's super annoying  when B feels sad because she feels left out even though we invite her to everything. 

B and her partner also ALWAYS leave the stove dirty, leave the oven dirty, leave dishes and forget them. C is uncomfortable with bare feet and Bs' partner always walks around barefoot. They also always leave the toilet seat up, and It's not the rest of us cause we all pee sitting down.... 

They'll also act like they live here and leave food in the fridge, reorganize our fridge (without asking), give unsolicited advice about how A can take care better care of her plants (she knows how to do this) or I can improve my diet (I workout 7+ a week, I need to eat a fair bit...) This comes from someone who essentially eats processesed and/or frozen foods every time I see them, and I don't bring that up to them. 

And they're actually a lovely person, it may sound like I just don't like them, but they're super nice and fun to hang around, but THEY DON'T LIVE HERE. They shower every other night, they cook, etc. Even though utilities won't go up that much I feel like it's weird to stay over every night without asking the 3 other people who live here. It bothers C too, I think A doesn't mind. 

I don't wanna dictate how their relationship works but I signed up to live with 3 other people ( in a small 4 person student flat) not 4. WIBTA If I asked B to have her partner over less? 

I KNOW asking her and her partner to remember their dishes, or to clean the stove or to not leave empty toilet roll lying around etc. Etc. won't help because I've been asking this for months.

Hi /u/tevalentina!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or fully nude, but semi-nude is the minimum. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","Let me tell you at age 52, I am forcing myself to be present for the nasty dental work that needs done owing to my neglect. 

Dental anesthesia does nothing to stop the bone-conducted hearing damage that happens when they grind the majority of a tooth from my head. Tinnitus gets worse every time. So I am losing my hearing but I won‚Äôt starve from not being able to eat, or be killed by a jaw abscess. It‚Äôs a terrible deal except for the alternative. 

I discovered that no adult had ever provided any kind of emotional support around the dentistry experience; that my attempt was the first. I disassociated completely from all of it most of my life and thus never took it seriously. 

It is that adult presence of knowing-of-consequences that needs to live in me daily to overcome the whiny-child-I-don‚Äôt-WANNA energy. 

It‚Äôs no good to frighten or threaten the child; that only results in all the wet hardware capable of this kind of high-level imagining getting embargoed by a twitchy amygdala. 

We gotta love the inner child into cooperating. 

Maybe next time you‚Äôre at the dentist; allow yourself to properly feel the future-you-could-never-imagine before, and embrace the unpleasant reality that is facing you if you don‚Äôt change. 

I mean, what if you live? 

I know about having made myself comfortable with a rapidly approaching death. I know for several years I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be alive a year later. 

Here I am, life persisting in the face of all obstacles, and if I keep this self-care shit up I might have to figure out another 30 years of life. Guess there‚Äôs nothing for it but to start now.",1646092930

Trying to draw analogies from some of the IRL changes from 12 to 18 years is suspect since some of that was a sociological desire to extend the myth of ""happy childhood"", only allowed by increases in productivity and the shift from manual agrarian &amp; artisan trade jobs.  While some research suggests 25 as an average age the brain structures are finally ""thinking like an adult"", averages have the same problems as percentages: it is easy to go astray with statistics.  As well as mental &amp; physical growth do not have to always follow the same curve.

A ""standardized test"" has its own evils of stifling creativity, teaching to the test, bureaucratic belief that only the numbers matter, rules lawyering, ...

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 2000 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 2000 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 1900. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/Sweetkudos/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq.**

Dune could have been a paradise, but then spice was discovered, and no one wanted the desert to go away,"" implying that spice was discovered AFTER they started trying to attempt ecological transformation which was only as far back as Leit's father (as far as I know?) so two generations.

First question - genetics! How were other pregnant folks in your family with nausea, especially your mom? If they had less of a problem, you might, too. My mom never really had it, and those genes helped me skate on morning sickness. 

Second thing - talk to your doctor and tell them how scared you are. Tell them it's a phobia. Ask for medication like Diclegis just to have on hand in case things get rough. I got some and never ended up using it, but it eased my mind knowing I could break that glass in case of emergency.

(My bonus third thing - therapy! I've been doing it for ages. If you don't already have a therapist, one might help you with the phobia. Everyone's mileage will vary.)

Here is what i proposed:

Keen Scout:
- Hitting your enemies with your abilities **marks** them, making them visible thought walls by you and your allies. Marked Enemies killed by either you or your allies give both of you Grenade and Melee energy. 

The idea of this back then was to make top tree Nightstalker more of a trapper (it was called way of the trapper) and a Scout that highlights enemies

Anyway, i hope they will give something more to Nightstalker. It is a really cool class and it's a shame seeing it's potential wasted",1646092934

It's your choice, it's your body.

I would go for a sliding genioplasty, because it's your own bone and you don't have a foreign object in your body.(Titanium plates can be removed after 6 -12 month with SG)

That's a big advantage in my opinion. Also your mindeset about a real bone movement vs. an Implant.

But there are risk with a sliding Genioplasty, like infection, numbness in the chin area(common for a few years), slightly lower lip ptosis (lower lip sits a bit lower and you show more lower teeth show)
But this can happen with an implant as well.


So in the end it's your choice.",1646092934

"taiwan","t5_2qhrg","Obviously, the CCP leadership will be studying the Ukraine situation and Western response with great interest, as they want to know the likely parameters of foreign response to CCP military action, so they can build into their wargaming scenarios. Here are my thoughts of the similarities/differences.

* Ukraine shares a land border with NATO, countries, and already actively in a NATO membership action plan.  By contrast, Taiwan is geographically and diplomatically isolated with no precursors to a military alliance.  Furthermore, there is no multi-national NATOtype of military alliance in East Asia, only the bilateral military alliances (e.g. US-Korea, US-Japan)
* The Western powers cut Russia off SWIFT, as was to be expected, as well as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies.  What was not expected is the sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, which threatens Russia's entire foreign reserve backing (which is why the ruble is collapsing).
* The EU and NATO powers are actively and publicly moving large amounts of military hardware to Ukraine (anti-air, anti-tank, even jets), showing they are wiling to risk a wider confrontation with Russia.  It seems unlikely Korea or Japan would do the same for Taiwan, and Australia too far to provide immediate deliveries of weapons, with US only likely candidate.  But it is important to note that most of the Western weapons put into action have come from the smaller EU/NATO countries (Poland, UK, Latvia).
* The success of the Ukrainian information warfare (what Taiwan calls ""cognitive warfare"") was remarkable in completely turning around Western support for them.  On Day 1 of the invasion, it appeared that Ukraine would be abandoned by the core NATO/EU countries like Germany, but by day 4, everything had changed.

There will be lessons learned from this war, but my opinion is that there are more lessons for Taiwan to learn than for China.   President Tsai seems to understand that the [2021 Taiwan Defense Strategy](https://www.ustaiwandefense.com/tdnswp/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Taiwan-Quadrennial-Defense-Review-QDR.pdf) is deficient, but it remains to be seen if she can make the radical changes in the Ministry of National Defense leadership to bring new thinking and energy into reforming Taiwan's armed forces and military strategy.",1646092934

"vaporents","t5_2upjd","I've had the pleasure of using the regular globe and the defender and if you are looking for physical stability then the globes are your choice just cause all the weight is centered. 

In terms of performance, what you should look for is airflow, size, and type of percolator which all of bubblers are perfect for, but the globes are just a bit better in the airflow category. 

Size matters because the bigger the piece the more surface area the vapor can cling to and that means potential loss of flavor and THC. Airflow matters cause if you cant pull air through then you can't use your vape. Perc matters cause it helps with cooling. 

With all of that in mind, I personally think that the best pipes are 6 inches and below with a showerhead perc and a straight downstem that goes into the body. Which is why I think the [mobius](https://www.dhgate.com/product/new-mobius-matrix-sidecar-glass-bong-birdcage/378001581.html?invitorid=Y3yaeacc&amp;skuid=840696457902059520) is such a popular pick (I just got mine in today actually). However, the beauty of this hobby is that there are so many combinations that you can do and what ***I*** find to be good may not be good for you. 

Experiment and try new things even if they look weird. Worst case scenario is you have to return some items or sell them on /r/EntExchange, but that's just my viewpoint on it. Happy vaping! and I hope you found something that works!",1646092936

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","&gt; I sympathize with them because an individual should be paid based on what their worth.

Too bad the MLBPA didn't believe Ohtani should be paid based on what he was worth. Too bad the MLBPA agreed to a CBA meant to directly undercut his earnings potential the year before he was going to come over. Too bad the MLBPA helped Ohtani get stiffed with a league minimum contract when he was worth millions. Too bad the MLBPA handed the owners a cost-controlled, underpaid asset because they idiotically thought that they could depress the earning potentials of IFAs and funnel the money to their own union members.

Too bad they've also done this with draft bonus caps. Too bad they've never tried to really raise the floor for young players entering the league.

Karma's a real bitch. If you go around making sure everyone else is underpaid, sooner or later you'll make yourself look *overpaid* compared to how underpaid you've made everyone else.

Problem is its a huge difference whether you fight insurgents, or an big organised army. For example many american vehicles are near useless in open conflict.

But in normal wars its more likely to be rpgss, mgs etc. Thus quick light vehicles are better than ones extremely resistant to ieds.

"mealkits","t5_3gmmn","Yeah EveryPlates dishes are definitely not as interesting or flavorful as hellofresh, which is why it's so much cheaper. Every now and again they will have some cool ones (tried thai curry from them before), but usually it's just meat and a side. It's best to just have some seasoning on hand to add to recipes.

"Disneyland","t5_2s0df","My favorite thing about it is how the music matches the ride layout, something that I desperately miss from California Screamin‚Äô,
It‚Äôs a ride that I can‚Äôt miss anytime I go to Disney. I have autism and I am very sensitive to sound &amp; lights, space mountain was major stepping stone for me to get comfortable with other rides at the park, eventually up to Screamin‚Äô. However California Screamin‚Äô/Incredicoaster is too much of a sensory overload for me. I have only been on Screamin 2-5 times, and incredicoaster 5 times, and I am still unsure if I enjoy it or not, usually afterwards I sit down nearby the exit and cry for a minute. I feel like if I never managed to do space mountain, I wouldn‚Äôt have the confidence to do rockin rollercoaster &amp; expedition Everest when I went to Disney world back in 2010 and 2011. I wish I could‚Äôve experienced the rockin versions of both Screamin and space mountain, as I sometimes listen to their soundtracks. On my first trip back after the shutdown Space mountain was the first ride I wanted to do. I have a very strong emotional attachment to space mountain and California Screamin. I used to keep my eyes closed the entire ride since I was too nervous, and the soundtracks were able to help me understand what was going to happen next on the ride, and eventually how the soundtrack correlates to the rides layout. Last month when I went on space mountain the audio cut out after the main drop, and I didn‚Äôt notice until about 2 turns later because I‚Äôm so familiar with the soundtrack and ride.

"dyinglight","t5_2xcav","I‚Äôve written a section on my thoughts of dl2 vs dl1. I honestly think they really downgraded it in most regards, I‚Äôll copy the passage I commented for someone else down below-


Copy:

Nah, the game seems majorly downgraded in some areas and feels so much more generic and ubisofty than the first game because of it. Enjoy it as you want, I certainly did for most of my time played but for a sequel it has so many issues.

Parkour- yes it‚Äôs an improvement, but I‚Äôd say the only unquestionably improved aspect, the rest is debatable.

Combat- mechanically yes it‚Äôs better with the ability to block, but the ragdolling and general feel of it are not as visceral as the first, if an attack was blocked or didn‚Äôt go through a zombie in the first it‚Äôd bounce off them. That isn‚Äôt here in the second which makes it feel much more arcadey. Zombies‚Äôll also just comically go flying if their stamina‚Äôs broken and they get hit with a blunt weapon, it seems intended since there‚Äôs a hint on the losding screen saying that you can break their stamina to ‚Äòsend them flying‚Äô. The comical and arcadey physics really don‚Äôt seem like much of a glitch. And kicking zombies onto spikes doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well as the first.

Map- visually sure (at least until fog covers the entire fucking map) but the first is much better imo, the new size doesn‚Äôt help. There are a lot of similar ctrl c +v buildings and interiors which really blend together, zones of the cities are hard to tell apart from one another. If I showed you a random spot of the map and told you to navigate from there to the bazaar or the ship without map or compass would you be able to? I don‚Äôt think I could easily do it. In dl1 areas were so much more unique to one another and the central base was easily spotted.

Graphics- I‚Äôm on ps5 and tbh it doesn‚Äôt look brilliant graphically, it probably is an improvement but I don‚Äôt really care about graphics anyway at least. But it is hardly comparable to other next gen games which look a fair bit better than this one. Thats mainly thanks to 1080p 60fps at best on console. Can‚Äôt speak for pc but that version sounds like it has its own issues.

Story- fuck no. The characters are all forgettable and unlikable (minor exceptions being the occasional pk soldier who is later forgotten or sacrificed for the plot). Plot points don‚Äôt make sense by the end, our main character has no character or history, his entire character is just ‚Äògotta find mia‚Äô. Waltz‚Äôs final boss is dumb af, and there are pretty much no choices that had any consequences whatsoever. The first was forgettable but still managed to have memorable set pieces (Final tower, volatile nest, museum, school, that first night chase) dl2 really didn‚Äôt have much to compete.

And to the people who say ‚Äòthe first game had a shit story that‚Äôs not why you play it‚Äô. Is the sequel not supposed to improve on the first game‚Äôs failings? They marketed a choices matter story heavy game and failed to deliver, they can absolutely be called out for it.

Fuck there are so many areas I can go into which I think the first game did better,

Zombies (not nearly as many to see and not as memorable as the first game)

Skills (like 5 redundant and pointless skills in the parkour tree, as well as the cut survivor tree.)

Outfit system (I‚Äôm not a fan of the gear aspect and frankly it mostly looks like shit, you either look homeless, like a tourist or like you‚Äôre from cyberpunk)

There are probably more but this is off the top of my head. Stop with the coping ‚Äògames not as bad as you guys say‚Äô posts, burying your head in the positive feedback will not improve the game whatsoever and you only want validation, we want a better game.

Edit:Fuck it I‚Äôm gonna add shit as I remember and just copy paste this on dl1 vs dl2 posts.

Nightime- nowhere near as scary as the first one, stick to the rooftops and you‚Äôre immune to everything, chase system is easy to escape so you have to really go out of your way for a volatile chase. Dl1 didn‚Äôt have enough incentive to go out but this is a big downgrade on the horror side.

Survivor sense- just doesn‚Äôt work half the time. Gets very annoying.

Endgame- shitty fog over the map cause I went for the bad ending after having played the good end. Wasn‚Äôt worth restarting. Not to mention not enough shit to do, just ubsioft style markers all over the map.

Crafting- not good, needing 200 or whatever zombie trophies to upgrade a blueprint is fucking annoying and it‚Äôs thanks to that gear system and the need to upgrade craftables with level. Not fun.

Quarantine zones- the gre labs are copy pasted over n over again, the first game had unique quarantine zones with their own stories to tell. Each one was completely unique.

Someone else summarised it perfectly in another comment.

Nah. Feel, atmosphere, and vibe trumps the sequel. Dl2 feels superficial and disingenuous.

I get ubsioft-like vibes from the sequel whereas the first game has its own identity. It felt like dying light. This one feels like something else trying to be the first with a bigger map.

Free content updates-I have a major bone to pick here, they cut shit from the end of dl1‚Äôs life to add in as future updates. New game + and nightmare should have fucking been in at launch. Just cause it wasn‚Äôt in at launch in the first game doesn‚Äôt make it ok for the sequel to cut it to add in at a later date.

Everyone justifies them cause ‚Äòit‚Äôs free‚Äô but it‚Äôs just cut content‚Ä¶ the faction armour being released in 3 parts across a week is exactly the same and it is absurd. How is faction armour, new game + and nightmare difficulty not in the game at launch. It‚Äôs gonna take months for the game to match the content let alone improve on the first game.

If something was available by the end of the first games life then it should be available at the start of the sequel. Not having ng+ and nightmare difficulty is pathetic.",1646092938

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/BaconBoii427! **You need to read following message in full. We will NOT reply to modmail messages similar to ‚Äúwhat is reason my post was removed?‚Äù** 

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I think you need to start working on yourself. Your wife seems to still love you, because she doesn't want a divorce, but you say that you are depressed and you have no friends in the place that you live. You also seem to not have any hobbies, because she is the one exercising but you aren't. She became friends with the guy and started going running with him; you were not running with her. She seems to be very active and trying to make friends. 

She cannot stay home all day and not have friends, no activities, nothing. 

Yes, she seems to be having an emotional relationship with this guy, but what are you doing for her to stop and start doing that with her? 

&gt;I've never been violent towards her, buy her presents/flowers, do way more than my share of housework etc, have never lied to her. 

This is not enough. Yes, you seem like a good house partner, but you don't seem to share anything outside of house chores and kids anymore.

You should work on yourself. Do therapy alone. Get a hobby. Try volunteering and make friends. Most people in Sweden speak English. Or go to one of the conversation groups for people that want to practice English as a second language. Find a class on something that you like. Maybe once you can talk to your wife about other things and share new things with her, she'll leave this guy behind.",1646092941

Because of this people who want Northern Ireland to be part of the UK (unionists) call it Londonderry while people who want Northern Ireland to be part of Ireland(nationalists) call it Derry. Google ""the troubles Ireland"" to see how contentious that issue is.",1646092942

"tax","t5_2quww","I'm in a no-income-tax state, which simplifies things.

I've verified all my transactions again, and I'm sure this was the only miss. (My 2018-2020 transactions weren't affected by this, but some 2021 transactions are, which is why I caught it now. After this correction, the transactions all line up correctly.) The value is definitely under 10% of my 2017 AGI.

Just so I understand, please let me know if this is right. I basically have two choices now:

1) Amend and file, and pay the $12K-ish in tax on the missed spend. This is the ""right"" thing to do.

2) Don't amend. Ignore the missed transactions. Since the statute on limitations is up, the IRS can no longer audit me for that year or collect the missed taxes. This is the ""less right but still legally correct"" thing to do.

Is that about the size of it?",1646092945

My suggestion if you don't want to fix it yourself to check out [Midwest Camera Repair](http://www.midwestcamera.com/) in Wyandotte, MI. They rebuilt a Nikon lens for me recently. OR look around and get your self a gently used SRT 102. Which had a electronic hot shoe.For old film cameras a Nikon F3 or FM2 is nice. They can use the older AI/AIS lenses which can be reasonable used. Both had motordrive options. The one thing that made the F3 unique was it was the pro camera of the 80s. So it had a removable viewfinder. You could take it off and look down into it, or get a special high eye point finder that was meant for people wearing glasses or helmets.If I ever consider film again, I might try and get 120 roll film camera.Another option is to find a flash bracket. They used to make really powerful flashes that had a bar that attached to the tripod socket. Some companies did make special flash brackets made to raise up the light source. One of those and a PC sync cable would do it.",1646092945

"CTguns","t5_31jg5","Because you are under 21 years of age you are limited to long guns (rifles and shotguns). Worse because you are under 21 you also cannot buy a semiautomatic centerfire rifle with a magazine or that can accept a magazine holding more than 5 rounds from a gun shop/FFL. ([statute link](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_529.htm#sec_29-37a)) You can however currently bypass this restriction by buying one in a private face to face sale.

In order to buy firearms, magazines and ammunition in CT one needs a state issued permit or certificate. Because you are not 21 or older that limits you to the Eligibility Certificate to Purchase Long Guns if you want to buy a long gun. You will have to contact Special Licensing and Firearms Unit at 860-685-8290 for the application package and then fill out the application, take a safety course, get finger printed and pay some fees then wait a few weeks for the application to be approved (or denied).

CT has a rather expansive assault weapons ban that limits the types of firearms one can buy. ([statute link](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_943.htm#sec_53-202a)) CT also has a magazine ban that limits one to 10 rounds or less. ([statute link](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_943.htm#sec_53-202w))

As to type of long gun. Its really a personal preference. Some will start off with a .22 rimfire. Some with a 12 gauge shotgun. Some will go with a bolt action rifle. Best suggestion is to find a friend or family member who has guns and shoot some of theirs, or find a range that rents long guns and rent a few to shoot. Doing so gives you a feel for what type or kind of long gun may work for you.",1646092946

This is a reminder that the ""Question - Unusual Situation / Seeking multiple viewpoints"" flair is not to be used lightly, and that most questions should not be standalone posts. 

We want to foster a sense of community, which is why we have a centralized place (the Daily Threads) for most of our conversations. This allows users to post and get replies, but also encourages them to reply to others in the same thread. We want you to receive help and be there for others at the same time, if possible. Most questions should go there, along with regular updates. Thanks for helping us create a great community!        

Examples of questions that belong in the Daily Threads are questions about changes in your cycle after your loss, and questions about figuring out whether you have ovulated or when you might ovulate.

Posts that do not adhere to our [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/wiki/index) for standalone posts will be removed.  This includes posts where the flair has been changed, but the content has not been updated to fit the flair applied--these will be removed at the Moderators' discretion.

However, we didn't get easily accessible budget enchants for several slots until late into the 100 cap. Sure, other options were available, but they weren't as good and/or weren't as easily accessible. We won't know what the situation is until the new cap drops, so speculation isn't helpful.

With all of this in mind, the decision is ultimately up to you on what to spend your time and money on. For myself, I choose to still play and accrue resources rather than waiting for the new cap.

"ukraine","t5_2qqcn","I'm afraid that pulling back at this point is exceedingly unlikely either. It's obvious that this is largely motivated by control of energy resources and the revenue they provide for the Russian government and individuals within it - at least as far as Crimea and the other two areas with oil.

On the other hand, the push for western Ukraine is beyond just annexation of small valuable territories - the scale of this suggests strongly a genuine push for geographical strategic advantage against the rest of Europe. To Europe this looks like a play for military dominance for future invasions, eventually even giving Russia control of the entire eastern (edit: I meant to say Western) side of the Eurasian continent.

A line was crossed and I believe this will mean attitudes and positions of threatened states will change forever.

Edit to add: this exact move was speculated on and anticipated by involved nations for decades now - it's a continuation of Soviet (and even pre Soviet) geopolitical doctrine in many ways and now it's been actioned",1646092949

Things are about to get nasty like they did in Syria. The SAM issue makes sense, too, but I'm not entirely sure about the pilot argument, or rather, it runs deeper. Why couldn't they get the training/flight hours needed to competently work with ground forces, or make ground attacks? If the answer is money, then that's the bigger issue. If the issue is fuel, then they're incredibly screwed. Even if the issue is maintenance or something, they've got bigger problems than minimally trained pilots. Before, I thought Putin was crazy for doing this with such a shoddy plan and a military that isn't up to contemporary standards. Now, I'm thinking everyone at the table must have lied to him.

Time to scratch another off the P2W. What do I know going in? It's like a drama/'romance' (in the lowercase-r sense) about characters who are together, but don't really like each other (they'd each rather be with someone else). There might be NSFW content, but likely not in a titillating way. It seems to have a reputation as a little 'edgy,' which sometimes I really like (Texhnolyze; Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo) and sometimes find falls flat (Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku; Monogatari). We'll see!

* Ooh, I really like the [shift to the panel](https://i.imgur.com/GdipBo9.png) here. That was a big selling point of Hakumei &amp; Mikochi. It's considered a bit divisive? Sort of a ""lazy"" way to force focus onto the things you want to focus on, or too derivative of manga. But it lets you eat your cake and have it too on deciding between backgrounds and close-ups, and that works for me. 
* Damn, [those eyes](https://i.imgur.com/OIcRXaU.jpg) though. Someone's getting buried in a matchbox.
* We're [committing pretty hard](https://i.imgur.com/MFbsrO9.jpg) to it. The premise is explained; our first point-of-view character, the slightly-creepy Hana gives her take on hopeless love and limerence while smooching a guy she's not into and thinking of her teacher (not sure yet if they're actually related or she's just using the term in the 'child referring to older guy' sense). Having, as they say, a very, *very* normal one. 
* The intro is good, maybe not great. Kind of the everyromance-intro but the characters are all sad and isolated throughout.  
* [The scene](https://i.imgur.com/FCgwB0T.jpg) had me back-and-forth'ing again, but [it looks like they're not related](https://i.imgur.com/EMVJ0nb.jpg), more of a neighbour ~~I guess~~ as her mother says (convenient clarification, thanks writer).  
* ahaaa she [walks into shadow as she thinks it](https://i.imgur.com/a3rCZFA.jpg). What they did there. We see it.  
* [You have a familiar voice](https://i.imgur.com/t72Wlbm.jpg). Allow me to reiterate that twintails is always worst girl while I look up... Oh! Shiori Izawa, aka Nanachi. Hmm then. 
* The [comic-book dots](https://i.imgur.com/r51zXwK.jpg) (is there a name for those?), on the other hand... Well, I see the logic, the character's being Galatea-fied a bit in Hana's eyes, right? She's like a drawing, something impossible and unattainable, that would feel unfair to ""compete"" against (hey, it's the theme from the flashback). But I also just don't much like the look of it.  
* And of course you can also use the panels for [separation](https://i.imgur.com/11X9pP1.jpg), which again might be considered to be lazy compared to using some object in the scene to accomplish the same, but it also avoids any ""and why is this convenient pillar/statue/fish here"" issues. It treats the world the characters inhabit as more ""real,"" less malleable to directorial need, while treating the framing of that world as *less* real, less like an actual camera shooting real events.  
* They sorta [disappear behind the cherry blossoms here](https://i.imgur.com/HGgt3dK.jpg), which could suggest any number of things, but I'm feeling it as them being buried beneath the general ""romantic narrative"" that life expects of people. They're in the background of that story. Kind of brings up the ""pair the spares"" trope, which is kinda the whole point when you thin
* Oh hey yeah you should [get a scooter](https://i.imgur.com/bHPZgZl.jpg), it worked for that other depressed girl that looked kinda like you.  
* They're a little [unrealistically small](https://i.imgur.com/T6b8sZU.jpg) they are here (compare to the bed); it's a neat visual metaphor.  
* Ambivalent on the [VN-looking shots](https://i.imgur.com/B8Sp7R2.jpg). Not sure if they're really accomplishing much.  
* Definitely more of a male-gaze camera than I'd predict, but the music and colour are working hard to sell the actual emotional palette.  
* ""There's nothing more revolting than the affection of someone you're completely disinterested in, is there?""  
* Thesis stated, then.
* But [another interesting statement](https://i.imgur.com/G7dYXoK.jpg) is suggested. The reference to her crush as ""onii-chan"" constantly makes him seem less like a person and more like an idealised archetype, doesn't it? And the idea that you project an ideal onto someonehat they don't really fit into is hardly unique to awkward &amp; slightly fucked-up relationships. Wonder where it'll go with that.

So far, it's on the good end of what I expected. It's set up some various ways it could end in ugly hurt feelings. It's hard to invest myself in hoping for the best for them because of the sense of that inevitability, ike classical tragedy, but I still want to see it implode.",1646092950

It might be better for you to marriage counseling for it since you can bring it up to the therapist and have it as a goal.

His support among veterans is primarily driven by Desert Storm Boomers who thought he was a tough guy. Even a lot of those guys started to figure it out by the end.",1646092953

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","LONDON/WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A cyberattack on a NATO member state could trigger Article 5, its collective defence clause, a NATO official said on Monday, amid concerns that chaos in cyberspace around Russia's invasion of Ukraine could spill over into other territories.  
  
The military alliance has for years made clear that a serious cyberattack could trigger the clause, but such a scenario has so far been largely hypothetical.  
  
""Allies also recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as an armed attack,"" the official told Reuters.  
  
""We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be in order to trigger a collective response. Any response could include diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature of the attack,"" the official said.  
  
Whether or not a cyberattack met the threshold of an attack large enough to trigger Article 5 was a ""political decision for NATO Allies to make,"" they added.  
  
Britain and the United States have warned of potential cyberattacks on Ukraine which could have international consequences should, for example, malicious software designed to target networks in Ukraine start to spread elsewhere. read more  
  
There has also been concern among cybersecurity experts that Russia could team up with some of the gangs and people who release malicious software, such as malware used to hold Colonial Pipeline to ransom in the United States last year.  
  
U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said there were no clear guidelines on how NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) should respond, should such an attack take place.  
  
""These are things that have been in hypothetical discussion for a decade, but because we've not come to any universal conclusion on what those standards should be, what level of attribution is needed, we're kind of in a very grey area,"" he told Reuters.  
  
He posed the hypothetical case of a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that impacts NATO member Poland, triggering power outages that result in hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic lights, causing fatal road accidents involving U.S. troops deployed there.  
  
""The West may have wanted strategic ambiguity in this area, and that may still be the right choice,"" he added.  
  
""But have we sufficiently made clear to the Russians the red lines on cyber or frankly to the NATO public, the American public, on red lines on cyber? I don't think we've done that.""  
  
Warner said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" a massive Russian cyberattack had not occurred. But he added that such an attack ""becomes even more dangerous with Putin elevating the readiness of his nuclear weapons.""",1646092954

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I mean, from an Orthodox perspective, both Catholic and Protestant churches are continuations of local pre-schism churches, but they have taken the faith in a different direction since then. I remember Patriarch Bartholomew's exact formula now - he said that Catholicism and Orthodoxy have grown ""ontologically different"". Not that he's a rabid anti-Catholic or anything, on the contrary, he is controversial for calling the Church of Rome the ""sister church"" of the Church of Constantinople and for praying with Catholics at Masses. My point was rather that he's someone who doesn't pussyfoot around or give ambiguous statements concerning issues he feels strongly about. For another example, he has gone as far as to say that Orthodoxy cannot exist without the Ecumenical Patriarchate. He has also decided a few years ago to single-handedly reclaim Constantinople's historical jurisdiction over Ukraine (which was basically *de jure* under Constantinople's care but *de facto* under Moscow's), annul the Russian Orthodox Church's condemnation and deposition of two schismatic groups, reunite them as one church - the Orthodox Church of Ukraine - and grant it autocephaly, citing his rights as universal primate, as having been appealed to by the schismatics, and as having *de jure* jurisdiction which ought to become *de facto* again, but also citing the Russian Orthodox Church's alignment with Russia's imperialist and unfair eyes on Ukraine. He made everyone furious and was seen as causing a dramatic schism in Orthodoxy (as the Russian Orthodox Church's excommunicated Constantinople, Greece, Alexandria and Cyprus for recognizing the Orthodox Church of Ukraine) but current events seem to show he may have well been onto something after all. (Not that I take a side in this whole issue.)

He's not a hothead but he can say things very straightforwardly, speak truth to power, and do things that can be outright offensive, when he feels that the Lord has given him a mission to fulfill. This makes him both a respected leader and a controversial figure.",1646092955

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Cargo that actually works. 

Right now cargo in the medium range (30-120 SCU) is damn near unprofitable due to the fact that refresh rates are so damned low. What usually happens is someone in a C2 comes in, buys all the cargo  and then the entire server is left to just sit there for 2 hours while the cargo meter fills up again. This means.that you won't ever really be continuously hauling you'll just be sitting on the pad shoving others off the trading consol so you can actually get cargo. On a good day if you're hauling medical supplies around crusader or microtech you'll be getting about 3k an hour. 

Oh and cargo is shared between all servers. 

Cargo for me is the basic gameplay loop of this game. Everything else (including pvp) revolves around cargo. Without cargo the miner can't get his goods to the stations, without cargo the pirates don't earn money, the escorts don't have a purpose. Cargo creates an objective, it drives gameplay. Look at JT it's basically just a cargo mission. The game doesn't need to be balanced around pvp or weapons or duels it needs to be balanced around objective based gameplay and strategy rather than simple trigger skill (also why the pvp light fighter crowd is not worth listening heavily to since they seem to whine way too much whenever their button mashing is countered by anything that requires them to use their brains). A solo gladius should literally never be able to take on a large ship regardless of pilot skill (short of boarding) it sould be like a guy in a motorboat trying to fight a container ship, the dude would just get run over. Instead they would have to think about squadron composition, loadouts, how many people they need, and what roles each person needs to play. They would have to identify targets and select an approach based on that target rather than using the same approach every single time. This drives strategy, emergent gameplay, and more importantly an interesting fight while forcing pkay interaction since it's no longer a case of ""who is the best swordsman"" but ""who has the better army"".",1646092955

"BoardgameDesign","t5_2sqpc","Come on. To be fair just some guy on the internet is what most of these posts rely their legal advice on. :P   
OP: It's going to depend on  case by case basis. Using TSR as an example, a ton of their character are public use. They have an entire set of documents for people that want to make 5e adventurers and some characters (Beholders come to mind) can't be used unless it's an official license from them. Then there's a full list of characters you can use and it's really just reference them because you're using the 5e ruleset. The doc is for adventures but it relies heavily with the fact that they can't legally protect 'Dwarf' but they can protect their system or creatures they specifically created. They're probably one of the easier ones but you'd need to check.   
NOT LEGAL ADVICE (there, disclaimer is in there) but one thing you could check is if the character/name exists in other popular media. Vorpal is likely fine and there are reference to it in games like Alice and wonder land, Munchkin etc. Multiple places like that is usually a good indicator of public use and if you can find references all over you're probably fine, if you can't... best stay away or rename. Alternatively, rename to something that is super clearly satire (there are other cases Munchkin does this on their cards, likely for the same reason).",1646092956

It's Dark Souls stuck into Breath of the Wild and it's good.

If I can talk about a surprising flaw in BotW, it's that it has a bunch of fun physics tools and puzzles, and it has this pretty deep combat system with expendable weapons, but the two things are basically totally divorced from each other unless you start doing wacky shenangians to catapult boulders into moblins, and you can't do that all the time.  

Elden Ring has decided to just focus on what Dark Souls has always done well - tense deliberate combat - and put it in an open world, adding in easy jumping and a mount. 

Because it's also open world, it's easier (if you take the time to explore) than other Souls games, as long as you're not in a dungeon. Enemies too hard? Just ride past them. Boss too tough? Put a marker on your map and come back later. The first big 'story dungeon' that people are getting stuck on, you can literally ride around, and there's like 15 hours+ of content if you decide to clear the entire zone before it anyway.

So overall it's taking the best parts of Dark Souls, but now instead if you're stuck, instead of taking a break from the *game* to refresh yourself and come back in a better mood, you can just take a break from that specific area and go somewhere else.

The mood of it is also interesting. example (extremely mild optional quest spoilers):  
Early on I found an optional boss battle that summons you into an arena. The boss in there, Bloodhound Knight Darriwil is tough and I knew that while I could beat it, it would probably take me many tries (I tried at least five times). I left it alone.  
Then later I was talking to the starting merchant and he said ""have you heard howling in the woods to the east? Try this finger-snap gesture.""  
I go there, I hear howling, I finger-snap, and this wolf-headed dude jumps down and says ""Hey I'm hunting for this dude named Darriwil, can you help me out?""  
And I think to myself, hang on, I know that name, let me go back there.  
So I go back to the boss fight, and before it spawns there's the option to summon the wolf-head guy. I summon him and he helps beat the boss, much easier. I get a cool sword from beating the boss and some extras for bringing the wolf.  

And all of this is totally optional. I bet 70% of players beat that boss without ever knowing there's an NPC you can get to help. There's no quest markers, it's up to you to take notes and remember things and explore unusual structures you see or note on the map.",1646092956

"editors","t5_2qpkc","&gt;To interpret, you need to delete or repeat one frame every 1000 frame

Hello, but are you really sure that this is what ""interpret"" does? For example over [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/organizing-assets-project-panel.html#change_the_frame_rate_of_a_clip) Adobe is saying

&gt;You can use the Interpret Footage command to change the frame rate that Premiere Pro assumes for a clip. When changing the frame rate of a clip, audio is changed, in addition to the video. Changing the frame rate changes the original duration proportionally. For example, if you set a 10-second, 24-fps clip to 48 fps, it becomes half as long, with a new duration of 5 seconds

So I read it like this: if you ""intepret"" a 30fps clips as 29.97 it will just play a tiny little bit slower.

It seems that it is when you place a 30fps clips on a 29.97 timeline *without* interpreting it as 29.97 *then* some frames would be dropped or some other magic would happen in order to preserve the original duration of the clip.

""On paper"" interpretation seems like a good option, so long as the NLE can adjust the sound accordingly or if all the clips are very short. Right?..

P.S. the more I think about it.. okay suppose Premier can adjust the audio.. but if you choose to finish in a DAW then we have a chance to mess things up, don't we?

The audio would really need to go through Premier magic on export to DAW and then one still has to watch out for software bugs.. Who knows if Premier really does it well. Seems like a test run of the whole process might be needed.

I am a chicken compared to you folks, a student, but if I can volunteer my opinion: there's a need to either (A) re-process the video 30fps -&gt; 29.97 using some sort of optical flow or just by brute force dropping some frames. Or there is a need to (B) interpret 30fps footage as 29.97 and then take really good care that sound is adjusted accordingly. One or the another. Maybe it's better to find some software to do this reliably before ignesting into NLE.",1646092957

Please note that Rule #4 does not allow for Tax Evasion.  This is [a site wide rule](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [a subreddit rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/).  Do not endorse, suggest, advocate, instruct others, or ask for help with tax evasion.  Do not be coy and sarcastically recommend against it or suggest using a privacy coin in response to an IRS inquiry.

Note:  Tax discussion is allowed as long as the above rules are not violated.

Generally, I dislike Nikocado. The Jerry Lewis-esque shtick was tired and played after the first 5 minutes, and I'd rather have root canal during leg waxing before watching him... ever. But this... this I like. I ***like*** this Nick (as opposed to Nikocado). He appears suprisingly genuine, says interesting stuff in a funny way, and if he was always like this, I'd listen to what he has to say.

I've always leaned towards believing the cancer story. But now, after seeing this, I'm thinking again. Does Nick have real, inside information? Lying about cancer certainly fills in some stories in Amber's story - for instance, why she is SO confident and un-scared about doing follow-up testing.

"TheWire","t5_2reco","That speech that Marcia Donnelly gives Prez about having kids of his own, because Dook isn't his kid and there will be plenty more kids in need like him the following year, breaks me every time. It's basically the school system equivalent to ""There you go again, giving a fuck when it ain't your turn to give a fuck""

Prez did all he could for Dook, he even offered for him to come back to the middle school to shower/leave his laundry, but I think either Dook never did this, or would probably have been prevented from entering because he was no longer a student.

Also Prez gives Dook $200 in the last (I think) episode even though he's aware he might never get it back, because he's still holding out hope that he can genuinely help Dook. When it comes to helping Dook, Prez has nothing to apologize for.",1646092958

"recruitinghell","t5_3bwcw","I‚Äôm Autistic with ADHD so I can speak on the neurodivergent part. In a comment above, it‚Äôs mentioned that they typically use a type of AI software that reads things like eye contact, tone, facial expressions, body movements, etc. As an autistic person, I already really struggle with those things in a regular interview, but to put myself in front of a camera for a set amount of time with no one to ‚Äúread‚Äù or match in terms of energy or expectations‚Ä¶ obviously I would get rejected immediately. While an NT may be extremely uncomfortable and awkward and can be seen as such during a video like this, I think that compared to an ND person they would still be able to pass by just on things like tone and facial expressions being ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or friendly. In contrast, Autistic people (apparently) can come across as cold, unfriendly, and/or even hostile when not masking. If we use the wrong tone, inference often is made by NTs when there really isn‚Äôt any. 

I can often match the other person in output during regular interviews, so I come across much less Autistic than I actually am. It‚Äôs a form of masking. Asking me to perform a soliloquy is beyond my capability, especially when I‚Äôm to be judged against NTs in a pool of applicants. 

It‚Äôs honestly already asking a lot for us to exist in a world and workplace made by and for neurotypical people, and it took many years for me to be able to learn to mask well enough to get and keep jobs. I hope that answered your question well enough.

Though again could fall back on resources and their bosses. If they never okayed them to finish and release a patch.

"CredibleDefense","t5_2y5ib","They've lost Nord Stream.  So the only way to sell oil and gas to Europe is through Ukraine.  

They've sighed a new deal with China to sell them oil and gas but it'll take years for the pipelines and other infrastructure to be built.  Particularly if it's the Russians building them.  

Russia may be hoping that if it knocks out the Ukranian pipeline.  That Germany will be forced to turn Nord Stream 2 on but that's becoming increasingly unlikely.  Germany will go green and nuclear before that happens.  

Whatever their plan was, it's back fired.  

Their conventional forces have lost the fear factor that they once had.  They've played their hand geopolitically and over extended it.  

How long will the sanctions last?  Probably until after Putin is out of the way.

Ukraine applied for NATO membership in 2008 and was rebuffed.  There was no chance of Ukraine joining in the next 10-20 years.  But their membership of the EU is likely to be fast tracked.

Your right it‚Äôs not a numbered entry so let‚Äôs compare it to another remake they‚Äôre marketing as another way to retell the same story, stranger of paradise. Both are obviously different, have been since the start and are marketed as being the same as the original. Are you as critical of that? 

Absolutely hate the marketing of that because your totally right. It‚Äôs really dumb for them to say it‚Äôs the same as the original. And no offense but it‚Äôs also kinda dumb that people saw very obvious differences in the trailers and assumed it was gonna be the same. It was obvious that the whispers were gonna be a big part of it from the marketing imo and people saw that and assumed it to be the same as the original still? 

From what I saw of the ending people were 50/50 on it. 50% of people absolutely hated it with a passion. 50% of people loved it as soon as they saw it. I certainly loved it and I saw many people on Maximilian doods chat who loved it as well, I don‚Äôt remember his response to it I honestly don‚Äôt think he loved it but I don‚Äôt think he hated it either. There‚Äôs a lot of different views on it so it‚Äôs kinda hard to tell. Your point absolutely still stands tho there was a lot of backlash I agree.

And square is just straight up lying in interviews the creators keep saying it‚Äôs the same as the original to sell copies and then everything in the game and in supplemental material points to it being completely different. And I‚Äôm hella pissed because people keep seeing that, expecting it and getting let down. I have a feeling some people didn‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre full of shit and think they‚Äôre gonna change part 2 to be more in line with the original. Just like they expected part 1 to be and are gonna be let down all over again. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong too maybe it will change but it would be a real slap in the face to everyone who likes the new stuff and their own interviews where they allude to fan theories being true. So no matter what they‚Äôre contradicting themselves",1646092959

But they may be important to her despite what *you* think of them. And you said that you were upset because you felt that saving your money for other things was more important. That‚Äôs all your evaluation of what‚Äôs important and not. That‚Äôs you dictating over what she may want or feel is a priority. It might be the case that y‚Äôall are not on the same page in terms of what should be prioritized; it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs doing anything out of spite. Just because she does something you disagree with doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs doing it to spite you. And she may very well know that you don‚Äôt like those decisions. But just because you don‚Äôt like them doesn‚Äôt obligate her to make different decisions, especially when it comes to her body.

That‚Äôs the entire point. You seem to be resentful of the fact that she‚Äôs made decisions about her body that you don‚Äôt think should be priorities and that don‚Äôt meet your expectations. And while you‚Äôre welcome to have your opinions, and she‚Äôs given you chance to voice them; your opinions don‚Äôt bind her to any expectations that you have.

"OtomeIsekai","t5_1zqfgn","Hello \~ I'm a 25 year old Canadian and go by Kehtea on the discord. I'm semi-active there sometimes.

I am an OI fiend and have read quite a bit. I like reading the ones that are big good good but I can find guilty pleasure in reading more of the cheesy... trashy ones. I have a hard time picking favorites but lately I've been enjoying ""Saving My Sweetheart"", ""Father, I Don't Want this Marriage"", and ""Villain's Are Destined to Die"". Honestly I have a lot more favorites but I don't want to type them all out.

I dabble in anime but that void has been mostly filled by OI. I'm a big FMA fan (I got the FMA:B DVD's and 3-in-1 volume set of the manga &lt;3), and I watch Jojo when the new seasons come out. I also love Love is War, but I watch it with my bf so I don't want to read the manga and get spoiled. Generally I don't watch too much unless it makes it's way to Netflix and I find it there. 

I play a decent amount of games. I have been BIG into Genshin Impact (AR 55), but I'm too shy find people to play with so I mostly play by myself. I'm also into Stardew Valley (just modded mine a ton), Animal Crossing, Hades, Valhiem, Civilzation 6, Persona 4/5, and Dragon Age to name a few. I'm also down to try new games as long as they don't put a big hole in my wallet.

Hit me up if you looking for someone to chat with or play something with. I will say my memory is a little small brain and recalling some OI stuff is hard since I read so many. But I'm still down to chat about it! I'm trying to put myself out there more so here this goes! (If you notice me on the discord you can also DM me on there.)",1646092959

I opened up to a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about it which is actually rare, because talking about my feelings doesn‚Äôt even help me. He said that he was there for me, but he later said that I ‚Äúdid it for attention‚Äù. I literally cut him off on the spot, then and there.

I then actually reached out for help, but the company I got in contact with just turned their backs on me. They said that they would help me in the form of therapy. They said that over the next 6 months a therapist(s) is going to call me, to talk about everything. Well 6 months roll by, and I don‚Äôt get any call whatsoever. I had to get myself out of that hole. I spent days in my apartment just lying in bed, not eating and drinking, and rarely even going to the bathroom. The sad thing is that since talking to people about it doesn‚Äôt even help me, I told no one. No one knew how much I was suffering. I genuinely felt like I was just some huge, dead void. Thankfully I got temporarily better for another couple of months.

Unfortunately I do still struggle with those feelings now, but I still live in the comfort of knowing that no matter how hard it gets, it‚Äôs not going to be as hard as it was last year. I‚Äôm still very unhappy about my life and I haven‚Äôt felt joy or true happiness in a very very long time, but I know that the worst bit of the struggle is over.

&gt; The Russian president thought he sensed an opportunity to take advantage of a disunited West.

&gt; Otherwise, why attempt to conquer a country to prevent it from succeeding? And why threaten prison sentences for Russians giving aid to Ukraine? Plenty of Russians seem to share our perspective: Protests took place in scores of Russian cities over the weekend, and thousands of people were arrested.

&gt; China has squirmed at having its longtime support for an individual state&amp;#039;s sovereignty conflict with its just-christened friendship treaty with Russia, and is balancing its political position of not enforcing sanctions by having to limit financing by Chinese banks for Russian goods because of the risk of exclusion from the global financial order.

The problem isn't with having consequences for breaking rules and boundaries. The problem is that the punishment heavily outweighs the infraction so much so that it breaks the scale. And not only that, but this is a Consequence for a fucking *child* who's brain is so underdeveloped they are probably literally unable to do things like manage time or remember things nearly as well as an adult could. 

Let's look at your example and analyze why it's shit reasoning to justify the consequences. Your child arrives home 2 minutes late. At absolutely worst case scenario, your routine which is so crucial to your sleep and downtime, gets pushed back *two minutes.* If your life is destroyed because you lost out on two minutes on downtime or sleep, then you're probably less functional as a person than the child themselves. 

As to why it points to abuse, frankly speaking thinking about it more it doesn't just point to abuse, it is abuse, in the form of isolation. If you're telling your kid they can never see a friend again because of a single, minute mistake they make, then they are being isolated from the other kids outside of school hours. It's inevitable that at some point in their friendship with another person at some point they're going to be two minutes late to coming home. Nobody, absolutely nobody, is never a minute late in their lives. The so called boundary that is being set by the parents is inhuman. Nobody can do that, not even adults. And we're  suppose to expect a *child* to uphold these inhuman standards?

People who are this strict tend to lead into other forms of abuse too. There's absolutely no chance that child wasnt emotionally abused by the parents, who probably proceeded to guilt trip him about this incident saying its his fault he can never hang out with his friend again, when it's not. It's the parents for being completely unreasonable in their expectations of an underdeveloped person.",1646092959

First, they probably expected some Ukrainians (especially on the eastern side) to be glad they came to ‚Äúdenationalize‚Äù them, so they didn‚Äôt expect that local Ukrainians will do anything to stop this. 

Second, the big difference between moral of Ukrainians and Russians there. Ukrainians defend their homeland, many Russians didn‚Äôt even have an idea where they were going. Keep in mind, there is a bond between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Most people in Russia have family/friends in Ukraine.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

Now in Europe it's down to just G2 caps and FNC Hylissang.

Instead of seeing a player, liking the way they play or their personality, and growing to root for the org because of them it's turned into a guessing game of where they'll end up next split.

Do not send currency into a state that invaded a free, democratic &amp; peaceful nation. Do not add your drop to the bucket, as someone else said it. These are plastic figures, nothing essential. You cannot target an economy without hurting unrelated businesses. Everyone is quick to ask for sanctions and actions, but if not buying little plastic figures is really the sacrifice that is too much to ask for, then we're all just hypocrites, asking others to carry the burden.

When I've updated the Starter Guide today I did make the deliberate decision to leave out any references to 3rd party companies.

It's not a question of weaknesses. Comic Thanos has those too, he loves Death way too much and subconsciously sabotage himself because he thinks he's not worthy of the power.

It's a question of misrepresentation of the character. Thanos not having his iconic powers is very weird. Imagine a Thor who doesn't summon lightning or a Spiderman without Spider-Sense?

Btw Thanos one shots Binary Captain Marvel with a punch before failing to two shot Thor with a punch and cosmic power in Infinity (2013), so when he doesn't make her flinch with the same headbutt it one shotted Thor 5 seconds before in Endgame, I could only roll my eyes in the cinema.",1646092962

We have what our governments are willing to share but frankly I wouldn't trust ANY government to be truthful in this situation.

educated guesses can be made by people who can infer such things through alot of accounting math but honestly even that can't be trusted wholeheartedly because in the geopolitical field, everybody has a bias.

In one, a man is arrested for a minor crime by police officers sympathetic enough to let him go at first and turn himself in later. Even if he was/is convicted, it's a littering charge. He'll be fined and then let go, likely very little worse for wear. I'm thinking the tragic loss of his fiance is probably by far the harder blow.

In the other, Jewish people and other undesirables were rounded up and imprisoned on the charge of being undesirable and after multiple attempts at exile were killed and/or subjected to subhuman conditions in a work camp.

Some interpret Bible versus differently and so there's a whole lot of nonsense in churches, some not all.   


So I studied the evidence for my faith. Why did I believe. I studied evidence from people like John Lennox, William Lane Craig and many others you can find online that educate on the massive evidence for Christ, for our faith etc. If your church is not on track, biblicaly , might be time to find one that is.

"UkrainianConflict","t5_30hhs","The West wanted the Ukraine to join, but had no offensive intentions.  If Russia had succeeded in a quick takeover of the capital the West could not have stopped it.  

Russia hoped for a quick decapitation and puppet-regime, but built up massively to be prepared for a Grozny type of prolonged campaign of brutal bombing and sending in attack forces.

But the Ukraine is much bigger than Chechnya and has borders with countries that can supply anti-aircraft, anti-tank and other missiles and weapons that will make it much harder for the startegy of Russia (dominate the air and pin the Ukraine's forces down &amp; take them out one by one). The West can also easily share information. They can also supply provisions and humanitarian aid to let an active resistance dominate West Ukraine and lead insurgents from there. 

In an attrition war with conventional weapons, the Ukraine may win with support from the West. Hungary and the Czech Republic certainly do not like Russian invasions. Poland does not want to go back. 

Russia has misjudged the response of Sweden particularly. Bullying with threats makes it much more attractive to turn to Nato for Sweden. Finland is too close to Russia for an easy assessment, but they are allergic to the intimidation and have a rich historical link with Sweden. 

Wildcards: 

Insane Trump-politics could leave Europe on their own. Not very likely. 

Russia could crumble. Most Russians see Ukrainians as very much like themselves. The Russians will start finding out that it is a war from Russia on the Ukraine from their soldiers. One disenchanted general or oligarch or individual could take Putin out.",1646092966

I did what I was told. As of tomorrow I will have been in the hospital for 5 days getting all the tests to rule out other issues. I finally got my lumbar puncture today which confirmed IIH. I hadn't seen much of a change on diamox so they are increasing my dose to 750 mg 2x a day. Hopefully I will be discharged tomorrow. This has been such a crazy last couple of days. They wouldn't even let me do outpat care because they said I would never get an appointment. Right now not sure what are side effects of diamox or from lumbar puncture.

I had tried most of the ones on the March madness bracket and I wanted to try the rest.  My friend and I went down the rabbit hole. We took all the pizza places from the comments and put them on the page. Then started trying them some more than one in a day. Some of the ratings you won't agree with. Zero is the best Chicago is the worst. Though I would like to drive Pizza papalis Detroit deep dish. Since the downtown location is closing I don't know if I will have the chance. I'm a little biased towards Detroit deep dish but as you can see alibi made it to the top. Everything is is considered in these ratings. They're all based against each other. Not everything can have a four-star like on Amazon. 
      
How I rate:    
1 IS IT COOKED (I order well done / burnt and never have had one over cooked. Usually they are undercooked)

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.  This post we didn't see your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification

What age is the guitar?  Might a warranty apply?   

If we're talking about the same thing,  it might be 'fixed' by someone with some skill with finish touchups, basically with some careful over-spray.     Once they start into that work,  expect it to take a couple of weeks - lacquer takes time to dry fully.

I don't think DTS will spend more than an episode or two on the title fight, that's just not how it's structured and how the producers talk about the show.  That being said, Netflix has some access that's going to be interesting and new even to more serious fans - angles and details that we really don't know.  New Horner and Toto sound bites should be outstanding.

How DTS handles the stewarding/race direction should be pretty interesting too, they haven't really talked much about those in previous seasons but think they'll need to for this one.  Apart from the title fight there's a lot there this year too - even just to start there's the entire debacle that was Spa (which we should get some good Vettel remarks about) and inconsistent track limits enforcement all year - whatever you want to call Checo/LeClerc at RBR, and culminating in Alonso being Alonso and not even trying to make the corner at COTA, which should get some interesting commentary.",1646092968

Me and my family live together, and we split all the jobs in the house, including cleaning. We have a system in place so that everybody has a specific daily chore. We also have a list of things we need to do during what we call a 'deep clean'. That's when we clean everything in the house really well. We do a deep clean around twice a month. We decide who gets to chose what they do first, then the next person choses a job of choice, then so on until all the jobs are taken. We all agreed on this system, and everyone contributed to making it. We take a picture and send it on our group chat. Our oldest sibling, (let's say S,) has a more time-consuming course/job/project (I'm going to say work for it) than the rest of us. Because of COVID, all of the work has been changed to things we can do at home.

&amp;#x200B;

S's daily job is doing the dishes. S leaves the dishes in the sink. The dishes that were in the sink at night are the same dishes from the morning, every time. I took pictures to make sure. I do the dishes for S all the time, because every time I go to ask S to do it, S tells me S is about to take a nap, or about to get back to work on their project, or something else, so I left S alone. Whenever we deep clean, S always says S can't help for the same reasons. Except S has time to cook, read, write, and multiple other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked S to do the dishes when we were doing a deep clean, and S said, ""Sorry, but I was about to take a nap."" I just walked away. S asked, ""Did you hear me? I said-"" I interrupted, ""I heard you. I know. You're napping, as you said. Enjoy your nap."" I said this flatly. S got mad because, as S said, I walked away without responding, and S was busy all the time, so I need to respect S, and S want to take a nap. Then S asked me why I was so upset.

&amp;#x200B;

I blew up. I told S that S doesn't clean, and I'm tired of it and used to it. And that I always have to do the dishes, and that I'm tired of S always being too busy to clean but having free time for other things. S said S did do the dishes and deep cleans, and I showed S the pictures of the sink, and the pictures in the group chat of our lists for deep cleaning that didn't have S's name on it for 4 months back.

&amp;#x200B;

S said they have their work, and it takes all of S's time, and I told S all of us have work, and we clean anyway, and that S has time for hobbies and S is lazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I said this, to the best I can remember: ""You have time to cook and read, but not clean. I know you have things keeping you busy, but so do I! So do the rest of the people in this house! I think you're using your work as a way to get out of cleaning! I think you're just lazy!"" I then stormed off, opened the door to the room and found... another sibling listening. This sibling told everyone what happened, and my mom, friends of S, and other siblings told me I should've left it.

"girlscouts","t5_2tp33","Why does it upset you that other girls don‚Äôt sell as much or at all? Honest question. 

Because as long as your troop leader is actively leading, as long as the leaders and the treasurer are managing the troop finances appropriately, as long as every girl is getting out of GS what she needs, and as long as the troop is self-funding their own adventures instead of constantly asking parents for money like a glorified playgroup‚Ä¶ then cookie sales are functioning as intended. 

Cookies should NOT be a source of high stress for the girls or the parents. Cookies are simply the way that Girl Scouts fund their own activities, adventures, supplies and badges - that‚Äôs all.

If you‚Äôre bummed out because your kid and others are ‚Äúbusting their humps‚Äù to sell 300, 500, 1000, or 2000 boxes, and you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúunfair‚Äù that other girls aren‚Äôt ‚Äúworking as hard‚Äù? Then you need to step back and think hard about exactly why the girls sell in the first place. And imagine how much more relaxed you‚Äôll be if you just sell 53 boxes next year and stop early. Or maybe not sell at all. Seriously.

No one is a ‚Äúbetter Girl Scout‚Äù because she sold more cookies than another. And honestly this kind of resentment breaks the ‚Äúsister to every Girl Scout‚Äù and ‚Äúrespect myself and others‚Äù parts of the GS Law for me.

I took over and ran one existing troop for a whole year with $153 in our account until the next fundraiser rolled around, and I started up and ran a brand-new troop starting with $0 until our first cookie season. There‚Äôs no reason you have to have $$$$$ in the account to be ‚Äúreal‚Äù Girl Scouts.",1646092969

""I was in a desperate situation""

""it was another time""

""I hurt you because I love you""

""if I can't have it, no one can"" 

I can think of numerous of justifications that aren't tied to blaming supernatural reasons. So how is it worse to justify an immoral act with religion than it is to justify it in any other way? You're still committing evil, you're still justifying it.

I'd say evil atheists select different ways to justify their actions, and are as much hypocrites as any other group of people. I am empathetic. I care for others and it brings me joy to help people. I also take great pleasure in beating up bullies. Which makes me a total hypocrite, rite? Or perhaps humans aren't coherent, reasonable, stringent and infallible.

Literally historically the most dominant laner in the mid, especially in the modern age unlike Bjerg playing against fucking Shiphtur, Voyboy, and Link. People used to criticize Jensen for being less effective out of lane just like they do with Jojo now (although Jojo's criticism is legitimate) because he focused on dominating lane from 2016-2018. 

And how many times do I have to say it: DL has 0 international achievements without Jensen. Like, what's wrong with you? Did your brain break? They literally brought each other what the other couldn't achieve alone, but people with 2 brain cells go ""Oh Jensen can't win anything without DL."" and forget the contrapositive of ""Oh DL can't do anything international without Jensen."" 

And I know you're a simp for Jiizuke. Jiizuke can't win a title period and can't make it to Worlds because he is too inconsistent and has a champ puddle. 100T took him off Syndra and the series was GG, mid diff. Great laner, though. Wonder why Jiizuke only lasted 1 season with Impact, while Jensen played with him for 3.5 whole years. Had Impact, Svenskeren, a rookie as promising as Tactical, and Ignar, but couldn't make it over 100T or C9 once. Game 5 was on him to carry, with his insanely hot ADC put on mage duty, Jiizuke with his career on the line gets his coveted Lucian aaaannndddd.... Jiizuke? He disappeared! Or they wish Jiizuke disappeared 21 deaths in a series as a bunch of ranged picks. Oh well, I'm sure has all those great international performances to look back on. Oh wait...",1646092971

Here's another (from your friendly ADHD having professor):

Any textbook worth a shiz is written in such a way as each paragraph sets up with first sentence providing the concept; middle sentences providing examples, stats, etc. for understanding and clarification; closing sentence restating and/or reinforcing the initial sentence, transitioning to the next concept.

Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph. If you grasp the concept, move on. If you need a bit of clarification, move into the paragraph, then move on. 

If you're feeling tired, bored, or worn down during the process, ""highlight"" the segments or concepts where you might need or should review the entire paragraph, in order to come back later when you're feeling up to it, and keep going forward. 

Proceed through each segment in this fashion, and you'll power read most of your ""text"" rather quickly, allowing for the highlights to guide you on where you might need to home in for later.

Because of this, I'd normally recommend taking the Japanese pension as soon as possible (age 60), while holding the US Social security as long as possible.


That said, if you keep working once you're back in the US and get to 21 years of social security earnings, the WEP starts being phased out, so this becomes less important.

What's on paper is what matters. If you're past the technical interviews and it seems like they are infact going to make an offer, then saying something along the lines of *""I am ready to move forward with offers and terms of employment, and would be happy to negotiate these terms""*. is fine. It shows them you're serious about talking and gives them a reason to keep talking to you.

&amp;nbsp;

Something they cannot do: make you agree to anything that's not on paper in your hot little hands yet.

&amp;nbsp;

Don't sweat it, they probably just want to make sure you're serious about securing something and not just using them as leverage for something else. Just be honest but firm.

&amp;nbsp;

Also as a side note: yes, always negotiate. There's very few exceptions to this and your situation doesn't sound like one of them. You should always try to maximize what you can (within reason), and any reasonable company expects people to do so, to some degree.",1646092972

for me its not worth going i5 12600k! plus you need to know that performance difference bettwen these two cpus with 3060ti will be even less in fps!

agree with the rest, ok ssd is also little waste of money!

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","Sorry you are dealing with this.  Anyone would have anxiety if in your shoes.  My wife has had years of chronic issues, including pain.  I am not qualified to say whether or not it is in your brain and the medical world struggles sometimes on complicated cases.  When they can't figure it out, it is not uncommon for them to say ""it is all in your head"".  I think it makes them feel better than to admit they can't figure it out.  

While my wife still struggles, Jesus did heal her over 15 years ago of chronic migraines.  I do not know whether you have a faith to rely on and I am not interested in pushing anything on you.  However, Jesus has healed many people of problems that doctors can't.  In the event you have interest, you can do an internet search for Healing Journeys provided by Andrew Wommack Ministries.   I bought their healing Journeys DVDs where several people each discuss what their issues were and how Jesus healed them.  My wife enjoys them and they lift her faith.  I also enjoy the book of Psalms in the Bible, particularly Psalm 18, 91, and 121.  They are each uplifting when someone is struggling.  If you do an internet search for those psalms, you might consider using the New International Version of the bible as it is easier to understand than some.

I'm just offended on principle by how expensive their options are, with the most reasonably priced beds being so awful. How dare they put a $3k price tag on something that shitty. Yes, the i8 feels great. But it's like $7k with a really good discount, probably 10k by the time they're done upselling you on every accessory and bundle. I kind of think the lower end models are all there just to get you to accept the insane price of the better beds, when you lay on them and feel how crappy they are. 

It's a tried and true sales tactic, show the customer something they hate so they're more willing to pay the higher price on what they really want. It feels sleazy.",1646092973

I can't say for certain if this is what is happening to you or not.  When I went through withdrawals, I found a lot of help in the Surviving Antidepressants forum.  I've implemented a lot of healthier alternatives to medication to help me.  It's not perfect, but I am doing much better while dealing with withdrawals.  

Healthier diet, yoga, therapy and some supplements (Magnesium and Fish Oil).

Russia invaded a sovereign country illegally cause it doesn't want it to join NATO. 
This country (Russia) is big and it being allowed to do so brings fear to every neighboring country. Russia borders 7 European countries.

Now think about what will these countries do fearing their impendant demise. They will buckle. They will become vassals of Russia and empower it. 
Now, the more countries buckle, the more powerful they become and further west they can go.

By the time they get to you, they will have the power to take you down. Are you ready for the invasion? For the lack of support you showed? 

This is not ""a corner of europe"" this is the worlds biggest country doing territorials wars. I wish you could understand that by the time you think it would get to you, it would already be a nuclear war.
Ukraine is the largest Eastern europe country that isn't Russia. If it falls, no others stand a chance.

Don't be cowardly. Face up to bullies that threaten the freedom of the western world.

Oh and btw i did not say anything about nuclear first strike. We want this to be resolved without nukes. But, we cannot be bullied and have to be prepared for the eventuality.
First strike could only happen if we know for a fact Putin ordered strikes in order to stop them.",1646092974

&gt; - A coalition government formed after the 1998 federal elections had the phasing out of nuclear energy as a feature of its policy. With a new government in 2009, the phase-out was cancelled, but then reintroduced in 2011 following the Fukushima accident in Japan, with eight reactors shut down immediately.
&gt; - Public opinion in Germany remains broadly opposed to nuclear power with virtually no support for building new nuclear plants.

It adds interesting features and i would like to continue playing it for my stream, but i have had to start over more than 10 times now and never got past day 4. Day 4 i had to start over because (again) i had a titan in my startzone that got stuck in a loop of trying to jump over a hole in a fence the normal sized version would have been able to get past. Got it to 500 live which took me long af (only takes 10 dmg from normal ammo) and a huge radiation bird swung down on me and 3hitted my a\*\*. After that the things live reset itself all my arrows stuck in it were gone, my shotgun ammo was basically empty and i hadnt been able to find the necessary recources to craft a workbench. So i couldnt defend myself anymore and had to restart. 

At which point i got stuck just trying to make it to the trader for the first time 4 times, spending half my ammo just on trying to make it there.

On low difficulty its too easy and if you up it it just breaks the game. I feel like youre supposed to play it on the lowest difficulty and even then the broken shit will still ruin your playthrough.

Also, in your intro introduce yourself, it doesn't have to be complicated just say what your name is and that should be enough for everyone. Change your subtitle outline to black and a different font. I think what you're missing in general is structure. Making a youtube video is like telling a story, you must have the intro, the content, then the outro.

Your editing is awesome and your thumbnails are good too! You're just missing that part and that's it!",1646092976

"IchikaFanclub","t5_11c3j4","Oh, alright.

Honestly, even as much as I like Ichika, I don't think the role she was given was that bad, but people hating her have the problem of not understanding that it's just a role that the author choose for her and completely ignore her posterior redemption. Also, I don't particularly like fuutaro as character either so I don't think she's loosing anything by not being with him haha.

Anyways let's play a little with the story, it seems that she ended up acting that way as a last resort due to seeing Miku and Nino putting so much effort for him and getting closer to him, while she had been trying to mantain her feelings under control. I think the best story route for her would've been leaving a lot earlier in pursuit of her career and stay away from fuutaro, making everyone miss her and in good romcom fashion, leaving it to the MC to go and solve the issue. Then, when he goes to try to bring her back, she has to give tons of additional reasons for leaving like the drive to pursuit her career; to which he offers rebuttals as to why it doesn't require her to leave her sisters, until she has no option to confess that she loves him but couldn't gather to interfere with Miku's feelings. He then realizes the things they have in common (the dedication they both put in focusing in their careers), and acknowledges Ichika's selfless character, so decides to reciprocate to her feelings :)",1646092976
"infj","t5_2r39a","I agree here! A lot of people try to conform to a different identity. I think to answer your question as to why people might try to mimic an INFJ is because of our traits, which might be appealing in theory. For example, as intuitives us INFJ are very good at understanding people's feelings and emotions. We can tell when people are being disingenuous very easily and it makes us a little uncomfortable (hence this entire post), and I think that's something that a lot of sensors don't have. It's stuff like that. We are also introverts who mostly have social lives so I think that's another thing. Also, I know a lot of INFJs, you only know yourself? It's a shame.",1646092976

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Basically there are schools that offer financial aid to international students and thhose that dont. Identify where you wanti appky and then look up if that school offers aid. If it doesnt then you‚Äôre most likely not gonna be able to make it work but do expkore your options.

If the school offers aid to intl students, then there are a few types:

1. Merit based

- Aid will be based on your academic (or sports etc.) achievements.

2. Need based 

- Aid will be based on your EFC which is basically what your family or you could contribute towards your tuition. Usually the lower it is the higher the aid. 

You should also check if the school meets demonstrated need or not as this will determine whether or not you can go, but don‚Äôt let that discourage you from applying. 


Some schools are need-blind which basically means that they will not consider your financial meed in your application negatively but most do, so the more you ask for the worse your chances.  


Also, what you need to realize is that even though tons of people get huge amounts of financial aid every year, it is incredibly difficult to do so. Sadly, being international who is also asking for aid, we are just not on the same playing field. Our chances are way worse and there is no such thing as a safety school. However, if you work hard and are  determined then it is definitely not impossible.

I‚Äôm telling you this because I was incredibly naive about my applications to the US. I thought I had a decent chance because my grades were good and I did a lot of EC‚Äôs for someone from my country, but that was not the case. Prepare early, research and keep grinding.",1646092977

As long as the ""net"" amount in MFP is low enough, you should find yourself in a calorie deficit. Being able to treat yourself should help with adherence too!

That being said, this depends a lot on the accuracy of the device you're using to track your exercise calories. FWIW, I used a Fitbit charge 2 (later a versa2), and these seem to be accurate enough for my purposes.

I'd try this way - your net daily goal can be 1500, and you can eat your exercise calories - if, after a few weeks or so, your average weight hasn't dropped, drop that net number down by 100 cals or so.

This strategy also incentivises you to do more exercise, which has its own benefits besides weight loss.",1646092978

CP-0 are going to try and assassinate Luffy

\- luffy is the main character and will never die  
The Strawhats all have their hands full

\- don't remember everyone, but franky for instance is only holding zoro, jimbei was holding some rubble but could easily get out of it.   
Zoro might be dead

\- lol  
Big Moms crew plus the World Government are lurking in the mainland

\- this is probably the biggest tension point, if it wasn't that zuneesha is gonna smash the WG boats and BM crew is a meme by now.  
The bombs still haven‚Äôt been dealt with

\- bombs in OP don't do much tbf  
Luffy is reaching his limit but theres no indication that Kadio is

\- luffy is always reaching his limit  


  
A bit of a devil's advocate there, but I guess my main point, and possibly my main criticism of OP (i love it btw don't get me wrong), is that in the end the good/main guys don't die. Like, I would be hella sad if zoro died, it would be traumatic for the SHs, but it would make me even more involved, and it would make the stakes even higher, and it would make the SHs even more motivated. But it doesn't and will not happen. So I guess given that knowledge that none of the main characters dies the stakes do not seem that big, the tension kind of dissipates.",1646092979

"civ","t5_2rk3b","Good answer from /u/TheMarshmallowBear on what amenities actually are. Some other details:

- Amenities which come from buildings and improvements are applied to specific cities and cannot be reallocated. Build an entertainment complex, that city gets +1 amenity. Build colosseum, all cities within six tiles get +2 amenities. 

- However, cities which just got new amenities from local sources might still appear to stay the same or lose amenities as points from other sources are allocated elsewhere

- The game allocates those ""global"" amenities for you, distributing them such that all of your cities are at roughly the same happiness level. No weight is given to maximizing yields or propping up loyalty issues by allocating amenities to places where they would be most useful, it's an extremely naive algorithm. There also appears to be an element of randomness, as if you watch closely you'll see cities have amenity points taken from or given to them for no discernible reason. 

Similar to the tilepicker, it is completely insane that amenity allocation is randomized, and even more insane that the player is given no control over it. But hey, taking away player choices and given them to a badly designed AI is what 4X games are all about, right?",1646092979

As an example my input was 696969 because I'm immature, but the minecraft seed: command that i ran in the world gave me a long string that was something like 490....etc. So, on the seedfix website if I used that I'd get walls of chunks, but using 696969 on the seedfix website fixed the issue entirely.

The decision you make is certainly up to you, then. Personally, I wouldn't be able to continue that friendship. It would cause me too much pain and/or irritation.

*****
&gt; In a statement obtained exclusively by CNN, retired federal Judge J. Michael Luttig, considered a luminary in conservative legal circles, enthusiastically endorsed Jackson, describing her as a candidate who is &amp;quot;Eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.""

&gt; Noting the court&amp;#039;s 6-3 conservative majority, Luttig called on Republicans &amp;quot;To confirm Judge Jackson out of political calculation, even if they cannot bring themselves to confirm her out of political magnanimity, and then proudly take the deserved credit for their part in elevating the first black female jurist to the Supreme Court of the United States.""

&gt; Role in 2020 election certification battle Luttig played a major role in helping Pence defy Trump and certify Biden as the winner of the presidential election on January 6, 2021.

She says she wants to kill herself? NP, give her number to the suicide hotline below and make sure that if she's really troubled (unlikely) - she can receive help. They will call her to avert a suicide.

Sorry to be pessimistic here but I see scam/ set up all in this post. I'd seriously give her number to the hotline, tell them the story and go no contact.

Take this case: (q)(r) = 8

Say q = 4 and r = 2

(4)(2) = 8, checks out.

Now say q = 8, what will r equal? 1. this time, you can see q doubled and r was halved.

Now you can rewrite (q)(r) = 8 into q = 8/r using some algebra.

However, you mentioned in other post that you are 'heavy' - so there is a possibility that you were over the weight limit for the frame's tolerances - which could void this guarantee. Cube have some fact sheets on what the weight limits of each model are on their website - but they only go back to 2019 at the moment: [https://www.cube.eu/en/service/helpdesk/faq-technical/what-is-the-approved-structural-weight-limitload-limit-for-my-cube-bike/](https://www.cube.eu/en/service/helpdesk/faq-technical/what-is-the-approved-structural-weight-limitload-limit-for-my-cube-bike/)

You might have be able to use the waybackmachine or do some other digging to find the weight limit on your particular model.

If were involved in any crashes which could have caused the initial crack which lead to the failure, that would also void the guarantee.

If you are over the weight limit, or there was a decent crash, there unfortunately probably isn't much you can do except stump up cash for a new frame.

If you're under the weight limit or there haven't been any crashes that should have caused this, **fight for that warranty claim**. I'd be pissed AF if a frame I purchased new failed after only 3,500km - that is honestly not a lot of km and well under what should be acceptable.",1646092982

"ADCMains","t5_39cvu","Just to warn you, I'm only silver. But I am climbing lol Here's a couple things that could get any ADC main to Gold and perhaps beyond:

1) Use ""Player Attack Move Click"" to auto. Some people use ""a"" but I like swapping scoreboard to ""a"" and using ""tab"" to auto attack. Don't forget to go to Game settings and check ""Attack move on cursor.""

2) Freeze every lane, every game, every chance you get until level 8 or 9. Eventually this won't work, but below platinum 90 percent of opponents will have no idea what you're even doing, let alone how to counter it. This also increases the chances of your jungle coming to your lane.

3) Don't use flash offensively until you're proficient at wave control and other ADC fundamentals. Flashing for a kill in lane is rarely worth the 300 gold; its usually way better to flash an engage later. My level two all ins are complete trash, but I win a lot of lanes despite that because the enemy ADC uses flash for a kill.

4) A lot of new players will stop farming past laning phase. If this is the role you want to play, you have to have higher than average cs. After lane, farm jungle camps on the way to wherever you are going or on the way out of wherever you have been. 7 cs/m in gold and below is a great goal.

5) Stop dying. Other roles can die and still impact the game. ADC cannot. We have to be KDA players to be relevant. Otherwise you will coinflip every game.

6) Mute chat if you haven't yet.

Hope this helps!",1646092983

I honestly think that any reality show like this (or really, any reality show) should make it a part of the contract to attend therapy for a set amount of time after the show is over. These people aren‚Äôt just dealing with the repercussions of these relationships which can be very damaging, but they are also dealing with the social fall-out from people seeing how they acted. I honestly think it‚Äôs unethical to put people in this situation and then basically wash your hands of the fallout the cast faces. 

I also believe that this show isn‚Äôt about appearance and is actually about love being blind to red flags. IMO, these producers know what they are doing, and they are being completely irresponsible in how they deal with the cast. If it really is just about appearance, they should be vetting their contestants via therapists and mental evaluations before allowing them on the show. Instead, they don‚Äôt seem to care at all about ethics and continue cut corners just to save money. I can feel the capitalist greed rant coming, so I‚Äôll stop here. Lol",1646092983

I'm not saying he would get the exact OC he's looking for but by putting in some work he can get at lease some primary ones without waiting too long. It's not like he's going to stop playing because he got one out of 90-something OCs.",1646092983

My dad lived there for 18 years until he went to college. He kept seeing and hearing unexplainable things until he was about 13.

The wreckage down lake street was immense. Smoldering buildings produced a thick haze, broken glass everywhere, spray paint, the unique smell of burned buildings.

I saw people everywhere with brooms and trash bags they brought from home. A woman walked past me as I parked, walked up to a group of people picking up wreckage and asked how she could help. She was looking for something, ANYTHING to do. People brought water, snacks, offered to tow wreckage with their trucks.

People came from all over to help. It was one of the most profound places I've ever found myself in my life.

Compared to mainstream reddit subs spouting badly sourced missinformation and blatant lies (along with horrible advocating for violence, genocide, etc in contravention of reddit rules and being upvoted for it) r/Russia had minimal posting on the conflict itself as it was very locked down in the run-up to this. 

This is purely a political strike at the sub for not joining in the anti-Russia, pro-NATO festivities consuming reddit. 

This is disgusting and made doubly pathetic by the fact /r/Russia has been a victim of ceaseless high volume brigading and downvote bombing for days now since the crisis began and the admins now punish them instead of the brigaders!

"ArtefactPorn","t5_313fb","First defence: archaeologists take the long view of things. Tags eventually get separated from their objects, or fade, or tear off. Now, you may say that would never, ever happen. After all, the artifact is in a museum or library, looked after by experts. On the other hand, archaeologists know better. Some of the sites that we dig up ARE museums or libraries. And we are always reading about some unique and valuable ancient book that‚Äôs been discovered on the shelves of a great library. No one has looked at it for 400 years because no one knew it was there. There have also been incidents such as the priceless objects in the Baghdad Museum being looted after the Americans took over the city. A portion of them have been recovered. I assume the catalogue numbers were intact.

If you want to prevent that kind of information loss from happening, you have to make the tag part of the artifact. Here‚Äôs how I did it with stone tools and flakes:

put a layer of clear fingernail polish on a small area of the stone
let it dry
write the catalogue number on the fingernail polish with a steel-tipped pen
let it dry
cover the writing with another layer of clear fingernail polish.
let it dry
No material has been taken from the artifact. It is visually and chemically intact. The tag is proof against aging and wear and flood and even (depending on circumstances) fire. And if, at some future date, for some unknown reason, it were necessary to remove the catalogue number, a little acetone would do the job nicely.

For what it's worth, I read that the aluminum 19"" wheels on the XSE were soft and Toyota dealerships are seeing a lot of the 2021 XSE's come in with dents from potholes and need to be replaced. They apparently are very expensive to replace and are popular among thieves to steal because of their value and demand.

"UkraineWarVideoReport","t5_5wjmo8","From all the interrogation videos a consistent picture is this:

1. Troops were told they were going to Belarus/Crimea for a training exercise (Putin needed to preserve the lie, so he lied to his own troops) 

2. Most had their phones confiscated, officers included 

3. Conscripts were forced to change to contract status (legal requirement in Russia to partake in hostilities). 

3. Some were moved to the border then told to cross the border. Some tried to refuse but were threatened with prison. 

4. Others were flown somewhere and dropped off and weren‚Äôt told for hours that they were already in Ukraine. 

5. Some were told they were in Ukraine but they were told theyre still on a military exercise.  (When one captive asked how it makes sense hat Russia would train on Ukraine territory‚Ä¶ it was clear he never considered the absurdity of it before‚Ä¶ he was very confused and then admitted that he got ‚Äúfucked over‚Äù). 

There is a recording posted earlier from a trooper describing how utterly unprepared they were and how one of his 3 battalions got obliterated immediately and another got no working tanks left. 

6. Seems that only the more ‚Äúelite‚Äù units were told they‚Äôre going on a ‚Äúliberation‚Äù mission. They are confronted by civilians all over the place and are basically standing there embarrassed and dumbfounded.  



Bottom line - Russian troops don‚Äôt want to be there. 

Keep in mind - these are not societies hostile to each other. These are historically brotherly nations.  Most Russians have relatives  in Ukraine and vice versa. 

Putin was selling the same lies to his own people as he was trying to sell to the west. 

If most Russians were told the truth, he‚Äôd have no public support for it. 

And the soldiers are realizing they‚Äôve been duped.

I saw videos of Russians walking up to civilians and offering surrender and an apology‚Ä¶ once they realized what the fuck was happening. 

It‚Äôs a blunder of epic proportions.  

Russians, generally speaking, have no interest in killing Ukrainians. It‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs spiritual birthplace for real.",1646092990

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This also gives an idea of why Putin is threatening nuclear war; *any* direct, conventional intervention would seriously undermine this strategy in a way that he can't really respond to effectively. He has already  committed too much of his army to fighting Ukraine alone - if the Polish frontier opened he would need to pull back from his offensive and adopt a totally different, defensive strategy.

Which leads to one of two possible outcomes:

* Faced with no way to win conventionally any more, Putin (or a replacement) negotiates on unfavourable terms.

* Faced with no way to win conventionally any more, Putin uses nuclear weapons.

The second option seems to have so little upside that it's hard to imagine him actually pursuing it - at *best* it results in everyone's armies being so ruined that no further offensives are possible and there's a return to the pre-war status quo but with massive sanctions permanently in place.

Then I went to my first track day and was kinda surprised  that after a long (covid) break, I was immediately on pace without the usual Friday jitters.

Then as I got more into sim I started driving from the ""hood"" and my first track day I couldn't stop myself from turning in wayy too early (which sounds counter intuitive.. but, Maybe muscle memory was overcompensating?)

Next event I moved back to in-car sim view: went to the track and finished 3rd of 25+ cars, as a usual upper-midpack guy, landing a podium with serious competition was a blast. 

My takeaway: it doesn't always feel like you're being productive... And Frankly. It shouldn't.. it should be fun. But it rubs off on your muscle memory and really does help, even if the physics arent 100% accurate. I'm not really running faster on track, but I'm more consistent.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","Its NOT A FINE system, it was never designed as a retirement plan... it's started as tax shelter/dodge for executives in the 70s to shelter EXCESS income. Then the finance companies got a hold of it and figured they could make nice steady management fees as more corporations ditched traditional pensions for 401k only . Sure it's better than nothing (when companies offer a match), but that's not saying much.

In lieu of pensions we need a government backed REAL retirement plan, where the US government acts as a fiduciary (ie. has your best interest at heart and not trying to extract fees) and provides.inflation protected investment options (not just volatile stock market choices) , the plan should be universal, provide substantial tax advantages,  shouldn't be tied to any specific job (since many small businesses in the US dont offer 401ks) and it should be structured so it promotes responsible saving for retirement...it's. not that hard.

"chile","t5_2rer8","Voy a ser la persona que deba decirlo, pero Guarello es un imb√©cil en este caso y eso no es novedad. La diferencia radica en algo simple: La guerra es en Europa y la FIFA y todas esas organizaciones est√°n en Europa. Puedes viajar relativamente f√°cil entre las diferentes ciudades europeas con facilidad. As√≠ mismo, ac√° UK y las UE se han unido fuertemente para luchar contra Rusia y castigarla de todas las formas posibles.

&amp;#x200B;

¬øPor que cuando EEUU destruy√≥ Irak no vieron a nadie sancionado en ning√∫n deporte? Porque a diferencia de este caso en gran medida Europa estuvo dividida en el aspecto de la guerra en Irak. El consejo de seguridad de la ONU apoyo en su totalidad, 15-0, la resoluci√≥n 1441 y despu√©s EEUU presento evidencia falsa al respecto y gran parte de Europa estuvo involucrada en esa guerra. Mucho tiempo despu√©s se dio vuelta la tortilla de que  se hab√≠a entrado a la guerra con falsedad y despu√©s lleg√≥ Al Qaeda e ISIS y sus ataques terroristas en Europa. No hubo un momento donde hubiese un enemigo en com√∫n al que todos los pa√≠ses estuvieran en contra. 

&amp;#x200B;

De hecho, yo dir√≠a lo contrario. El hecho de que Rusia intentara hacer lo mismo que EEUU respecto de Ucrania es lo que llev√≥ al rechazo de la guerra y el fuerte apoyo a las sanciones contra Rusia. Especialmente porque ya se sab√≠a lo que se hizo en Crimea el 2014 y lo que hab√≠a estado haciendo en el este de Ucrania.",1646092992

"rva","t5_2qpvj","I appreciate how idealistic you are. But you've determined your views with no room for compromise. Not to mention you seem incredibly pessimistic. You want affordable housing and developers to always front  all costs for every large market rate development but don't seem to realize that without any incentive market rate housing would likely be even more expensive in many cases. You've further determined we should just build more public housing projects....because those were so successful....which comes at a comes at a cost to tax payers. Build a project that operates 100% on tax payer money or build a project that is funded entirely by the private market at the cost of like a 2% tax break....which one do you think is more affordable for the tax payer and the renter? Another thought exercise: taking the developers words at face value, if the project just barely squeaks by with a tax break at 63 units assuming a current market rate per unit, wouldn't you be able to infer that the developer would have to charge above market rate to make a profit without the incentive? How is that more affordable for renters? This is the premise behind tax credits for housing. Smaller public investments to help develop areas that left to the free market would likely remain undeveloped and under served.",1646092992

putin has fond memories of the soviet union and has been working for decades to try to regain the international power and influence of those (for him) glory days, and get back territory when he can. look into alexander dugan‚Äôs book [foundations of geopolitics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics), which seems very close to the playbook russia has been following for years.

"UpliftingNews","t5_2u3ta","&gt;Only one of them is being butthurt about the potential of using a word wrong though.

Conservatives fucking *love* to jump on and attack any potential weakness they see. People using confusing terms when talking about left leaning ideas like going green is a hotbed of them picking at the little details to discredit the whole idea to their audiences.

Take for example this article. I was confused by it as well because apparently exponents and exponential growth aren't anywhere near the same thing. With exponents the number is multiplied by itself three times. With exponential growth the rate of growth increases in proportion to the population size. So exponential growth of solar energy here means the larger the market for solar gets, the faster it expands. It doesn't literally go up exponentially, but the rate of increase rises in proportion to the market size.

But it's very easy to imagine a conservative talking head looking at a report like this and using the mathematical definition of exponents to mock the entire thing, since if that method were used we'd have solar generation comparable to 2015 levels by the year 2001.

So I understand the defensiveness and strong desire for literal correctness in use of words, even if the initial poster got things wrong themselves. Don't poke fun at them for being pedantic. Just be angry we have to be this defensive in the first place while we're trying to save the world from right-leaning idjits who'd burn the whole ship down around themselves just to make a buck.",1646092994

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt;I don't believe this so I won't answer.

Why do you believe Putin waited so long in between his 2014 incursion and this one? And we just happened to have an aggressive President who spoke loudly and carried a big stick? You think that was just coincidence?

What are your thoughts on the majority of Americans who think that Putin wouldn't have invaded with Trump as president?

&gt;He made it clear from the get go there would be consequences, and he's kept his word on that.

Sure, but Biden has openly admitted that his consequences weren't severe enough that he thought they would stop Russia. He basically told Putin directly that he knew sanctions wouldn't be enough to stop an invasion. 

If I have a lot of power, and use some it to pretend to stop an action from occurring, while I had way more power to use to prevent that same action that I know will occur, doesn't it stand to reason that I allowed that action to occur?

&gt;But if Russia did invade Ukraine under Trump's watch, I do think the media would be a bit more critical.

I agree. 

&gt;It would probably do something similar to what it's doing now, which is isolate Russia as much as possible.

Do you think it would be an acceptable world to live in where Russia rules over the majority of countries, with it's only competition being NATO countries?",1646092994

First two plots have case numbers on a linear scale, next two plots are exactly the
same but with case numbers on a log scale.

First (and third) plot show an exponential trendline, second (and fourth) are SIR
models that assume 27% of infections will be detected via testing.

Expected case numbers if the current  trend continues:

    day  cases  68% range
    ---------------------
    Wed:   589    428‚Äî764
    Thu:   583    413‚Äî768
    Fri:   575    399‚Äî773
    Sat:   568    386‚Äî775
    Sun:   561    372‚Äî775
    Mon:   551    357‚Äî778
    Tue:   544    345‚Äî776

The current doubling time is
1196.1 days.

Usual disclaimer about trendlines:

&gt; The plotted exponential trendlines in the above plots are simple extrapolations of
&gt; what will happen if Reff remains at its current value. the SIR model projection,
&gt; although it accounts for the effect of increasing immunity, still assumes that
&gt; Reff otherwise remains constant.
&gt; 
&gt; This does not take into account that things are in a state of flux. If
&gt; restrictions are tightened, the virus should have fewer opportunities for spread,
&gt; and Reff will decrease. If restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact
&gt; tracing may suppress spread to a greater or lesser degree over time. The above
&gt; plots specifically showing the effect of population immunity do take into account
&gt; a reduction in Reff as immunity due to infections increases, but ignores any other
&gt; possible future changes in Reff.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people
&gt; each infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of Reff to vary
&gt; randomly in time. As such the projections should be taken with a grain of salt‚Äîit
&gt; is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","Let's see

First I like to think Elizabeth is the first child to be killed.

Before her death in my headcanon Micheal nd Evan were cool. Siblings in the Afton family were originally pretty happy with each other.

Micheal did really loved nd cared about his brother and sister.

But when Elizabeth died things change.

They were able to see her death. And both were not able to save her because both didn't realize she was close to baby.

And with so many emotions inside to escape from the pain he put all blame to Evan in his mind. And that made him Evan's bully. So that he can blame someone else to escape from guilt.

That's why Baby or Ennard uses Elizabeth's voice when they get you are close to beat the secret night in SL. To make Mike remember that guilt again which he fully accepted when his brother met his demise as well. Resulting Mike to change as a person. Sad yet wiser and a more heroic one. Even if he can never call himself near that.

And for Evan Elizabeth's death effected him emotionally but it wasn't fear at first. He first tried find ways to maybe save her. Or try to understand why that animatronic killed her. How can that thing even do that.

I like to think Baby (AI) sees herself as a part of Afton family. And when she is alone she talks to Elizabeth who she sees as a sister. She doesn't listen to her when she tries to stop her from her bad deeds but still talking to her makes her not feel alone which she does not want to.",1646092995

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Hello /u/jbeezy80! Thanks for your submission to /r/NoStupidQuestions! However, the automoderator thinks you're asking a question about the situation between Ukraine and Russia and so has removed it (sorry!). It's natural to have questions about the situation going on right now, like:

* Why is Russia invading Ukraine?

* How is this different from when Russia seized Crimea, or when the US invaded Iraq?

* Couldn't Ukraine just join NATO? Why is NATO doing nothing? 

* Should people in nearby countries like Romania or Poland be scared?

* Is the USA going to join the war? Will there be a draft? 

* Can I join the Ukranian army if I'm not Ukranian?

* Is this all going to lead to nuclear war? Will Putin actually use nukes?

* Why do some people say 'the Ukraine' and others 'Ukraine'? Is it 'Kiev' or 'Kyiv'?

All of these are questions that come to mind easily! *Too* easily. We get each of those multiple times a day, and our users are a little tired of it. So we've created a megathread where you can post your question instead!  **Feel free to post your question in the megathread**!

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Hold up - after running off your dunce/hypocrite options, have we conceded that those labels should be applied to you rather than me? I ask because your lines of questioning and fear of engaging so many points is boring, so I'd at least like to see you display enough integrity to own your losses.

&gt; You‚Äôre failing to address ‚Äòanarcho‚Äô-communism‚Äôs failure to work in any unit over village size.

No - I've had no reason to explain the entirety of my prescriptions in detail, and you haven't pointed out why you think that's an obstacle - it's pretty dishonest for you to make such a claim. If I were to list the issues with anarcho-capitalist that you've failed to address, we'd be here all week, so instead, I'll ask about the NAP *yet again,* and how you plan to uphold it. I'm not the one failing to address issues here. 

&gt; But, also, you want a society where you don‚Äôt have to work to survive; even hunter-gatherers work to find shelter and food. So, how do you overcome *that* little hurdle?

I'm not advocating we return to being hunter gatherers, so I don't much care what they do. It's quite simple - we expand the welfare state to address people's core needs - food, shelter, healthcare, etc. That removes the coercive ""work or die"" choice you seem to depend upon, while preserving incentives to work. It may surprise someone with such an authoritarian ideology to learn this, but you don't need to threaten people with death to make them work - that's the domain of a slave master. The underlying tax system would also address the extremely destructive overwhelming power disparities associated with disproportionate wealth - power that's typically granted to you based on who your parents are, further dismantling undemocratic, authoritarian relationships.",1646092996

* If you watch porn, do what you can to stop. If you do not watch porn, do not begin for any reason whatsoever.
* Go the fuck outside. Lack of sunlight leads to higher chance of heart disease, loss of bone density, and cancer. Furthermore, the more you're outside, the more you're exercising, the more you exercise the less likely you are to succumb to obesity.
* For a job, find a balance between what pays well and what you enjoy. Enjoyment increases productivity, the more productive you are the better worker you are, and the better a worker you are the more likely you are to get promoted.
* Learn to fight and use a weapon. Become strong enough to protect yourself and what you love.
* Read, read, read. The unexamined life is not worth living, and it is only through knowing what others have known that we can examine life. Furthermore, knowledge is power.
* Where you recognize evil, speak out against it, and give your enemies no peace.

Could be forgetting something, but this is quite a good start in my opinion.",1646092996

"DungeonWorld","t5_2ud8c","I think you're asking for something VERY difficult.

Dungeon World, and PbtA in general, is very open and creative and flowing.  Minecraft, being a video game, is very mechanical and structured.  The core appeals of the two are at odds with each other.  It's like chili and sorbet - great, but not together.

Minecraft, even with mods, won't really get the freedom of action I like from DW.  Like, there's mods about exploring and magic and such, but they're all part of a very different core game.

You could theoretically make a PbtA game that's about Minecraft/the Minecraft world.  I think that's your best bet.  You could make it center around a resource management game - health not restoring on rest, so you have to balance food, iron, diamonds, armor, arrows, base building, et cetera.  Uplift the villagers, pillagers, piglins, and endermen into full interactive tabletop NPCs, add all sorts of funky dungeons that aren't in the normal game, use made up monsters, stuff from Dungeons and various mods... it *can* work, but in the ""minecraft novels for kids"" sort of way.  You won't get the appeal of tech-modded or redstone to hit the same in DW.  Those systems are analogous to optimizing in crunchy games, moreso even board games, in terms of the type of enjoyment.

But, again, these games have very different appeals.  As someone who adores both of them, I think any hybrid is gonna lose something from one, probably both, experiences.  But even so, if you're gonna pursue this further, I'd be glad to bounce ideas.  I'm making a game that, while not MC themed, is in the sort of space you seem to be targeting - freeform creativity, but with enough crunchy bits to scratch that itch too.

On the other side of it, you can totally make a Minecraft pack with magic and exploration as a focus.  I'm doing that, like, right now, in another tab - currently I'm enhancing the loot of the dungeons that are all over the world.  After that I'm gonna make all the magic systems integrate together.  It's not hitting the same free and creative notes as DW, but it does have the fantasy environment.  Similarly, you can go for some prebuilt experiences - vanilla mapmakers have gotten *very* good lately, and you can all be players there.  I exist more in the modded space, so I dunno what's good there, but I know there's a lot of neat stuff.  There's also Vault Hunters, which looks like it's more made for experienced modded players?  But it looks really cool, if you're willing to git gud over a few attempts, probably.",1646092996

A levy or sea wall will not protect Sacramento, because the pressure of the ocean will push groundwater up. Additionally it would need to be massive and water would need to be constantly pumped and redirected. Building roads though mountains is something we've been doing since the early days.

I'm really, really not one to overhype games to the point where I've grown more and more cynical each year. Sure, I still play games here and there, but for a long time there hasn't been anything that had the ability to really grip me. There were some cool games, but *yeah*.  
  
But *this* game. This *fucking* game. I'm in absolute disbelief over this game. And all I wanted originally was simply ""another Fromsoft fantasy game, even if the open world is boring, as long as I've got the legacy dungeons"".

Cowart hasn't been able to crack the roster. He is a pass rushing DT/NT. He hasn't been able to succeed at DE in CFB. Probably has the wrong mix. Too big for DE and too small for DT.

"TolerantEurope","t5_5fhhtk","Sigh. Here we go. 

No it is not ideal for a tolerant europe. Agree. But let us be clear. You do not define My history and the collective experience and records of My People. 

During ww1 there were 2 bosniak regiments. It consisted of muslims, catholics and orthodox. It was bosniak in name and appearance (the fez most notably) and Saw action in the italian alps and in galicia. 

During ww2 there was indeed a bosniak SS regiment. It was stationed in Vichy France and on the eastern front. It did not partake in action in the Balkans because they never got the oppurtunity. The nazi croatian puppet state annexed bosnia and drew volounteers and forced conscriptions as the nazis did. 

When the war was about to be ended about 20 % of bosnias muslims disappeared in the hands of the partisans...you think we - as a People - dont know that? 

History is what it is. I simply extended context to what that woman must feel given her very real experience and i know plenty of serbs and croats who feel the same way about One another. 

Is it the right way forward? Fuck no. It isn't.",1646092998

Thus leaving me there, to sob and try to regulate myself all alone. She eventually came back after a few minutes, but never explained why she left or apologized for doing it.

 If people feel a sense of relief from someone's behavior or actions, if those actions are positive and empathetic, and they can find inspiration in that person, there's nothing wrong with showing support for that person. I agree there's some people going over the top and being a bit fanatic about him but fuck it, the world is so stirred up and negative, let people enjoy the small pockets of positive action that comes out of the encroaching daily hell and let that empathy thrive. This inspiration leads to people becoming better people and that's pretty hard to argue against.

This isn't valid at all.

So do I have anything to add? A little, again I stress virtually everything you see on screen has been paid off or is on the way to being paid off. While I did pick up the manga already I strongly suspect I will recommend to any first timers to watch through S2 before picking it up unless JC Staff pulls a 7DS. 

But viewed on its own, the season itself is a satisfying story. We have our arcs, our proposal and our OTP so it is pretty self contained. The comedy mainly works for me but I understand why it doesn't for everyone and the pace was frenetic at times that the VAs were definitely rushing out their lines.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I don't expect it or rely on it of my parents, but I do expect that they would WANT to help out. In my family, and my husband's, being there in that capacity for one's family is a huge component. To have mine or my husband's parents outright turn us down for assistance would be surprising. However we also know that we can't abuse their kindness, and so we are careful not to. In the end, we get to enjoy alone time occasionally, and our parents get to enjoy spending time with their kid's kid, which I think is how it ought to be - not a chore for them, but instead something special. As a parent myself (and someone who doesn't vibe with kids), I am already fully prepared to be as present in my daughter's kids lives as she wants me to be because to me, looking after my grandchild is an extension of looking after my child. Obviously though, I'm really lucky to have family who drop everything to help out with the kids whenever and wherever, and I understand that this is not always the norm.",1646093001

In fact, it was the lack of regulation of Texas‚Äô non-renewable energy that caused the blackouts. However, the media machine of the oil and gas industry was incredibly effective at spreading the lie that renewables were at fault.

"FemaleDatingStrategy","t5_xaiot","Oh my GOD I was going to say the same thing. When I shop I always put either a substitute if there's a brand I prefer, a Do Not Substitute if I MUST have this exact brand, or ""Use best judgement"" if I don't care what brand it is I just want some fricken lasagna noodles, or Ask Me when I want the item, but need control over what the specific sub is without knowing what is available.

Women? Can use judgment and get me what I need. 

Men though? Men will either: 

A) Message for EVERY SINGLE ITEM (even those with specified substitutes). 

B) Make dumbass inexplicable substitutions. Like - I asked for a blend of coconut milk and almond milk. This shit is in the freezer. Motherfucker buys coconut water. WHY? Or I ask for a 3 lb roast. I guess there was no 3lb roast because this asshole purchased 2 x 2.5lb roasts. WHY?? Or, the most baffling one that I still don't understand -- ordered some lip balm...on the order receipt ""substituted with"" GLUE. FUCKING GLUE YOU GUYS.

C) Message for some substitutes and not others - and this is super infuriating particularly when they don't ask before substituting for the items I specifically ask them to text me about. And yet do the opposite for other items. AND THEN even when they do ask THEY DONT LISTEN. For example, this one asshole messaged to tell me the store was out of baguettes. I had ordered 5. I asked if they had  other brands of baguette, or even just french bread. He texted me a picture of a pack of 6 sub rolls - which, as we know, are neither french nor baguettes, they're like glorified hot dog buns. I said no - I do not want those, skip. Guess what I received? 5 packs of the 6 sub rolls. So I had 30 subs I did not ask for. 

I haven't always had perfect experience with women shoppers but I have NEVER had as bad an experience with a female shopper as a male shopper. Women shoppers text me afterwards to thank me for my detailed notes and substitutions. I can't even say it's weaponized incompetence because in this case what are they trying to achieve even? They're just...inept. They've spent their entire lives being catered to by mommy or their GFs and now for the first time they're doing this job which they assume is sooo easy cos the women can obviously do it and they just are So.

"FASCAmazon","t5_ez8rn","Absolutely - A hardship transfer is a request by an employee to move and work in another employer location because of personal circumstances. 

The employee does not lose his/her job but gets a same or similar position in the new area. 

As long as you have worked at least 60 days with Amazon, you are eligible for a hardship transfer. This can be done via HR at your local FC. Typically HR will have you fill out a hardship transfer form,  and then upon review they will typically approve but there is always a chance you might be denied. (For instance the FC you want to transfer too might not be accepting Hardship Transfers).

Another option is if you speak with your OPs manager about the situation they might be willing to work with you provided you are on good terms with Amazon. 

It reflects much better on your previous OPs manager if they are involved with a transfer, a normal transfer VS an employee potentially quitting or circumventing OPs and going right to HR for a Hardship Transfer.

You have options, I encourage you to utilize them, good luck!",1646093003

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;	chill dude we‚Äôre having a discussion

No, we weren‚Äôt. You weren‚Äôt providing enough information to have a discussion, and your a) contrary take on chinas response, b) brevity, and c) lack of/further failure to provide any supporting information (and nothing remotely resembling your claims showing up on google) made me think you were acting in bad faith.

Now we can actually have a discussion.

I don‚Äôt think your first citation supports the idea that they are anything more than trading partners. A former Soviet satellite with a surplus of half finished military equipment and an economic deficit sold that equipment to the most eager global buyer, after no one else wanted it. The fact that they had to go through commercial cut outs is even more indicative of purely economics (or graft) being the motivation. There is nothing about reciprocity and there is nothing about training.

[China receives more military equipment from France, and substantial amounts from Germany, Switzerland, and Britain. ](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3139603/how-china-grew-buyer-major-arms-trade-player#:~:text=Where%20else%20does%20China%20import,Ukraine%20(6.3%20per%20cent).) 
This level of trade [has not spared France from the attention of the wolf warriors.](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210323-wolf-warriors-and-a-crazed-hyena-french-researcher-not-intimidated-after-clash-with-china-envoy). Definitely not the type of behavior I would expect if arms trade indicated close allegiance.

This is definitely a situation where I disagree with Chomsky. [I find the argument that a democratized Ukraine threatens Putin‚Äôs power much more convincing.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/what-makes-putin-fear-ukraine) That danger lead to threats and attacks, those threats and attacks pushed Ukraine to further embrace the west. [Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over Crimea and Ukrainian economic and political determination since the fall of the USSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_relations). In this context, Chomskys argument essentially becomes, Ukraine should just accept Russian rule, because they can‚Äôt resist independently, and according to Chomskys analyses here, they also shouldn‚Äôt turn to NATO. Frankly, that‚Äôs simply appeasement.

Turning back to China, you are right they are in a bind, it just has nothing to do with Ukraine in the specifics. They are very import dependent for food and luxury goods their ruling class wants, and very export dependent to drive there economy. They want a world order where they are free from western influences and can pursue their territorial ambitions, but are also completely dependent on the west economically. IMO that‚Äôs why the official tone changed when the extent of the sanctions became apparent and not when Russia started no bing Kiev.

That doesn‚Äôt mean that you should allow every team into the playoffs, but 12 teams really isn‚Äôt that bad, nor is 14 teams. 

The only negative consequence seems to be in the eyes of diehards who for some reason think everyone will lose interest in the regular season if they expand playoffs.

You're, missing the other premises before the conclusion, is not that you're wrong for asking for censorship, it's that if you're in favor of frees speech, you can't be in favor of censorship. Those positions can't exist together, for reasons explained before, and you claim to be in favor of free speech as such you're in a contradictory position.

You're not trying to kill in self-defense, you're either killing preemptively or killing because they have killed, neither is self-defense. As you said later, they're not attacking you right now, mostly for lack of power, but the fact is that they're not doing it, as such you have no claim to self-defense.

The reasons why you think it's bad are both understood and irrelevant really, at least on the argument I presented over free speech. if you're not in favor of free speech then I guess I would have try to convince you that it's a good thing first, but, since the first comment, we both agree you already see it as a good thing.

Your main claim is that given x,y, and z reasons they should be banned, but those are all arbitrary points, you can say that they should be banned because they like bananas, and it would have the same validity at the end of the day. As such there's no point in arguing about x,y, and z, because that's already in your definition, instead, I'm apeling to a deeper point of arguing against censorship, not censorship under some pretends but under any, keeping in mind difference between censorship and withholding someone accountable for their actions.

Yes, their position is inherently against freedom of speech, but so is yours, what is the point here? we're going back to killing the killers, you adopt a position against freedom of speech to prevent a position against freedom of speech, don't you see how that's counterproductive by nature?

It doesn't matter who started the situation, or their intention, as you said this isn't school, you have your own position, that between other things claims to be in favor of freedom of speech, therefore, going against it because someone else started it, is ridiculous. That's like saying I'm a pacifist but if you punch me my first response will be to punch you back, well then you're not a pacifist.

As stated before, if you're against their position and still don't try to ban it is the mark of being in favor of freedom of speech. What you're doing is not that, and to say that you do it to defend freedom of speech is hypocritical at best.",1646093003

If you ever want to come back to reality.. spend some quality time with me (your old pal Stranger) then come on down, doors always open and I'll be here forever (just let my mom know youve come to visit me, ignore her asking to make you something to eat). Good luck ole friend.
   
     Always and forever,
           Stranger-",1646093003

"discordapp","t5_388p4","&gt;I'm saying that if, on one side you have a randomized clinical trial showing a specific conclusion, and on the other hand you have several government or corporate ""recommendations"" that the opposite is true, we should be allowed to consider quality of evidence, rather than just quantity.

This has nothing to do with government or corporations though? It's ""the medical community"", sure some of the medical community are members of corporations or governments but I don't think that group has a majority enough to make consensus by themselves.

&gt;New information may be discovered that proves everyone wrong. And especially during a pandemic, when we barely know anything at all for sure, that information may change rapidly. To pretend there IS certainty is the problem. There is absolutely not enough certainty that we can declare unpopular ideas untrue.

I don't see your point here, new information was discovered, and the medical consensus changed, and so the guidance changed. Nobody is pretending there is certainty but you have to pick some way of measuring trust and declaring that's the best way to do things.

**The question I'd like you to answer most is,** I'm not sure what you want discord to do? Employ a medical researcher to read every published paper and decide what is and isn't misinformation? Or just give up and allow people to spread whatever misinformation they like? How are they supposed to know what is fact vs. misinformation when they aren't experts?",1646093004
