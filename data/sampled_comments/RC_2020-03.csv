1. An image that looks like a meme but has no joke or punchline

2. A meme template that is taken literally, therefore removing its intended comedic purpose

[Here is a guide on what is and is not an antimeme](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/eatqu4/a_guide_of_what_to_post/). An antimeme is NOT r/boneachingjuice or r/speedoflobsters. Those types of memes belong on their own subs.

Even then however, you will still end up with dies that have multiple defects or fail to hit the intended clock speeds.

So having a target market for those second rank chips is in no way an unreasonable thing to do - it's basically standard operating procedure for CPUs and GPUs.

Any impact that this will have from a developer's perspective should be reasonably easy to mitigate with an adequate SDK.

"volleyball","t5_2rcxy","a. The roster did deteriorate from last season. There are improvements with Vettori but that's nothing compared to losing a reliable back-up. He's going to choke in a big game. You know it.

b. Modena from last season =/= this season.
Check the stats of Zaytsev. I watched the games. There's no need to play it like your observation is the only truth. Both can be true.

c. It was a catastrophe in my eyes but it is subjective. Achieving the triplete and winning only a single cup after bringing the best player in the world is not a particularly great result.

d. Lisinac is a monster this season but his serve have been inconsistent for some time. Worst it got to was during the Champions League game with Budejovice.

This isn't a big problem if Vettori or Russell are serving alright but they have just one bench server and Codarin does not have a powerful one to break Lube's reception.

Nelli used to do that for Trentino but he's gone. Djuric couldn't play without using two subs and I doubt he can do better than the three or even impove if he only plays a maximum of 10 mins?!? of game time this season... so far.",1583020801

"startrek","t5_2qixm","Like I said before, I watched the leaked episode last Thursday. I have now written down a more detailed summary. Contains everything that I remembered from my first viewing experience:

HEAVY SPOILER WARNING!

Here is what happened to Hugh:

&gt;!... first he was captured by the Romulans. (Elnor first managed to escape and hide.) Narissa interrogated him and wanted to know how Soji and Picard could escape. Hugh refused to answer her questions. Then she lined up his patients (the Borg XBs) and get them shot dead by a firing squad in front of his eyes. \[Once again, unfortunately, a lot of gleeful and unnecessary violence.\] He collapsed crying on the floor. Narissa told him that she unfortunately could not kill him, too, because he still has the status of a diplomat. !&lt;

&gt;!Later in the episode, after a lot of the A-plot at Riker's new home planet was shown to the audience, they briefly returned to the cube. Hugh, who was allowed to run around the hallways again, met Elnor and they discussed their further plans. Unfortunately he was under surveillance by Narissa ... so suddenly a Romulan security squad arrives out of nowhere to confront them. Narissa declares that Hugh just violated his treaty obligations as a diplomat by planning a conspiracy against his Romulan hosts. Therefore he has no longer diplomatic protection. She and her hit squad then immediatley try to kill both men. !&lt;

&gt;!First, Hugh manages to escape, while Elnor takes out the guards. Then we get a Matrix-Style Kung-Fu battle featuring Narissa and Elnor. Both insult each other in Romulan language and the new lore that was introduced in Episode 4 (that the Zhat Vash and the Warrior Nuns hate each other in Romulan society) is used as a background for an intense hand combat sequence. When Hugh tries to intervene, sticking his neck around the corner, Narissa suddenly throws a hidden blade at him ...  the blade meets its target and cuts halfway in his throat. Elnor tries to comfort Hugh while Narissa beams away because she was in danger of losing her fight. !&lt;

&gt;!Hugh got a few lines left that he whispers to Elnor, then he loses consciusness. I assume that this was meant to be a death scene. The only hope for him would be that he was just poisoned - but which doctor would save him now in hostile Romulan territory? So I guess he is dead.!&lt;

Other important events in Episode 7:

&gt;!\- The episode begins with a flashback to the scene where Commodore Oh meets Dr. Jurati in Episode 3. This time the audience is allowed to follow their interactions longer than last time. Oh tells Jurati that she wants to recruit her for a special mission that will demand a lot (of sacrifices?), then she forcefully mind-melts with her for ten seconds. We see ultra quick cuts of events that might happen in the future (if the Androids run the Alpha Quadrant in the future?) that show violence and destruction of federation buildings and ships. This seems to imply that Commodore Oh is either from an alternative future or was also mind-melted before with someone from this future. Otherwise she wouldn't be able to show Jurati these pictures. After ten seconds Jurati collapses and starts crying.!&lt;

&gt;!EDIT: To be clear, that these violent pictures in Juratis mind are from an alternative future is only a speculation from me by now. Could be pictures from a past tragedy as well.!&lt;

&gt;!\- In the C-Plot of the episode Narek is able to secretly follow Rios and his ship because Jurati was forced to swallow a tracking device by Commodore Oh. Rios detects that he is followed by a Romulan and is becoming suspicious how that is possible. He then tells Jurati that he is suspicous of Raffi. Jurati gets a guilty conscience and tries to puke the device out of her stomach. She collapses on the floor of sickbay and is found by the EHM.!&lt;

&gt;!\- Seven is not in the episode, but in the last scene someone (I think it was Elnor, if i remember correctly) plans to contact her with the hidden communication device she left on the ship.!&lt;

\- That said the A-plot was really really good. I highly recommend the episode for old TNG fans. Riker and Troi interacting with Picard for one episode was simply amazing. Not cheesy or clunky or weird, but really really good. The A-plot is in a way like ""Family (TNG 4x02)"" and covers 80 percent of the episode. Some spoilers about the plot on Planet Riker:

&gt;!\- Riker and Troi had two children, a boy and a girl. Like her mother Lwaxana, Deanna had to deal with a tragedy, one child died early. Her son had a rare disease and could not get treatment with advanced technology because the federation banned all synth-technology in 2386. So the Rikers have a little bit of a grudge against the federation as well, but are still living a relative satisfying retirement. They are still full of joy, not of hate (like Seven).!&lt;

&gt;!\- Maybe because her teenage daughter, Khestra, gives them joy every day. She immediatly befriends a traumatized Soji and tells her stories about Data and the good old TNG days.!&lt;

&gt;!\- The A-plot has many nice scenes with Riker and Picard together. Riker is not portrayed as broken or bitter, but rather cheerfull, concerned for Jean Luc and witty. He is Number One again and offers his old captain help for his mission. But Picard declines, alrady afraid that Romulan killers might show up soon on this planet as well. Riker mentions that he is still on reserve duty for Starfleet.!&lt;

&gt;!\- Soji first refuses to trust her new ""friends"". Troi, Khestra and Picard all have to join forces to make her feel welcome and earn her trust. Troi can feel emotions in Soji and in one scene talks to Khestra in a telepathic way of communication, like Lwaxana did to her in TNG.!&lt;

&gt;!\- Soji finally tells her new friends about her dream in the previous episode. Khestra is able to google the planet that Soji saw in her mind when she ""looked up"", while the adults were still guessing which planet could it have been. The A-plot ends with the decision of Picard and Soji to travel to this planet. Rios, who was able to get away from Narek, is picking them up at the end of the episode.!&lt;",1583020802

Once the government has taken his means of harming you, and others like his, they will become powerful enough that they will not need you vote as no one else can challenge them for power.

In my case, someone harms you and you have the power to regulate them. If its the CEO of a large company - strike, if its an mugger - whip out a gun etc. Police, medicare, an army, and other social services will exist and have vast amounts of power, however, they will never have enough power that they control all parts of your life.

I'm in bed at the exact same time every night, and I make sure i get at least 8 hours of sleep, though there is no difference between sleeping and being awake. After having a glass of moderately lukewarm milk and doing 20 minutes of stretches, I have no problem sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. Or maybe i do, I really can't tell. I was told that each and every one of my bones was twisted into the shape of a horseshoe at my last checkup. 

I'm explaining that i'm an ideology that wishes to live a very moderate life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning or losing, although i see literally no difference between those two things. Sticking my head in the sand and ignoring the world's problems keeps me from losing sleep at night. That is how i deal with society, and i know that is what brings me happiness.

But if neither of you can choose, then do neither - live in an entirely new state.

My boyfriend and I have spoken about what we can do to ensure that our kids see and know my family. It would include long holidays in the UK every summer and winter, regular video calling with cousins and grandparents, and maybe even an exchange program so they can study in the UK for a little bit. We've even had conversations about where I would give birth because of citizenship 😂

To be honest, I would recommend for the sake of your girlfriend, it would be fairer for you to live closer to her family. This is because women go through a lot during pregnancy and after a child is born, and grandparents tend to be closer to the daughter's children, than the son's.",1583020805

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","I'm doing an MPhil at Cambridge and I won't lie to you - the teaching quality is very low at master's level. I did my BA at a much lower ranked uni and I feel that it actually was of a higher quality as a course than Cambridge in any given year. The MPhil's here really are just money-makers/chances for people to create good networks before pursuing an academic career. In short (and to be brutally honest), the master's courses are not worth the money - especially if you've already done a master's. I have met many students who feel the same way in many different programmes. But if you have enough income to pay for it with ease, why not I suppose. Just keep in mind that it really is more about paying for the name of Cambridge than really doing much to help you intellectually imo. But it's what you make of it.",1583020805
"AskMen","t5_2s30g","going 100% raw (no condoms, no BC) the first time is the WORST way to go unless you are okay with the possibility of getting pregnant right away. definitely start off with condoms, at the very least. 

get used to each other and sex with each other, and also learn how your own body reacts to sex as well. then you can start talking about alternative methods (BC, pull out method which i don’t recommend on its own..but w/e)

you have EVERY RIGHT to ask him to wear a condom. i i don’t trust any man who would risk pregnancy/STDs rather than just wearing a damn condom. i understand it doesn’t feel as great, but it feels even less great when she hits you with that “i’m late” text",1583020805

Only concern is Asura's 5-turn damage mitigation. Suppose that I bring AWoL and I wait till her damage mitigation wears off, then by the time I plan to attack, then she would've been blinded several times, thus raising her immunity.

Even if I attack during the first 5 turns, no matter how strong my DPS units are, they will barely do damage due to the damage mitigation. During the 1 star battle, I've seen her re-cast her damage mitigation before it wore off. In another case, I've seen her re-apply it shortly after it wore off.

If we assume that the universe is purely homogeneous (in a different sense from the cosmological principle), and if we assume that physical causality is the driving force of all things, then it would make sense to assume that we are part of a large ""ring"" (sphere) of habitable conditions emanating from the centre of the universe (big bang). At our current time, our galaxy might be one of many which has the exact same kinds of worlds that house us. 

We might be on Earth #69, out of the thousands of exact replicas of Earth and life there. There might be another version of me, writing this exact comment on Reddit in every other Earth out there, right now.

The alternative is that the universe was never purely homogeneous at all, and we are unique to this particular universe.

"entitledparents","t5_358dh","Read this comment in its entirety or get banned. Consider checking out /r/entitledredditors instead. If you contact us with a question that can be answered by this comment, you will be banned permanently and your internet will be revoked.  

Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. **Go to https://old.reddit.com/user/me/ to see both kinds of karma.** Use desktop mode. If you claim to have enough comment karma because you don't understand there are 2 kinds of karma, you will be banned.   

The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.  

Questions? Everything you could possibly ask us has been answered. Again: **if you ask us a question that can be answered by this message, you will be banned.**

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Warren receiving assistance from Persist PAC is disappointing and it goes against the values of her campaign but I don't think it undermines her credibility. 

I think it does undermine her credibility to some extent... just a few months (weeks?) ago she was saying that she wouldn’t accept “a dime” from a super PAC. She used that as a talking point, saying that every other candidate was using one (Sanders “super PAC” was a nurse’s union, Yang’s “Math PAC” was worth like $20), and then flipped overnight when she was given a massive ad buy from a super PAC with undisclosed donors. 

She’s still the second choice for me and probably most other Sanders supporters, but optically it looks like it fits into a pattern of willingness to compromise on core ideals. She made a big deal out of not accepting help from super PACs, accused others (sort of falsely in some cases) of relying on them, and then accepted 7-8 digits in spending",1583020810

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt;First off, licensing requirements are not minimal. They require a passing stepwise examinations and staying up-to-date on required CME hours. What else are you expecting?

They are minimal.

Furthermore, something i forgot to mention, is that most continuing education is paid for by drug companies. That's how we had tens of thousands of doctors still believing ""oxycontin isn't addictive"" and ""xanax is ok for alcoholics"" as late at 2010.

\&gt; Are you arguing that we shorten medical school, or that we combine undergraduate education with medical school?

Yes to both. More residency and field experience, less school. Allow for field experience to replace undergraduate education. Undergrad, IMO, is pointless. Everything learned in undergrad should be learned in high school, or skipped completely. We don't teach these things in high school because we have to slow our schools down to accommodate the lowers common denominator. I am also an advocate of home schooling, for those capable of it.

\&gt;That will just discourage rounded students from applying because they are not certain what they want to do.

That's the point, and also the problem we are trying to solve. We don't need undecideds becoming doctors. Most nurses are not undecided, as they begin their nursing programs very early in undergrad. It's a calling. it needs to be a calling. instead, most doctors get into it because of the income potential. They get locked into a track they aren't interested anyway because it's too late to turn back by the time they figure out what they want to specialize in. So that's how we end up with a massive oversupply of plastic surgeons and speech pathologists and a massive shortage of general practitioners and trauma surgeons, arguably the two most critical positions in the healthcare field.

My doctor is someone i can trust. Why? because she wanted to be a doctor but couldn't afford med school, so she joined the marines and became a medic. Then became an EMT firefighter, then a paramedic, got a nursing degree, then a nurse practitioner license. Then her own patients, myself included, recognized her talent and raised enough for her to finish her doctorate. THAT is a doctor. Some spoiled kid who got bullied into college by his counselors or parents then figured out they could make alot of money if they go to med school after three years of partying, should never be a doctor, and never will be a doctor no matter how many credentials you tack onto the end of their name.

\&gt; Not trying to harp on my rad friends either, there is no way I could do what they do.

You should at least have a basic understanding to be able to step in and notice when they are making mistakes. Because i can assure you, those people likely could do 90% of your job for you should you suddenly drop dead in the middle of a critical procedure, and they are mostly competent enough notice your mistakes. Cross competency is important in eliminating the chance of negligent mistakes. We have incredibly high rates of malpractice in this country - almost all of which can be traced to a lack of cross-competency and cross-responsibility. Things are too segmented, as you say, and too much information falls through the cracks on both personal and institutional levels.

\&gt;  Do you really want your primary care provider managing your ventilator settings or performing a heart cath.

If you do not understand how to do this as a doctor, i would not trust you to become my doctor. The nurses should be better at it, but you should be competent at it as well. Otherwise, see above point about catching each other's mistakes.

\&gt; Your argument that they are the only ones on the front line treating patients is just as ridiculous.

i've been hospitalized three times in my life and i never met the doctors who handed down my diagnoses. They were always a mysterious character in a back office. And their diagnosis was wrong, all three times. I saw other doctors during my stay, but their jobs seemed at best, symbolic. Sign on the dotted line, make sure meds are proper, do some bedside compassion moves, onto the next patient.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Certainly if I was the only physician on an island I would do whatever I felt like I could

Our healthcare system is fragile, and will be easily broken by this virus precisely because you have spent your entire life assuming you will never have to assume the role of ""sole physician on the island"".

\&gt; Generally, in medicine very few people are searching for new ways to treat things, because if they do this they are abandoning the established ways to treat things. Certainly there is bench research being done, and ongoing research studies, but a lot of these research studies are poorly designed and full of bias. That is why we generally wait for the standard of care to change.

All bets are off when lives are at stake and time is limited. This applies to epidemics of novel or rare diseases more than anything else. And it is in these times of crises, that you will be truly tested for your worth. There are years when weeks happen, and there are weeks when years happen.

\&gt; Medicine is so vast, which is why we have specialties. There is too much medical research and knowledge to try and learn everything.

Of course you can't learn everything. But there is value in being well-rounded. Otherwise you can't see the forest from the trees, and fail to apply occam's razor - and that's a trap (judging by your response) that you have fallen into as well.",1583020810

Quality wise it's every bit what you'd expect from a Leatherman tool, but stripped to the minimum. The Style CS doesn't even have pliers, the main tool is a medium/small scissors. They also have the Style PS, which has a small pliers and swaps the knife for a small scissors.

I personally don't need pliers on the regular, or the added weight of a full size multi-tool. And as cool as the Skeletool looks I prefer having a solid set of scissors handy. I'd say if you prefer having a full size tool the Wave sets the bar for use, and comfort.",1583020811

_______________

This galaxy, known as Centaurus A recently had a small jet discovered in within it [by a team of scientists in 2017!](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/4056/4609363) The jet, which is being shot from the galaxy's black hole, as a whole is broken into 3 distinct portions. Jet A, B, and the most recently discovered portion, C. The paper above used 50 hours on a 2.2 m telescope to achieve an image of the 'C' jet, but they also had help from an amateur astronomer named Rolf sunk *130* hours into the target as well. Sadly though, even after 130 hours, still no C jet emerged. Rolf's image is by far the deepest I have ever seen someone expose on this target. [I made a comparison image between all three being my own, Rolf's, and scientist's who discovered the jet](https://i.imgur.com/TfGGXFX.png). 

One of the most interesting things I find in the posted image though, is [the additional red to the bottom of the galaxy. Are these additional jets?](https://i.imgur.com/3IoUG3G.png) Possibly, but I am not sure. Sadly, scientist tend to focus on the known jet region for observations, so professional views of the lower area are lacking currently. Maybe this will go from the first amateur image of the C jet, to the first image of jets that were considered undiscovered. 

The equipment that went into this image was a Takahashi TOA-150B telescope and an FLI16200 camera using HαLRGB filters for a combined total of 67.5 hours. While these are definitely expensive pieces of equipment, they are still considered amateur pieces in the scientific realm amazingly enough. Mainly due to them being available to consumers, and equipment of this quality is generally not suited for serious observations where as scientific observatories cost *millions* of dollars, not thousands.

That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and the teacher got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on a classmate. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. He should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over him, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the teacher didn't agree with me. She KICKED ME OUT of the classroom, and I didn't even finish taking the test. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my cum after it already dried out and solidified on the carrpet. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean dried cum? You CLEAN cum after its FRESH out of your dick, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT quadratic on a test? Either make the equations less sexy, or LET ME jack off in your classroom, asshole.

I wish Madden would make a strategy guide/Tip-website that explains every details the developers   Know. Or something that explains what a soft squat and cloud flat defend vs all formations/motions and routes (Honestly don’t think they have resources to regurgitate the actual code to the normal player)

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","The draw distance is extreme for planets and landing zones. Show me another game that does that without replacing it with a sky box or flat texture (not many that will - mostly because its not necessary).  How do you think you can see Lorville from space?  That's not faked.  Yes I know they use speed tree.  I am not a novice to 3d asset generation, LOD's, texturing and the like as I do it myself.  But you want better performance and smoother multi play and massive scale with tons of complex objects all with complex physics, you got to unburden the client and physics calcs as best you can.  LOD's are dropped out of site at above 5K for ships mostly (Im guessing here, cant remember, but its not super close), but the environments less so although you will be at a very low LOD at distance.

In a vacuum you can do all that but the environment per object container that dictates what is streamed in at the time, has to also take into account what may show up there.  With more closed loop games you have a lesser number of assets you have to worry about.  Or rather what you load up you are pretty much know definitively what that is in a controlled area.  SC assets cannot all be loaded at once - so you have to have wiggle room or suffer performance issues.

If the area is devoid of other players and ships then you can back in more polys extra textures, less aggressive culling, etc.  I believe the trees, rocks and other flora have their own textures (Layered of course to get the depth needed up close - like the clothing).

Baking them into one decreases draw call per object.  So more objects equals more draw calls, plus real shadows will take client performance on more trees, additionally more polys affects this with more complex lighting and shadows.  1 tree at 1,000,000 polys would be more efficient to render than 1000 trees at 1000 polys.  So its a combination of things.  Plus this way its easier to stream.  If we moved slower in the game it would also be better, but SC has high speeds which make it even harder to complicate the ground assets if they are overly complex geowise. They still have poly budgets with this game.

While engines like Cry really crunch polys, it still matters in the over all scheme, and the more you can squeeze from one area performance wise can free you up to do other things.  More polys on trees mean more complex collision proxies and so on.  But anyways, I'm just saying there are reasons for things sometimes other than they just are being lazy.  Perhaps when Vulcan is implemented and the physics refactor we will see better on the planets.",1583020816

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","**Viticulture: EE** vs **Tapestry** as a competitive game.  

Is there an established meta in these games? I know Viticulture cleaned up what was perceived to be an over-centralizing strategy and Tapestry has altered some of the civilizations.  

I'm looking at both of them and I was hoping I could get some input on them from those who have played either (preferably both) a lot of times and would consider themselves intermediate to advanced players.  

Obviously there is some RNG involved in both but we prefer games that are deterministic in nature like Terra Mystica, Gaia Project, and (to some extent) Scythe. We want the best player to win and we want diversified strategies. Obviously Tapestry is more asymmetric than Viticulture is so we'd probably find that it fits our flavor better but we truly just want something that we can sit down and be cutthroat in. Not exactly referring to combat, fighting, etc but aggressive placements/denial etc. Seems like it would be present in Viticulture, but is that the case in Tapestry? 

Finally, we love modular games and games that allow for more or advanced content as you play. That's what got us in to Scythe and Stonemaier games in general, and Viticulture seems like it has that in spades. That doesn't seem to be the case with Tapestry, but then again we played Terra Mystica over 100 times before one of us bought the expansion so we're okay with somewhat static gameplay from session to session as long as it's engaging.",1583020817

Scholarship

(Location) As a Florida native, Starkville is within a day’s drive of your home state which will make it easy for your friends and family to come to see you play. On top of that, we play Florida in our conference. **If you come to Mississippi State, I guarantee we will win at least one game in Florida.**

(Campus Life) Mississippi State has a great campus that you will enjoy both on and off the field. I say on the field because our crown jewel of our campus is our on campus stadium. Here, fans celebrate our players to the chorus of thousands of voices and just as many cowbells. It provides an electrifying atmosphere that continues after the game in the Junction, the Cotton District, and Fraternity Row. **If you come to Mississippi State, you will have a top 20 campus life experience and are guaranteed to play in our impressive on campus stadium.**

(Tradition) I am looking to build this program in all facets with your help. This includes tradition. **If you come to Mississippi State, you will be a part of raising the bar of tradition and we will have higher tradition when you leave than when you came in.**",1583020817

"space","t5_2qh87","A few commonly asked questions about my photos:

**How do you take long exposures of the sky moves?**

* I use an equatorial mount to [track the movement of the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYkY_JYfKlY) and take long exposures without the stars trailing. I also take several hundred shorter exposures (2 minutes each) and stack them together to create one single image that then goes onto post processing. This image was photographed over 2 nights.

**Are the Colors Real?**

* Yes, this is a true color image. Although my camera is monochrome, by taking multiple exposures through R, G, and B filters, I can overlay them into a color image. If you looked at this through a telescope it would look like a gray smudge as our eyes are awful at seeing color in low light levels. 

**What is your light pollution/How do you deal with it?**

* My apartment is under Bortle 7 skies (the scale goes from 1-9, with 9 being the worst) For this image I used a broadband light pollution filter which blocks out some (but not all) of the wavelengths of light produced by exterior lights. It is possible to get good photos without using any kind of light pollution filters, and I've found a lot of the messier clusters are great targets for heavy LP and/or full moon nights.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Ehhh, that sounds like a great way to completely halt innovation.

Better would be to determine a time that particular appliances are required to last (say, 20 years) and make companies qualify the components for four times that (so, 80 years in this example).

That's how we do it for aerospace components I work with. Want a valve to last for 1000 cycles? Gotta show it still works at 4000 cycles (in addition to a bunch of other testing).

Now, of course, with that will also come costs rising to cover the additional testing and higher quality parts required. That by itself will drive some standardization to reduce costs - companies will start finding parts that have already been qualified that they can buy to avoid doing the testing themselves.

But, it avoids the pitfall of forcing every company across the world to use the same ""standard"" part, because standard parts are extremely limiting and slow to improve and optimize around whatever challenge society is up against 50 years from now.",1583020820

Bob is a manager at ABC Corp. with 4 team members. No more.

His brother Steve wants to work for ABC.

Bob has the power to fire someone from his team.

Bob has the power to hire someone to his team.

There’s nothing wrong with Steve working for ABC.

If Bob fires someone explicitly to hire Steve, is that okay? You would argue it is fine because Bob never did anything that was out of bounds or illegal on their own so that power should be respected.

Firestorm is good for situations of where the map is pretty urban, or if you're going against usf.  - the mp40 volks beats the riflemen at their own game in regards to cqc. And if you're ahead, get the flamm hetzer to flush off infantry and fortifications alike. The main reason of why I like this doctrine is the Opel truck - you can set it at base and use it like a usf ambulance, while having the freedom to go for mechanized hq and not worrying about injured troops.

Elite Armour is good for the snowball effect - especially for maps of where a fuel is closer to your hq. If you're dominating the early game, you can chuck these 221 scout cars with the radio on both fuel points and you can get up to 60 fuel per minute. If you manage to maintain that advantage, you'd get tanks for days.",1583020825

"FragileMaleRedditor","t5_n8im4","Like lnamorata said, it's not just a matter of arguing from your feelings. The more important part is the patronizing tone people use to dismiss actual facts and expertise. It's a more specific example of how a lot of men don't actually listen to women.

For example, let's say I'm a female engineer, and I've been trying to solve a certain problem for a couple weeks. I've done a bunch of different techniques, but no matter what I try, nothing seems to be working. So I bring it up with a male colleague, who is working on something completely different. And instead of commiserating, he just tells me the first idea that comes into his head about how to solve the problem. Except I already had the same idea last week, tried it, and it didn't work. And then when I try to tell him why it doesn't work, he ignores me and goes on about how his idea is different (it isn't) and will completely solve whatever I'm working on (it won't). He's trying so hard to prove himself right that he's completely ignoring someone who just knows more than him about this specific topic.

An even worse example would be if instead of actually suggesting a solution, he goes off on a tangent about some basic principle that any first-year engineering student would know. In this case, he's not just being condescending, it's outright insulting: he's effectively saying that my expertise means so little to him, that he thinks he needs to teach me about some basic facts that aren't even relevant.

It's not only men who do this sort of thing, and it's not only women who it happens to, but men do it to women *all the time,* on almost every subject. There is a large portion of men who just refuse to accept that a woman might know more about something than he does.",1583020826

Exercise- you did a squat. You danced to one song in the privacy of your home.

Diet- i had one less soda. Or I had one more veg. Or, for the excessively skinny, i ate one more meal than i would.

Non zero is about remembering to celebrate that you did do something. Stop dwelling on yesterday ""oh I'm a failure and a fuck up I can't even remember when i last did a squat."" Do a squat now! Then- do NOT diminish that squat by saying shit like ""it was only one"" NO NO NO NO NO. It was one more than you would have done! It was NOT ZERO do not act like it was zero!

We still do the planning activities but in story mapping sessions right before starting a new feature or slice, and in a “discuss” lane where refinement happens right before starting work on a card. 

This has several advantages: the MVP (the first slice identified in the story mapping session) defines the size of the “sprint”, so things like moving unfinished cards to the next sprint, which distorts velocity, never happen; burn-up charts can forecast when the slice will be delivered thus managing stakeholder expectations in a more meaningful way and lowering team stress; the results of refining a card are pretty much guaranteed to be relevant when work starts on it as there’s no delay between the two activities; and so on.",1583020826

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

To address your point of applying to a tech company: it's not that easy. 

The legal field over the past 10-15 years has suffered significant job reductions. In my graduating class, almost 55% of my graduating class at mid-tier 1 law school did not have full-time legal employment. So when I got a full-time offer in a field that I wasn't particularly interested at a very reputable company, I wasn't going to turn it down. 

I thought about going and picking up some ""tech work"" at my current company, but as I'm out in CA and the headquarters (where all the tech folks are) are in the east coast, that's also not reasonable for my current situation. Because of ailing parents and close ties to the region, I am unable to move.  

I understand that I am pretty limited in my options, but as I am solely motivated by money, I have no qualms giving up several years worth of my current salary if my earning potential is significantly higher after-the-fact.

I feel limited in my ability to grow and develop due to my weak math abilities, however.",1583020831

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","Maybe this is semantics, but technically nothing can exist without state support. Even if the body comprising the state agrees to anarchism as the guiding set of principles you still end up with a “state.” You and twelve buddies build huts in the woods and agree mutually to the terms of your arrangement that forms the state. Even democratic-syndicalism-trade-unionism is still a state. Captialism, from this point in history going forward can 100% exist without a state because the folks that are participating in the economy would continue to do so. Look at the various forms of de-centralized currency, that’s all commerce without “The State” but it still requires a group of people to cooperate and check one another and that’s a state. It’s just anarchy flavored. This notion of stateless is a fools gambit and the four first comments parroting the same notion in regards to the concept is naive. 

At the end of the day, even with the aggressive nature of The State removed, those within an anarchist world view are still going to follow enough guidelines to be indifferentiated from anything that the anarchybots would call a State. Your family is a state in and of itself. We are all born into a state and may die in a different one but linguistically it’s like the phases of matter. Change energy in the system you can move from solid to liquid. Change the motivation in the state, you can flatten the hierarchy and remove the coercive elements. 

But to say capitalism fails to exist without the State fails to deeply critique your own views on this and I say that working for a fang company and hating the results of current affairs in the economy. Ideology is great but look outside and get out of the bubble unless you’re going to hoist the flag first.",1583020832

But if more unique mechanics were introduced (like puzzles to damage/kill bosses incrementally instead of bullet sponge damage, etc.), then they might be able to force us to need different loadouts than just ""optimal DPS"" for endgame activities.

If a situation is causing a negative sensation for someone then that situation is objectively bad for that person.  As a human I require sustenance, and thus acquiring sustenance is objectively good for me.  It's of course always relative to some sort of being that has preferences, but that's the case of any ethics.

Even if the MCC would have released with everything at once we would be seeing the same trends because these games are ancient now. Reach is 9 years old. Those who love it (like myself) will still get a blast out of playing it but it does show it's age and there's plenty of competing titles that will easily draw other players away.

It's astounding how historically ignorant people are in regards to Halo's popularity, especially Halo fans. Halo 2 and 3 were behemoths yes, but also if anyone ever truly went back to look at the competition those titles faced, nothing stood up to them. They were the definitive online experience on console. Those two titles just absolutely trounced everyone else because nothing quite measured up in terms of quality...until they did and then Halo slipped. People don't acknowledge that Halo 3 was topped on 360 by CoD4 by June 2008 and the only reason Halo 3 reclaimed it's title was held on to it as long as it did was because CoD:W@W released and split the CoD player base. By MW2 CoD took the crown and never looked back. Reach which everyone has been so nostalgic about (despite the endless hatred, bitching, and moaning that existed about the game ruining Halo when it came out) never reclaimed the crown. So it's just no surprise that the MCC is where it is on PC. Nostalgia only takes you so far, but it doesn't prop up a dated MP experience for the long term.",1583020833

Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[22] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[11][23][24]

During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Frédéric Bastiat.[16][25]

Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[26] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[1][27] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[28] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[28] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[29][30][31] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[31]

Cruz's senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison: ""If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary."" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[9][32]

After graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[1][33] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[27] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said, ""Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant"".[34][35][36][37] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[38]

Cruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[39]

Last few days*: 27-32 sec. 
(*very busy @ work + a lot of meetings that require more talking then I generally like to do)
  
Rarely below 25s.. almost never below 20s again.

18s and below is hay fever territory for me.

Starting point when discovering the Buteyko method... a CP of about 6 seconds. Yeah, heavy burn-out and in a very bad shape. A heavy flu gave me the final push over the edge back then.
  
The number of health complaints I had couldn't be counted on two hands.. :-S

Almost no energy, daily migraines, memory loss, no sense of smell, cold hands and feet, unable to talk without stuttering, tingling limbs and nose, hot flashes, shivers, high resting heart rate, pounding heart, heart palpitations, anxiety, daily panic attacks, frequent spells of feeling dizzy, etc. etc.
  
Writing just a few things down from the top of my head, I realize how far I've climbed back up again. But that first year was rough.
The first time increasing my CP over 10 seconds... the headaches were insane.. 3 days of just sitting in a corner not sure if I was going to feel better or die.",1583020836

*****

&gt; Más de 7 mil aspirantes de todas las edades registró la Escuela de Manejo para Mujeres de Ecatepec en la primera convocatoria emitida por el gobierno municipal, las cuales recibirán el curso gratuito impartido por instructores certificados.   

&gt; Ernesto García Tampa, encargado de la Dirección de Movilidad y Transporte municipal, recordó que la meta inicial era de mil mujeres y fue rebasada ampliamente, por lo que crearán más grupos y contarán con más vehículos para la capacitación, pues tenían asignadas seis unidades.   

&gt; Vilchis Contreras impulsó la creación de la citada escuela, a propuesta de su esposa Esmeralda Vallejo Martínez, presidenta honoraria del DIF de Ecatepec, en apoyo a las mujeres del municipio.   

&gt; “Ha sido un éxito la convocatoria para la creación de la Escuela de Manejo”, expresó García Tampa, quien aclaró que todas las mujeres registradas que cumplan con los requisitos participarán en el curso, que se impartirá en diferentes horarios por instructores certificados.   

&gt; García Tampa informó que las clases de la Escuela de Manejo para Mujeres de Ecatepec iniciarán el próximo 18 de marzo, con duración de 10 días en los que impartirán primero un curso teórico y posteriormente la práctica individualizada.

It doesn't matter which twin stays and which one goes.

If, however, gravity is in play, then it does matter, the twin in the gravitational field will age more slowly.  If we look at the paradox with gravity, the twin in the gravitational field sees his twin move away at velocity 2V, the twin in the spaceship sees the other move away from him (along with the gravity-inducing thing) at 2V, but from the time contraction from the velocity has to be the same as the previous statement regarding the paradox without gravity.",1583020837

&gt;Nearly all of the press coverage of Trump from all of our media outlets, excepting Fox, has been relentlessly biased, critical, and often dishonest.

Trump is often correct to criticize CNN, the NY Times, the major networks, and PBS and NPR for this. 

The problem is that Trump is often not correct to criticise and he does anyway. I would also say that what he does isn't really criticism as much as dismissal. He doesn't say why the news is wrong or attempt to address the points they have made. He just shouts FAKE NEWS and that's it.

&gt; Slovak opposition movement Ordinary People took a strong lead in the EU country&amp;#039;s parliamentary election, an exit poll released by TV Markiza showed on Saturday.

&gt; The poll by the Focus agency showed OLANO winning 25.8% of the vote, followed by Smer with 14.9%. It showed OLANO would be best placed to lead negotiations on forming a new centre-right government with other opposition conservative and liberal groups.

"theravada","t5_2ra0d","As long as you are speaking of a ""self"" that isn't a permanent and substantial entity then OK. As Analayo notes:

&gt;Contemplation of the elements offers a convenient entrance into what could be considered the most central dimension of insight in early Buddhist thought: not-self (*anatta*). The same could alternatively be captured with the term ""empty"", in the sense that everything is empty of a self. The term ""self"" in such contexts can be misunderstood. The statement that there is no self does not mean there is nothing at all. ""Self"" here refers to a permanent and substantial entity, something that is able to exert complete control. Such an entity can not be found in any aspect of experience. - [*Satipatthana Meditation: A Practice Guide*](https://www.windhorsepublications.com/product/satipatthana-meditation-practice-guide-paperback/) by Analayo, pages 73-74

But if you mean a permanent and substantial self in the ""soul"" sense then the Buddha most definitely *did* say there is no such thing.

[SN 22.59](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato) makes it clear that none of the aggregates are self. 

&gt;“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
&gt;
&gt;“No, sir.”
&gt;
&gt;“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
&gt;
&gt;Any kind of feeling at all …
&gt;
&gt;Any kind of perception at all …
&gt;
&gt;Any kind of choices at all …
&gt;
&gt;You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

[SN 22.81](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81/en/sujato) further states that a self cannot be found in or out of the aggregates.

&gt;They regard form as self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and root of that conditioned phenomenon? When an uneducated ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, but they still regard self as possessing form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. …
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, but they still regard form in self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. …
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, but they still regard self in form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. …

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The democratic party has been trying to get to a national healthcare system with no private insurance since at least FDR. Ted Kennedy almost got it done in the 70s. Not radical nor authoritarian to provide an essential service like insuring peoples' health. 

""Rhetoric entrenched in Marxism"" it's pretty easy to red-bait about marxism when a candidates core message is about income inequality. And he's not demonizing an entire class of people ""because of who they are"", he's demonizing them for deliberately creating a system that favors them at the expense of the people. He demonizes them because they participate in a system that new about climate change since the 70s and decided to funnel money into propaganda campaigns to convince people it wasn't real. He demonizes them because they constantly fight for more power and wealth for themselves at the expense of the rest of society. Indexing tax brackets to inflation but not the minimum wage. Pushing for ""right to work"" laws so they can bust up unions to give their employees less benefits and lower pay. 

You can look at the world and see this glaring inequality, and see that the ultra-wealthy are aggressively pushing for even more inequality, and get very angry and upset with them without having ever read a thing about Marxism or Leninism or Socialism.

Edit: Oh and ""praising authoritarians"" - the literal policy of the US for the past 100 years has been to install right-wing dictators favorable to the US everywhere, and to violently overthrow governments should they manage to oust these dictators. And we're currently allowing a genocide of the Yemeni people because we're best buds with brutal dictator MBS. So the establishment knows damn well that their attacks on Bernie, who protested this kind of authoritarian interventionism in other countries, isn't an authoritarian-minded leader, but they'll gladly use the attack if it helps them.",1583020837

1. Compressor.
2. Datavac.
3. Canned air

A lot of people recommend against a compressor, but I used an oil based one for years on different systems and never had an issue.  Oil-free is obviously better.  Besides you can buy separate oil/condensate in line filters as a add-on if you're worried about it.  Hands down this will do the best job.

A Datavac is honestly the in between product, it moves more air than canned air but not as much as a compressor.  It's somewhat expensive and close to what you'd spend on a compressor.  But then again it's made in America which is important to some of us, and it's useful for other things as in the air comes out warm and can be used to dry newly washed intake filters for instance (or anything).

Canned air, cheap in the short run, expensive in the long run.  Some cans work better than others, generally you get what you pay for.  Causes waste, pollutes the air.

It's smarter in the not very long run to buy something besides canned air unless there's a reason you can't have one of the other options.  I'll always use a compressor when I can, there are relatively cheap options that are quiet and small/portable that can be put up in a closet and nothing match's the power.",1583020839

Better but not different so saying it's not about the fights is not adding anything to the discussion just telling another fan what YOU believe and what YOU value in the story and the rest should follow suit since...""OnE PIEcE iS nOt abOuT tHe FighTs"" so if someone compliment the fights no one would say ""one piece is not about fights"" right?

PABLO ESCOBAR'S son says his father ""Worked for the CIA selling cocaine""; (The CIA) “were practically his partners,” which allowed Escobar to defy the law, and gave him nearly the same power as a government.; Escobar smuggled 15 Tonnes a day into the USA, Making $420 Million per week.

He claims that singer FRANK SINATRA was a major trafficker for Pablo

[http://csglobe.com/escobar-son-dad-worked-cia-cocaine/](http://csglobe.com/escobar-son-dad-worked-cia-cocaine/) FEB 22, 2017

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo\_Escobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar)

Juan Pablo Escobar Henao, son of notorious Medellín cartel drug kingpin, Pablo Escobar, now says his father ***“worked for the CIA.”***

In a new book, “Pablo Escobar In Fraganti,” Escobar, who lives under the pseudonym, Juan Sebastián Marroquín, [explains](http://www.noticias24.com/internacionales/noticia/121173/mi-papa-trabajaba-para-la-cia-afirma-hijo-de-pablo-escobar-en-entrevista/) his *“father* ***worked for the CIA selling cocaine to finance the fight against Communism in Central America.”***

*“The drug business is very different than what we dreamed,”* he continues.

*“What the CIA was doing was buying the controls to get the drug into their country and getting a wonderful deal.”*

\*“He did not make the money alone,”\*Marroquín [elaborated](http://www.elintransigente.com/sociedad/2017/2/16/juan-pablo-escobar-mi-papa-quiso-secuestrar-michael-jackson-423405.html) in an interview, ***“but with US agencies that allowed him access to this money.***

***He had direct relations with the CIA.”***

Notably, Marroquín added, ***“the person who sold the most drugs to the CIA was Pablo Escobar.”***

Where his first book primarily covered Escobar, the man as a father, Marroquín’s second — which has just been released in Argentina — delves into the kingpin’s *“international ties of corruption in which my father had an active participation, among them with the American CIA,”* he [said](http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/hijo-pablo-escobar-no-tengo-dudas-que-mi-padre-se-suicido-n4114981) in a recent interview.

Those government associates ***“were practically his partners,”*** which allowed Escobar to defy the law, and gave him nearly the same power as a government.

Predictably, this information is conveniently absent from media headlines in America.

If the CIA trafficking cocaine into the United States sounds like some tin foil conspiracy theory, think again. Their alleged role in the drug trade was exposed in 1996 in an explosive investigative series “Dark Alliance” by Gary Webb for the San Jose Mercury News.

The investigation, headed up by Webb revealed ties between the CIA, Nicaraguan contras and the crack cocaine trade ravaging African-American communities.

The investigation provoked massive protests and congressional hearings, as well as overt backlash from the mainstream media to discredit Webb’s reporting. However, decades later, [officials would come forward](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/10/gary-webb-dark-alliance_n_5961748.html) to back Webb’s original investigation up.

Then-senator John Kerry even released [a detailed report](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/north06.pdf) claiming that not only was there “considerable evidence” linking the Contra effort to trafficking of drugs and weapons — **but that the U.S. government knew about it.**

El Patron, as Escobar came to be known, amassed more wealth than almost any drug dealer in history — at one point raking in around $420 million a week in revenue — and reportedly supplied about 80 percent of the world’s cocaine.

Escobar [landed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2015/09/15/watching-netflixs-narcos-heres-pablo-escobar-in-forbes-first-ever-billionaire-issue-in-1987/#716bdc7479e9) on *Forbes*’ list of international billionaires for seven straight years, and — though the nature of the business makes acquiring solid numbers impossible — his [estimated](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#1-in-the-mid-1980s-escobars-cartel-brought-in-an-estimated-420-million-a-week-which-totals-almost-22-billion-a-year-1) worth was around $30 billion.

Escobar and the Medellín cartel [smuggled](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9/#8-once-he-started-a-fire-with-2-million-because-his-daughter-was-cold-8) 15 tons of cocaine into the U.S. — *every day* — and left a trail of thousands of dead bodies to do so.

*“It was a nine-hundred-mile run from the north coast of Colombia and was simply wide-open,”* journalist Ioan Grillo wrote in the book, “El Narco: Inside Mexico’s Criminal Insurgency.”

*“The Colombians and their American counterparts would airdrop loads of blow out to sea, from where it would be rushed ashore in speedboats, or even fly it right onto the Florida mainland and let it crash down in the countryside.”*

If what Marroquín reveals in the new book is, indeed, true, it would mean the [CIA played a major role in ensuring Americans had access to boundless quantities of cocaine](http://csglobe.com/two-cia-agents-arrested-by-minutemen-while-crossing-mexican-border-with-1300-pounds-of-cocaine/) — while the U.S. government sanctimoniously railed against drugs to promote the drug war.

In fact, as Marroquín keenly observes, **drug prohibition makes for the best pro-drug propaganda** — the nature of something being illegal naturally gives it greater appeal.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Not at all nosy! I grew up stateside and have always been very career driven (particularly so, for a woman). I moved to Italy for my graduate degree, in an industry Italy is known for. After working (re: slaving) for years, I knew I’d never accomplish my goals there. And also knew that elsewhere, in the EU and US, my experience/pedigree acquired in IT would be welcomed with open arms. So, I had a few options in Switzerland, Finland, Berlin and the US, and chose to return to the US for the way of life.

There were many many factors that made Italy difficult to work in for me (outside the fact it was 2009, re: recession), some of them include:

- getting a true employment contract (rarely offered because it’s very difficult for companies to get rid of an employee once awarded). This also had a cascade effect (paid under the table, etc)
- there was no advancement in the job I held or those similar to it, because positions were filled by an older generation of men who weren’t leaving anytime soon
- patronizing men are par for Italian culture, and make it hard for Italian women to succeed in the workplace. 

Amongst other reasons, the dissolution of a long-term relationship and the rest of my social circle, all in my profession, “escaping” to other countries for their profession, too. Just to add, most of my social circle were men who faced the above, too. 

On a lighter note, I look at my friends now and they’re all excelling in other EU cities, now working for top-tier studios and multinational corporations.",1583020841

Group A includes people who have just traveled back from Iran/Italy and asked to be checked due to the outbreak in those countries. Group B consists of people have been in contact with those from A.

In Korea, the biggest outbreak of the virus was connected to a church. The authorities ended up mass-testing members of that church and those related to them. 

As you can see from the examples above, testing that could detect mild cases follows a certain logical pattern. This group gets tested because of a direct connection to previous cases or being in an area that is highly susceptible, not because of their own severe symptoms. 

On the other hand, if someone was infected on a bus for instance -hence no way to tell who they got infected by-, and that person ended up only having mild symptoms like a little cough, there is almost no way to detect them. Such a person will also be unlikely to ask for a check because they wouldn't think have had any direct connection to previously infected.",1583020842

Caruso started as a meme last season because he got some highlight dunks/plays you wouldn't expect out of a bald dude. This gained traction because the Laker fan base is by far the largest in the league.

He rode that meme wave into this season, so he was only just a joke, but then through exemplary defensive play he became a crucial part as a defensive role player on a historically great Laker regular season team (5th highest winning % currently). To be a best closing lineup option on a team that great is an impressive feat for a guy who was cut from a g-league team just a couple years ago.

Caruso crushes it on eye test in terms of defensive impact, but if you want to talk stats, he's top 15 overall in defensive real plus minus (2nd for SGs), top 4 overall in 538's defensive RAPTOR rating, top 16 in defensive player impact plus-minus among guards (DPIPM).",1583020842

You tie the knot so that when you pull the thread all the way, it won't come out of the fabric, it gets stuck on the knot on the under side, because the knot is bigger than the interlacements of the fabric.  

It's good to know that in general, fabric has very different characteristics for knits vs. wovens.  So I wouldn't start with a stretchy t-shirt, but maybe an old regular shirt.  

Look up backstitch and securing stitch.  I've got to go now but I'll think on this more and see what else might be helpful.  Welcome to sewing!!!!!

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Hey there. Skin sister here! I also am oily/dehydrated and suffered from cystic acne as a teenager (still get the occasional cystic pimple on my cheek once in a blue moon). What you need is a skin reset. And lots of ceramides for that dry skin. First off though, lets get you a face wash. My recommendation is to get a gentle jelly cleanser. It will be tough enough to get the gunk off your face but gentle enough to not leave your skin tight, peeling and dry. A favorite of mine is the glossier jelly cleanser. But there’s tons of options, and if you take a trip to Ulta they have lots to choose from with all sorts of price points. I currently use Fourth Ray Beauty AM to PM face wash ($12) and it’s great. It leaves my skin pretty soft afterwards. Something you might want to incorporate into your skin care routine is a serum packed with ceramides. Krave beauty Barrier Relief or Stratia’s Liquid Gold are my two recommendations for you. More than likely, your skin is dehydrated because your moisture barrier is wrecked, and these two are great for that. Cerave is a great moisturizer for someone with dry/dehydrated skin, so keep using it. I could also recommend adding an oil into your routine, I know you suffer from oily skin but believe me, adding oil will definitely slow down sebum production a lot, as it will mimic the natural oil production on your skin, and will trick your body into thinking it has made plenty. I will always recommend Youth To The People Glow oil, it was my life saver when I was fixing my moisture barrier, but if it’s not something you can afford, try to find an affordable one that’s *not* comedogenic. Although I work in the skin care industry, I am no dermatologist, and since I cannot physically assess your skin, I can only recommend you what’s worked for me. If your skin continues to be dehydrated no matter what you do, please advise that you may need to see a provider, as you may have some sort of thyroid/hormonal issue going on. Other than that, one other thing I recommend doing is if you use face wash, do not dry your face with a towel when you’re done! Gently tap excess water off with a old t-shirt or microfiber towel, and do your skincare routine while your face is still slightly damp. It will make a huge difference!

On the basis of what? In any case, all those judicial reviews would be taking place *after* it had  been repealed (you can't do preemptive judicial reviews, AFAIK). 

&gt; All this would take time, lots of time.

Judicial reviews seldom have suspensive effects while they're running.

&gt; Then something so major as witrhdrawing from this would be heavily protested without either a referendum or it being in a manifesto.

I think that you're overestimating the will of the British people to rebel for the sake of a piece of what is perceived (wrongly) to be ""European"" legislation.

"Starwarsrp","t5_2tg2b","Yathrea felt the cold, dead void of space slowly closing in around her, sucking the air from her lungs, the heat from her blood, and the life from her very bones themselves. She felt herself dying, slowly but surely, less than a minute away from death - but Yathrea could not die. She *would* not die - not now, when she had so much to do; so many transgressors to lay low at the tip of her blade. The teachings of the Jedi, again, were insufficient, forcing Yathrea to tap into her anger, her righteous rage, allowing it to boil over, its heat driving her onwards, forcing the blast door ahead of her open with raw, telekinetic strength before slamming it shut behind her. She would not allow the warlord’s filth to funnel her as they pleased, to distract her - either they would cease venting the atmosphere, she decided, or they would die, and she would live. Either way, they would die. Right now, that was all that mattered as she continued her relentless advance, carving through blast door after blast door with incredible ease, raw anger feeding her body with incredible, foul strength. Her every step sent vibrations reverberating through the ship, so heavy were her footfalls. Roiling telekinetic force about her body sent unsecured debris whirling about, slamming into walls, tearing apart bulkheads. Every step brought Yathrea closer to the bridge, new alarms sounding as she cut a haphazard swath towards her sought-after prey. Every step brought Yathrea closer to satisfaction of her ever-growing bloodlust. She simply cut through every obstacle in her way, throwing others out of her past, one after the other, until she found something upon which to slake herself - the captain of this vessel. The one responsible. Still, she was too enraged to properly defend herself. She would absorb what blasterfire she could - the rest, she would suffer. She would survive. Leaping forward, raising her blade, a powerful blast of telekinetic force surged out from her.

They would die.",1583020845

I think the idea that current society is what allowed progress is just disproven by a look at history. No age of humanity was without technological progress, wonders and marvel. Sure, there were people/nations which contributed little if anything (the Mongols are a neat example) but generally, history never ""stagnated"" nor do I really see what modern society offered that would support this hypothesis of yours.

I've been interviewing candidates for nearly 2 months now and I've seen 1 page to 8 page resumes. I can't really comment on (1) as I'm not familiar with the actuarial idiosyncrasies, but for (2) and (3) I honestly don't think you have enough experience for a 2 page resume. The things that are likely to push you into two pages are listing all your irrelevant college achievements, hobbies and internships. Once you graduate and have a full-time job nobody cares if you were on the dean list 8 semesters in a row or were the president of model UN. The only college achievements worth listing are publications or national/international awards (Rhodes, Fullbright, Goldwater, etc.) .  If it was an actuarial internship I'd say keep it, but given that it was an internship in college it should have the least amount of bullet points, and save the space to elaborate on your full-time jobs. Sorry if I'm projecting, but I've seen too many horrible analytics resumes in past couple of weeks and it makes my work day more difficult, at which point I start to wonder whether you are worth hiring if you can't make my day any easier.",1583020847

"FortniteCompetitive","t5_ac643","It definitely had auto rotation, there's no debate about it. The bug simply applied the assistance to mouse input. It wouldn't just add auto rotation on top of that. It's important to point this out because any amount of auto rotation isn't balanced, so it's wrong for people to claim that it was balanced previously.

What I meant about varying levels of aim assist was for the really really bad players who are playing public matches full of bots. Something like the strongest aim assist is only available to people with very low account levels. For new players essentially.

I'm not suggesting having a varying level of aim assist that changes over time for arena. I'm saying lower the maximum amount of assistance for arena play lists. Just like how they lock aspect ratio in arena, have a separate slider for the aim assist strength for arena that on 100% is a lot weaker than standard public matches.

I've been playing on linear recently, I know what you're talking about with the slowdown, and it is jarring, because I've had to set a sensitivity that falls in between what's comfortable looking speed without slowdown, but still will move quick enough while slowed over a player. 

I suppose a solution to that would be an additional slider that allows you to decrease the velocity change when over a player, so people can fine tune their feel.",1583020847

This is not going to get better. Refusing counseling was the nail in the coffin for me. He does not take you or your relationship seriously. It sounds like you  have no  kids so that's good, no custody issues in the divorce. I'm sorry your marriage is failing, I don't know if being overworked is making him like this and he was different before or something, but it's clear that you are not a priority and he's basically in a self focused like ""I have to take care of myself for work whatever you're doing"" mode and if you've been begging him for months to make time for you and he just gets angry you have run flat up against a complete unwillingness to change anything about himself for you, which is not how relationships work at all. 

My first and only marriage so far ended for basically this reason. She was working alot, she was abusive in response to pretty much any request I made, I got yelled at over stupid shit, and I refused to engage with her until she fixed her shit. She didn't and we got divorced. 

It is what it is. Go talk to a therapist yourself alone in your spare time, you need someone to unload all of this on and get an objective opinion about it and a therapist is a really good place for that, sounds like you can definitely afford it.

&gt; Is Germany equipped against a virus that could cause damage &amp;quot;Far beyond a health emergency,&amp;quot; as Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, one of the world&amp;#039;s biggest health foundations, puts it? He believes the virus could cause a chain reaction with the &amp;quot;Potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008.&amp;quot;.

&gt; Even in times of non-crisis, state health services are already hitting their limits, says Ute Teichert, chairwoman of the Federal Association of Physicians of Public Health Departments.

&gt; Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and one of the authors of the Global Health Security Index, is a hard woman to reach these days.

Not building more dropships when everything is fine is one thing but they have a timeline now!

Arresting a 17 yo and killing the one person actively working on the problem seems *kiiiiiiiinda* unhelpful if you ask me. Everytime I rewatch there's at least one Kane scene about buying time that makes me particularly pissed, bc it literally makes no sense.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","Trust is earned. I think what you are saying is true but it goes both ways.

How you are, how people see you, all comes into play when you communicate with others. If you have earned their trust, they'll forgive a bad turn of phrasing, they'll more readily assume you mean things in a good way. The opposite is also true, if you have earned people's distrust, even a sincere phrase could be questioned.

That's why I run on simple rules that have served me well: treat people with respect, tell the truth, try to cooperate. With this attitude, I never worry about misunderstandings blowing up a situation, because people will give me the benefit of the doubt first until given a chance to clarify.

And this doesn't mean that everyone likes me. So to address your point, if I'm in a dispute with someone that flat-out doesn't like me, they can question my approach, or hate my personality, but they don't accuse me of being disrespectful or dishonest because I'm not those things. They might say I'm wrong or refuse to let the issue go, but they wouldn't question the sincerity of an apology from me because dishonesty is not something they see in me.

Anyone that struggles with being perceived as sincere, it is worth learning why this is happening and correcting it, because life is way easier when people trust you. I don't go around treating people with respect and honesty just because I'm a champion of good manners, I do it in part because I profit from it all the time. It costs nothing, and the rewards are immeasurable.",1583020852

"thedavidpakmanshow","t5_30b6q","The problem with that theory is that he's been attempting to poison the well for whoever has been in front at the moment, trying to make them look unelectable. When it was Warren, he was going on about Pocahontas. When it was Biden, he was bribing foreign leaders to dig up dirt on him. (It's possible the Hunter Biden stuff did in fact damage Biden in the early contests, due to Democratic voters becoming spooked that Biden now had his own version of ""but her emails."") Notice that he didn't go after Bernie previously--he mostly ignored him. That's because up to now he didn't think Bernie had a serious shot at the nomination--an assumption that suggests Trump is more influenced by conventional Beltway thinking than he lets out.

I'm sticking with Occam's Razor. He wants Bernie as nominee because he genuinely does believe Bernie will be his weakest opponent. Now, whether that belief is *correct* is a different matter. It would hardly be the first time in history a candidate should have heeded the advice ""Be careful what you wish for.""",1583020852

Note that this has nothing to do with Trump. He fucking called for walling off our country because ebola. It was dramatically overplayed, but people in the west are scared of Africans. We were all gonna die then. And Trump criticized obama for not closing our borders. Same with SARS and same with this because people fear asia.

The autistic community is divided primarily into two camps; the neurodiversity movement and the autism cure movement. The neurodiversity movement believes autism is a different way of being and advocates against a cure. On the other hand, the autism cure movement advocates for a cure.

''Thus  in  the  period  1920-50,  these  countries  saw  formation  of  labour  unions,  cooperative  societies and extension of social rights to broader groups.This was followed by what is often referred to as a Golden Period of Welfare in these countries. The period 1950-80 saw the extension of the welfare model to include education, health  care,  pension  plans,  etc.  for  the  citizens  by  way  of  expansion  of  the  public  sector.  Universalism  became  an  important part of these countries''

Sabe o que é bizarro? Eu não estou falando dos países bálticos no pós-segunda guerra, mas após o fim da URSS, onde eles aplicaram medidas liberalizantes incisivamente, com investimento maciço no setor de serviço e afins, com forte desindrustrialização. Deu certo até a crise russa da segunda metade dos anos 90, quando eles foram arrastados pra lama, por causa da falta de dinamismo e versatilidade das suas economias.

So that could also increase our risk possibly. I’m not sure about mesalamine though — but if you look it up it should tell you if it makes you more susceptible to infections! I’m on entyvio which is a biologic so it does suppress the immune system for sure, however when i last got my blood taken i had a normal white blood cell count. So hopefully i’m not super susceptible. I think the best thing we can do is remain vigilant and frequently wash our hands/use hand sanitizer and avoid touching our faces.

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","Thankfully I haven't been insulted or physically restrained / harmed in any way in my current relationship. The stories I hear from other women make me want to cry and vomit at the same time. So sorry your ex did that to you. I firmly believe men who call themselves ""nice guys"" or who are primarily described by others as being ""such a nice guy"" are a red flag, because it's a sign that niceness is a facade. 

&gt; obviously nowhere near as bad as what so many women go through

That's the thing, most abuse victims say this. ""Compared to other women, my pain is nothing"" and yeah it might be true sometimes but *still*, how much do we have to endure before we feel it's valid to talk about it and feel angry and sad? And admit that this experience broke something in us that might never be whole again? I had an abusive ex and yes, I carried a lot of resentment in me for a long time because of the things he did. Even if he left no visible scars on me, he stole so much time and energy from me I could have spent not wondering why he did it, not feeling helpless and sad, not asking myself if I had it coming, not angrily venting to friends and family about him. He robbed me of joy I could have otherwise experienced.

Sorry, but not telling us what is going with the SQ42 is extremely disrespectful considering the amount of money the community has to provided to develop that game. 

&gt;\[...\], why do they need to tell us over and over again just to playcate us.

They don't have to tell over and over again, they only have to say it once but the problem is that they don't even do that. They have not addressed a single time why the SQ42 chapter roadmap is not updated. Or should I assume that they have yet again to restart production on SQ42 because of some new feature? I hope not... They are ignoring the entire community, and I think that behavior is extremely childish and the middle-finger is that they continue to believe that they are an open project.

An open project should not only share when things are going right and when they can earn praise but they should also address issues like this. That people find no update on the SQ42 acceptable is mind boggling to me. Right now CIG is like any other project sharing the ""wins"" that can be seen as beneficial but nothing else.",1583020855

* I like keeping in touch with people.
* Some people have issues with compulsively checking it or comparing themselves to others and feeling bad, but I guess these just aren't things that affect me. I'm experienced that temptation. I'm probably just not interested enough.
* Some people have been toxic or treat it as their political soapbox, but I just unfriend them.
* I don't believe Facebook is a great company, but I've done a fair amount of reading about the various scandals, and I didn't come away convinced that Facebook is evil incarnate like some people have concluded.
* I'm not concerned with stuff I share on Facebook getting out (to a potential employer, etc.) because I only post something if I'd be OK if the whole world saw it. From the beginning, it has been clear to me that once that data leaves my hands, I don't ultimately control where it goes.

Comparisons ends with that, they are both fighting games and are both easy to pick up

Let's put it like this, it's like asking how DBFZ compares to Tekken, I don't need to tell you hoe much in common have Tekken and DBFZ, they have practically nothing in common

If I had to do a comparison GBVS to DBFZ

 - It's even easier to pick up

 - It's a lot less chaotic

 - A shit ton of more focus on neutral

 - Way shorter combos, no magic series, but GBVS one has links, fundamentally completely different combo system

 - Proximity normals, close and far, fundamentally based on distance standing light, medium and heavy are 2 different attacks

 - GBVS has no autocombos, but if you LAND either on hit or block a close normal you can do up to another 2 normals that both will combo, mind you this actually scales the damage negatively, they don't let you do more damage but help with confirming in to special moves

 - Both games have extremely simple stuff and more advanced stuff

 - Like in DBFZ, hell more than DBFZ, putting your opponent in the corner is very rewarding

 - Roster is smaller but all characters feel unique, no homogenization

 - Completely different in regards to special moves and supers, actually quite different compared to a lot of FGs not just DBFZ

 - Can't cancel special moves in to supers

 - Defense is definetly easier ( anti-airing, overheads, throw teching, whiff punishing )

 - Fundamentally: optimized dramatic finishes

 - Same ASW aesthetic master class, absolutely stunning

 - Different lobby system, private rooms are separated from lobbies, the only type of matchmaking is ranked matchmaking

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Do you really think that that not letting a few millilitres of some random sticky fluid out of you for a long time will suddenly make you more confident, happy, and healthy? How does that make sense?

Confidence is much more complex than that. So is happiness. So is health. But let's start with confidence. Confidence is based on 1) experience and 2) the self-belief that you can use that experience. Then if you want to increase your confidence, you must gain some experience (knowledge, skill, practice, etc) and/or build up your belief in yourself. The former is easy, while the latter is more challenging.

Happiness can be caused by others or caused by you. When you hang out with people, or seek some form of entertainment, or someone gives you a compliment, that is happiness caused by others. When you see that your work has had a positive outcome, that makes you proud, which is another happy feeling, but caused by you. If you're not a naturally happy person, go do something, and I mean anything, with a friend or acquaintance. Smiles await!

As for health? Sure, abstinence from anything will make the activity more pleasureable once you resume that activity. 

I would encourage you to evaluate your life plan so you can steer yourself in the direction you want to.",1583020858

"blogsnark","t5_39xf0","[SarahsDay](https://www.instagram.com/sarahs_day/?hl=en). Her earlier YouTube videos were inspiring for me. She ate so healthy and focused on eating a well balanced diet. I think it started going downhill right after she moved out of her parents house and her constant Tropeaka pushing drove me insane. And she lost me when she began bragging about how much “fruit and nut mix” she ate when in reality she only had a handful. She began exhibiting disordered eating and that’s a no go for me because rice struggled with disordered eating. I don’t like that she has no personal training certification but was pushing her fitness ebook. 

[Blogilates](https://www.instagram.com/blogilates/?hl=en) but me unfollowing her was a long time coming. Her voice always sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard and then she began talking about her tacky ass wedding dress and I unfollowed. I was a long time follower of hers (YouTube and her blog) but she has always been very fake to me. I think she’s tried very hard to convince herself to love her body. I’m not surprised she did that ridiculous 90 day challenge last year, she’s always struggled with disordered eating. I don’t like how people criticize her body though. I’m petite, not exactly curvy and I have an athletic build. Not everyone wants to shape themselves into centaurs like the Kardashians have. I’m also not sure what people expect her, a Pilates instructor, to look like.

[HRHCollection](https://www.instagram.com/hrhcollection/?hl=en). Need I say anymore? I watched because she was my guilty train wreck pleasure but...if you know anything about Alex or have watched any of her videos, they speak for themselves

[Madalin Giorgetta](https://www.instagram.com/madalingiorgetta/?hl=en) with her inclusivity/body positivity schtick. She gained popularity on Instagram for being a BBG girl, meaning, she followed Kayla Itsines Bikini Body Guide program and was often featured on their IG page. She kind of stopped posting and made a video admitting that she had stopped following the program and began weight training but she didn’t want to disappoint her followers so she just began posting less and less. She created her own program and is supposedly certified but her form is horrendous. Then she started on this whole body positivity thing and became insufferable. Constantly calling out diet culture and making claims that weight has nothing to do with health. It bothers me when people spread misinformation for the sake of being “woke.” I remember she snapped at another influencer after the girl said something...I can’t remember if it was “sis” or “yasss” but she called her out for co-opting AAVE and constantly using it. I’ll admit I did think it was cringeworthy because said influencer is always up Kylie Jenners ass and uses AAVE but meh.

The stock tube on the Vali is pretty poor, so pulling it out and inserting a black plate makes it sound much better. 

The black plate tubes were top grade stuff back then and now but because so many were made they're still super cheap. 

Just look up the tube types it supports and see what Sylvania makes.  A black plate for a Vali will cost under $10 or you're getting ripped off.",1583020859

If Bloomberg for example had been taxed to a degree to stop him from ever becoming a billionaire, then the tax dollars collected from him would be significantly less.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Nintendo sells:

-difficulty settings (Metroid 2 Remake, Breath of the Wild)

-save slots (breath of the wild)

-content present in the game disk/cartridge that is unlockable only if you pay for it (when other companies like Capcom sell on disc DLC people is outraged, but somehow is ok when Nintendo does it) 

-removed mechanics (they are back if you buy them, oc)

-cheats usage

-Unfinished games (most DLCs are announced and developed before the game launch, so the games are unfinished and the content is questionable, just look at TW3 EXPANSIONS they add like 25-30 hours, like a full fledged game, nintendo DLCs are short, expensive and shitty, that kind of content should be part of the base game)

-and of course is starting with the microtransactions (smash bros has, Super Mario Run has, Animal Crossing has ""macro""transactions)

-abandoned the fans to focus only on casual players (I miss playin a good Fire Emblem, one of my favourites franchises T-T, now is only ""fun"" for undemanding casuals)

I understand that she was being toxic for being controlling but her being negative isn’t really her fault, she can’t control how she feels and I really doubt she’s being depressed just for the sake of it. You said that she’s needed space for 6 years, I don’t think she wants to be like this, I genuinely think she’s trying but she doesn’t know how to solve her problems. You have to think about her intentions, ask yourself, is she purposely being negative to make me upset. 
In this case I do think you’re being selfish, you have problems and she does too. If you love her then you’ll be happy making her happy and just telling her she’s been depressed for a long time so she should be happy by now isn’t helping. However she did sulk at the fact that you were happy, I don’t think that was healthy of her but from her perspective she felt like you weren’t helping and she just wanted her space ,but she could’ve portrayed it to you in a nicer way. Overall I think both of you are immature, she doesn’t know how solve her problems and becomes bitter about it.

I'm mostly done with my Zeus grid; unless they add another Grand Light character with a broken weapon the only things I feel that I could really use are a fourth Eden, Metatron, and a Taming Sari. I do have two Ivory Arks already I might invest in at some point if they end up becoming more vital as it is.

I have enough weapons plus a summon for a Zeph grid already, and the few pieces I'm missing for being a true Windlord are all Legfest things (a third Love Eternal, a Sky Ace, Andira). Unless they release a new Wind Grand with a broken weapon or run the roulette through legfest I don't think the roulette will make a major difference there. It'll be a little while yet until I have all the upgrade materials for me to switch to it anyway.

I think the only thing that could really make me change my mind about what to invest in as far as primal grids goes is if I luck into an Agni and an Ixaba or two, although I'd probably end up grinding a Prom grid then rather than trying to collect a full whale grid. 

What would actually have the most impact for me overall though would be lucking into a Belial so I wouldn't have to use a Siero ticket to get him. Being able to free up all those gold moons for bars would make a big difference.",1583020863

You don't have to be.  Everybody can use social media to their advantage if they have something worthwhile to post about themselves. You don't have to pull 'celebrity' level of clout on yourself, as long as it's offering another avenue of social possibilities for you. Not to mention that a lot of celebrities don't start off as celebrities themselves, but have got to that point by obsessively promoting everything they do...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's still posting ""gym selfies"" whoring for likes. Just like a bitch You're catering to bitches bro. Stop playing their game &amp; make them play yours.

Nobody gives a fuck about what you think. If posting 'gym selfies' gets you pre-selection or any kind of advantage in pulling women then it's arguably worth doing. Nobody gives a fuck 'whose game is this', you ain't Jigsaw motherfucker, you're some rando from the internet trying to be alpha on a forum full of anonymous dudes.

Also, you're acting like posting a picture of yourself requires you to go out of your way in terms of money/time/effort... It takes 10 seconds to do, you're already going to the gym, or you should anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The fuck? Who cares about what that bitch thinks. She needs to pass **MY** background check before I'll give her any attention &amp; access to any of my resources.

You fucking geek. It's not about caring what girls think, it's about exploring your options and using the nature and desire of women to breed with physically attractive men to your advantage. You can do this in many way, but arguably the easiest, quickest and most wide-spread way to do is IS TO FUCKING POST A PICTURE OF YOURSELF WHERE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAN SEE IT. 

This is how i know you ain't getting no pussy, because you say stupid shit about you needing to background check girls...There's no background checking with women, unless you are vetting them for a LTR or marriage. If you're interested in fucking, all you need to know is in the forefront \[the appearance of said woman\], not what her background is... 

&gt;Stop catering to bitches. Simps like you are why they act like complete shit.

I ain't catering to no one, i just play look at what the game is and try to play it to my advantage. I don't give a fuck about your perception of the state of the game, and what men and women should be doing under some BS narcissistic fantasy you live inside of.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Hey OP, so a couple of thoughts I have on this situation, and my opinion based on my experience. It does sound like she does not feel valued or loved in this relationship. Although I do believe it is totally reasonable to ask for space in a relationship, she is either taking this to an extreme or trying to get you to pull some weight and show her you love and care about her. Also, we all sometimes prioritize friends over our SO's in a healthy relationship, however, you should prioritize her more often if you want the relationship to last. 

What kind of attachment style are you? How often do you text her, and have you two discussed your comfort levels with too much/little communication? I know for me, I am a little bit avoidant, and I want to really trust my SO that I don't have to text or call often. That's just how I am and I took me a long time to realize that it's okay, it just doesn't work for everyone. I have had issues simply because I did not fully trust my SO, and took little communication as pulling away or lack of interest. 

Anyway, I would think carefully on this, because more often than not, the amount of effort you put in can be an indicator that you don't really want to be in the relationship. Ask yourself if this is what you really want, and if so, to what level are you willing to fight for it?",1583020865

This is very similar to discussions throughout history where multiple great powers talk about the best way to divvy up a colony. Be very careful about listening to the language they use. Listen to the assumptions they make about the underlying issues. The assumptions often tell you a lot more than the words by themselves. 

They talk about “opportunity being lost” when Africa trades with itself. The opportunity being lost is theirs, not Africa’s. The man is skeptical of the African trade agreement because he thinks they won’t be able to overcome “corruption.” What is his definition of corruption? 

USA and China are locked in a battle to see who will be able to rape Africa most thoroughly.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

**Title:** [USA-FL] [H] AirPods Gen 1, bad battery; AS IS [W] Paypal

**Username:** /u/djfakey

**Body:**

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/r048Ell)

AirPods Gen 1. I’m only owner. Bought 2 years ago. 

**Left AirPod** seems to disconnect randomly so music doesn’t play out of it randomly. Also battery doesn’t last long. Maybe an hour with music.  

**Right AirPod** has bad battery. Maybe 45min music listening.

**Wired charging case** works fine, haven’t had an issue with it charging or holding a charge. Has some nicks and dings

Includes original box. No lightning cable. Check timestamps for what you’ll get. 

**$50 SHIPPED in US ONLY** via PayPal invoice. 

Selling AS IS. No returns.

I recently had to leave work early due to vomiting intensely from my period, a few months ago had to leave early because i bled through my undies and was about to bleed through my pants. 

Did i ask for any of this shit? no. Is it as bad as some women have it, of course not, but like i know i got very lucky to be born here, and even here, my right abortion is restricted.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","There are two grammatical ambiguities in the contract (Thank you English).  If you want to be an ass, section D can be interpreted in two ways:  1) ""The DDA will only harm those individuals or groups specifically designated as enemies by the mortals, where those **mortals** are described in Sec A.""  or 2) ""The DDA will only harm those individuals or groups specifically designated as enemies by the mortals, where those designated as **enemies** are described in Sec A.""  If you examine Sec. A you will see that no one has been designated as an enemy.  Thus the demon will never attack anyone.

If you want to be less of ass with the ambiguity, you can take the same ambiguity for Sec C and interpret it in two ways: 1) ""For the duration of service, the DDA will follow the instructions of the mortals who are described above in Sec A."" or 2) ""For the duration of service, the DDA will follow the instructions of the mortals where the instructions to be followed are described above in Sec A.""  The second interpretation is a lot better because it only pledges the demon's service which could be interpreted as physical work.  Thus the demon never has to explain anything.  If you want the demon to fuck with the party this is important.  Under this interpretation I'd then follow the following steps:

Step 1, the devil can hide/destroy the paper the contract is written on so the players/characters may never review it again.  It won't change the contract made but the details are then up to the players to remember.

Step 2, the technical details of ""specifically designating individuals or groups as enemies by the mortals"" should be interpreted quite literally.  

Every single time the party wants the demon to attack someone/something, every party member must go through the process of explicitly saying ""I designate that person as an enemy, go attack that person"".  Just ""Attack that goblin"" doesn't cut it.  At no point should the demon boast of why it isn't attacking.  It should just acknowledge it heard what the player said and then do nothing on its initiative.  The fact that there are three parts to the riddle and they get no feedback until they succeed with all parts (all players, designate as enemy, and order to attack) means it is unlikely the players will figure it out, especially if they can't reread the contract any more.  

If they do the impossible and figure out the riddle of their creation, and anyone is silenced, not present, or died (and not resurrected) they are shit out of luck.  Also, all orders to do anything the demon doesn't want to do must come from every party member.  This takes time so it could get a bit of disobedience time before getting fully ordered to stop.  Much longer if someone is sleeping in another room.  Not once does the contract say the demon can't work against the party in ways it wasn't instructed not to.  This should be used sparingly though.  Finally, the contract should be taken to override all orders so orders to accept orders from a subset should be rejected with a ""I hear you"" and no explanation.

They will get frustrated with step 2, especially if you limit the number of people who can say large amounts of text simultaneously in a combat situation (as you should, 6 seconds isn't long enough for 4 people to say such long sentences in non-synchrony).  I'd personally rule that it takes 3 seconds per person per target.  Any spell casting that has a verbal (V) component can't be done on the same turn as instructing the demon.  They will turn to using more general phrasing to instruct the demon to attack entire groups within a few sessions.  This leads to the next step...

Step 3, If they want to designate a group using anything remotely ambiguous it will interpret that in the least favorable way.  For example, everyone in that area -&gt; party member moves into that area is now and forever designated an enemy.  And enemies move -&gt; not an enemy.  For every order it should be interpreted consistently though.  Between orders can be inconsistent.  Anyone in that direction (pointing) -&gt; examine the map carefully to find everyone in an infinitely long projection in that direction, kill who ever you want at a later date.  Anyone who helps the BBEG -&gt; start killing store clerks, inn keepers, important people in communities that didn't know they helped the BBEG.  Kill all the humans -&gt; all humans are now fair targets.  Kill the goblins -&gt; time for peaceful goblin traders in a city.  Obviously you can and thus will announce the party sent the demon to kill 'random' town people.  Or if the party ever helped the BBEG in any way at all you can then attack the party... obviously days later while they are sleeping in different rooms.

Under no circumstance should you ever let the party claim they have the right to un-designate someone.  That isn't outlined in the contract.  Attacking any party member should be at moments that could lead to an actual member death.  Signing deals with devils and letting them stick around the party is dangerous and should be reasonable for a party member death.",1583020869

And yet you won't put your money where your mouth is by shorting he who falls? You sounded so certain before but now you're backing down. Interesting. It seems you've conceded that you don't know the future. Amazing. I think very few of us don't own renewable companies so that does nothing to support your original case that oil and fossils are dying industries. You simply don't know that. As I said before, ""Who's not investing in renewable companies? It isn't either renewable or non-renewable. You can investment in both."" Please stop ignoring what I write.

You look at data **and guess**. That's my point. You're just guessing. We don't know. Intuitively, I agree with you. I think renewable companies are on the rise and oil and fossils are on the decline. However, I don't know that. I don't make my investment decisions based on feelings. Dividends are irrelevant so I hope people wouldn't foolishly invest in a company just for the dividends.

Your graph shows heavy growth since the trough in 2017?? Businesses fluctuate in profitability all the time. Earlier, you just alluded to that by saying ""something happens in middle east and oil prices shoot up 10-20% in a day "" so I don't see your point.

"CancerFamilySupport","t5_3e65q","My sisters fiancé was diagnosed with stage four kidney cancer and they told him he had a year to live. That was two years ago. The cancer was in most of his major organs and bones, also his brain and brain stem. His last scan showed “no uptake”. Meaning no sign of cancer. If the cancer in her bones is kidney cancer that means they only have to treat kidney cancer and not bone cancer and kidney cancer. Doctors have no way of telling how a patient will respond to treatment. The first doctor my sisters fiancé saw told him he should book a cruise while he still feels good because there was nothing they could do to help him. They saw another doctor. His treatment was immuno therapy.

My dad was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer about 6 weeks ago. The first few weeks are the worst. It does get better. It’s awful waiting for results and for treatment to start. I know first hand that cancer is a wild card and anything can happen. Take whatever news you get seriously but be aware doctors are just going on generalized results, everyone reacts so differently to treatments they really have no idea.

The best advice I have is to appreciate the good days, and if you have a bad day know it will be over in 24 hours. No one is guaranteed another day on earth and just because your mom got diagnosed with cancer doesn’t mean she will go before you. You will only get one chance to deal with this In a manner which you will have to live with for the rest of your life. Make it count! Try and keep things as normal as possible, I know it won’t even be close but fake it till you make it. When I found out about my dad my mom said “ we will not sit around waiting for something bad to happen, we will live our lives and hope and pray for the best.” I’ve just started stopping by more, calling more, and really appreciating how it feels to hug my dad and be close to him.

I actually just submitted an extra payment to see what would happen. I paid $1000 (though nothing was due because I paid my normal payment on 2/14) and $894 went to principal and $106 went to interest. This looks right to me, the only thing I don’t like is it now says I I don’t have a payment due until April but I’ll still make payments every month whether i have one due or not.

I think if I combine my extra payment with my normal payment, I’ll see all of the extra payment applied to principal, I think the only reason I had the $106 in interest above is because of the time between the two payments.",1583020871

I very much agree with the sentiment that high derivatives volume can impact swings. But what the hell do they expect us to do?

We all know the banks and institutions short the hell out of the market, as individuals we own the right to do the same when the time comes.

As an investor, a contributor to the economy, and an individual, we have obligations to ourselves to pursue the most optimal path forward in the financial world. Perhaps derivatives wouldn't be so attractive if bonds, commodities, crypto, etc, weren't such atrocious options.

If he cares about his nephews, this is a good way to make sure that the money he spends is going directly to helping them, and not to whatever shit his mother may spend it on for herself instead of for its intended purposes. 

Also, if, in the future, you're more prepared for children, and you and BF both are on board, you two could talk about seeking custody of the nephews, especially if BF is concerned about his mother's impact on their lives, and we know their mother isn't a suitable parent for them. (I say this assuming their father isn't in the picture, since they seem to be with your BF's mom full time based on what you've said in your post.) I don't know how you feel about that possibility, but it could be a potential solution to many of your concerns- keeps kids from being messed up by BF's mom, keeps BF from feeling obligated to give his Mom money, etc., and if you both love and care about these kids and want to do right by them, then chances are y'all are better, more suitable surrogate parents than BF's mom is.",1583020872

In capitalist systems, it is possible and likely that someone who makes something is upwardly mobile. Thus a worker who notices a way of making something better, can strike out on his own and start their own company eventually becoming a manager.

I have a neighbor who has 12 cats plus some ferals she lets run free and they drove my cats insane. You can't change other people, but that doesn't mean you just have to accept the situation.

I would suggest you instead invest in many of the products available out there to deter cats from coming onto your property/patio.  There are motion activated sounds, or water spraying devices that will do the trick. You can also get a relaxing plug-in device for inside your house to keep your cat happier and make sure to close the blinds to that window for the time to limit line of sight for pet. Lastly, cats can jump remarkably high, so I wouldn't worry about her getting stuck.  She can get out, she just doesn't want to.

If you care about winning Spring overall, there's not really a need to panic, we're still 3rd after this loss and we haven't seen how the team performs in a series yet, or when they're not 'trying something new' which they obviously were today. If you care about TSM's summer LCS performance and potential worlds trip, then what does spring matter anyway? It's 18 Bo1s for a team of 5 players who are clearly capable of winning in LCS, look at last weekend when we played standard. Two comfortable-ish rollovers of weaker teams that are worse than us player-for-player.

The mindset I have, is that, unless you're the best team in the world, you will eventually have to face a team better than you. This means they play a 'standard' comp and win most of the time. So you look for a way to be good at something else, in a way that specifically beats the meta comps and strategies, and this gives you an opening of how to beat great teams.

Really it is like any other industry, most funeral directors do the job because they have compassion and the desire to help grieving families. However, to make yourself and your family most comfortable when the time comes that someone has passed away, you should preplan. Go to a few funeral homes, meet the people, get price quotes for different types of services, and ask lots of questions! If you meet with one funeral home and you don't trust them, or they rub you the wrong way for any reason don't hesitate to go somewhere else! The best way to know you aren't being ripped off is to develope a relationship with a funeral home before you pass away. We have many older individuals tht come in regularly have  cup of coffee chat for a  bit with us and leave a check to be added to their burial fund. Note, look into the laws of your state. In Minnesota all pre-pay funds need to go into a trust, and can be transferred to any funeral home if desired. The people who stop in to chat and add to their fund get to know us well and makes the hardest time in their life, a tiny bit easier, knowing that they are in good hands! We are a gossipy group, which is weird to say, but if one funeral home hears of several awful things at one nursing home it doesn't take long for that to spead to other places. We also know a lot about hospices and sometimes even the hospitals if there are multiple in the area, and churches. Churches are actually a huge one if you are ever in a position like me. I don't have faith but my mom is christian but hasn't attended a church regularily in many years due to work. I started scoping out good churches to bring her to for something to keep her occupied after retirement. We get to know the pastors as well as the congregation. Many good resources you wouldn't expect can come from your local funeral directors!",1583020874

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","Yes, the Circassians were a later dynasty, though it does go to show you there was not 800 years of continuous Turkish rule. The area has gone back and forth many times. And again, I’m not sure I’d call Baibars and his clan “Turks” in the same way I’d refer to Ottomans. They were Arabised Cumans. The medieval Turkmen in Antioch came from the collapsed Seljuk Empire, they didn’t have much to do with the dynasty in Cairo, though that’s kind of pedantic I just thought I’d clarify.

According to Dr. Jack Kalpakian there were many Alawite expulsions, although not as much as the Armenians, I’ll give you that one too. 

As for the referendum, there was both a popular referendum and a parliamentary vote. The French were basically looking for an excuse to hand it over since Ankara wanted it really badly, for practical reasons and because Atatürk mistakenly believed a popular theory at the time that Turks were directly related to ancien civilizations, including the Hittites (In reality all Anatolians are probably descended from the ancient inhabitants, be they Turk, Armenian, or Greek, as evidence suggests the Eastern Romans and Turks didn’t replace all the old inhabitants of the area, and performed more cultural assimilation than direct colonization.) and was pushing for annexation prior to his death. The French believed that Turkey was on the verge of joining the axis and wanted to sweeten the deal with an exchange of territory, yet in a twist of fate it wouldn’t matter because the Germans conquered them within a year. The best solution for the region now, imo, is to simply get a peace process going so the border can loosen up a bit and people can travel more freely again. Though that’s easier said than done. This war really hasn’t done any good for anybody.",1583020874

If you use the pad as a base and then pack the wound with a fluff roll the pad (in theory) could be missed by the surgeon and be a source of surgical infection.  However I have packed wounds with a 4x4 and then follow it with a fluff roll because I was resource limited.  I just made sure to tell the surgical team that there was a separate piece of gauze in the wound.  
  I also don’t believe it has to do with sterility because all QuikClot and Chitan impregnated gauze are all gamma irradiated.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Release Date: 21st February 2020  
  
----  
  
In the wake of acclaimed singles ‘Points Beyond’, ‘Wake Me Up’ and ‘Melodies’ the innovative trio finally share their much anticipated second artist album ‘Hardly A Day, Hardly A Night’.  
  
In 2016 they released their debut album ‘Brainsugar’. Accumulating over 40 million streams, the album won praise from Mixmag, Resident Advisor, Consequence of Sound and DJ Mag, who described it as “a startlingly accomplished debut” in their 9/10 review.  
  
The electronic trio now presents ‘Hardly A Day, Hardly A Night’. Inspired by the cycles of time, and the cyclical movements of the planets, the new 12 track record weaves together themes of loss, hope, and acceptance. Showcasing their remarkable production techniques and textured sound design throughout the album, Cubicolor continues their unconventional rise to the upper ranks of the electronic music world.  
  
“We're very excited to share our new record with you. We've put everything we had into making it. The second album is always the hardest for every artist. For us it was no different. We nearly broke up, lost loved ones, had significant health issues, but through all of that we are still here, stronger than ever. What tied us together then and now is that we love making music. We hope that passion shines through in the music!""  
  
‘Hardly A Day, Hardly A Night’ is available now via Anjunadeep, digitally, on CD and on limited edition 2x12” mirri board gatefold vinyl.

"canoeing","t5_2t797","I have a side mount that I made. I'll look for the plans or photo online in a sec. 

I have a 14' pelican plastic canoe. Its a shitty canoe and don't recommend it but it was free. I use a 30lb trolling motor that I bought at a pawn shop. It scoots my canoe at a pretty good clip. Don't remember what size marine battery I have. It's big and I've been out for over 8 hours and never ran it down. 
I place the battery in the front of the canoe and ran long battery cables  the rear for the motor. 

I'm in Illinois and you might want to check your states laws because in Illinois once you put a motor or sail on anything you have to register it like it's a motorized boat. 

Good luck.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","&gt;Wenn ein Plakat Erklärungsbedarf hinsichtlich der eigenen Motivation benötigt, sind nicht all die anderen Schuld, die es nicht ""raffen"", sondern die Leute hinter der ""Botschaft"".

Der Erklärungsbedarf besteht ja nur weil 2 von 3 Zeilen der Transparente gekonnt ignoriert werden. Den Zusammenhang sollte man als doch schon etwas gebildeter Journalist schon ziehen können. Vor allem als Sportjournalist mit Schwerpunkt Bundesliga. 

&gt;Mal abgesehen davon, sehe ich nicht wo das Problem der Kollektivstrafen ist.

Jo, aber die Genfer Konvention ist nicht so der Freund davon. Und dafür gibt es Gründe. Selbst der DFB hatte vor nicht allzu langer Zeit eingesehen das Kollektivstrafen nichts bringen. Nach sehr langer Arbeit der Kurven. Und diese wurde jetzt durch eine Privatfehde von Hopp zerstört. 

&gt;Durch die feige Vermummung der Störer können diese durch Videos nicht haltbar gemacht werden.

Dir ist bewusst das in jeder Kurve Zivilpolizisten sind und diese im Regelfall Kontakt zur Kurve haben? 

&gt;Dementsprechen muss die Kurve sich selber reinigen

Von was? Von Leuten die gegen Missstände protestieren? Die sich mit Gleichgesinnten solidarisieren? 

&gt;Du scheinst aus der Ultra-Szene zu kommen, welche Lösung schlägst du vor?

Ich komme nicht aus der Szene. Ich sehe das diese Transparente halt nicht als Problem an, von demher bin ich der falsche für eine Lösung da. Wir können uns aber gerne über meiner Meinung nach richtige Probleme in der Kurve (zB das Werfen von Pyrotechnik) oder im Stadion (zB Rassismus) ist unterhalten.",1583020878

“Democrats aren’t going to really do anything” is a statement that ignores the fact that they are presently doing a lot.  They are focused, motivated, and moving with swift calculation.

But you think if they get control of the White House they’ll suddenly stop?  It sounds kind of nuts.

Edit:  Downvote all you want, but I have eyes, and I know what I’m seeing.  It’s a coordinated nationwide assault on gun rights.  You can’t erase it, you can’t undo it.  They’ve foolishly taken off their smirking mask of “cOmPrOMiSe!” and gone balls out for gun grabbing.",1583020878

Office Depot actually gave me two free desks because I had to escalate one time.

They just needed my CC to put something on the order. I asked multiple times to ensure I was getting 2 free desks. I was assured I was.

2 weeks later, there's still a charge on there for a desk at full price. I had to escalate a bit to the corporate office just wanting it to get dropped to the discounted price. Of course, everyone kept telling me I was lying, no way I ever got promised even a replacement discounted desk. By the time it got to corporate I was threatening to dispute it with my bank.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt;Do you remember what you had for breakfast precisely one week ago? We've been doing this for three years straight. None of the incidences are notable enough to remember anymore because it's just another out of hundreds at this point. I appreciate that you've explained why you asked. I'm going to take the liberty of assuming that my statement in particular doesn't matter quite as much as an example of any sort of the things you brought up, and move on from my claim.


If I had had the same experience hundreds of times on the internet, and I had all my comments in a history I could easily look back to from a time I recall still responding to those, I would think at least a couple of instances might stick out in my mind, and even if not, I could dig one up without much trouble. I might not be able to say what I had for breakfast precisely one week ago, but I can certainly recall the details of notable breakfasts, and can remember in detail a breakfast I've had hundreds of times, and if I had a log of all breakfasts I had I could easily go find an example of it.


I think it's just hard for many NSs who come to this sub honestly trying to understand TSs better to be convinced that their characterization of the events like you describe is accurate, when this sort of question comes up time and again and the response is so frequently to not offer one example (though sometimes they do, and sometimes they offer good ones!), while simultaneously making the claim that it is so widespread and so egregious, and generalize it to ""all the mainstream media,"" ""leftists in general,"" etc. It just encourages the most plausible explanation in my mind to be that the TS asserting such a degree of whichever effect is under discussion is more likely reacting to their own cognitive biases than painting a true picture of reality.


&gt;Articles with the headline along the lines of ""Trump says the coronavirus is a leftist hoax"" are being shared all over the place today. Trump did not in any way say this but that's what the title says and no one actually reads articles. Check the comments on these posts. Everyone thinks that's what he actually said. What he actually said was that the left was politicizing the coronavirus and that politicization was their new hoax. Not the virus itself.


I agree with TSs that mainstream media often is biased and can misrepresent things, but again, it's all about the degree of how bad it is - coming from many on this sub, it seems they think every word uttered by the MSM is a lie, and that outlets do everything in their power to rile up as much Trump hatred as possible.


After a few Google searches:


Here is a FOX article talking about the Trump response to the critical headlines like those you mention:


https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-campaign-media-coronavirus-hoax


When I follow links to each of those cited headlines in the first paragraph, the article makes it clear, usually in the first paragraph, that Trump was referring to their politicization of the coronavirus, not the virus itself.


When I watch the full video excerpt on the FOX article, it seems rather unclear to me exactly what Trump is referring to by calling it their ""new hoax."" That they are overblowing the dangers of the coronavirus? (WHO and CDC, and even Trump, as he argues, are not treating the risk lightly). That they are trying to paint Trump's efforts to respond to it as insufficient? (the argument can certainly be made). Trump is a bit ambiguous in his own statement IMO.


Meanwhile, a Google search for ""Trump coronavirus hoax"" brings up plenty of left-biased outlets with the specification of Democrats' criticism being the ""hoax"":


Vox: ""Trump casts criticism of his coronavirus strategy as a Democratic Party 'hoax'""


Slate: ""Trump Slams Democrats Over Coronavirus Criticism: 'This Is Their New Hoax'""


Chicago Tribune: ""President Trump accuses Democrats of making coronavirus ‘their new hoax’ after criticism of his handling of outbreak""


BBC: ""Coronavirus: Trump calls criticism Democrat 'hoax'""


Esquire: ""Trump Called Coronavirus Response Criticisms a 'New Hoax' From Democrats""


Anyway, my point is just that even while I agree media is biased (something that is encouraged as we allow media outlets a lot of editorial leeway on the truth and there's plenty of bias from right-leaning sources as well), it just doesn't seem to me to be so pervasive and purely fabricated as to warrant labeling all news ""fake news,"" yet my impression is that many TSs treat it exactly as such - not a word uttered by any MSM outlet (or maybe just left-leaning outlet) should be trusted and should be assumed to be false from the get-go, and every article is part of some larger conspiracy to treat Trump as unfavorably as possible. I just don't think reality reflects that viewpoint.

I have lost myself to the never ending sleepless nights; Lying there, in a cold sweat and hyperventilating.

I need that musty fragrance to absolve and wrap itself around every square millimeter of my being. Only then will I truly find happiness and meaning in this god forsaken purgatory of mundane life. By luck or by fuck I will find that jar and pry open its crusty seal and release it's pungent glory to the whole of mankind; my legacy and only true purpose in life now is to find this jar, bury my face ballsack deep and pull with the force of 17 Dyson DC55 total clean™️ vacuums until my ribcage fractures and my throat implodes causing massive trauma from such extreme force and inertia hefted upon them from each individual muscle fiber straining to get a taste of the sweet, sweet nectar.

Then you send your game to them and they review it and then if they approve they will work out a business deal but who knows what MM is coming up with. I’d love for it to be more then just PlayStation. I’d want us creators to publish to what ever platform we wish",1583020882

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","your post gives very little info as far as what kind of content you're running, how strong your build is, how long you've been playing PoE, so here are some general points that might help

* currency and valuable drops only come from actually killing monsters (besides flipping currency/items in your hideout). it's more than likely that you can improve your efficiency by spending less time in your hideout. 

* make sure you have a good loot filter (neversink is probably the most popular one) and set it to an appropriate strictness (never leave a map just to empty your inventory).

* make sure you pick up and vendor 6-socket item drops. the jewellers orbs add up over time and are a very reliable way of generating currency

* if your build is strong enough to handle T16s at awakening level 8, you should be easily over sustaining with map drops and can sell your excess maps in bulk for considerable profit

* influenced items and boss drops make up a big chunk of lucky big ticket items you can sell for multiple exalts at a time

* if your build is feeling weak, you should ask for build help in the daily questions sticky thread with a link to your character page. if you aren't using a build guide, that can help a lot. [ZiggyD - buying your first item set video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4aZrsY9M5qBxERp-3iAA8iyyFyeWvaxA) details a great process for buying gear on a budget, though that budget can be much higher and you'll just have to adjust your search criteria accordingly

* the chaos recipe is great for beginners because it requires much less knowledge and research than valuating and trading items with players. it does quickly become tedious and has a pretty low ceiling for earning rate, but is much better than vendoring rare items haphazardly

* if you have an extra premium tab, you might wanna consider filling it with identified rings and amulets at a flat, relatively low price (2c-5c). when it fills up, just vendor everything in it. if someone whispers you to buy an item, look at the item and ask yourself what stat(s) they're looking for; if you can't figure it out, just tell them you're kinda new and ask them what stat(s) they're looking for, chances are they're already getting a good deal and might be willing to explain why their build wants the item. this will help you gradually gain an understanding of what stats/combos are valuable and why. your understanding is usually limited to builds you've played before and this approach can accelerate your trade knowledge faster than you can level up and properly gear characters (and you earn currency while doing so)",1583020882

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I do not recommend a credit card at all, always get a debit card and learn how to pay for items you have money to buy. Never buy anything on credit and make sure if you do, pay it immediately to clear the debt. I have seen to many people get into debt using credit cards.

If you are clever with money however, you can use credit cards with a 20month 0%apr, put everything you buy onto the card and put the money you would have saved into an isa or high interest savings account. When the min payments are due, pay this off and continue to accumulate the debt and savings. Never under any circumstance use the savings for anything else. When you come to the end the 20months, use the saving to pay off the debt and collect the interest and repeat the process again. It's alot of work for very little pay back but its ""free money"" as I like to call it. Get it wrong and it can put you into alot of debt so be warned.",1583020882

Q. Are these times consistent both on and off your corporate network with the corporate machine?

Q. Was the install process used (installer files and config tweaks) for both machines the same? Or does your IT use a install/deployment process for their client installs?  If the latter ask yo see what the configs look like.

My other  thoughts are as follows:

1. ArcMap may be looking for  resources that are blocked by corporate policy.  Performance should be the same on and off network.  Delay is program attempt to reach resources until timeout.

2. Policies restricting traffic or completely blocking through specific ports.  There may be ports that your IT might be blocking fot security.  Policy might be different between on network and off network, so can't tell you if difference in on network and off network would cause this.  However, this is easily verified in your config, and reviewing if your IT has any policies affected these ports.

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Just remember power for altitude pitch for airspeed isn't a solid rule. Always be aware of the tradeoffs. If you change one, you need to change the other most of the time. If you're high, you need to pitch down, but all that's gonna do is make you faster, more speed = more lift, and the nose is gonna come right back up unless you trim it, then you'll lose altitude and gain airspeed, which is maybe what you want because maybe you were high and slow. Always think of that. If I change this, what else do I need to change? Don't be afraid of trim, you should be trimming a lot in the pattern, every single time you change power or pitch, trim it if you want to keep it.

Let's say you're low and fast. What do we need to do? Do we need to add power? Maybe not, because if we trim the nose slightly up, maybe we'll bleed that speed off and get our altitude back. Maybe it isn't enough, the nose still wants to drop and we're getting too slow now. Ok now we need to add some power. But remember you add power, the nose is going to want to go up because you're dumping more air on that horizonal stabilizer, you need to trim nose down to stop the nose from pitching up too much, causing you to get slow and high.",1583020886

All 3 primary colors have to be balanced to get grey. Mixing complements for grey is tricky but you might try lowering the amount of yellow in the mix if you're getting taupe.

It's pretty difficult to get grey with a black dye in my experience because of the nature of most black dyes. Black is generally a mixture of colors used at a high WOF % for intensity and the mixture is almost never really neutral. I would look at Jacquard or Dharma Trading's silver grey and Cushing's dark grey. Dharma also has a platinum grey but it's more of a cool grey in my experience.",1583020887

* **[Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/about/rules) (rule #2):** 


 * **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous and descriptive.

 * **Make sure your post makes a genuine attempt at being funny:** Ensure the content you're posting tries to poke fun at a politician, or political event. 

 * If your post causes us to scratch our heads in confusion, don't be surprised if it's removed. Posts need to be funny, unique and make some form of effort in trying to make people laugh. 

 * Low quality images, shitposts, trash memes or troll memes will be removed. Repeatedly posting posts when they've been removed in the past will get you banned. 

* We understand how deciding if something is funny can often seen as subjective, so just [send us a quick message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor&amp;subject=Rule%202%20Removal:%20Second%20Opinion%20Request&amp;message=Please%20put%20link%20to%20post%20here%3A%0A%0AWhy%20should%20we%20reconsider%20this%20removal?%3A%0A%0AAdditional%20comments%3A) if you want us to take a second look at it for you. 


* **[Don't be a jerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalhumor/about/rules) (rule #6):**  

* The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team.


* Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance.


* If you're a jerk, including use of ""tard"" or anything related to Clown World, you'll be shown the door.

*****
&gt; Roubini is famous for his daring prognostications and now, he has another one: He believes that coronavirus will lead to a global economic disaster and that U.S. President Donald Trump will not be re-elected as a result.

&gt; If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007.

&gt; Roubini: Because there is a significant risk of a war between the U.S. and Iran.

I don't remember if they got their tests actually from the CDC, or they said that the CDC now allowed them to use their own tests.  Maybe the CDC gave them to WA early because of the cases that are popping up here?
  
Have you heard if California gets its tests from the CDC, or are they doing their own thing regarding their recent cases?
  
Edit: Some more info in this article [here](https://q13fox.com/2020/02/29/king-county-health-officials-1-death-new-cases-of-coronavirus/) (scroll down to ""Officials Work to Expand Testing Capabilities"").

*****
&gt; Roubini is famous for his daring prognostications and now, he has another one: He believes that coronavirus will lead to a global economic disaster and that U.S. President Donald Trump will not be re-elected as a result.

&gt; If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007.

&gt; Roubini: Because there is a significant risk of a war between the U.S. and Iran.

If you are are a teacher then there are regulations about having to report child avuse if you see it.

If you are a pilot then there are regulations about how many hours in a row you can work.

If you are a traveler then there are regulations about what you can do on airplanes, or what identification you need.

I'm just gonna say I think it would have been the right thing to do to give Sasha at least some of the money. It isn't your fault that your dad chose to cut her out, but you really need to be more understanding of her position. I'm sure it really stings knowing that you and your dad were living a relatively nice life while she was literally abandoned and left to struggle. If he was that behind on child support then it goes without saying that he was not doing much to support her, which must have been really tough for not just her but her mom as well. Her texts were harsh, but I understand why she feels the way she does. He was her dad to, whether him or your mom like it or not. He should have put you both on his life insurance policy, but you could have stepped up where he didn't and shared with her regardless. Knowing that she will continue to struggle while you use his life insurance to buy a house is like the final slap in the face in her eyes.",1583020891

"underlords","t5_117kpk","Let me be straight with you:

Bloodseeker is not a good stand-alone unit lategame, i.e., he is not a 3 star Luna that you can put in regardless of alliances and still expect good results. He will run into somewhere and die a horrible death, wasting a spot on your board.

Bloodbound units are in general very mediocre and below average warlocks/mages, i.e., using them feels like a burden in later stages.

Any meta lineup, hell, any decent lineup stomps a 3 star bloodseeker. Period.
Don't give me your Stonehallpike or cloak crap. If you are bad enough to not have a bkb on bloodseeker? A potm arrow: he is dead. A hobgin stun: he is dead. A ride ravage: he is dead. A bear root: he is dead. He runs into 3 ranged hunters: he is dead.

I have not lost to a 3 star bs yet. Either because again, he is a crap lategame unit or because people are smart enough to get out of bloodseeker/bloodbounds after they have done their job. A good example is the recent OGApit underlords tournaments, while bloodseeker has seen play often, he didn't do much and was sorted out for later compositions.

I am sick of these posts complaint about bs. Let me be straight with you: 
stop whining, very likely that you are just very bad. Look for solutions against bs, whining about it isn't one, unless looking like a whiny bitch was the outcome you are aiming for.",1583020892

The mode really spiraled off into another direction after bo2.  For all the focus being shifted to story telling mode they did a really shit job of it and the final product is bo3 being confusing as fuck but still really good maps to bo4 all the maps except chaos are remakes and not as good as originals and now the story makes even less sense and heres another shitty story oh and we wasted even more resources on a second story line and on a campaign just like the one that cut in bo3 and hey it got cut again for bo4 but this time we dont have time to make it work...

Blundel screwed the pooch on several fronts.  From fucking up the campaign story to fucking up the zombies story.  To wasting resources in the millions on multiple games back to back.

I know he meant well growing up with the series and watching its evolution bo4 was just insulting as a final product and continuation in the series to me.  It showed a complete lack of an organized leader with a plan and proper scrump scheduled for production.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Sorry, I didn't mean the term internet atheists to offend. I originally just wrote atheists, but then I thought that isn't right, because most atheists I know don't make this kind of argument. My experience is that it is an argument mostly made by atheists who enjoy debating online, so I said internet atheists.

&gt;Are you an 'internet theist'?

Yes, obviously.

&gt;As for the actual argument, there is conflation and equivocation with 'begins to exist'.

I can be a bit slow, but I don't see an equivocation. Yes, somethings begin to exist when pre-existing atoms are arranged in a certain form to make them. This is what we mean almost every time we use the phrase ""begins to exist."" Other times we use the phrase we mean something coming to exist entirely from nothing. This is a very niche way to use the phrase, and usually it is marked by the latin qualifier *ex nihilo.*  When the argument says everything that begins to exist has a cause it obviously means in both senses of the phrase, ie. *ex nihilo* and otherwise.

But when the atoms that make up me are arranged in the right form, that is when I began to exist. This arrangement needs a cause, obviously, I'm sure you know all about how that happens. I just seems crazy to say that nothing begins to exist. Didn't you begin to exist sometime in the past? Not your atoms, but you? I know I did.",1583020894

I would be lying if I told you that I don’t still miss aspects of our relationship. We broke up in April 2018. I miss him sometimes, and I miss our life. I have a new boyfriend and I would never hurt him. Some will say that it isn’t fair to the new boyfriend, but I’m of the impression that I feel everything very deeply. When I love someone,
I always love a part of them. The truth is, that the missing still comes. It always will but at some point I started realizing that despite the missing, I actually understand now why it was better that we split. I am happy to move on, and I am happy with everything I have now.",1583020894

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","It's my understanding that as the blood in your body is in a closed loop system (like a tube filled with liquid and connected end to end).

Performing CPR correctly means you are pushing pressure on the heart to pump blood out when you press down and blood will come into the heart when you come back up during compressions. 

You add oxygen into the bloodstream when you do mouth to mouth resuscitation. 

To pump blood in and out of the heart correctly you need to actually get pressure past the ribs, which is why you need to aim for the ~5cm / 2in (1/3 depth of chest) depth when performing chest compressions. 

Yes this may break some ribs, but if you don't get the depth during compressions, CPR will be inadequate.

Someone like Scientology can actually pose a mild threat to them when they make fun of them, or celebrities can affect the shows ratings to an extent, but there is nothing stopping them from attacking people smaller then them, and I find the fact that they do to be sad.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Sindra sipped on her coffee as she read the newspaper, a bite of pumpkin bread making its way in with every other sip. It was her morning routine before she got to business as Mindburst, and it was her way of staying sane in the busy life she had. The coffee shop owner was also rather pleasant to talk to, seeing as he always knew what she wanted before she had even got to the counter. Granted, she was the one telling him telepathically, but he didn't need to know that. As she gazed at the Gazette, the Hero's Section caught her eye, apparently some upstart new villain called Firefreak was making the pages, and...  


""OH HELL NO!"" Sindra shouted as she stood up, grasping the paper with both hands as she read, right in the second paragraph, that Red-Zone Mikey, her sworn archnemesis, her most hated man, and unknowingly, his tennis partner on Wednesdays, had called this... FireFUCK into a showdown at high noon today. That wouldn't do, it WOULD NOT DO, Red-Zone was HER nemesis, NOBODY else could have him! She tossed the newspaper aside, and it dissipated into atoms, reforming into a black-and-white costume for her to use as she flew out of the shop, towards the main stretch of town as the church bells signaled 12:00.  


Red-Zone Mikey went flying through the air with all the grace of a brick, only stopping when the concrete of the building behind him kindly caught him. Firefreak came in, propelling himself forward with streams of blue flame, and socked Mikey in the gut with a left hook, cracking his rib. Mikey groaned, and threw up a red forcefield, but Firefreak just laughed and broke it with a swat of his hand, bitch-slapping the hero another dozen yards.  


""AHAHAHHAA, WHAT A JOKE! If I had known the Great ""Red-Zone"" was such a weakling, I would have started being evil sooner!"" Firefreak cackled as he rushed in and threw another fist at Red-Zone, but felt his hand stop mid-punch, then a sudden wrenching motion as he was yanked back across town. He felt his hands and legs pull together, and was left dangling before Sindra as her costume dramatically flapping in the wind she was making.  


""Speaking of *jokes,*"" Sindra said, tighting her psychic grip on the man, ""I'd like to know exactly what you think you're doing*, newbie.*"" Firefreak opened his mouth to answer, but felt his tongue get tugged out of his mouth before he could say anything, biting it a little on accident. ""*Not a word.* Listen here, *Failfreak*, Red-Zone is MY bottom bitch. I see you try anything on him again, and I make your current human pretzel impression look like the work of a four-year old. GOT IT?"" Firefreak whimpered, nodding in terror, and Mindburst tossed him aside, leaving him to his own devices on how to best get away from her as fast as possible, and she flew over to Red-Zone.  


\[I had him right where I wanted him, you know.\] Red-Zone signed, and Mindburst responded with the one piece of sign language everyone learns. \[Fine. Thank you, Mindburst. I am *forever* in your debt.\] She still didn't know how he was able to so easily convey sarcasm in sign language, but she groaned as she flew off. After all, she'd forgotten to finish her coffee.",1583020896

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","Do you farm lotteries? I also very rarely farm mats outside of event shops and I reached huge QP hell prior to the Christmas season due to some lucky rolls. 220m QP is absolutely nothing once you've managed to get the mats to 10/10/10 servants. It does seem like you're rather new and that might be the limiting factor. It took over a year of that style of playing to actually hit QP hell due to finally having the mats to skill up servants and hitting that lucky roll period where I actually had many servants I wanted to 10/10/10. That being said Lunchtime is more useful overall, you only bring Mona Lisa when farming doors and very rare quests that give lots of QP but Lunchtime you can slot into pretty much any non-event farming.

Love how you state that as if it's a fact. It's not. It's just your assumption based off of past illnesses.  Normalcy Bias. Yes, many illnesses start like this, they seem more deadly because only the severe cases end up going to the hospitals and getting tested, however, that does not appear to be the case with this.  In a lot of places rn, pretty much anyone even resembling a case or anyone who has been in close contact with someone having it is being tested, not just severe cases. Out of the people on the cruise ship already almost 1% are dead and even more in severe condition. Many experts have already said the ""iceberg effect"" does not seem to be nearly as apperent as with other illnesses in the past.

&gt; If you really believe this kills 3 percent of people that have it then I have a bridge to sell you 

Tell that to the experts who estimate the death rate to be 2%. The death rate is also largely dependent on the health care provided. In some places, it could fall below 1% while in other it could rise tremendously.

You mean something that was theorized but then proven?  Patriarchy is still a theory an a boogieman at that.

Where did I say otherwise?  But if you think men as a group have always been more powerful and dominate than women you should read up on history then, and more so focus on economic and social class.  

&gt;I’m an upper middle class straight white man, but I don’t buy into that “we are the real victims” bullshit lol.

Your privilege is showing.  But you are also upper middle class.  Mind you a lot of feminists are middle to upper class (feminism did after all started with white rich women), and they claim to be victims. Surely you see the issue here.

&gt;also, it isn’t a theory, it is a concept.

Tell academia that then.  As they call it a theory.  Either way its still a boogieman especially in countries like the US where power is more economic class based than gender.",1583020898

If I'm not actively keeping up with software, visual trends, and expanding my skillset, I'm actively falling backwards. There's a circuit of local freelancers and everyone knows everyone. Helping a producer on a passion project on the weekend for free will must likely land you a gig. If it's your first time being invited back to a facility, it might be a good idea to bring some donuts.

Projects can get out of control fast. I deal with painfully early call times and late night edits constantly. Sometimes you'll be on your feet for 12 hours without a break, sometimes incompetent project managers turn easy edits into multiple day nightmares. Just don't complain. We all know it sucks. Just suck it up and get it done. 

It kinda irks me when I see people bitching that they can't buy a home at 22 while waiting tables at TGI Fridays or claiming that anyone with a successful career, ""got lucky."" Like we all know Adam probably wouldn't be where he is today if he didn't train Jimmy back in the day.

I usually do the $11  special which you get a dozen donuts 20 donut holes and a fancy donut. I normally get maple frosted, glazed donut holes and a cinnamon twist bc thats what I like. They started in Oklahoma and I'm not sure if it's a midwest thing or something but they seem to have location all here in the midwest. Not sure if you would see one say out in California or not.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has won the South Carolina Democratic primary, CNN projects.

Earlier today, Biden, speaking at a rally, confidently proclaimed that “the full comeback starts in South Carolina.”

We’re going to win South Carolina, and the next step is North Carolina.

And tbh when he does, Gruden will be enamoured because Byron seems like the exact type of guy he looks for.

To stop binge eating drink a lot of water throughout the day it helps to keep off from over eating. When you think you’re hungry it can be your body saying hey I’m thirsty.

**Please report unverified sellers who respond privately to your buy ads.** This is against our rules, and will result in a safer community for everyone.

Thank you for posting to r/SexSells! There has been a recent **increase in scamming from unverified sellers** who will contact users through their buy ads. For your own safety, we recommend you only work with sellers who are verified on our subreddit. Moderators will be unable to help you if you work with unverified sellers. 

To ensure someone is verified: Ask every seller **to comment on your thread** and check that they have Verified Seller or Trusted Seller flair before continuing. If they can't comment, they may be banned. [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSexsells) with any questions about a user. **DO NOT SEND PAYMENT** until you have seen for yourself that a user is verified. A user who offers to verify for you themself on kik/cam/etc may be who they say they are, but there is no way to hold them accountable in the event that they take your payment and do not deliver services.

**Please refer to the [ban list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/wiki/bans)** before sending a seller payment, especially if they claim to be verified but have not commented on your thread. Many of the ""sellers"" messaging you who will not comment are on this list.

The hands are seen when jumping, vaulting over something, wall running, etc. When with a weapon, it's held at low speeds at aim stance, and then lowered as speed increased.

Both new Shadow Warrior games also have a very cool katana holding stance in first person, and it's even two handed like here.

"elixir","t5_2vhb3","A lot of people have brought up a lot of great points here.  I have production experience with both elixir and scala and I like these kinds of thought exercises so I thought I’d chime in. 

The choice should ultimately be made based on what’s best for your team. Performance will be part of that but so will language features. If your team has a heavy java background then scala might be better - they will appreciate the familiar tooling, interoperability, and static type checking. If your team is used to loosely typed languages and a very modern approach to tooling, then Elixir may be a hit. A miserable engineering team can cost a lot more than poor software performance.

WRT performance, without knowing more about your usage and team I’d say it’s a wash. Elixir can be very fast and so can scala.  It obviously depends on the application but in my experience (across a pretty broad range of performance requirements), performance problems are more likely to be due to poor architecture decisions than they are due to limitations of the language.  Don’t make everything an actor, don’t make any more network requests than you have to, etc. 

For streaming it depends exactly what you mean/want. I have worked on some very high-throughput applications using elixir and kafka and it was a joy. No frameworks involved, just subscribing to a topic, calling a function on every message, and publishing the results back to a different topic. I don’t know if you’d call it reactive but I’m not sure what benefit that would provide in that use case. 

WRT Phoenix I think you may be missing something. There’s absolutely no requirement to use Phoenix and there are no dependencies or anything that only work with Phoenix (excepting, of course, things specifically designed to work with Phoenix). Elixir is a powerful language on its own with great tooling, a relatively good collection of third party libraries, and a fantastic community.  I don’t think I understand why you would choose not to use elixir just because Phoenix exists. It gets a lot of press because a lot of people write web applications.

There’s a great blog post (or maybe it was a conference talk) titled “Phoenix is not your application”. The basic idea is Phoenix is just a set of actors running in your application and you should build your code with that in mind. In fact I’ve found it to be extremely useful to add Phoenix to already-existing applications to provide either an API or just some operational utility. You can accomplish that with a lighter-weight set of dependencies, but Phoenix really isn’t that heavy to begin with. You don’t have to use it, if you do use it it’s very unobtrusive, and there’s not much overhead to using it when you do.",1583020905

&gt;It happend a couple of times that my coworkers asked me to go party with them, but since I never went partying I always decline

In my experience, the best response for me in this situation is ""ya know, I'm an aspie dude/dudet, and part of that is that I'm fairly quiet in social situations, so if you don't mind me being fairly quiet while we are out, I'd love to...""

Honestly and openness is the one thing I've found that greatly releives the stress and anxiety, which for me mostly stems from the pressure to act more neurotypical, something that takes a tremendous amount of mental energy to do.  If I remove that and set attainable and healthy expectations, it relieves the anxiety that would be there otherwise.

I feel that talking about it made our relationship stronger and it also made being sad in front of them and with them natural, and in a way beautiful.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The Markers are just receivers for a signal made by a lifeform, and we know the Brethren Moons can be killed, too. One man killed one. An entire race of the most advanced beings in the galaxy couldn't stop The Flood, and that's even after they wiped out trillions- if not quadrillions, if not more- of lifeforms in their attempt to do so.


What you're talking about is destructive capabilities, not suffering- and you're looking from a biased point in the timeline. The Brother Moons reached Earth, and they'll probably consume it, yes. But in the grand scheme of things, that's relatively inconsequential. Skipping to the end of the story isn't a good measure of how much suffering something can inflict. When The Flood wins- be it in a hundred years, or a hundred million, or 4.5 billion- all the souls it has consumed will continue to suffer endlessly, even if every cell of their original bodies has long since decayed. When the Brother Moons kill earth, they'll just keep roaming through space like Hellstar Remina, eating whatever they can find, until a higher civilisation wipes them out. At the end of the day, they're just another killable alien species that wants to conquer the universe. The Flood practically _can't_ be wiped out because they exist both in realspace and a higher, untouchable dimension- meaning that they need one single spore left in realspace to come back from annihilation. The record of their suffering will never, ever cease. They will consume the universe until the universe ends, as all things must, and there's no escaping it.


Isaac was able to continue because he never lost hope. He wanted to escape and live with Ellie, whatever form that life took.


The Forerunners were a lot smarter and a lot more hopeful than Isaac Clarke, and they still came to the conclusion that killing EVERYTHING was preferable to trying to fight or escape the Flood.",1583020909

"r4rDFW","t5_2ta8v","We had to remove your recent post on /r/r4rdfw because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4rdfw).

Finally, please make sure you read the the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

it's like these delusional fat people who try to convince themselves and everyone that being fat or obese is pretty, it is not, it looks unhealthy, it IS unhealthy, people who shame them or discriminate are bastards, but saying it's pretty and good looking is insane, what humans consider pretty and attractive are things that look strong and healthy (super thin models is a modern thing, for most of the history beauty just meant ""healthy looking"", take greeks as an example)",1583020911

I don't know why she's posted this in IF; this seems more like DWF stuff, doesn't it?

EDIT: not to mention that of course humiliation is bad but that good physical education classes should not humiliate students. I remember at my school we had to run a mile for a fitness test - I walked most of it, had a time of about 12 minutes, and didn't feel humiliated at all.

*****
&gt; Roubini is famous for his daring prognostications and now, he has another one: He believes that coronavirus will lead to a global economic disaster and that U.S. President Donald Trump will not be re-elected as a result.

&gt; If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007.

&gt; Roubini: Because there is a significant risk of a war between the U.S. and Iran.

There would be ""wonder shorts"" which push the balls up front and accentuate the cleavage. Like diamonds on a pedestal.

There would be a little hole in the shorts to let the ball cleavage poke through

"nCoronaVirus","t5_2eq9ss","Well, when they have only tested less than 500 people, what did we expect to happen? 

The mishandling of this whole shit show from day one was based around blaming someone else for the problem. To date the US government has not taken an active role in stoping the spread beyond closing borders and stoping plane flights. If you watch any of the Senate panels on this the experts have constantly said that this will not stop the spread. 

From the first week the CDC and DHHS should have been testing anyone showing flu like symptoms but failing a flu panel. But instead they are only testing high probability travel cases. It wasn't until last week that this policy changed... And even then they are only testing those requiring hospitalization. 

This is not the way to stop the spread. This methodology will only catch those needing critical care and those people would already be at a point where they would spread the disease to few other people. The people we need to worry about are those still going to work or trying to tough out the begining stages of what they think is the flu, or worse the ones who are asymptomatic. None of these people are even being considered as a threat by the people in charge of managing this epidemic.

"GetMotivated","t5_2rmfx","Not lying, and I'm assuming not misinformed since the information came from Steven Furtick and a few of his associates when they came to a children's ministry ""conference"" my (former) church sent me to. It was around the time of the Orange tour, but I can't recall if this particular appearance was part of the Orange tour or a seperated event.

At this time, SF was pushing what Elevation called ""The Code"" - life lessons and quotes for children to memorize. They touted some of the same ideas of the Bible, and quite a few just mainstream ""good qualities"" but supposedly this was more friendly for kids who ""had trouble memorizing the Bible."" Except some of these ""codes"" were a little...off. obedience was pledged to Steven and not god. He was the ""visionary"" and they had to protect his vision.

Remember the infamous ""cult coloring books""? (Though I imagine you called them something else if you serve in the church) they had those at this conference, for us to see. I believe they were even promoting the opportunity for the artist to do a custom version for the different churches. I wish I still had mine, the only reference I could find online is [this article](https://standupforthetruth.com/2014/02/elevation-coloring-book/). Even the artist doesn't associate herself with this work anymore.

Granted, this was a few years ago. But I find it hard to trust any church that has a history of demanding blind obedience to a pastor before God.

And no, I didn't spend time in the church. I spent time in one that was being mentored by SF and his church, an Elevation satellite in everything but name. They also took heavy influence from HILLSONG and Bethel, and now are on their own path to spread THEIR message, rather than god's.",1583020912

I know because I avoided credit until I was in my 30s, had almost 800 credit score within 6 months of opening my first card, which I only did to get a loan to purchase property. Had I had credit at 18 and through my 20s I would have bought a lot of things I did not need and likely fucked myself.

Just live within your means until you plan to use your credit for something, it's really not that hard to build as long as you haven't already fucked up your credit.

*****
&gt; Roubini is famous for his daring prognostications and now, he has another one: He believes that coronavirus will lead to a global economic disaster and that U.S. President Donald Trump will not be re-elected as a result.

&gt; If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007.

&gt; Roubini: Because there is a significant risk of a war between the U.S. and Iran.

A couple weeks later I texted him to see how he was doing, and that turned into constant texting and calling. I went to his apartment a little while later to hang out, and he told me he had feelings for me, and kissed me. 

We started dating but since he was my manager we couldn’t talk about it at work or even let on we were friends. It was impossible. A few people caught on and we swore them to secrecy. We were trying to hang in there until I was promoted to his level, which I was told was about to happen, but eventually I just couldn’t wait anymore and found another job. My last day, we finally became public, and it was such a relief. 

Today he is my best friend and the love of my life. He knows me better than I know myself to be honest...one time he knew I was about to throw up a solid minute before I knew I was going to throw up. I’m actually sitting on my break at work counting down the minutes to close so I can go home to him. I can’t wait to see his face.",1583020918

Thinking about how the 'trader' side of things could have gone makes me especially sad. So many ways to undermine the gangs, and potential allies to recruit from the parks, all could have led to a dynamic final battle. Instead it's just you going gung-ho alone against a hundred heavily armed raiders.

Imagine a personal quest with gage that either hardens him as a raider, or convinces him to turn away from that life. Instead of simply being a character that talks at us. Isn't the point of games to be reactive to the player?

I wonder if it was a deliberate choice, to highlight that a themepark is all show and glamour but ultimately without substance.  Doubtful but in either case, it being a shooting gallery where you only really get to pick the final outcome feels par for the majority of Fo4.",1583020920

There was a great bbc article highlighting how native English speakers speak a different kind of English than global speakers. Global speakers speak a very formal kind of English, and many metaphors, colonialisms, and nuances like tone get lost. 

And while non-native speakers really understood each other, they had trouble understanding native speakers and speakers who had full grasp of the language. 

For example, One time while I was in Germany for a semester abroad, I helped some students with their English homework. 

The German native, English teacher was not pleased and argued so much of it was wrong. I sent the homework back to the US to an American English teacher who sent it back with the note “no grammatical issues”. The German English teacher was even unhapper about this and it became a huge thing. 

It goes to show that you can learn a language well, but you cannot *know* a language until you live it. (Like living in the US has definitely changed the way I speak English)",1583020922

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad"," 

I love the idea of cross pollinating genres, but you have to ask WHY it can work. 

Noir is french for black. For fiction to fall under noir it should possess a checklist of elements such as corrupt characters with an onslaught of vices, dark/bleak atmosphere, violence, and a story structure that piles on unfortunate events complete with an equally dark or rather black ending. 

I think fantasy is an unlikely yet perfect setting for noir. You can explore misty hills and abandoned castles, plague ridden cities, blood in the streets mixing with soot and rain. The mashup has so much potential. I’d liken it to grimdark. 

The text reads really well as a monologue. I can see this working well on a stage with a character in full medieval drab. It would be entertaining to see in a play but how it is currently- it isn’t working for me. 

Even though it’s written in 1st present with a hint of 2nd, I didn’t connect with the character because I felt there was a lot of telling rather than letting the reader experience being in the characters head. I felt there needed to be more description such as what the smell could be likened to instead of just calling it a lingering stink. 

I’m seeing a lot of filler words/phrases and vague identifiers. Also, the sentence length is a bit repetitive so it dampens the pacing. I was pulled out of the narrative when reading those little touches of ‘whaddaya know’ and ‘You just can’t get away from it, kid.’ etc.  It came across as sticking a lit cigarette in Geralt of Riviera’s mouth and making him speak with a transatlantic aficionado. Each instance of those anachronisms was less compelling and more satirical imo. 

Overall there were a few grammar mistakes and odd word choices but I could picture the scene and was intrigued by the concept and some lines but not sold on the execution as a whole. I think the text would come across better if written in 1st past with more show than tell to make the narrative a little tighter. 

&gt;*I smell them before I see them. All the powders, potions and perfumes in the land can’t mask it. All the spilled ale, cooking meat and ripened cheese in this tavern can’t mask it. It’s the kind of smell that sits under all others. Lingering down there for whoever decides to go sniffing for it.*

I smelled the monsters before I saw them. All the potions and perfumes in the kingdom couldn’t mask the stink. Nor could the scent of spilled ale on the floor or cooking meat and ripe cheese. The stink lingered in the tavern; a scent that sat beneath all others like the hint of garlic under the nail bed or the sweet rot of a dead mouse in the wall. It was there waiting-hiding...for anyone who decided to go sniffing. 

Just an example but I think it works a little better with a bit more detail and in past tense. Perhaps it’s a personal style issue, but when I read 1st present in fiction it slows down the pace because the MC is giving a play by play as it happens which feels unnatural. 

I think you have a good start so far, it just needs some polish.",1583020922

Don’t try to thread the needle with a low 4 iron punch shot to the green.  Take your medicine, chip it out. Play for bogey or maybe make a putt and even save par. Oh that was on a par 5? You’ve played a reasonably safe punch forward but now if you hit your 3 wood absolutely perfect, you could get to the green in regulation still despite having OB down the entire side. Noo, just hit it 115 yards twice, try to save par but at worst bogey.  Not smack that 3 wood OB and end up getting triple (I did exactly that 2 rounds ago).  I should have played safe.  It’s all about trying to get the doubles and triples off the card.  Bogey is a good score when your goal is to break 90.  Good luck!",1583020923

&amp;#x200B;

The BM, by the way, had nothing to do with his healing at all (aside from the one applause emote I gave him the first time he did it)- the BM barrage was to chide him for his endless parry spamming and backstepping.  I did it while he was healing because that's when I had time to do it...

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Hey! Please refer to rule #13 and see below for more information! 

Unfortunately we strictly don't allow memes on the subreddit anymore (and at moderator discrection we usually remove other low effort images ""Ex: Check out this gay thing/This minecraft thing I did, ETC"") as we have noticed over time with no enforcement of this policy the subreddit it quickly moves away from the intended place of advice and discussion towards more of a /r/dankmemes meme filled subreddit which is fine for a subreddit that is intended for that kind of material but that is not what this subreddit is intended for, low and high effort memes/images will at times have 5x the amount of karma any individual post will get and thus knock important personal questions down the listings and causing them even more unlikely to be seen which is a problem.

We still love memes and they are definitely a great way to cope and relate or just have fun so I suggest if you want to resubmit this image or browse other similar things you should head over to a sub like /r/gay_irl and check out their sidebar/rules as well as suggested communities and find a ton of great content (We are unaffiliated but they seem to be the place for gay memes).

Sorry to let you down on this topic, I know it seems a bit silly but we take our users problems really seriously and it's a terrible thought to me that we would instead go for the lowest common denominator and allow memes to fill the pages while those that are in desperate need of help and guidance are forgotten and pushed out so unfortunately this is the decision that was made.

I hope you can understand and either way I hope you have a really great day/night.

There's something about a lot of buzzing and NVH that makes you involved whereas new cars are quite cushy, heavy, and have a detached feeling compared to stuff from the 90's and older.

You will probably be able to skip some courses and transfer credits if you have already done some math. I didn’t because I wanted to stay eligible for scholarships.

Most of the challenge is the course load, some semesters I took 6+ courses with a lot of them having labs. You are pretty much in class 9-5 Monday to Friday and then have to do all your coursework outside of that. The first year courses are generally easier since they are mostly intro courses so it’s a good warm up to get used to the course load.

There are lots of projects and papers that require a lot of time, especially the final project. I for sure pulled a few all nighters (because I am a procrastinator), especially near the end of my vessel design.

&gt;As for the points about Shadow of the Colossus, the gameplay there is very particularly designed to work with every other aspect of it and would not necessarily work well.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;But yea I couldn't just take advantage of the system like that, Id feel bad

Depends on how you look at it. I rationalized it like this: the system will have to pay way more in health care costs if I continue a job I don't particularly like and burn out in my 50's. The system is by the people for the people. Abusing it and lying is wrong, but I was just straight up telling them what I wanted to do and why and got my application accepted (I even told them I looked for jobs in other EU countries, and they were completely fine with this - in fact they had a whole web-page dedicated to help me find jobs in the EU).

For you if you move with your boyfriend (and qualify for some of the assistance, can't speak for how long that'll take as a non-EU citizen), you could see it as the state investing in you. Once you have built on yourself you can be a stronger citizen and help your society (e.g. it was a good investment for society to give you the benefits). Even if you don't become a tax-payer the investment might still be good: benefiting from e.g. free therapy might mean you support your husband (or neighbours) better, allowing them to be happier which in the long run means they live longer healthier lives and can pay back into the system.

Increased happiness for all individuals living in the system should be the end-goal of the system. Sometimes it's not quantifiable. It can be small things. Maybe one person volunteers at something. Maybe they spend some time picking up trash in the park because they think it looks beautiful. Maybe they make some art and have people stop and think or sing beautifully. Maybe they sit and talk with some elderly at a park bench and increase the nice atmosphere in the neighbourhood that way. Maybe just a smile while passing a stranger is enough?

\----------------

Haha oops I got carried away. If you do at some point decide to go to Germany you should for sure learn German! You can get by there without it (knowing English is really all you /need/ in the EU) , but there's just so many people that don't speak good English, and most communal or governmental things will be in German. I've lived for shorter periods of time in EU countries without bothering to learn their language, but if I was to stay for longer I feel it'd only be right (really helps with the enjoyment of living there too).",1583020925

Trolltunga (Troll tongue) is a rock formation situated about 1,100 metres above sea level in the municipality of Odda in Vestland county, Norway. The cliff juts horizontally out from the mountain, about 700 metres (2,300 ft) above the north side of the lake Ringedalsvatnet.[1]
Popularity of the hike to Trolltunga and rock formation itself has exploded in recent years. The increased popularity has turned Trolltunga into a national icon and a major tourist attraction for the region. Until 2010, fewer than 800 people hiked to Trolltunga each year. In 2016 more than 80,000 people hiked[2] the 27 kilometres round-trip from Skjeggedal, making it one of Norway's most popular hikes.[3]",1583020925

It would be different in that sex would only be permissible in an opposite-sex marriage when both sides intend to procreate.

- Change your pillowcase way more frequently than you usually do.
- Do not sit on/ lay on your bed with your outdoor clothes.
- Change your clothes after you go in-doors.

My Mom never realized that she got pregnant from bio-dad, and always maintained that birth certificate dad was my real father.   

I don't blame anyone, it happened, and I am the result of that happening.

**Charity Drive for Equal Justice Initiative**

To help celebrate this occasion, the moderators of BPT are organizing a charity drive to support the [Equal Justice Initiative (EJI)](https://support.eji.org/BlackPeopleTwitter). EJI provides legal representation for prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted of crimes, poor prisoners without effective representation, and others who may have been denied a fair trial. The folks at EJI are on the front lines of combating racial and economic injustice, as well as protecting human rights. We want to equip them to continue carrying out their valuable work. For those who may have seen Just Mercy recently, Michael B. Jordan plays the founder of EJI, Bryan Stevenson, in the movie.

I particularly enjoy stanza three, where you talk about the love of poetry and the love of a woman, and how you say her smile is unreachable. Something very sad about that.

The end of the poem is particularly strong. It sums up the poem nicely, and shows again our speaker's love of poetry. How it is created in nature, for example, and I interpreted it as being able to see beauty in the moment.

Continue to create fresh images with strong language, think about all the ways nature can be sympathetic to the human condition and write about that. All in all, good piece, hope some of this is useful, and have a good day!",1583020932

My end of seeking was completely different. I hadn't been a seeker that long. Mystical experience in mid-2013, then psychosis realization that truth existed early 2014, then end of seeking early 2015. The seeking ended because there was a nonconceptual experiencing that I am what I was seeking, so seeking was no longer necessary. However, although the direct apperception of truth ended seeking, the effect on the body/mind apparatus was limited as the machinations of the mind and the subsequent identification and suffering continued and continues. It was a ""shallow"" realization, akin to recognition of awareness, rather than a dissolving of any sense of internal agency.   


What a beautiful self-realization you have had. Do you feel any pull or yearning to embody the shift in being, or is integration unfolding naturally? Do you notice any egoic movements? I.e. desire for the moment to be different in any way, any suffering that arises from resisting the inevitable?   


How long have you been on the spiritual path? Was there a lead up to the shift in this consciousness? Had you been meditating a lot, contemplating, inquiring into the nature of reality and your identity?",1583020932

"WorldBuildingDaily","t5_37dxp","40 hears ago, the Pirates of Baybaria stoped The Lenineta, a Slavic Federation colony ship. A small team boarded the mechanical section of the ship and cut the power lines to the Warp Drive. Contact was then made with the ship's operating crew and surrender negotiations were conducted. The agreement was quite generous, as SF Colony Ships were better defended than those of any other nation. The sleeping colonists would become property of the Pirates and be sold into slavery on Baybaria. Each crew-member could choose to join the Pirates or life freely on the surface. In addition to choosing one of their colonists as their personal slave, those living on Baybaria would receive a commission on the sale of the colonists.

The Settler Manifest was transmitted to the planet surface. The slave companies and Merchant Republics went about their usual pre-shipment routine of wild speculation, flattery, bribery, and sabotage as they competed for the right to sell the Pirate Fleet's catch. Orders began to pour in from across the planet. 

The most striking was from the Sultan of Janujalid in the distant south. He had requested the Lenineta's entire security detachment, offering a wild price. Usually, young men were bought as slaves and raised to be loyal soldiers. Importing a group of experienced soldiers, already loyal to eachother, was obviously a risk, but the Sultan was desperate. Janujalid was quite isolated, well beyond the normal bounds of Baybaria's civilization, surrounded by hostile Insectoid nests and marauding Ashlander tribes. Nevertheless, it rich in resources and well positioned to form a thriving ecosystem. All that was needed was to secure the region from enemies and invest in its development.

His investment seemed to pay off. 7 Insectoid hives were destroyed. The southern Ashlanders were decimated and forced into submission. Enslaved Ashlanders were forced to build dams, capturing the water of the melting ice caps and irrigating hundreds of kilometers of previously uninhabited wasteland. The elite Lenineta Regiment grew to respect the Sultan's wisdom and open-mindedness, and as he grew old, he gave the army increased amounts of money, land, autonomy, and influence in government. Crucially, unlike most Sultans, he gave his slave soldiers authority over their own religious affairs. Outside the citadel stood a large cathedral, encircled by the homes of Janujalid's new Christian population.

The Sultan's son saw this religious minority as a threat to his power, and he was right. The Leninita Regiment was still combat worthy, growing old, but more importantly, experienced. Their sons held priveliged positions in government, organising settlement efforts and infrastructure projects. The Orthodox Christian community was jealous of the power it held and unwilling to relinquish it to the upstart Sultan. As the Leninita Regiment were resting in their homes, celebrating Christmas, the new sultan ordered all gates into the Orthodox district be sealed shut, the houses set ablaze, and the cathedral bombarded by cannons.

Hearing of the betrayal, the Christians outside the city mobilised for a rescue. While some of the Muslim soldiers and citizens inside mutinied and rioted in support of their Christian comrades, the Crusading mob, unaware of events inside the capital, began to torch farms, barricade roads, and prepared to starve the city into submission. Survivors give conflicting accounts of who won the battles within the city walls, but it didn't matter. When the cathedral collapsed, the Christians blew the dams, flooding the  entire city.

The Christmas Rebellion shook Baybaria's society, launching a wave of slave rebellions and holy wars that lasted decades. The only form of planetary unity on Baybaria was religion, and the new Union of Leninita brought that to an end.",1583020933

I’m starting to get pretty frustrated and it’s early. I know the second area has a boss but I can’t even find the boss. I’ve upgraded both sets of armor and have now tested both of them and they both take the same exact damage so it doesn’t really matter now.

So basically you just have to evade all attacks. Which is fine because it’s like doing a no hit run on dark souls.

Here’s where I’m frustrated. So by the time I’m through the level you end up having to fight these much larger machines that heal themselves. There is very very little damage you can do to them regardless of what part of the body you hit. So doing the level takes a long time. If you die you redo it all that’s fine, just like most games of these.

Where the hell should I go and why? I’ve saved two people that are in home base now. I can’t access any of the doors because of power and to get back to where I died takes about an hour worth of grinding the enemies.

There is only one shortcut I’ve found in level two. Outside home base you can go down the pipes and take the lift down.

I got to an area where I extended a bridge but now I’m beyond lost. No not lost. I know The area really well. There is just nothing to do. 

I don’t mind having to grind to grind but having to grind and it not payoff is just a waste of time. I can’t upgrade my stuff anymore because the materials aren’t in this area and the charm of this game is starting to wear off pretty hard. It’s just factory room copy and pasted. Recycle room copy and pasted, conveyer room copy and pasted. 

What am I missing?",1583020936

&gt;The surgeon general on Saturday urged the public to stop buying masks, warning that it won’t help against the spread of the coronavirus but will take away important resources from health care professionals.

&gt;“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!” the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”

&gt;The plea comes as panicked consumers rush to buy masks online, including so-called N95s, a surge that has led to price gouging and counterfeit products.

&gt;In another tweet, Mr. Adams said the best way to protect against the virus is to wash hands regularly, and for those who are feeling ill to stay home.

&gt;Health officials around the world have been imploring the public to stop buying masks if they are healthy or not caring for someone who is ill. Medical professionals need a large supply of the masks because they are in direct contact with infected patients and must change their masks repeatedly.

&gt;“There are severe strains on protective equipment around the world,” said Dr. Michael J. Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program at the World Health Organization, during a briefing on Friday. “Our primary concern is to ensure that our front line health workers are protected and that they have the equipment they need to do their jobs.”

&gt;Dr. Ryan said masks primarily prevent a person from giving the disease to someone else.

&gt;“There are limits to how a mask can protect you from being infected,” he said. “The most important thing everyone can do is wash your hands, keep your hands away from your face and observe very precise hygiene.”

&gt;The W.H.O.’s guidelines recommend that health workers use surgical masks to cover their mouths and noses but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed them to wear masks known as N95s, which are thicker, fit more tightly around the mouth and nose, and block out much smaller particles than surgical masks do.

&gt;Both masks help prevent the spread of droplets from a person’s cough or sneeze, but medical specialists have said that for average members of the public, they are generally not effective.

&gt;A person is more likely to get infected by touching contaminated surfaces than from a droplet traveling through the air.

&gt;Air can also get in around the edges of the masks, particularly flat surgical masks. Health care workers who wear N95 masks as part of their jobs are required to undergo a fit test at least once a year to ensure that there are no gaps around their mouths.

&gt;Most people are unlikely to know how to wear these masks and could accidentally contaminate themselves if they touch the outside of the mask when they remove it and then touch their face.

&gt;“Not having a mask does not necessarily put you at any increased risk of contracting this disease,” Dr. Ryan said.

&gt;But the message has not stopped people from buying the masks, particularly the N95s, which are usually inexpensive and popular with construction workers and painters.

&gt;“You know what a mask costs?” said Mike Bowen, the executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech, an N95 mask manufacturer in North Richland Hills, Texas. “Listen to this: A Class 2 medical device, you can buy two of them for the price of a gumball.”

&gt;He added: “They’re cheap. They’re automated. They’re not handmade.”

&gt;But on Amazon, sellers have been advertising masks for at least $10 each. One seller advertised 160 masks for $800, a deal that was no longer available as of Saturday.

&gt;Vice President Mike Pence seemed to address the shortage during a White House press briefing with President Trump on Saturday.

&gt;Mr. Pence, whom Mr. Trump appointed to coordinate the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, said the administration would have “40 million masks available today.”

&gt;The government has contracted with the multinational manufacturing giant 3M to produce 30 million more masks a month, Mr. Pence said.

&gt;Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday that it was critical that masks remain available for doctors and nurses who were caring for those affected by the virus and for people tending to loved ones with the illness.

&gt;“There is no role for these masks in the community,” he said. “These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.”

&gt;Dr. Redfield’s comment came after an exchange with Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, who asked how people should be preparing, including whether they needed to stock up on food or prescription medication.

&gt;“Not at this time,” he said.

&gt;“Should people be afraid?” Ms. Houlahan asked.

&gt;“No,” he replied.

&gt;“Should you wear a mask if you’re healthy?” she asked.

&gt;“No,” Dr. Redfield said.",1583020938

"udub","t5_2razk","I actually disagree with this point. The grade is based on average and not on the absolute grade of a student. Common mistakes like misreading is a skill that is worth testing, if u misread a document during a serious procedure and risk the lives of your coworkers then that’s a severe issue. I don’t recall any issues made by my professor and doubt there could be a serious gap in knowledge by any small mistake. Most of the stuff is conceputal and a small error SHOULD be caught my over 200 students and it’s not fair to blame the professor. For sure I hate the physics system with all the stupid stuff all over the place, but overall I enjoy the work and progress im making with understanding it conceptually. Most of the stuff should be visualized in your head and be able to make sense. I think the content and skills tested were adequate and the average will account for common mistakes people made. If this class wasnt graded on a curve I think people wouldn’t have this common opinion (except for the shitry layout of god damn 20 different things we need to do every week). Thats why i feel most of the course complaining arises from those graded on a curve because a bad performance on a curve equates to complaining the test is usually unfair. However, I think the test was fair as it perfectly hit tension and atwood machine which is conceptually hard to understand (and papers have been written about why is it so hard), conservation of energy, force diagrams, springs, work. All of this stuff was explained in class and further exploration could have been done on your own time. I remember asking my friend atwood machine questions before the exam because I knew tension is gonna be the hard question they would ask and it appeared on the test so that worked out well. I guess i might be bias but I feel the entire sequence is not really that bad as people claim.",1583020938

Otherwise, software intercepts the keypress and sends the instructions to the device, which can vary greatly from device to device and sometimes is not well-documented. Sometimes, the software exists, it just requires an X-config change to map the key to some instruction/command, since X can't automatically know how the manufacturer ""reused/defined"" the Fn-Keys, or if there are non-standard keys on the keyboard.

Sadly, it isn't very consistent at all and is a common problem with Linux and other systems not designed/preconfigured by the manufacturer.

"NASCAR","t5_2qs08","It was still being used by NASA, SCCA, and other road racing sanctioning bodies until Copart offered the owners a fortune to lease it for Hurricane Harvey car storage. Lemons and Chumpcar raced there as well.

What really doomed TWS wasn't the facilities themselves, they were a little run down, but still usable for the most part. The location was absolutely horrible. Highway 6 was (for most of the track's existence) a 2-lane road that couldn't handle race weekend traffic, being out in the middle of nowhere meant no sewer system, so they used septic tanks, and inadequate ones at that. On top of those logistical hurdles, there's the fact that there is pretty much nothing else to draw people into the Bryan/College Station area besides Texas A&amp;M.

The track was doomed for big league racing from the start, but had done pretty well for itself for grassroots motorsports once they built the road course.",1583020944

&gt;You are right in your second assumption as well since we are the ones that must seek God as we are the ones that lack the knowledge.
And the point I am trying to make with illustration is that without the existence of time space and matter God cannot have the three O's, without the three O's God is not perfect. If God is not perfect, he won't be God.

That's not true if nothing is there and if God still exists then of course the three O's still hold.

Omniscience: God will still have to know himself, so this still holds.

Omnipresence: God is still in some type of void or what we conceive of as Realm of Heaven so God is still everwhere.

Ominpotence: God will still have control over the aforementioned realms as well.

God will still be perfect in this sense it is just the universe that does not exist. Or the universe could be in some zero point state without any space and time dimensions. The question that nobody can answer is how did energy come to be in the first place?

As far as I've seen and I've started playing about 3-4 years ago, is that she posts in joke threads (because why not), she posts reveals during new League times (which is more or less a part of her job) and she more or less uses her ""connections"" in the company (as in, goes into the next room and asks the devs) to answer a few questions here or there.

None of those things are praise-worthy. They're quite literally basics of her job. GGG has ONE game to worry about and they're not a huge company so it's not like she has to catch a cab to ask the devs questions. It seems very simple to me.

Riot Games also has this with their League game. Go into their subreddit and they're incredibly communicative and have tons of posts and places where you can ask them questions and they're (usually) communicative about the changes they do, which GGG does NOT do whatsoever and I don't see anyone praising them for it, which is sad because GGG has very little player interaction overall other than their usual ""omg the players who give us money are awesome"" and Bex stating her PR bullshit around.",1583020946

"thewallstreet","t5_3jstw","So much can happen between now and the election, it's too early to tell imo. The most recent polls have Trump lose to almost all Democrat contenders.

The media are definitely against Sanders though after having underestimated him for months. Whether you like the guy or not, you have to agree the way the media asks him questions compared to someone like Klobuchar is comical. And I think if they keep that up in such an in your face way, it will actually help him.

My personal opinion is that if the DNC sends a milk toast candidate like Buttigieg/Biden against Trump, they still stand a decent chance to lose despite what polls suggest. If they want to win, they should (again, imo) pick a populist. And that means Sanders.

I also think the DNC will rip itself apart if they pull off some dodgy fuckery at the convention, which would also lead to a Trump win.

The one thing I'm most sure about is that Bloomberg would get destroyed by Trump in debates. Christ he was bad during his first 2 debates. His paid boo/cheer squad was beyond cringey.

Make sure the ram is dual channel (2x8 instead of 1x16) since that can give you 10-15% better performance. The laptop matters as much as the specs do. Especially things like build quality and cooling system. You wouldn't want a laptop with great specs but is made out of super cheap materials would you? Or one that can't even keep reasonable temperatures? So far in your price range the helios 300 (2019) or the lenovo y540 would be good choices.

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","But where is the line drawn? Is it at guy mutilating and raping babies? Is guy raping and mutilating young adults better or worse than that? Why? What about guy who sexually assaults and hurts young adults? That's not as intense, no? Still bad? What if it was babies again, sexual assault and hurting. What if it was just mutilation? Should we censor It? Birds of Prey? Joker? Tokyo Ghoul? It wasn't graphic in birds of prey how that guy cut off a person's face but... its still cutting of a person's face, that's mutilation. And we still saw blood! Bad! Ban it! 

What about stories from rape survivors? Should we censor Lolita. That book was terrible! The narrator was a pedophile! Okay. What about The Colour Purple? The narrator was the victim of pedophilia. Is that allowed? No? It's still got pedophilia. We should censor it. The Handsmaids Tale was less direct about it... but there was heavy themes of rape! Censor it! Its still rape! 

Did you hear about the nazis? This girl called Anne Frank wrote a whole diary about the horrible stuff they did! We have to draw the line. 

Look, here. It's so easy to say we need to draw the line. But we can't. Because the line is actually a slide and eventually the definition of ""pedophilia"" becomes any age gap, even if both parties are of consenting age. A fanfic writer expressing their personal experiences with child sexual abuse as a victim through fictional characters is going to be lumped into the same category of the authors writing rape to get off on it. They will both be censored. And that's not just me speculating. That's what happened on Live Journal with Strikethrough. Sexual assault survivors lost their support networks due to censorship. 

Its not a quick and easy ""draw the line"" kind of situation.",1583020950

The only time it puts AI into a match is to fill out the game. The AI is generally rather bad and easy to fight. As you're a lower rank were not too many people play the game fills up your matches with AI. As you research better, Higher Battle Rating (BR) aircraft you will be at a level were more people play and so the game won't need to put AI into the matches as there are enough players. 

People are, usually, a lot better than the AI and can use actual tactics and teamwork against you which makes things a lot harder along side the fact you're now fighting better aircraft. It's a learning curve is all, just play and learn and from mistakes and you'll notice yourself doing better. 

What I did is watch YouTube videos of good players playing the game modes I struggled with and copied their tactics and learnt how to use the team.

1. Have the devil trick the party into giving it an order that contradicts the contract. In this way, it can't fulfill Section C without breaking part of the contract, and it can't fulfill the the contract as a whole without breaking Section C. With this done, have it argue that, since the contract has become unfulfillable, it's now null and void. The easiest contradictory order to bait would probably be ""Ignore my previous order,"" which makes Section C break itself.
2. Once the devil is outside of the circle, it is no longer ""the devil contained within the basement circle."" Therefore, one could argue the contract no longer applies to it. Of course, if it made some other, verbal pledge as part of Section A, this probably won't work.
3. Have the devil somehow escape to a place where it can't receive ""instructions"" from the party. Maybe have it call in another devil, who dispatches it back to the Nine Hells (or whatever fiend plane your campaign uses).
4. Have the devil deliberately weaken itself in some way, rendering it *much* less effective in battle. Whatever it does should be something that neither it nor the party can easily reverse.

Finally, as others have suggested, you could have the devil go full [Jackass Genie](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie), interpreting every command in the worst way possible and exploiting every bit of freedom or semantics to screw over the party. Some examples:

* ""*I* didn't harm the mayor! The javelin I threw did!""
* ""You didn't say *not* to lead a horde of hungry ghouls to the camp while you were sleeping!""
* ""You want me to attack that dragon? Okay! Eat pebbles, lizard!""
* ""You said 'bring the corrupt nobleman to us,' not 'bring the corrupt nobleman to us *alive*.'""
* ""All right, I know you guys can't hear me right now, but I declare that today is opposite day! Any order you give me today, I'll interpret as the opposite!""

Of course, this is probably the most difficult option. You're setting yourself up for a constantly escalating semantics battle with the players, which could be fun, but could also grow frustrating for both sides.

Above all, whatever you decide, try to make it entertaining. Your players clearly want the devil servant, so overshadow the disappointment with a fun game session.",1583020954

""Dude was teaching soldiers useless skills"" Are talking about killing Titans when Paradis is fighting against the outside world? Are you kidding me? Or maybe you're blind? 
There's something I shouldn't have to explain to a snk reader but the thing is, titans are pretty *BIG* and kinda easily *RECOGNIZABLE*, and I'm pretty sure that Zeke used the wine and his scream to turn some people into *TITANS* mostly *INSIDE* the walls, and some of them are exactly where are situated Keith and the trainees. 
And you dare to say that what he's teaching is useless? Knowing how to kill titans is as important as knowing how to kill humans. 
During the first episodes, Keith was teaching the 104th how to fight against humans even tho they needed to get rid of the titans on Paradis more than anything else, and it turned out that this skill was kinda useful after all! Same goes with what was happening during the previous chapters!
What he was teaching wasn't useless at all!

Plus, Keith didn't defend himself from his trainees because otherwise, if they hadn't beaten him up, they would've been sent to jail, or worst. 
He protected them! 
When a 104th member (I don't remember who) asked him about his injuries, he didn't complained or denounced those kids, instead he told the 104th member to focus on the battle. 
He protected his kids once again! 
He also made a very powerful and useful speech to his trainees. 

I really can't see why you hate him that much.",1583020954
"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Right, it's one thing if I'm struggling but, yeah, I've had people sprint to grab something I dropped within reach, or hold open a door while I'm beyond the awkward distance away. It's, oddly, a lot more of the good-intentions-but-uncomfortable-results that gets me though, because--especially if it's something I actually don't need help with, (like picking up something next to my feet, say), I have to struggle with not appreciating the ""assistance"" (that makes me feel like an incompetent child), while also trying to be polite like they were because I *do* understand they're not being malicious or patronizing intentionally.

Besides that, I rarely go out without my SO or caretaker, both of whom keep an eye on me and know what I would need help with. It's an independence thing; sometimes I like to enjoy feeling like I can be left to my own devices. The 'helpful' stuff isn't something that cuts deep, it's just something I don't think a lot of people consider. Holding the door open for anyone is polite, of course, but I'm hesitant about it because there have been times I've had someone decide I'm not crossing the bump at the threshold fast enough so they *yank* me in--that's scary! How easy it is for a total stranger to decide to bodily move you--chair or no. Just reminds me how vulnerable I really am.

Also, the other reply is spot on. I've dealt with the people who I know are going to ride the high of ""aiding the helpless"" when they pick up the ketchup bottle I fumble, like, please--genuine helpfulness and self-serving helpfulness is separated by a thin line, but when you deal with as much of it as a disabled person, you can recognize it pretty fast.",1583020954

"battlefront","t5_2t6xr","Lmao who said it should he equal to co op, the easiest gamemode on the planet? I think they should gove gains akin to galactic assault. And no, that doesnt make the gamemode ""very powerful"" lmfao because it would still take you the same amount of time to level on galactic assault. It wouldnt be anymore powerful than literally any other gamemode. Yeah, you would get more xp per kill, but you realize you can only get a maximum of like 6 kills in a single match, right? And you can only get a maximum of 2 kills with a single character if you win the round. Of course draws exist but those are rare and only happen when the teams have the same number of people alive. Also I aint inexperienced bruh. Been playing since the first battlefront released in 2004, and have played tons of battlefield all the way up until the new Battlefront's release, and now this new battlefront 2. I could whoop you in hero showdown thats for sure lmao. 

I didnt make the mistake of thinking it would give me xp either. It literally shows you the xp gains after each match. I knew it was a problem and i didnt think to speak about it until now, after playing co op again and realizing just how quickly you can level up. Levelling up heroes in galactic assault/supremacy also isnt that much harder since you can get way more kills and go on massive kill streaks with relative ease. Kill streaks arent a thing in hero showdown, and your opportunity is usually a 0-6 kill window. If youre skilled and are winning your rounds, you really only have a maximum of 6 kills. If you do what most people do and choose 1v1s, and your teammate is also good, then you get a maximum of 3 kills. This is after 3 five minute rounds. 

Just because YOU play other gamemodes and find it fun, people like me who've been playing battlefront since 2004, probably wont find them as fun as other people do. Hero showdown is something Star Wars games have never had before, and we havent had similar multiplayer play since 2005 with the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith video game, where you could 1v1 people in arena like locations with real lightsaber to lightsaber combat. That is why I and many others almost entirely play this gamemode and it would be nice if we could at least level up our heroes to level 25 after 100 hours of gameplay. Im not asking for myself, either, im asking for the community and because this gamemode deserves to be fixed. Most of my mains are already level 25 or above, but theres tons of people with no star cards or really weak ones just bc they cant level up their stuff while only playing what they like to play. Why force people to play something that bores them and requires some amount of luck, when they can play something that they like?",1583020955
"TheRightCantMeme","t5_3p1as","I went ahead and re-read your first comment - *real* fucking slow. 

You claim that the only group of people with a comparable suicide rate to trans people of today is Jewish people under Nazi Germany.

Then you somehow jump to the conclusion that this somehow *proves* that being trans is a mental illness.

So, the person who replied asked if you were implying that Jewish people are mentally ill, which is the only reasonable connection I could see you’re trying to make with the original argument.

To me, *IF* your claim is even true, then the only connection I could make from that is that people who are under immense negativity, hatred, mistreatment, and misunderstanding from an oppressive society that deems them “less than” have a similar rate of suicide among them. Which, to me, makes perfect sense.

I just don’t see where “They are ending their own lives at a rate comparable to Jewish people in Nazi Germany” even comes close to implying that they are mentally ill, unless you’re also making the point that Jewish people in Nazi Germany were also mentally ill.",1583020955

R4= Nami wins via Zeus,  Sakura EOS scales to Town Level+ via Hundred seals

R5= Shikamaru takes it, Ussop is mostly range fighter

R6= Chopper takes it via Monster Point, Kiba is not very powerful at best Building to Large building level via Jutsu, with his 3 Headed is 3x stronger than he was against Sound 4.

R7=  Robin takes it via DF, Hinata is not a fighter

R8=  Gai wins via 7th Gate

R9=  Jinbe takes it, massively higher Physicals, defense and control of water, has no charkra so Samehada advantage is pretty much nulled

R10:  Law takes it

R12:  Doflamingo takes it via higher physicals, defense, speed, range and overall power,  he pretty much nulls all of Nagato/pains jutsu, there is nothing pain can do here, even CT would be useless and he be dead long before he even uses it

R13: Katakuri wins, Physically stronger than G4 luffy does there is not much Itachi can do, even his armored susanoo would be broken, his totsuka blade is semi nulled via Future sight so 99% of fights Katakuri wins, Itachi stamina is also too low and without susanoo itachi is too weak.

R14: Crocodile wins, stronger physicals and stronger Sand control also immune to sand.

R15: Hancock takes it, her punches and kicks are lethal while Tsunade punches are normal, Regeneration is not gonna help her from Petrification

R16: Raleigh Stomps,  there is nothing Jiraiya can do even with Sage mode

R17: Kizaru stomps, base Minato is weak, his stronger jutsu is Rasengan which is weaker than even Pacifista attacks, Kizaru also intangiblity in light form making all of his attack pretty much useless even KCM minato would lose.

R18:  Whitebeard has a higher chance of winning because Hashirama stats are so trash that any single strike from whitebeard would kill him, hashirama also has no protective type jutsu like susanoo which can protect him from any angle,  Hashirama has high attack/Jutsu but 0 defense, his Wood Kanon 1000 arms would be crush along with hashirama as well.

R19: hard one really,   Raikage cant injure nor kill Enel but all of Enels attack would only contribute Small damage this however can become huge after hours or days of fighting so overall Enel would win, Raigo one shots.

R20: could go either way, unlike Hashirama Madara posses Susanoo which is Offensive and defensie Jutsu

R21:  could go either way

R22: Basil hawkings stomps,  Sasori is too weak and his stats are terrible and much weaker than even Arlong

R23: Deidara takes it via C4 or C3

R24:  Rob Lucci take sit,  Killer bee is not very powerful his fighting style is just very effective against ninjas because ninjas have low stats,  Rob Lucci is far superiir physically and in terms of techniques.

R25:  Magellan takes it

R26:  Kuma stomps,  Choji via Butterfly+Giant form only scales to MCB/Town level via Boruto feat

R27:  Valentine takes it, INo is useless, her attack power is Wall level+,  her spiritual attacks might be useful.

Tolkien planned on writing a sequel with Aragorn's son ruling, and underground Melkor/Morgoth cults rising up, despite Sauron's defeat.  

He ultimately decided against it, because it would turn into an endless pattern of good defeating evil defeating good defeating evil defeating good defeating evil...

Socialism is defined as the proletariat owning the means of production and is an economic system, examples of such countries today and throughout history were the PRC, USSR, Cuba, DPRK and Venezuela. The Nordic model is not socialist and the means of production are owned by the bourgeoisie, Bernie calls this socialist but it is not and socialism is not ""when the government does stuff"".

Social democracy is capitalism but with more than typical welfare, it is still a bourgeoisie ownership of the means of production and can't be socialist, it is in a way closer to fascism as it delays the development of class consciousnesses and diverts the focus to other problems and is just like fascism, an obstacle towards building true socialism, the main difference being that social democracy is progressive while fascism is reactionary. 

Bernie is an imperialist and supports sanctions against actually socialist countries, advocating for a continued existence of Israel is not ""openly critical"".

I would be really surprised if she ever comes close to using 16 gigs in solidworks. The graphics card is really hard to suggest over the internet because theres a point where it goes from pointless to critical to have a quadro.

Maybe if you're a bjj guy as well, you can give me some info on that.
My worst move is the kimura, and my best move is the darce, i personally would not be interested in looking for a kimura instructional. I would be much more interested in a darce instructional, because it is much easier to optimize something instead of learning something from the ground up.

In your copy you pretend they are very bad at the guillotine, so if i already have a good guillotine and i'm looking to optimize it, the beginning part of your copy (wich is the most important part) would not resonate with me and might even turn me a little of.

My point is, that i THINK people are more inclined to buy instructionals on moves they are naturally good at. 
And if they are not naturally good at let's say a guillotine, they would not even look for an instructional on it.

 I might be wrong, what do you think

"FanTheories","t5_2u6rc","Avoiding one of my favorite spoilers for the series. You’ll see who, what, and why. Oh, and I don’t mean the name of the Tardis.

Eh, the flaw in this is when SHE flies it perfectly fine and basically without much effort.

Counter theory: Tardis homes in on events without a fixed timeline. In the doctors attempt to aim for somewhere, they are effectively hitting a moving target. The Tardis is able to get to those Timey-Whimey points but the doctor likes having fun with the core in the same way they like having fun with the assistances.

It could also be that the Tardis actively knows where the Doctor wants to go via psychic link but the doctors actions on the console actively interfere with it. The key to this would be the Doctor not realizing it works that way. SHE would  know about that and compensate for it as SHE has a much stronger connection to the Tardis (due to HER “foundational environment”)

The simplest answer is: the Tardis messes with the Doctor for the Doctor stealing it. As if the guilt of the doctor pushes Sexy to help him find the points but the doctor won’t get what they want for stealing. In Doctor terms: it’s a “morality circuit”, Sexy acts like a forced conscience.",1583020958

So around a 0.00001 chance that any single person they encounter has the disease. Lets multiply that by 100x as a worst case scenario for circulating undiagnosed/mild cases: 0.001%. And for a decent chance at getting infected you need to be in close proximity to the person or spend time in their presence (eg an embrace, sharing a meal).

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/sentientparsley! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;/r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Stacking commanders does become a problem and is seen more at this scale. 4v4 players are the most likely to leave a game after a play goes poorly and the most likely to execute a poor play. This makes 4v4 an awful learning environment, and further entrenches 4v4 players into being bad players. Cheers.",1583020960

Some guys will expect you to use another form of contraceptive, but if they demanded it they would be completely in the wrong.

As the water rises, the preacher climbs to the roof and starts praying. ""Lord, save me so I can continue on my mission of preaching your gospel."" Just then, a coast guard rescue party floats by in a rowboat. ""Let's go mister. Into the boat."" ""I'll stay here,"" says the preacher, ""The Lord will save me."" An hour later a second boat reaches the scene and the water is close to the roof of the hotel. 
""Sir, you better get in. the water is still rising."" ""No thanks. The Lord will be my salvation."" Toward evening, the hotel is almost completely under water and the preacher is clinging to the satellite dish on the roof. A helicopter is spotted and on a loudspeaker is heard ""Sir, grab on to the line and we will pull you up. This is your last chance!” 
""I'm all right,"" says the preacher, as he looks heavenward. ""I know the Lord will provide sanctuary."" As the boat departs, the satellite dish is hit by lightning and the preacher is killed. When he arrived at the Pearly Gates he was furious. ""What happened, "" he shouts. ""I thought the Lord would provide"" Moments later a thunderous voice is heard. “Sometimes the lord does not work in mysterious ways, sometimes those ways are obvious and only a blind believer cannot see what is before them.”",1583020962

1. Yoshi for sure. Mostly because of his design, I think he's the coolest looking character. And because anytime I play a Nintendo game (Mario Party, Mario Kart, Smash) I pick Yoshi everytime, without hesitation. 

2. The entire soundtrack of Parappa the Rapper. I just have such fond memories of that game because it's one of the first games I remember playing, and I love it and still to this day love it. 

3. Cyberpunk 2077. I've been waiting for awhile for this game and I hope it lives up to all the hype. I also love the Witcher 3 and have faith that CDPR will do amazing with this game as well. 

4. The Pokemon Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan are based off of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan!

5. I love video games and am also in the process of getting everything together to start my own podcast about the PS4. I will cover news, games I'm playing and my opinions of them, and run down some of the best deals you can get on games and accessories that week!

It's gone. If you sell, it's gone for good.

... is this supposed to be bad? Lol. For the sake of a better overall health for the game, why is it a problem if some people can’t parry? And lowered damage is **good**.

On the live game, why would you throw a 500ms light that does 15 damage [on average], is easily parried and you eat 30-40+ damage because of it? (Literal double the damage). It’s so skewed is no surprise the turtle meta existed for so long. Around 20 damage for a light parry is an ideal start since light parrying isn’t exactly the most skillful thing you can do in this game.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","How is a citation needed, it's basic common sense. Pick any country on earth, go there, start making out with the same sex in the middle of the road. Most people passing by will be weirded out. In many countries you'll be put in fucking jail (think of the middle-east). 

No matter if you think it's wrong or not, it's not normal and that's a fact. This is not just me, like I said, most people would be disgusted at acts like that. Go ahead and do it in your own home, for the reason that we cannot see it and thus won't be grossed out by it.

&gt;Also this sentence doesn't make any fucking sense. We speak English here. Try to actually learn it.

It's pretty sad if you cannot understand a simple sentence. People are weirded out by same-sex couples because they flaunt it, because people see it going on. You don't see that same thing if people decide to not have kids, it's just 2 normal adults, whereas looking at two fairies walking down the street making out and holding hands, it's in peoples' faces and they don't like it.",1583020966

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Difficult clients?!?
This is a really long story so to sum it up, how do you guys deal with difficult clients. ?  I have a booking policy which requires a $25 deposit, which isn’t much. This one particular client has been a nightmare with booking etc. (She first contacted me of October last year to book for a family shoot and then before we even did the shoot she contacted me again to book a valentine’s shoot which was a special) (we have already done the family shoot now in January and she loved the photos) she rescheduled the family shoot and now shes always wanting to reschedule the valentine’s, which is fine. But when I try to get her to choose a new date she doesn’t have any idea. Three weeks went by with zero contact from her, she didn’t reply to any of my messages. And then finally she replied saying she couldn’t reschedule for February (it’s literally the last day in February). She had booked a valentine’s special that was only valid for February (which she knew). So since she couldn’t book for February I told her I’d honour her deposit that was no problem but I would need her to book by August. And well she got mad and said “I'm not back till Sunday and your the first person I have ever met that will put a expiration date . Very first.  My brother does photos and my cousin has her own studio, I know ALOT of people even on a group so your the first . I will let you know but as of right now Feb isnt going to work . I have been dealing with some personal medical things that have been out of my control but it is what it is . Have a good day”

So then I said 
“I understand, and I’m very sorry you’re dealing with some medical issues. I don’t put expiration dates on deposits, however for this particular session, due to the lack of communication I thought it would be best for your sake to book something by August to make sure you still got your shoot. The shoot doesn’t necessarily need to be before August, just thinking you should have it BOOKED by August(so that gives you 6 months to pick a new date☺️) I am relocating next year, and I am getting married this fall. I didn’t want you to pay your deposit and then possibly lose out on being able to rebook your shoot for when you want it (for lack of availability and for me possibly not being here anymore). Every photographer(as with any business) has their own policies and procedures. I hope that’s clarified 😊”

"Career_Advice","t5_2v78q","What type of work do you want to do?  And do you like accounting?  Some people really don't like accounting.   If you don't know you could take an online course on accounting or take an intro course at a Community College to see if you like it.  

If you want to work in corporations as an accountant or a financial analyst and eventually be on the path to a Corporate Controller or CFO role you could do both paths with an MPA.  You also could have an MSF too but it's not the same path and not as versatile.  If you want to get ""hired instantly"" learning accounting is like learning a trade.  You can be hired immediately to do useful work.  You can do work instantly.  Also, with an accounting background, you can always start your own accounting business or consult in retirement, etc.

In my opinion (I am biased as a CPA and Corporate Controller), if you want to work in corporations with the CFO path I would choose the MPA path.  You would be more versatile being able to do accounting and financial analysis type work. You could be able to a controller role leading to CFO as well.  

Accounting is the foundation of how businesses work so it is very useful for understanding everything.  Then add financial analysis skills on top.  It is easy for accountants to learn financial analysis vs. the other way around.  

If you are into accounting a great career path is to get your MPA, go work for an audit firm (top 4 like PwC or EY) for 3 years or so, then go work in a corporation and work your way up.  The big 4 accounting is a great foundation, teaches you to lead and manage teams, deal with stress, manage priorities and time, and you get a lot of responsibility early vs. other people that go straight into a company's accounting team.

Alternatively, if you want to work for a hedge fund, a VC, or investment banker than the MSF would better to have than an accounting degree for those jobs.",1583020968

The info that they are a part of your husbands past with your ex seems to carry some sore feelings, and you say you don't take much time caring for them, yet your mental state is compromised very heavily from their presence in your home. 

It's obviously not a good situation, a therapist could help you manage your emotions around the animals in the time being, while simultaneously helping you build a roadmap to get the dogs out of your life. 

Your husband doesn't sound very sympathetic either, considering so much of your post history revolves around these dogs. Having someone in your corner to support you in real time is extremely valuable.",1583020968

&gt; NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles ""Outro"" and ""Green Lights"", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, whch dropped later that October.

"awardtravel","t5_35rd5","DP for those traveling to SE Asia. Original itinerary was IAD-NRT NRT-HKG  KWL-XIY PEK-HND HND-ORD, travel March 6-27. Flights from Japan were booked with United miles in Y, using excursionist perk, US to Japan was booked VS F.  

TLDR: United has been very accommodating changing flights without fees, even on partners. Marriott has also been equally accommodating. 


We have changed three times with United, once for mainland China when State Dept raised it to level 4. We removed mainland flights, kept NRT-HKG, added BKK-ICN-NRT first time. 

The second time was when S.Korea was raised to a level 3, we called United to see if we could change again and remove the ICN connection (BKK-ICN-NRT was the only thing available on the first change) as there were direct BKK-NRT flights now, no issues.  

The third time was 10 minutes later when we realized we booked the wrong flight due to the time change to 12:30am, which left us without a hotel, no issue changing again with no fees for the third time. 

In terms of hotels, even non refundable bookings with Marriott weren’t an issue canceling (we’re Platinum, most were points). The only issue we had was trying to cancel  a non refundable hotel, the Langham in HK, booked though Chase portal. They contacted the hotel and the only thing they would have done is change the dates, so we decided to just keep the booking and go. 

Heading out next week for the above mentioned locations, will be happy to address any concerns first hand of the areas.",1583020969

Take a hard look at your finances and make sure you’re prepared for a cut in your income. Are you financially prepared to be out of work for two weeks or more if you get sick? Cut your spending back until you can answer this question with a definite YES. 

If consumer spend contracts hard, we’re going to see a lot of lay offs and businesses closing. If your health isn’t an immediate concern, focus on your personal resources. Look ahead 3-6 months and remember that cash will be king. If possible, buy the dip!",1583020969

It was about the time of Moses and the time humans made first contact with Ra and the time the Egyptians briefly adopted monotheistic religion under Akhenaten. 

His son was King Tut who I personally knew, loved and admired. I was high born and I believe I suffered a terrible fate after my husband passed away (buried alive?). I have come back to my Egypt afterwards, as remembered by my mother but not me. I was well learned and read a lot according to her and this trait is still here with me thousands of years later. My mother bought me shelves worth of books when I was a child although we were dirt poor.

It’s madness to think of thousands of years of incarnations. And yet here we are.

Today I live a five minute walk from the Rudolph Steiner school in Manhattan. And the closest thing I have to a priest is an Egyptian man who works at the bodega on the corner.

Life is supposed to be hard and unfair, and no amount of bragging and thrashing will ever change that. The best thing we can do is to economically develop the world in order to allow people in poorer countries to live ecologically.

"WarhammerCompetitive","t5_3mrre","So the way you are describing it they do stack since two units could get points for different secondarys on the same target. Gangbusters and the reaper explicitly state that once a target unit has wounds counted towards them that same target unit cannot count for any other secondary. My understanding of stacking is that no one target can count for two different secondarys, but your description has a way to do so.

Most people seem to be saying that BGH works just like the reaper and gangbusters, which is how I hope it works. But I see the argument that you are trying to make too. It's just not clear.

Edit: I guess my question is does BGH work exactly like the reaper and gangbusters so a single unit can only ever count for one secondary no matter how it was killed? or does it allow for a single unit to be used for multiple secondarys as long as the killing units doesn't count the final wounds for BGH?",1583020973

Second, what is the purpose of telling his parents? It sounds like you expect them to be disappointed and that it would create division.

On the other hand, if for some reason you're directly asked about it then I think an honest answer is appropriate.

Okay so I was like 12 years old. I was staying at my Grandpa's place for like a few weeks during the summer with my mother and siblings, My Grandpa and Grandma were recently divorced so my Mom + Siblings were visiting my Grandma, and my Grandpa was at work, so I was home alone being I had overslept the night before. So it was a normal day, and before this I had not believed in anything paranormal. So I was in the kitchen heating up frozen Pancakes from my Mom from earlier in the morning, and I heard a sound in the garage (My Grandpa is a mechanic so I had assumed he was at the house) I didn't let it bother me and I continued to wait for my food, then I heard things fall, repeatedly the same sound over and over again,  as if things in the Garage were falling over (he has a giant tool box and stuff) so I got scared, I looked outside and his car wasn't there. The door to the garage was locked as well. The sound didn't stop happening, and came out of nowhere. I grabbed a knife assuming there was an intruder, I then ran in the farthest room to the back (it's a 1 story house so all the rooms are in a long hallway). After waiting a while, I ran outside and called my mom (there wasn't good phone reception in the back rooms). My mom told me there was nothing to worry about and that she was about to come back. Eventually after waiting a while, scared to death, my mom and my Aunt came back.   


Since it was their childhood house, they have lived in it for pretty much their entire lives, so she explained to me that in the past they have all experienced weird paranormal activities in the house, the superstition was that someone  before they lived in it had killed themselves in it (this actually happened)  and he's the one that haunts the house. Things only happened in it when people were home alone, or alone in their rooms.   


What might have caused it I do not know, but it was an interesting experience that pretty much forced me to believe in the paranormal.",1583020974

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","The difference for Bernie is that he produced something that millions of people wanted. What was produced conceptually was all of his own work. The production and shipment of physical copies is kind of incidental to that. Unlike most millionaires, Bernie actually produced something and it's not something that can be reproduced by others without him. That's intellectual property. 

So yes, the workers should own the value of their production, but... Most of the value in every copy of a book sold belongs to the author who wrote the original manuscript. Which as someone who writes with the hopes of becoming a novelist, I can tell you it's a hard and time consuming task to write a book.

So while the people who all help to produce copies of Bernie's book should be paid fairly for their work. They also don't deserve a share equal to what is paid to Bernie. Since without Bernie's work, there wouldn't be any value there at all. The core concepts, ideas, and writings are Bernie's. So people paying for his book are first and foremost paying for his words. It's one of the few cases where one person getting the majority of the value of a work is justified.",1583020975

In my experience it is REALLY okay to just split and leave the other person to grieve on their own for a while, even if it may feel disrespectful at the time. And I can't overstate the importance of having backup - I've had people do it for me when exiting messy relatioships, and I've done it for others.

You realize that this is just you conceding to the corruption of the healthcare industry right? You're conceding that the corrupt roots of big pharma has absolutely ripped apart any semblance of effectiveness in our government, because we have an administration that appoints lobbyists whos main goals are the destruction of the very agencies they were appointed to. The problem isn't government the problem is the very economic system that is incentivized to keep corrupting our government. And the solution isn't to *give up* and just let the greedy corporations do what they want, there isn't a single example of a successful solely market based healthcare system in the world today. Because we know that healthcare companies as well as big pharma are operating with the mentality to maximize profits. You bemoan the insulin costs, you bemoan the price of healthcare without recognizing that its the corporations that are the ones jacking up the prices on these vital life saving drugs/plans. private charities won't fix this, they lack the scale and funding, what we need is a system that keeps these privatized autocracies we call ""corporations"" to be kept in check, not to expand their power.",1583020976

You go on mic and try to help the team with your Main or Off-Tank, and they don't listen or care. The biggest thing I always see with Gold/Plat is way too much stupid dying. Overextending, not following tanks, going off doing your own thing as if you're too smart and a badass.

Diamond has that, but much less. I've always said I have to work harder and concentrate more on a stupid Gold/Plat game to compensate for the stupid play, and my reward is still a streak of losses and being unable to climb out of this hole. Also, I think the game never got past that annoying bug where it just gives you a generic 2200-2300SR rating. Samito (one of the top players in the world) even got a Gold SR rating for his DPS. I think the bug was introduced with the patch that separated the SR into three categories.

Those with older accounts won't have to worry, since it will go by your previous SR and if you are are high up, it will generally stay high up in the next season. But those making brand-spanking new accounts, be ready to be placed into Gold/Plat even if you are really a GM/Masters.",1583020976

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","I would avoid it if at all possible. lol. Cable installers would typically run the line into your basement and then just pop the line up through your floor.  

If that's not a possibility for you and you need an outlet in a lathe and plaster wall...

1) Use the junction box as a template and mark the cutout. 

2) Use a utility knife to remove all the plaster inside the cutout

3) Use a fine-toothed keyhole or compass saw (*not* a drywall/jab saw) to cut the lathe. An oscillating tool works for this too, but I still prefer to do it by hand so as not to damage the plaster. 

Keep in mind you'll also have to install an F-Connector on your coax once you've run the line.  I have a video here on how to do that:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P6uxHWZurQ&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P6uxHWZurQ&amp;t=3s) 

If you make a mistake in your installation, it's no big deal, you can just make repairs with joint compound like you would on drywall.",1583020976

Suits are a cultural indication that you have a job. And not just any job, but a job that pays well. If you wear a suit to work, it means you make important decisions, or at least that your image matters. That means you’re on top of a dominance hierarchy.

People are attracted to people that are high in a hierarchy: be it money, physical strength/athleticism/power/authority. A suit is a sign of more than one of those.

&gt;Anyway what you're describing as a virtue, it isn't honesty, it's a actually a lack of shame

I never claimed they were honest, and they're definitely not virtuous.

"chihayafuru","t5_2zo72","I’d say entirely possible. Remember it’s not everyone in the karuta world, but for people like Chihaya, she was attracted to karuta because she intuitively knew she could excel in it - iirc her very first card starts with “fu”, which in Japanese can sound closer to “hu” and is an extremely quiet sound. On the other hand, it completely escaped the extremely talented Arata, despite having known the tapes they were using through and through. 

I once did a hearing test and had a friend who could hear about 2 frequency bands higher than I could, while I could hear about 4 higher than all the rest of the group, so I totally believe it. There are also matters of intonation, which I believe Rion had brought up, and which are an important part of Japanese as it is. Despite the poems being read with a certain intonation, it could be the “spoken” intonation could make its way in to a degree, as well as mouth positions certainly not being identical going from one same vowel to a variety of consonants.",1583020977

I swear, this has nothing to do with me subbed to r/titanfall, I just liked the lore behind it. Usually there is none for those types of games, so for Titanfall to have a more deep look at how Titans were just farming robots turned to designs for warfare became pretty interesting.

Luckily, this profoundly anti-democratic Bill failed on second reading.** At the time, then Ontario NDP deputy leader Jagmeet Singh [spoke passionately against the Bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DZGvFlNNTU) in the interests of having a free and open societal debate on Israel-Palestine. It is profoundly troubling that the NDP has strayed so far from this position that one of its most prominent members took not so long ago.

IJV Canada wishes to thank all of our supporters, over one thousand of whom sent in emails to members of Ontario’s Parliament to oppose Bill 168. In addition, we thank the many organizations that supported us in our fight, such as the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, the Canadian Federation of Students, the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, the Canadian Friends Service Committee, and the BC Civil Liberties Association. Moreover, a group of over 350 Canadian academics launched an open letter yesterday (see letter below) declaring their opposition to the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism.

While yesterday’s vote at Queen’s Park was extremely disappointing, **IJV Canada remains committed to the fight against Bill 168, and against the IHRA antisemitism definition more broadly. We believe that it is crucial to fight antisemitism and white supremacy, while at the same time protecting freedom of expression and standing up for Palestinian human rights.**

In terms of the next steps, IJV Canada intends to weigh in on Bill 168 during the period of public input, and we will keep our members posted as to the next action steps.",1583020978

I think it's a really good thing to help people with the first step, because the moment someone honestly asks themselves  ""Am I transgender?"" is a major turning point in life. After it's asked they will pay much more attention to things they do and think and won't let the denial stuff casually go without notice.

I don't think there is like a subtle and effective way to do it. I'd say that if you feel somebody is acting like a transgender in denial, you can just tell them that. It's only important to follow it up with explanations and answering their initial excuses and then once you planted the idea - to let them take a break. So:

1. Suggest they might be trans (try not to offend them) and give a quick explanation as to why you think so,
2. Answer their doubts/excuses and explain a few initial questions,
3. Let them handle the conversation and respect when they stop going deeper into the topic, try to avoid ""saying just one more thing"",
4. Preferably during the conversation give them an idea of where to look for resources.

Alternatively I would think of ""Do you ever want to be a woman/man?"" or ""Do you think you would be happier as woman/man?"" as it's a question they might answer Yes to, but not connect dots that it is a trans thing to think, then you go into the previously explained suggesting.

Just don't ever say it around other people, it has to be a conversation between just a two, to avoid social opinion going against it's purpose.

Hey, **if somebody told me sooner, I would be grateful**. That's also a thing I hear from others, that they wish someone told them sooner.

Of course the actual realization is up to them and they should do it at their own pace, but helping them start a journey is fine. Creating a first crack in their egg is fine, pressuring them to come out to themselves (because you think you know them better) is not cool. That's why after letting the idea sink in, you leave them alone and don't dwell deeper into the topic.

Worst case scenerio is when someone is in denial and has turned into a transphobe. It happens that we repress our feelings so much that we literally start hating others for having them, then it would be really hard to suggest anything without triggering a defense mechanism of hostility, blocking your opinions and also a feeling of harm (as the person is yet again forced to hate themselves).",1583020979

Of course I won't express that dislike around kids, because it can be pretty damaging to a child, I should know since I used to be a child, but my point still stands. I'm allowed to dislike kids, that doesn't exclude past child me. I was a thunder cunt. 

It's like pugs. I don't like pugs, like, at all, but I'll still treat them with the respect any dog deserves because I have human decency, I just wouldn't want to spend a lot of time around pugs.

I can't just start liking children, it's not my choice. I'm awkward around them, I'm a major germophobe and and I have a difficult time dealing with loud noises. It's like forcing myself to like coffee, no way am I gonna suddenly stop avoiding that terrible, bitter taste.",1583020980

Hope I’m not telling you how to suck eggs here BTW.

ADC / DAC is essential for any digital processing to be employed. If there is none then it’s an analog signal path, even if there is some complex analog filtering in between.

Again, the middle bit of his answer appears to be a very cautious response. My guess it’s because the two ICs are opaque to the person answering the question. I really can’t see any logical likelihood for those chips to have tiny ADC/DSP/DAC function’s imbedded in them. What a horrible mess of the final audio that would make.

"undelete","t5_2xv4u","Well, they’re supposed to be surrogates for the people. The only way to do what you’re proposing is to have a national ranked choice primary ballot... but that’s just not how we do it.

The way I look at it is this—

In a case where the super delegates pick the least likely candidate, they’re not doing their job, and that’s a problem. But if they pick candidates that collectively garner the support of 51% of the party then every democrat should show up for that candidate—because that’s party politics. 

And this argument about “well xyz supporters *would* show up for Bernie, so we should get to count them” is kind of BS. There are a lot of Democrats, not just two. So saying “well if there were only two, Bernie would win” is a complete red herring. There’s nothing that says there has to be, or is even supposed to, be two. But Bernie decided to run as a Democrat and under the auspices of the Democratic establishment. 

Why?

Because Bernie needs the Democratic Party to win. He’s not an establishment Democrat. So, big surprise, the Democratic establishment is not on board. If he gets the nom by the regular rules, nobody is going to take it from him. He agreed to share the field, which literally means to find out if a majority of Democrats support him — so the complaint that there should just be fewer candidates running against him so we can find out what his “real” support is, is just not valid.

And he didn’t run as an independent because he can’t win as an independent; he’ll split the vote. So if you want to join the party (literally and figuratively) because you *do* need the party establishment, then you have to give establishment voters something they want. You need those Biden people.

You want them to fall in line behind Bernie, but aren’t saying that you’ll fall in line behind other candidates...

Bernie can’t get elected without some Biden/Pete/establishment/whomever people. It’s mathematically impossible (I.e. he doesn’t have the support of half the party on his own). And yet the Bernie people want to give nothing to the Democratic establishment.

They need the establishment, but they refuse to offer anything in the way of concessions, and if they don’t get their way, they’re taking their ball and going home. The Democratic Party is a giant beauracratic entity. With elites. And you can’t just say “Vote for me. And also fuck you.” That’s not how *party* politics works. Independent politics, maybe... but we’ve covered why that doesn’t work mathematically in a general election.

That’s my soap box. Haha
It just really bothers me that collectively more than half the party wants one thing, and Bernie’s hardcore supporters just want to take their ball and go home. Like... what about having a broad desire to see good things happen even if it’s not *exactly* perfect.",1583020983

&gt; # [El Gobierno subirá el IVA de tabaco y apuestas y bajará el de compresas y veterinarios](https://www.lne.es/elementosWeb/mediaweb/images1010/cabecera/logoRedesSociales.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; El diputado de Unidas Podemos **Txema Guijarro** ha avanzado que entre las medidas de la **reforma fiscal** consensuada entre el PSOE y Unidas Podemos se incluirá **el aumento del IVA al tabaco** y a las **casas de apuestas**, y una bajada para los productos de **higiene femenina** y los **servicios veterinarios**.
&gt; 
&gt; Así lo ha asegurado Guijarro durante su intervención en el debate en el Pleno del Congreso sobre el acuerdo del Gobierno relativo a la [**nueva senda de estabilidad presupuestaria**](https://www.lne.es/espana/2020/02/27/erc-estudia-avalar-aprobacion-techo/2604709.html) y el límite de gasto no financiero ('techo de gasto'), preludio de los Presupuestos Generales del Estado (PGE) de 2020.
&gt; 
&gt; Guijarro ha destacado que las medidas económicas pactadas entre el PSOE y Unidas Podemos para la reforma fiscal, que ha empezado a implementar el Gobierno, ""**retoman el camino de la justicia fiscal**, el sendero que este país se había perdido hace un tiempo y que comienza nuevamente"".
&gt; 
&gt; En este sentido, ha explicado que, en materia de imposición directa, la reforma fiscal incluirá una subida del último tramo del IRPF y **se armonizará Sociedades**, reduciéndose el tipo aplicado a las pymes.
&gt; 
&gt; No obstante, ha desvelado que las mayores modificaciones en materia tributaria tendrán lugar en imposición indirecta, de forma que en el IVA ""se subirá para determinados productos y servicios"", como el tabaco y las casas de apuestas, mientras que bajará para los **productos de higiene femenina y los servicios veterinarios.**
&gt; 
&gt; Previsiblemente el IVA de productos femeninos **bajará del 10% al 4%** y el veterinario del 21% al 10%. En todo caso, las variaciones del IVA sobre el tabaco no figuran dentro del acuerdo presentado por PSOE y Unidas Podemos para la formación del Gobierno de coalición y la investidura de Pedro Sánchez.
&gt; 
&gt; También ha recordado que estas medidas van acompañadas de la creación de nuevos impuestos a determinados servicios digitales (['Tasa Google](https://www.lne.es/economia/2020/02/18/tasa-google-afectara-10-claves/2600588.html)') y a las transacciones financieras ('Tasa Tobin').",1583020984

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","&gt; prices would be much higher

As I said in my other post, the flea market, in my opinion, SHOULD be paying premium for convenience instead of having to loot the items for yourself. The price should dictate the demand, if you don't like the price that someone else went in raid and found something for, then look for it yourself, or use the hideout crafting recipes, which the vast majority of hideout upgrade components can be obtained this way. 

For what is considered an optional part of Tarkov, the vast majority of people heavily rely on the flea market. The core gameplay loop of Tarkov should primarily be obtaining such items yourself. If doing this helps mitigate a lot of the issues with the market I would be for it.

&gt; quests/hideout upgrades would be even more painful

They should be painful, upgrading your hideout, for what is essentially the center of your PMC's Tarkov survival, shouldn't be upgradeable so easily, at the higher tier hideout modules at least. As above, rely on the hideout for crafting for things you might need outside of looting in-raid.

&gt; One of the streamers on the last dev podcast mentioned this idea and everyone on reddit shot it down.

From what I've seen it's been pretty much 50/50. Some new players can see the value of the Flea Market but some players who have been playing longer can see how much it can be abused and fucks up the economy and progression of the game.",1583020984
"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","I have one thing to say: you do **not** need sleep paralysis to perform WILD. How you ask? Literally do the WILD process but skip the part about needing SP. 

These two sources might be of help. One is a video of a great lucid dream you tuber and the other is an article that goes into a deep explanation of what the WILD process is like. 

[WILD Video Tutorial](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G87_OGrP1wE) 

[WILD Article](https://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/wake-induced-lucid-dreams.html) 

Please though, do more research yourself and check out other WILD tutorials. You’ll quickly find that everyone has their own way of experiencing WILD, and so will you. Pick one tutorial to follow that you like and follow it the best you can, but don’t stick with it forever if it doesn’t work.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Lots to break down here - to be fair and because my formatting history is terrible I am going to respond to each point in a small paragraph.

You take 2 steps; I talk you down to 1 because I see my benefit in not getting into a conflict with you. You demand 2 more steps - I tell you know because we have already negotiated your advancement from 2 to 1 - if I give you even one more step then a compromise has never taken place. That would be someone acting in bad faith - while that is totally possible to be the case here with Funi; I am willing to give them a chance - changing ass to hips is a lot less then what sewage we were treated to in prison school and dragon maid. It looks more like a reduction in bad behavior; and hopefully a trend that would continue and I think demanding surrender will just result in doubling down.

As to compromise - the compromise in this case is they kept the subject and joke; but they filtered down the language from ass/butt to hip. I understand why folks more familiar with the subject matter would be displeased; but it seems not as bad as past things Funimation has done; I mean if we want Funimation to try and get back into the anime fandom good graces any progress is progress none the less and outright capitulation is generally want the more extreme folks expect in some groups; I feel its a bit extreme.

Rolling your last 3 into 1 response; your making some good points and I am really just offering my perspective and not entirely opposed to your opinion (again I just feel its a little too much; but that is my opinion) what if they had compromised with ""Butty?"" given you cited the character might use less crass language (ass - oh someone fetch my fainting couch!) and the character looks a bit juvenile - would that have worked as a compromise?

On March 22, 1988, The US DOJ (Associate Attorney General Stephen S. Trott ) notified the office of Independent Counsel that an informant named PAUL ALLEN RUDD met with PABLO ESCOBAR and that an exchange of guns for drugs had occurred with the contras. The informant said that ESCOBAR was dealing with a US government agency. See the documents here:

Rudd says that Escobar complained that George Bush Used to deal with him, But was now being tough. He claimed to have a photo of Bush with Jorge Ochoa, another cartel member. ESCOBAR stated that guns were unloaded and cocaine was sent to US military bases.

The Associate Attorney General vouches for the reliability of the informant as he has provided reliable information until this point.

Media Censor CIA Ties With Medellin Drug Cartel

[http://web.archive.org/web/20120908153238/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1190](http://web.archive.org/web/20120908153238/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1190)

The Washington Post (2/12/88) included this politically delicate aspect of Rodriguez's testimony in its headline: ""Drug Money Alleged to Go to Contras."" But Joe Pichirallo's page 30 article tiptoed around CIA involvement with Rodriguez. The Post also failed to mention Rodriguez's assertion that he worked with US banks, and it did not include his statement about laundering moneyfor the CIA after his drug indictment. This omission was egregious in view of the fact that Senator Kerry questioned Rodriguez in detail about an accounting sheet which a federal prosecutor submitted as evidence at his trail:

Senator Kerry: What does your accounting show with respect to the CIA?

Ramon Rodriguez: It shows that I received a shipment of three million and change sometime in the middle of the month. [(Watch the video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpEqF_51sw)

At the end of the hearing the Post's Pichirallo asked chief counsel Jack Blum why the CIA would use Rodriguez to funnel money after he'd been indicted. Blum responded that such a time would be ideal, since US government investigators cannot approach a defendant after he has been indicted. Extra! later asked Pichirallo why Rodriguez's testimony about moving dirty money for the CIA was excluded from the Post, but he was not forthcoming: ""It is my policy never to discuss anything I do.""

(Ramon Rodriguez mentions that he also paid the Watergate burglars earlier in his career, but Senator Kerry doesn't ask further questions.)

"bjj","t5_2qn02","I was already a Purple belt who had done a fair amount of MMA sparring so dealt with takedown but not any legit wrestling.

Started training with a Wrestling Coach from the US who taught us pure folkstyle. Not some MMA wrestling hybrid of takedowns for BJJ, just wrestling for wrestling using folkstyle ruleset.

I cannot overstate how much it has improved my game, I went from being mostly a tricky guard player baby purple to smashing much bigger browns from the top in about a year. 2.5 years into Wrestling now and the difference it has made is crazy. There is a probably like 20ish of us blue/purples that started wrestling when the class started in a gym with maybe 150 members and 10 black belts and the level of all the guys who added wrestling twice a week to an already 3-5 times a week bjj timetable has rocketed.

Mostly I put it down to the below

1. Tenacity, I know this may sound dumb but our Coach never shuts up about it but it is true. 8 years BJJ under my belt so I comfortable saying MOST BJJ guys chill way to much and do not have that same hustle you get in a wrestling setting as the pace is much higher.
2. Controlling the match, being a guard player/leglocker I am more than happy to play off my back, in fact I will often jump to leg entanglements mid pass to go for a sub. But the added value of when I feel I am getting overwhelmed on bottom to be able to scramble to my knees and snatch a leg and have most BJJ guys either just immediately give up top position or not have enough wrestling ability to stop it even if they do try. Also nobody has Guillotined me in years despite always going to my knees to scramble up. That being said a good back snatcher will make you pay.
3. Pinning, In BJJ they say""Position before Submission"" and this is 100% correct however it is often lost in translation to people and it takes a while to understand when you are supposed to go for the sub vs pin them down/ no when to abandon a position to avoid getting swept/ knowing, there is a lot going on in a BJJ situation. When your only goal is to pin the person on their back so strongly they can not roll you over or get up it becomes a lot easier to just focus on that. Once you can hold someone down submitting them becomes much easier.

Obviously neither are better than the other and pure wrestlers still get subbed over and over because they give up so many bad positions for a real fight but having the 2 of them together is truly amazing for your game.",1583020988

Example: made a Thai curry. By the time I've factored in everything it's a little higher in carbs than I'd like for a ""satisfying"" serving. So I have a smaller bowl of curry with an avocado (for fat) or some eggs (protein) depending on my macros for the day. 

Tldr: smaller quantities of prepared dishes supplemented with simpler mostly protein or mostly fat side dishes to make up the difference in calories/macros.

By no means an expert, but this has been working for me. I know you wanted more specific recipes and techniques (I'll be lurking looking for ideas), but this was a helpful mindset change I adopted.

The good news is that states are not totally dependent on the feds for planning and taking action. Each state has emergency task forces who have trained extensively for public health emergencies like this one. The bad news is that all of them probably assumed the CDC would never be politicized and so they made plans counting on them.

If federal censoring continues, I expect we'll see multiple states band together without the CDC. This bullshit flies in the face of every principle of public safety. (And, to be clear, I'm quite certain the CDC employees are also absolutely furious but are staying in their jobs to help out the best that they can. It's not their fault.)",1583020990

A bit of background- my partner recently got their green card, and is now a permanent resident of the usa. they speak perfect english, as well as two other languages, and have already lived in the here for about 5 years.

We recently moved to a new state, so my partner has to find a new job. (previously worked in freight/transportation) This was two months ago. my partner has previously told me that once the green card situation was all good, they would look into community colleges (they do not have a degree). Totally fair.

They toured a school, and seemed optimistic, but ended up not following through with it. They have since been applying to some jobs, but have not had luck and do not seem to really be interested in any careers. it seems like they have an idea, like ""oh i think trade school could be cool!"" and i am supportive, but then a few days later they drop the idea and as the weeks tick by i am becoming frustrated.

I am a phd student, and this situation has been really anxiety inducing. One, for financial reasons. i am paying for rent. And two, for personal reasons, my partner is always home, we live in a really small apartment so i have zero alone time. they do not have any friends, since we moved. They mostly stay home all day and game.

I love my partner, and I know two months without work is not a long time at all, but am i a huge asshole for pressuring them to give me a plan? What would be a nicer way to go about this? I dont want to force them to work a job they are not interested in.

\*\*\*apologies for how many times i wrote partner i just read this through

They spent a good 5 minutes or so jamming short sections of 3 or 4 other songs until Mike got to a note where the guitar was out of tune and then he'd hold that discordant note longer.

The 25 came from an evaluation that just drops the fractional improvements.

But yea, an array that it ePB 55 is pretty nuts.  Using the same method I did to find 4d6 drop lowest is 28 points I had 4d6 reroll 1s and 2s the drop lowest only coming out to PB 48. Just rerolling 1s dropped it down to 37.

"Jung","t5_2s5nh","I see in the way that Way that you wrote looking through your post history how intelligent and how clearly you see the Universe. Even if there are still questions you are accessing the Mind of the Self / Divine Wisdom.

I am intuiting here, but Beings have top down Awakenings. They gain the Wisdom, but not enough Light. 

I submit that when our Hearts are overflowing with Self Love and we have Infinite Patience. We are content in our Self and don't need anything outside the present moment. So we relax in peace and have an easy manner that on its own knows what to do. Spirit is patiently, but always, looking for an opportunity  to heal. It infinitely loved whomever is before them. It knows utter inner peace and seeks to help others find it. It's the state of the Self that the Eastern Traditions call the Boddhisattva or in Easter Traditions it might be called the state of awakening that is the Archangel.

You exhibit in your writing (I looked through your post history) the imprint of someone who is undergoing a really powerful and beautiful (even if it's a struggle) Spiritual Awakening. You have beautiful Gifts of intuition and and ability to communicate in a way that goes beyond mind

The issue is Bhakti. It's love for the Light in your Heart. I came to it by inner child healing and I'll provide a link after i post this. I don't know what your inner voice is like but when you complete all three self realizations of the Trinity, and you have a really good opportunity to do this in this lifetime your binner voice going to be adoration for Spirit the one that animates you without thought in the perfect.

With Unconditional Love and being in this state of being your mind is utterly silent and you never have to wonder what other people think

But again without Self Love it's a top down Awakening with a closed heart Chakra and that can be karmic and not a Love in every Moment situation. 

It's a little unclear to me because I don't know you. If your just out there and ecclectic  because your individuating with an immense intellect, but nobody really gets you. And so you are just silent. That's one way it could go. They key would be are you giving off a good vibe. Spirit often doesn't reply but it will become so immersed in the Love it feels when it hears a brother or sister speak that it prays and puts it's hand over it's heart and radiates the light of love

It's like that I. It's a pretty good way to be. There's a lot of Joy in it. Only you know how your Awakening to your Self is going. If you feel unease then go inward to your heart and Use your inner voice to love, comfort, and support your self until your heart is overflowing with Love

Let it go bruh. The past is the past. Now if you’ll excuse me I gotta go charge my Tesla.”

It's a black hole of hell that's nearly impossible to get out of. There's so little room for job growth and more often than not the higher up the ladder you climb, the less you end up making. It's not worth it. And don't ever be salaried in retail. Please. 

My breaking point was when I worked for a multi billion dollar Fortune 500 company during the last recession. I was an assistant manager overseeing three multi-million dollar departments. I was salaried and was told I could make so much money because of the possible commission. Only, if I made commission, it screwed over my employees who only made commission (they didn't get base pay like I did). My choices were to outsell my team, create a miserable competitive atmosphere, and lose really good employees, or step back and screw myself over. I don't think I ever broke $14ish an hour. Most weeks it was less. It was soul sucking. I'm curious how the hourly workers at the coffee shop feel about the manager getting tipped out for 39 hours.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I can relate.

I don’t get memory loss from depression but I’ve failed every attempt at treating my depression with medications for the last 12 years. Now that I’m considered “treatment resistant”, they’ve got me doing ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). And the ECT seriously destroys your memory. The past 6 months are more or less gone. I can only remember the past 24 hours or so in any detail. I’ve been trying to watch the new “Star Trek: Picard” series and each week a new episode comes out my wife has to explain everything that has happened so far in the series. I don’t even remember who the characters are.

I also can’t remember any of the controls for all the video games I was playing a few months ago. Muscle memory is gone too. 

That said, the ECT also wiped out my depression better than anything else I’ve ever tried by a wide margin. And the memories are supposed to come back eventually. I personally would trade the memory for the mood improvements again if I had to. Most of the memories were just of me wanting to kill myself anyway. 

In any case, head on over to r/ect if you want to find others in the memory loss camp.",1583020998

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","I know this isn't going to be the popular answer, but I'm of the opinion we need to stop differentiating the two so much. These kinds of distinctions makes perfect sense for fighting on the internet. Living in the world today, as it stands right now, what's the difference? There are people who show up for the struggle, and people who don't. People who protest, make agitprop on the internet, help orgs with coordination by making phone calls, sending emails, maintaining secure servers that house forums and message boards for coordinating radical actions are getting the fucking bread. That's all that matters to me.

&amp;#x200B;

To be an anarchist almost anywhere in the world today worried about the difference between mutualism and anarchocommunism is like looking at a dirt lot on which we want to build a house and refusing to break ground because we can't decide what color to paint the rooms. This dirt field has been here for centuries of capitalism. We've barely dug deep enough to drop gravel and we have no idea how much concrete we need for the pad, but we're too busy talking about interior design to start. Meanwhile, Rojava has fully capitalist corporations working within a left libertarian society. Chiapas is exporting Zapatista grown coffee to capitalist cafes.

&amp;#x200B;

Down to brass tacks, the only way to switch from what we have now to a fully ancom society would require complete appropriation of the entire society. Not only will that require an unholy load of resources, it will be impossible to accomplish without insane levels of violence or total social collapse due to something entirely ulterior, like a plague or a meteor. Chances are, mutualistic and communistic forms of resource distribution will exist side by side over the course of a century long transitional period and it's pure hubris to assume anyone alive today has a clue of what it will look like when we get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone from Libertarian Marxist to Mutualist is my comrade. We can not afford to sacrifice an ounce of willing effort on the altar of ideological purity. The whole post-industrial world is locked into a slide towards authoritarianism and outright fascism. Infighting among the libertarian left paralyses the movement in the face of our current crisis.

"AsianMasculinity","t5_30c2m","Wow, you didn't contradict any of my points. You reinforced my argument with a ridiculous amount of vitriol you directed towards a sympathetic Black man. The history of how immigration quotas were implemented was a direct result of vicious racism and nativism that culminated during the height of the second major wave of the KKK during the 1920s. The Chinese exclusion laws predated that period of explicit quotas. The laws were designed to limit almost all immigration to America except for northwestern europeans. Shortly after the Civil rights act and voting rights act, the United States liberalized the immigration laws to allow people from all parts of the world to come to this country. It is a fact that because of MLK, Medgar Evers, Rosa Parks, and other civil rights groups, we now have immigration from east Asia, south Asia, the middle east, Latin America, and Africa.  Consequently, you owe your existence in this country to their struggle whether you acknowledge it or not.

There is no oppression olympics, but most countries provide for their own citizens. It is a privilege to immigrate to our great country that wouldn't exist or be a powerhouse if it wasn't for the labor, struggle, culture, music, and knowledge of Black people and other types of people. I do think race as a factor in college admissions is not appropriate at this time. Do I think Black people suffer from racism at the hands of Whites? Do I think other minorities discriminate against Blacks? I think the answer to those questions is both yes. I also think Black people can discriminate against other people and White people. Life is complex. In Japan, they provide for Japanese people. I think we do have an obligation to help educate foreign people who want to be educated here, but I think some priority should be given to tax payers and American citizens. Every country in the world generally prioritizes educating its own citizens. Life is about balance. 

I have many friends from diverse backgrounds. Most of my Asian friends would tell me that Black people have gotten shafted in America throughout its history. The Chinese helped build our railroads, Asian Americans have helped transform and enrich our country throughout its history as well. Even though until the 1960s, the numbers were small, they have been involved in virtually every aspect of American history. I think the most qualified candidate should get the position or job at a University or job. I think board scores like SAT, ACT are essential because they are much more objective criteria than many other metrics available. I think grades are also important as well. Grades are notoriously difficult to perfectly calibrate across high schools, but are one of the best indicators of future collegiate GPA. I think that our country is very stratified, with gross concentrations of wealth and poverty. I think intergenerational wealth is one of the strongest predictors of future success. Consequently, I think clas and economic disadvantage should be a factor.

Life is about balance and proportionality. Technical schools might only care about board scores, High School GPA, and college entrance exams, but American Universities have a slightly more holistic mission that engenders critical thinking skills and appreciation for interdisciplinary thought. I do think certain extracurricular activities, athletic prowess, volunteering, and unique attributes should also be factors. I realize those qualities might permit one to inject their own biases. I am sympathetic towards some of the arguments made here about how some of those criteria seem to be an indirect means to disadvantage Asians. I still think people don't just go to a University to study all day alone without social interaction. It is essential that students learn and employ collaborative techniques of achievement and work. 

So, I agree it is a bad idea to use race as a factor. I think Black people suffer the most discrimination in this country. I think Black people have a ridiculous stigma associated with everything we do that poisons our achievement. I wish you had a passion for legacy students, and all the issues that disadvantage Black people and really threaten our ideas of meritocracy much more. However, I understand that potential 1% and those demonic Black people must be addressed forcefully. We are still yearning for justice that never comes. I love that we are a country of immigrants and think immigration is a source of strength. I just wish they knew our history much better and the inner working of the richest society in human history. We educate the wealthy elites of other countries as well. I guess it hasn't been that long ago, that most of us couldn't vote in this country. I should appreciate the progress. I would hope we would have more Asian American allies in the struggle against racism. It is strange because I agreed with most of the posters ideas concerning the drawbacks of race based college admissions, but I am still painted as a villain. Good luck on your struggle. I hope you look over my responses and really do some research into the history of this topic.",1583021000

You can find many examples given by Sartre and de Beauvoir on this. However, they all relate to the European society they lived in at the time. I believe one possible existential analysis would be to consider how people in their teens and twenties are using social media to be *both* free to construct a persona and express themselves online, *and* to be deeply anxious about this and therefore rather force themselves into less free roles. The existential anxiety of Instagram, the Being and TikTokness, Hell is Other People on Twitter... endless opportunities.",1583021000

Ok. Not exactly helping your argument. If any group of individuals stole a bus full of firearms and used it to bargain with/intimidate soldiers, that alone would constitute clearly high-risk illegal activity, especially in the context of an anti-government protest. That easily justifies soldiers being armed, never mind the fact that I still don't have a reason to believe these protesters just piled a bunch of stolen weapons on top of a bus not to use them, but rather to keep them away from protesters... out of the goodness of their hearts, I guess, lol.

Hence one of my threeshots has a 2k, a 6k and a 10k chapter, all of which I feel is an appropriate amount for what I wanted to convey in each part.

I also have a friend who just majored in History and now has a nice job that pays really well with an insurance company. Another friend of mine majored in Molecular Biology and is not using that major at all. It does not matter to most employers. They just like that you have the work ethic to fulfill the needs to get that degree. Yes for that 20% it matters. Not debating those. 80% though just get that degree and find a good job.

It also uses a unique mechanic where halfway through the fight(the hard part really), you can't receive healing anymore and the only healing is from a special potion item you can use in there, so the typical setup to farm is either 4tanks(easiest since no one can die) or 4DPS(a lot faster because you can do the 2nd part in one phase instead of 2).

Suggestions: 

1. Needs audio work. A dedicated mic, voiceovers that are closer to the mic, idk how your setup is, but it needs it. 
2. Tighter camera angles and focusing. Do multiple takes, close-ups on people who are talking, mix it up a bit. Adds some flavor. Unless you are going for a campy B-movie feel, but I think it could take your videos up a level for sure.

In a world without the internet or radio or some sort of magical analog, that actually makes more sense though. Prior to the modern age, you couldn't necessarily expect that of just anyone. The initial naivete and the process of discovering and learning as you travel in a homebrew setting is probably a lot more representative of what it would actually have been like to go adventuring in the middle ages, so its really different in the way that it doesn't make any attempts to model or represent a medieval or pseudomedieval world.

They are most well known and scene for patrolling the freeways but they also back up smaller local departments, act as police in unincorporated areas without sheriffs, police all states lands, etc. It's hard to regulate and outfit a department that does such varied duties with gear that works perfectly for everyone. Full face helmets make perfect sense when you are cruising on the freeway. They make less sense when they are off the bike for hours doing accident investigations but regulations say you still have to wear a helmet because you are on a roadway or patrolling the states capital at low speeds.

she doesnt mind your feelings or respect you if it crashes with her own pleasure or benefit

2 she only put attention on you when you were at risk, she is having you for somethingh to use whenever she needs it, you are a tool for her

3 she is manipulative of you to make you agree to what she wants

4 what happens when she finds a guy she finds attractove that also gives her whatever she gets from you? (emotional support, comfort, security) she will drop you like a old smartphone when she gets a new ome she likes more

5 you apologize for little justifiable thinghs yet she only did when you were at risk of breaking up, she has emotional power over you and has already used it, this is abusive

6 she is a woman who has a easier time gettimg hook ups and you are a monagamic commited guy who is loyal to her, she can and wants to fuck around way more than you can or want so she gets to do whatever she wants and knows she wont have you get someone else

she is doing this knowimg you wont like it and only sacrifice because you love her, she is tsking advantage of your love

The early stages are super easy, but not rewarding, and then the later phases become pointlessly hard, and you're out of energy because of the early phases. You need to spend more energy to do more damage, but there is massive diminishing returns because even at the highest energy costs you can't deal enough damage to make a difference. 

And in terms of balance, out of an entire massive roster, if you don't have a handful of specific characters, you will be even less productive, because either your strongest characters will not receive the massive stat boosts the devs handed out, or they will use moves that are counterproductive to raids because the bosses are immune to them or they waste too much time.

- take all the sedatives they offer, I was SO relaxed while they were performing the surgery
- use the Hylo (preservative free) drops literally every 15 minutes for the first two days 
- get some podcasts downloaded for recovery.  Do not spend time on your devices otherwise, enjoy the forced break from it
- use the antibiotic and steroid drops exactly as prescribed, don’t skip doses.  Also don’t think that these will sufficiently lubricate tour eyes, they won’t

Side effects:
- immediately post-op, felt tired, tired eyes, very dilated pupils, sensitive to light.
- 24 hrs post-op, I had 20/15 vision in both eyes, with some light “scratchiness” particularly on my left eye which was a toric lens (required additional manipulation during surgery), large halos in day and night driving
-48 hrs post-op, perfect vision, no scratchiness, slightly tender eyelids if I touched them (not recommended), moderate halos
72 hrs post-op, only slight halos.  No other side effects!  

I have a computer heavy job and I stayed away from devices and work for 96 hours.  I was able to work a full day on Friday, but I will say it was tiring.  Probably because I had been so lazy the last 3 days!

I had Visian STAAR, I’m sorry to say I’m not sure if that’s EVO, or if it’s the same thing?  I didn’t have to have an iridotomy.  And both eyes were done at the same time.  Total surgical time was approximately 1 hr.",1583021007

With that out of the way, you should NEVER be EXPECTED to do anything. The pill can really mess with your cycle. Some women have awful side effects, some women have mild to none. Some women need the pill to fix their cycles. It's not something you should just do with no thought.

If you're young and don't want kids I think it's a great idea to be on it if the side effects are minimal but that should be your choice and not for someone else. Any guy who expects you to do it or guilts you to do it etc is manipulating you for personal gain. Not cool..

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I awoke in a bed of flowers, looking up at an endless crimson sky.

I struggled to right myself and look around the area, gazing at an endless garden that I had never seen in my days. There were other people around that I had never seen before, which I thought unusual, for usually my dreams came with some semblance of familiarity.

But as I stood up and gazed around even further, I felt a strangeness overwhelm me, like the sense of everything I was seeing before my very eyes was not actually a fabrication of my mind, but a very real thing. And so to test that theory I tried to free myself from the confines of my dream, but could do no such thing, and as I stood and continued to stare at that once tranquil scene – now settling into a creeping discontent – I had a terrible feeling as to what was to come.

There was a person crawling around in the flowers beside me, a young woman muttering to herself as she trampled the flowers underneath her spindly frame, as her hands seemed to search for something in that endless green.

I approached her with reckless abandon, not believing her to be a threat in the slightest. “Are you alright?”

She looked up in my general direction with a timid look. “Where am I? What did you do to me? Where are my glasses?”

“I'm in the same position as you. I don't know where I am either,” I said, as I looked around in the grass for even a single glint of what could have been glass. “I just woke up here, same as everyone else.”

“There are others?” She looked out into the distance, where the other people had begun to stir and congregate, who she most likely couldn't see in her current state. “Where are we?”

“I don't know where we are,” I said, as I looked around the world. “I've never seen this place before.”

I saw what I thought to be her glasses hidden in the grass, and as I reached down to pick them up, a strange black square appeared before my very eyes. And even as I let out a panicked yell and jumped away from it, it followed me all the same. But in the middle of the chaos that had just overtaken me I noticed that it had upon its form, clearly legible text, and strange symbols of various colors.

“What the hell is this?” I said, as I cautiously reached out to touch it. My finger impacted its surface but did not break through, nor did it seem to change its form in the slightest.

“What's what?” said the woman, still on the earth beside me, but no longer searching for her glasses.

“This black box thing, can you see it?” I said, asking what I believed to be a foolish question.

“I see a fuzzy shape that looks like you, but I don't see anything black.” She looked up at me, squinting fiercely.

“It has my name, and some numbers,” I spoke out loud, trying to make sense of whatever I saw, “how did this even happen?”

“I have no idea what you're on about,” she said, as she cradled her head in her hands. “What is even going on here?”

I gazed to the bottom of that black box and saw clearly readable text, but with a word that I could not quite make sense of.

“Unique ability... glitch?”

The woman at my side stood up and brushed the dirt off of her, and only then did I realize just how tall she was in comparison to me.

“Unique ability?” she said with a strange look upon her visage, “what's-”

Then there came a strange buzzing from around me, and I felt the entire world around me be plunged into near complete darkness, so grand and encompassing that I could barely even see my own fingertips. 

Even the sparse wind and chatter that I once heard from moments before were no longer, and I felt entirely alone in that endless abyss. I thought perhaps that that strange experience was a dream after all, and this was merely the next step in its evolution, but that blackness never seemed to end.

“Are you still there?” I cried out to the void, not expecting an answer.

I saw a hand reach out from the darkness and grasp my shoulder, and while I feared the worst to happen in those next few moments, what I saw next was not an entity of indescribable horror, but the face of the woman who I was talking to just moments ago.

“Are you okay?” she said, her eyes fixated squarely on my own. “You suddenly started ignoring me.”

“What happened?” I asked, “why is everything so dark? I can't see anything.”

“What do you-”

And as soon as that darkness had come upon me, it all faded away once again, and I saw that oddly tranquil garden stretch out before me once again. I breathed a sigh of relief, which was overruled by the panicked voice of the woman beside me once again.

“No,” she said, “I can't see anymore.”

She started meekly flailing her arms about, as a deep frown settled in on her face. “I could see for a moment. I tried to tell you but you ignored me.”

“What's happening?” she said as she shook me with tremendous force. “Where are we?”

I could not give her an answer.

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","Checking the demographics of the people that voted for each main entry is extremely interesting. (Click on the Final Results window in the link and click on the pie chart symbol to the right of each title in the list.)

My thoughts:

* The #1 entry, X, had a very even gender and age split, leaning slightly towards male voters.

* VII and VI in comparison were highly favored by the 30-39 demographic. VII leans more towards female voters, and VI leaned more towards male voters.

* IX has an even age split, but has a 60/40 female/male voter split

* XIV is almost entirely balanced in many aspects, having a near equal gender split and 20-29/30-39 age split.

* XI being the other MMO on the list in contrast to the above skews heavily towards male voters as well as the 30-39/40-49 demographic, but has little presence among the 20-29 age demographic. Only the original FF much further down the list is as favored among the 40-49 age group.

* XV is overwhelmingly favored by female voters, but has a somewhat even 20-29/30-39 age split otherwise.

It should be interesting to see how SE interprets the results of this poll too, because quite a few things leap out to me as being quite unexpected (Emet-Selch's exceptionally high placement as a villain being among them, X beating out VII, Tactics placing high for a series that has been dormant for a decade and hasn't seen re-releases, and XIII/XV placing comparatively low for being the most recent mainline single player entries).

It's almost like the FF fanbase has different expectations from whatever SE's marketing department may think.",1583021011

Oh my, maybe you would have become a nurse had you played more with dolls, the horror!

I get what you're saying, having an interest that's common social circles you'll be placed in, is useful in making friends. There are many interests that can help you make friends. Though maybe you'll have to venture a bit out of the social circles you'll be expected to be a part of. Also, being interested in dolls, and being interested in war aren't mutually exclusive.

Alright, I don’t even know if “slut shaming” is the correct term here, but it’s the closest thing I can think of. 

A close friend of mine from college and I were catching up and talking about politics today over brunch, and I mentioned to him that I will not be available tonight because I already had plans with another  friend. He kept probing me about my plans so in the end I finally revealed I have plans to watch TV/primary results with an FWB tonight. My friend is politically on the other aisle, and he is fairly conservative when it comes to these aspects of life. I was fully expecting him to be full on judgmental with me, but he wasn’t. I made him promise he wouldn’t tell a soul, including his girlfriend, because it’s just not a part of my life I care to share with most people.

Well, I gave him for being open-minded too quickly. We went on to talking about the election and I mentioned that I was able to convince my FWB to donate to a couple candidates a couple weeks ago. It just so happened that my FWB and I were watching the TV coverage of the primaries during an activity break and I was able to convince him to support a couple candidates that I preferred. 

Somehow, my friend took deep offense at this, and basically called me a prostitute during brunch. For whatever reason, he linked the casual activity between me and my FWB with my FWB’s decision to donate to some candidates. In his mind, there was a quid pro quo when in reality there wasn’t. The two events were purely coincident.

I explained to him how hurtful the accusation was, because he is, in effect, judging me for having consensual activities with my FWB and attributing my sexuality with political influence where none existed. He refused to understand my point of view and called me disgusting for trying to hide behind “slut shaming” as an excuse. 

I’m genuinely at a loss for how he could invent this quid pro quo in his mind even after I very clearly explained to him the sex had nothing to do with the political contributions my FWB made. Am I missing something here?! I’m kinda upset right now.

&gt; she often lacks any form of true mobility

Not every god in the game needs ""true mobility"" to be effective, particularly not a warrior with ridiculous poke/sustain/set-up and potential tankyness. Yemoja doesn't have ""true mobility"" either and she's anything but ineffective.

And it's not like Mulan lacks mobility, evolved 3 pulls herself to walls super quickly and her ult can easily be used as an escape. I really don't get your point.

&gt; Yes her 3 does pull her to a wall, but there is a 2s frame shot that allows enemy players to interrupt it. If it was an instant cast ability, it would be more useful as opposed to just sitting down waiting for her arrow to fire.

Let's forget the part where her 3 also does a small pull + stun. It has a small delay on it to compensate the fact that it's way more than a movement option. If it was instant it'd be busted.

&gt; Mulan has an issue with her passive not displaying correctly

That's not a problem with Mulan. That's a problem with the HUD not displaying certain data correctly.

So basically, you showed 0 issues her kit has, and you didn't even explain how is her kit ineffective against meta gods.

It's a bit too early to tell her stance in the meta. She's definitely not as weak as some people think.",1583021013

That's how Commander is: as long as you aren't doing the thing the card got banned for, nobody really cares. And he's obviously not, you said that even with these busted cards, you would stomp him until he compensated. If he compensates by getting infinite recursion on the Titan, then you have room to complain, but until then, play a few games. If the cards are super oppressive in those games, explain that to him.

Im not against abortion in terms of legality, but the hypicrisy of valuing a fetus as a human if the mother wants it and in the same thought discarding it like menstration waste if she does not is reminicent of double speak from 1984. Have abortions legal, thats between you and your doctor and god if there is one. But dont pretend its not murder in the case of a healthy pregnancy. I dont respect someone taking a humanitarian stance on the immigration situation and at the same time telling themself that abortion isn't wrong.",1583021017

I'm no scientist. This is just a hunch, partly based on observing my own life. My religion today consists of reading Webu Sayadaw, practicing Sila (morality) and Dana (generosity) in my daily life and this is about as religious as I get. It's important for me personally to have a system to follow because it has been a lifelong goal of mine to grow in my capacity to be kind and loving.

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/wishforbeard743! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;/r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Be really open while you are in school and see what catches your interest but then see what works for you in actual practice.  I wish you all the luck in the world.  I LOVED law school!  It is a lot of work but it is so stimulating and you meet really interesting people.  Don't let anyone scare you about it.

As far as the wages, don't hate a person that make more than a university degree and can afford better life by putting in longer hours. Nobody force anybody to do these hours and it is a choice.

He can make errors and questionable decisons. Imagine being a simpleton and literally agreeing to everything someone says cause he got the credentials lmfao. I suggest you you be a bit brighter than that and have a mind of your own, ask questions more when you don't understand, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

By your stupid logic, we can't question ANY coach in the league and by your own stupid argument we can't call ANY coach in the league bad because they got ""more credentials"" and ""more knowledge"".",1583021021

so I'd say go Nef if you want an eKY specialist, or go Delphi if you want a unit that is probably better in a wider range of content, but not as in demand for eKY",1583021024

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","We’ve done something like, have 3000 point army ready.

Each game is 1500 points. 1 detachment (played in 5th kind of like this)

Troop units come back free (representing the backbone of the army)

Units that end a game below min squad size can merge with other under minimum units that would make “sense”

Example 1: 2 Units of SM devastators @ 4- units can merge but only have up to 4 Heavy weapons.

Example 2: SM devestators get absorbed into troops following weapon options. They basically fade away into basic squads)

Example 3: SM terminators can merge between Assault and Regular only if both units fall below min

Specialist Squads that fall to 1 model get the remaining model “upgraded”

Example 1: one Terminator remains: becomes a Captain in terminator price

Example 2: One Vanguard Remains: becomes a Captain with Jump Pack

Surviving MC/vehicles return at full wounds (trying to remember wounds between games causes issues)

Finally each army gets one non-named HQ to survive the campaign. If the model is slain, it loses any relic it has. But the next game it comes back with everything except their relics. (back when every army had to have an HQ)

When it gets later into the games armies sometimes can’t hit the 1500 point mark.. that’s where we would come up with house rules...

But honestly the game mode that GW came out with for 8th with the “half points gets sudden death” would work perfect with these! As long as everyone attempts to make a list with remaining units.",1583021025

"MMORPG","t5_2qlxw","Certain mechanics introduced to games such as finders have absolutely been a one step forward, three steps back thing. It made finding groups much, much easier but now people just hang out in the popular hub spot then queue into everything. 

Also it seems that most MMO players nowadays want the illusion of community and communication. Like they want to play with people around them but they want to be isolated when actually playing the game. It's shit like this that makes people think that Destiny and Tem Tem are MMOs when, at least to me, are just single player games that you do with people around (minus the stuff in Destiny that actually forces you to cooperate with a group of players).

We just have to accept that the people actually wanting to play MMOs nowadays have different ideas of what an MMO should be. I'd love to see a MMO come out that still have instanced PvE stuff but has a huge PvP focus in all zones of the game minus cities that also gets rid of party/group finders. But that doesn't sound like a very open net, wide reaching game which seems to be the absolute necessity for most game publishers nowadays.",1583021025

You may need to file your 2019 first though to update the information they have about you on file.  They will ask questions about your address and lines from the last filed return.  

Start with the most recent years and work your way back.  You can start with the past three years as thats what most free/cheap programs will let you file.   You are going to have to paper file a few years though.  

If you want to be really lazy just find an accountant to do it.  Get a T1013 signed and they can talk to CRA on your behalf and get all the information.  It will cost some money but its the easiest way.  They will also have all of the programs going back that far.

"NZCFL","t5_3oud9","Baylor offers #38 Chester Murdoch

Scholarship

Chester, I understand that you'd prefer to stay close to home, and I know that Texas isn't Florida. However, we do have a key similarity in terms of climate-we also don't have seasons. Jokes aside, I promise that i'll schedule 3 games in Florida while you're a member of this Baylor Bears squad, as I'd honestly like to visit Disney World and go to the Beach. 

Chester, we here at Baylor are very prideful of our long and historic tradition, especially now that we have added a national championship to our repertoire. Being the oldest school in the grand state of Texas and having played college football since the 1800's, we have entrenched ourselves as one of college footballs most historic and well known programs. Knowing that an important aspect of tradition is rivalries, I promise that we'll have a positive record against our rivals during your tenure as a Baylor Bear, and that our tradition ranking will increase as we add more trophies to display.

Chester, I want you to have faith that you are coming to one of the most prestigious schools in the NZCFL when you come and become a Bear. We will enter the top ten in prestige during your collegiate career, that's a promise. During my tenure as the coach of this program I have taken this team from 66th to 11th in prestige, the fastest rise ever documented in the NZCFL. If you want to go to a prestigious school on the rise, there is nowhere better than Baylor University.",1583021027

Aye, his crossing was poor at times, but his positional sense, work rate and determination are still unmatched. And could you honestly say Ojo offers anything in that position?

We also need a plan B. Every other domestic game consists of our tactics not working and us proceeding just to fire hopeful balls up the park. For a while Morelos was digging us out, but it always a bit of an ask to expect him to do that all season, off field issues aside.

The biggest annoyance for me is when we play teams who pack the box and our midfielders all drop back 20 yards to receive a 2 yard pass from Goldson, then turn  round and look shocked that there's no space in behind the opposition's defence.",1583021027

Although the Queedom of Min is known to have been established during the Great War of the 11th eon, or at least have matured then, it's founding legend and source of legal legitimacy - Imperia Divina - is much less well understood. The legend says that the Dynasty of Min is metaphorically or literally married to the Divine Empress, which is why the Queendom is not an Empire, and though this bond to the cosmic divine, it is legitimized as a state (as well as in it's alien-hating, rigidly hierarchic, militarist matriarchal culture).

There's absolutely no reason to believe any of that is true or that such a fact should give the Dynasty of Min the legitimacy it has; that's mostly secured through military might and fear of the Royal Fleet. The more rational minded argue it's merely a metaphor, since there were former rulers of the Aristocracy (predecessor of the Queendom), who were known to have been akin to empresses, but even this causes some problems, notably that human women cannot reliably master exotics (i.e. magic). Since Min acknowledges all magic comes from the Divine Empress, and men are generally considered second-class citizens, this creates a bit of a theo-political conundrum, which is mostly handwaved in-universe as ""women gave up the ability to master magic to be superior in all other walks of life"", which only works inside the Queendom because social norms keep the gender divide alive.

The whole mythos behind Imperia Divina is a political quagmire for the Queendom since it's enshrined in the Bounds Treaty, which secures universal peace, so they can't exactly change or adapt their founding myth without allowing every other state to reneogitate base terms of the Treaty, which the Dynasty doesn't want. Of course, that's the political reality. On the mystic side, many arcanists (male, mostly) and mystics (female, mostly) secretly fear that the Divine Empress, if such a cosmic entity exists, would in fact absolutely abhor the Queendom and that it's metaphorically married to it's own inevitable demise and the hands of consmic wrath.

Suffice to say, the Queendom of Min has a bit of an issue with it's founding legend. The truth is it was politically convenient to harken back to the woman whom the Divine Empress legend is based on, since that woman did in fact fight a successful war against the aliens. Beyond that though it was mostly political posturing and calling on old loyalties which went a bit far and now the Queendom is stuck in a bind.",1583021027

I'm not going to defend the actions of some protestors. It's not my place to do so and it's entirely outside of the scope of my statement. I have no idea what I would really do if I were in their position but I don't think I'd be exactly complacent about it.  If HK loses their voice, the PRC will swallow them up and they won't be making any more trouble for the PRC. There are obviously a LOT of HK citizens that aren't interested in letting the PRC rule their lives so if the PRC ever decides that the economic and political risks are small enough, I guarantee that they'll clamp down and ship those people off to be ""reeducated"".

So I'm taking this driving course which is about $500 for 6 two-hour lessons. For the most part, these lessons would last about an hour and forty-five minutes. I don't have a problem with this, since I think that he usually arrives early and starts the clock then, making it two hours for him, as well as the lessons he gives being very good. My mom doesn't like it since I'm not getting a full two hours. I also have an issue of not answering the phone on time so I may not get to him when he comes. So who's in the wrong?

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","True, though the result is pretty much the same either way. I just say as a flavour thing that the time when you intercept it is after they provide the components.(which is why(in my mind, not RAW) they still lose their action when being counterspelled, as they've done all the actions already, the spell was just prevented from taking effect.) For flavour I like the ""intercepting the spell after they've provided the components"" more so I'll keep using that in my games, since it allows for a lot cooler descriptions of counterspell actually intercepting or neutralising the opposing spell somehow rather than just magically interrupting the casting.

Ex. 1: Someone goes to cast fireball, but as the projectile goes to explode, you counter by creating a small vortex where the projectile hit that sucks the fire into it.

Ex. 2: Someone goes to cast Disintegrate, and you conjure a temporary magical force barrier in its path which the Disintegrate hits and destroys instead of the intended target.

(You can even use this for countering a counterspell, for example with the Disintegrate one, countering their counterspell could be you using your magic to bend the space your Disintegrate is travelling through allowing it to bypass the barrier, or maybe you wave your hand and shunt their haphazard unstable barrier into the ethereal plane for a moment)

(of course this is all just flavour, I know there's no spell that actually lets you bend your disintegrate or anything, it's just cool!)

Counterspell can be flavourful and more fun than just ""he stops your spell"", which is why I made this flavour change. But yeah, thanks for putting the actual RAW rule, I really should have put that in and specified that mine was a reflavouring/reinterpretation of that rule, I'm just so used to the reflavour it slipped my mind. :)",1583021030

"JUSTNOFAMILY","t5_3a182","She's invasive. 

She's an emotional vampire, sucking you dry.  My JN did this, and then demanded more and more and blamed me for not giving more. They do not care about us, only about getting what they want; it's the nature of vampires to only see us as food for them, not as a person.  When I stopped being available, my JN found other victims. 

She's toxic, deeply poisonous and very unhealthy.  

If she was a stranger, would she still be in your life?  Something to think about. 

Whether you do LC or NC, you and boyfriend are going to the be ones enforcing your boundaries.  She's very open about her disrespect for you and your needs and your wants and your emotions and your everything.  She's very open about her intention to use anything and everything that is yours for herself, as long as she can get to you to do so.  Many JNs are not so openly telling us what they are going to do.  Yours is.  She's going to do what she wants, while ignoring your needs and wants and life.   She uses people.  

She is pure selfishness.  

She is Entitled.  

She won't ever respect or obey your boundaries.  

So... you know that.  And whatever you choose to do, you can plan for that. Enforcing your boundaries is for you and boyfriend to do.  She won't.  Most of our JNs won't.  Accept that.  It will be a bit of work, and at first it will be hard to do.  Later, it gets easier because you change how you think about her and the situation.

It does get easier. 

You have lots of options.  There are lots of old posts on other subs, and sidebars about how to enforce boundaries.  You might make another post about suggestions for help to enforce yours, when you figure out what boundaries you want to enforce.  

Yes, there are people who will not understand if you remove your mother from your life.  You don't have to talk about it with any of them.  Even if people ask, you can have a couple of things you memorize to say, depending on how much you need to protect yourself from those people or in that situation or for your emotional vulnerability that day.  ""She's not around much.""  ""I haven't had a mother for years now."" [this is true now, she's got the title but she isn't doing the job of mother and hasn't] ""My mother is abusive and refuses to get help.""  Or you can just ignore the question and ask your own question about their lives.  Most people will be happy to talk about their interests.  

Other people will understand.  You might be surprised by who and where you meet them.  Still, what you choose to talk about is yours.  People can ask well-intentioned questions that are still invasive of your privacy and you do not have to answer these.  You can memorize several ways to respond to these.  I found a list helpful, of things I could say in various situations.  ""I don't talk about her except with my therapist.""  ""I am not able to talk about her."" ""Sorry, I can't talk about it yet."" ""She's toxic, but this isn't the place to discuss that.  Let's check out the buffet.""  Work out a list for yourself.  

Point is, there are people who will take the side of toxic people because they are also toxic, or they are enablers to toxic, or they do not understand how horrible toxic can be because they are some of the lucky ones.  And there are people who will understand.

  But you are adult and you get to choose what to say about your relationships and who to say these things to.  You get to choose, about most of your life, what information to keep private and what to share.  That's normal adulting, but JNs teach us to tell them as much information as they can milk from us, so they can use it to use us.  

You are allowed to discuss or not discuss the things in your life, with any other people, even relatives.  You get to make those decisions.  Giving yourself permission is hard.  But it is also freedom.

Seems to me the thing to do now, first, is to decide what you need as regards your toxic mother.  Base this on what you need for your health:  physical, mental and emotional.  Include stress and anxiety that she produces in you.  These things are important.  Ask your boyfriend to give input and don't defend your toxic mother when he does, just listen to how he wants to protect you and help you. 

Me:  it was my MIL and now is one of my spouse's siblings that have been the toxic JNs in our lives.  Nearly twenty years ago, MIL let go of all restraints on her crazy and we went first LC, down to the written only --to protect ourselves with proof, and then finally NC when LC didn't produce any changes in her choices.  She was a violent person and things got difficult before her health slowed her down.  We kept our boundaries, even when she wouldn't respect them.  She kept trying to drag us back, to force us to pick up the blame for her actions and her choices.  When she kept leaving messages on the business line, we had someone transcribe them, review them for threats, and put the hard copies in storage in case needed in court.  We screened all calls and never picked up hers.  We had plans in place if she showed up at home or other places, and people in the house and at work knew what to do.  We had plans for if her stalking became confrontational.  Lots of things like that.  She's dead now, recently, but a sibling in law has decided to try to take her place and be in control over the family.  That's about a thousand pages summarized.  Basically we put plans in place to protect ourselves, as much as we could.  Even though we couldn't go hidden or block her because of the Job, we did what we could, and had plans for the rest. 

You deserve better. You deserve never to be yelled at, never to be used, never to be treated so badly, but to be cherished and valued and adored.  You deserved a parent who loved you like a parent is supposed to love, not a parent who puts themselves first.  So, do what she never will:  Take Care of YOU.  Learn how.  Learn what that means. 

Decide what you want.  What level of contact, if any.  What kind of contact, if any.  What she would have to do to change that, like get therapy and admit her wrongs and change herself. Ignore for now what ""people"" will say, because they didn't have her as a parent, so they don't get to vote here.  You are going to learn how to deal with them.  I could write hours more just on that.

 Decide what you need:  a home that she never comes into, a real sanctuary?  a home she doesn't have an address for?  maybe some place with a gate or a gate guard?  no calls? calls when you are ready to handle them, maybe once every three months?  only texts or emails that you can check once a week when you are ready to face them? Someone else to be her contact for you, like an answering service or lawyer? Seeing her twice a year, somewhere public and nowhere near your home, where you can walk away, where you can stay somewhere else overnight and she can't follow you home? Not seeing her again because it isn't worth the pain and the damage to your health, your emotional health, your stress and anxiety, your nightmares?  What do you need? 

Figure it out.  Then we can help you set boundaries.  Then we can help you enforce them.  You are allowed to do this.  I think there are more people who understand than there are ones who don't, now.",1583021031

I guess I can just use a much lower ballpark figure and then increase holding if I can begin to foresee another major medical expense.

Respectgully, I felt you wasnt really able to achieve anything with that pick - but would have been able to do a great deal with something more simple and fitting.

Pudge can but it takes a fair amount of hero specific knowledge and is situational - some could interpret it as griefing at the picking stage. Same with Jakero mid to a degree - your team has no scaling and without a huge snowball to victory you have lost the game.

Humans aren't rational, and you will get toxic responses from frustrated players. Try 'sorry, I'm new, I'm trying my best' and if they continue immediately mute them. Your friend took it a little far pressing for a response imo, and could make it worse.

I help my friends that are new, and they do really well! If you have friends that are experienced at the game, it makes learning 10x easier. There is even a coaching mode that is super helpful.

GnRH agonists used to block puberty include leuprorelin (Lupron) and triptorelin (Trelstar). There are multiple studies pointing to GnRHas lowering IQ and negatively impacting brain function in general.

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00044/full#B6

Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) have been found to impair memory in adults, so the study by Wojniusz et al. (2016) on the possible cognitive effects of these drugs on children treated for idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) represents an important contribution to research in this area . . . Recent findings that GnRHas increase depression symptoms (Macoveanu et al., 2016) and slow reaction time (Stenbæk et al., 2016) in healthy women, and reduce long-term spatial memory in sheep (Hough et al., 2017) underline the importance of the research that Wojniusz et al. (2016) have undertaken. Girls treated for CPP with triptorelin acetate were tested with the short form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III.

It was found that the girls had a mean IQ of 94, as against a mean IQ of 102 for the matched control group (Wojniusz et al., 2016). These IQ estimations are presented as standardized IQ scores, which places a girl scoring 102 at the 55th percentile, and a girl scoring of 94 at the 34th percentile. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=27462292

+

The findings of Wojniusz et al. (2016) can be compared with those of a 2001 study in which 25 children treated for early puberty with triptorelin acetate were tested with the short form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Mul et al., 2001). In this longitudinal study, children took the IQ test before treatment and again after 2 years of treatment. It was found that their IQ dropped 7 points from 100 to 93.With 25 treated participants, this 7 point drop was significant (p = 0.002).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=11683207

Single person study of effects of puberty blockers on 12-year-old shows IQ drop of 9 points in 15 months

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694455/

But wait, there's more...

Staphorsius et al. (2015) conducted a study in a GD adolescent group under hormonal suppression to investigate the impact of pubertal suppression on executive function (EF). They compared GD adolescents under GnRHa treatment to GD adolescents undergoing physiological puberty and compared them to male and female control groups. They used the Tower of London test and found a negative impact of pubertal suppression on EF. However, they also associate this outcome with a lower IQ before GnRHa treatment.

Additionally, a global IQ decrease (WISC-III) was reported in a longitudinal follow-up of girls with central precocious puberty (Schuerger and Witt, 1989) treated with GnRHa.

Finally, a third study correlated verbal skill impairment to pubertal suppression in a GD group (Costa et al., 2015).",1583021033

The S22 to Appenzell used to be the same trains that still run on the S24 from Gais to Altstätten, although they used a newer low floor cab car. It was a proper narrow gauge rail. When they connected them they had to get new street certified vehicles, so they got a tram that has already been proven suited for regional operations. This was somewhat easy, as the swiss law only knows „Schienenfahrzeuge“ (rail vehicles).

We had a ton of fun just talking and listening to tunes and then it became this whole “M you should kiss K” and kept snowballing from there so I gave in and did it. Not the worst kiss ever, but I felt horrible. Like we had been used to be made a show of. So I (being the sensitive young soul I was) started crying. 

TLDR; kinda pressured into kissing my crush, kissed her, I cried cause I am sensitive, Aubrey.

You are not an adult, a human and what you call ""AFAB""? If you think you are all that, but not a woman, then it is clear evidence that you define woman as something else than adult human female. 

&gt;What does that have to do with you?

Your definition of woman is naturally relevant to everyone you call a woman. And we know you consider woman something else than adult human female, you refer to a gendered thing, thus it makes it relevant to all adult human females who don't want to be genderfied in this way.

&gt;The terms you use for yourself personally to describe your own personal lived experiences that you have are an insult to me."" 

I don't consider myself a woman with the definition you use and that should be something you should be able to empathize with as you also find it objectionable to be called a woman with the definition you adhere to. I said it would be an insult to be called a woman by you, not that you have already done so. I didn't claim that you would indeed call me and other adult human females women without first asking for permission to genderfy them.

Yes, don't apologise and for fuck's sake don't let her back into your life, if she was that bad to you when you were in a relationship she's probably just going to revert back to man shaming and attacking you over your gender again constantly.

She doesn't have 'misogyny sensors' though I'm sure that's what she told you, she's clearly just a garden variety feminist that constantly attacks men and you happened to be her target because you were in a relationship with her. I can't stress it enough, stay away from her no matter how much she begs you and stay away from women like that generally. 

It's difficult to gauge sometimes whether or not this is a widespread problem I think because of how much this behaviour pisses off anybody with any sense but one thing I can say for sure is that men generally now are avoiding all contact with women with this sort of mentality. The only reason she's acting all upset is because she probably has just realised what she's lost but if she's spewing that kind of nonsense about the patriarchy she's probably that indoctrinated it's conflicting with her personal life a lot and that is very common with feminists. Oh and as an extra note, if she had actually been taking gender studies and doing that shit seriously, that's a big no no, avoid women like that at all costs.",1583021036

"MaladaptiveDreaming","t5_2ys3w","I’m currently 18 and the description of how you daydream matches my experience almost entirely, the pacing, listening to music and the obsession with actors etc.   

My father is Muslim and my mum doesn’t really have any kind of religion. Although my Dad does hold some religious values like modesty and sobriety, he doesn’t really live a committed religious life. He would tell my sisters and I off for dressing a certain way and is always uncomfortable with the mention of us being around boys.   

I think at time I did feel ashamed for the way I dressed though that came from not just his reactions but other family members who aren’t religious. My parents never really had a relationship but spilt in a very chaotic way when I was about 15. There was some abusive actions involved and I feel as though that whole situation pushed me to daydream even more. I can’t recall daydreaming before the age of about 10 but I probably started before. I had a twitch when I was younger which looking back may have been part of my daydreaming.

I think it has been a way of dealing with loneliness as I only ever confided in 1 friend what happened with my family. I have always felt slightly left out in my family, being the third child out of four, and quite shy and I introverted. At the moment I much prefer daydreaming than anything else and constantly find myself making excuses to avoid social situations so I can continue daydreaming.  

I had therapy for a couple of months to deal with the breakdown of my family and there was some concern as to whether my siblings and I had depression. My mum has had it for as long as I can remember so I guess they thought we were more susceptible.   

I think my main mental health issue is probably anxiety related, although I can’t be sure as I have never been officially diagnosed. I have fainted giving presentations or when under social pressure in public, my whole body will start shaking and my heart will race when I have to speak to any kind of authority or even just give my opinion sometimes.  Recently I have also found myself bursting into tears after having a normal conservation with a teacher, because I build it up so much in my head and can’t stop thinking about how it will all go wrong. That being said as I am not diagnosed with anything it might just be general teenage anxiety.",1583021037

I only listen to instrumental music since I'm a music lover and a musician. Here's a few of the best albums I like to listen. This is mostly jazz and fusion, and it's the best thing to hear when tripping, I've done the test with a lot of people. If you want to trip-sit, you should try a few of those

Kind of Blue -Miles Davis     
Theatre by the sea -Janek Gwizdala     
Thrust -Herbie Hancock     
Quintessence -Bill Evans (You can skip Bassface, but it's funny if you're in a funny mood)      
Out of the Loop -Brecker Brothers     
Got a match -Chick Corea     
Skiptracing -Mild high club     
Still Life (Talking) -Pat Metheny     

I think you need to stay clear as much as possible from anything expressing rage, fear or other negative emotions. Mahler's fifth symphony is also a good thing you would like to hear on psychs, along with most of what Chopin did. 

I hope you give these a shot! Have fun",1583021038

They have ATMs on campus in the Campus Store and Statler Hall, and branches in the Campus Store and several around Ithaca.  As a local operation, they handle students all the time. And best of all, they are not for profit, so they don't have lots of fees and surcharges like the big commercial banks do, because they're not paying huge executive salaries, stockholder dividends,  building sports stadiums, massive advertising campaigns, etc.  I didn't understand credit unions when I first moved to Ithaca, but learned that they are usually much, much better for the average consumer.

Nearly all animals are alike in this sense. 

Also it doesn't contradict itself that men do have lower standards, as when they have sex they don't take the risk of a commitment to a child like a woman does(especially in the days before abortion and birth control), but that doesn't mean they don't prefer that a woman has been with less partners.",1583021039

"findapath","t5_2wqq6","I don’t remember writing this. Seriously though, I’m also 27, have had spine surgery, have bad joints, and heart issues too. I thought about but never applied for disability because I feared my issues aren’t “sufficient” individually. I also want to be an author, amongst many things. I’m sorry this is *really* long, but I’m hoping sharing my own experience may help you feel less alone in this at least. Take your time to respond; I understand if you don’t.

I used to have panic attacks constantly, and I still sleep way too much. I was prescribed a low dose of lamotrigine by my psychiatrist as a ‘mood stabilizer,’ so I don’t have as much anxiety as before; depression’s still here, but the lamotrigine also seems to help with my perception of pain which in turns the volume of depression down a bit. I don’t get out much so anxiety attacks are infrequent, but they still happen.

I had a “part time” 9-5 (4x a week) and it absolutely wrecked me physically. Don’t know how I did it for so long. I’m sell handmade jewelry online but I kinda hate it because I feel my jewelry is ‘untrendy’ and the marketplace just sucks. It doesn’t feel worth the effort because trying to sell has killed my enjoyment for making jewelry. I wanted to apply for disability but I don’t think I’m “disabled enough.” This makes me feel like such an outsider, one that society doesn’t acknowledge. I feel so guilty for being a burden on my family and partner, and I beat myself up over not doing better by them. (The way to avoid this is to be “selfish” and do what’s best for *you* instead of others. Help them and spend time with them because you know you will be a bit happier for it. As it turns out these things aren’t mutually exclusive.)

As for writer aspirations: I’ve been slowly working on my story - mostly just thinking about it nowadays, but I’ve also started reading a bit about how publishing works whenever I come across it online. Also, reading examples of bad storytelling gives me confidence that if *they* can get published, so can I. I still don’t have a lot of hope about it but if it ever does become a real possibility down the road, I feel like I’m preparing myself a bit. When I have a good, random thought or line for the story, I jot it down on my phone or someplace random to find later and think, “wow that was deep/what the heck does this even mean.”

I also want to start streaming games and making videos but I’m daunted by the setup and putting in a lot of mental work only to risk feeling embarrassed. Still, I’m passively (begrudgingly) learning about it and thinking about a video idea or what kind of streams I would want to do. I’m about to buy a phone arm thing so I can point my phone camera directly down at my desk to record... something. Streaming is a more nerve wracking thought - I know I’d enjoy it but it kicks my anxiety into high gear. 

Between anxiety and painful fear of wasted effort, it’s really hard to start, but just thinking about it - starting to start - and trying to be hopeful without negatively twisting it back in to myself makes me feel a little braver as time goes on.

Day to day tasks, I’m working on encouraging myself to do ‘five second tidies.’ When I’m walking through a room I need to clean, I note the little easiest things I ought to do. Recycle a bottle, wipe off a coffee stain, straighten a pile of papers, put the thing back its drawer, catch that one dust bunny. It builds a tiny checklist that starts kinda fulfilling itself, because I’m training myself not to dwell on why it got that way in the first place. Little improvements to your environment will make you feel a little better temporarily - it just relies on reframing a bit so you can work on appreciating the simplest good things and littlest accomplishments.

Making the bed is a good one because it’s an accomplishment to promptly enjoy afterwards, and it makes a messy room look instantly better. Something else I’ve been encouraging myself to do is sit myself up as as I wake up - it’ll help prepare your blood pressure for being awake and may make you feel a bit more feisty for tackling your day. I still find myself flopping back in bed and going on my phone, but I feel a small sense of quasi-anxious urgency to “proper” get out of bed.

Do not feel guilty about naps. Naps happen for a reason. Idk what the reason is. If I don’t want a nap because I don’t deserve it, I’ve been trying to do a five second tidy and tell myself I’ve earned it, even if I *still* don’t feel like I did. Even if it’s just tossing things in arms’ reach in the general vicinity of the trash can. Next time I wake up, I go, “ah, that simple thing I half-assed,” and finish the job.

I’m working on taking care of my body with stretches and decent nutrition. I *could* do so much better, but I gotta build my momentum slow and steady, otherwise I’ll risk hurting myself physically and tiring out mentally.

I’m taking the babiest of babysteps with myself, and I hope that something I’ve said might help you improve your daily life. It’s slow going since we’re kinda just bushwhacking our way through a swampy jungle with depressed machetes and ouchy bodies. We constantly see people around us on clearer paths and it’s too easy to freeze up, get jealous of them, and mad at ourselves. 

Just knowing I have to hack out my own path, even though I detest the fact and never wanted to, helps me remember that my existence is my own. It’s not comparable to others and it’s not fair to do that to myself. Theoretically, I can stop or go back, but I know that won’t make things better in any big or small way for my future self. Metaphorically, I’m hoping my path opens up to a gentle riverbank so I can follow it naturally. 

I’m not perfect at following my own advice. I have days where I can’t not hate myself and the sorry lump I’ve become. I’m trying to turn that self-loathing into “sticking it to myself,” and being my own cheerleader for the smallest accomplishments. When I need to feel bad, I let myself feel bad - downward spirals of ‘feeling bad about feeling bad’ are temporarily allowed and then kicked out. I don’t want to be this way. The only way to not be this way, is to try. The easiest way I can try is just gently nudging myself along.

I’m so sorry this is long as heck - writing this has made me feel iffy and worried, but I know I want to respond to this. I’ve been thinking about writing my own post on exactly this.  I’m also really sorry if this comes off as a “lol just be happy” type thing. I don’t mean to preach either - I’m just sharing my own experience on working on getting out of this swamp. Ahh. If you ever need someone to talk to, I’ll do my best for you. Us lost swamp-folk gotta look out for each other because it’s so hard to do when we’re too afraid to speak up and be known.",1583021039

See Emily Play was a big hit, but you don’t hear it on the radio nowadays like many of the band’s chart toppers, so I think there is merit to the idea of them being perceived as dated.

I do wish that Syd continued his solo career though. He was a gifted, albeit erratic, songwriter and creative mind who I think still had his best work ahead of him. The Madcap Laughs is a brilliant album in its own right with its raw style and influence on avant-garde music. Barrett was good as well",1583021040

\- Being polite. 

\- Remember what is important to their partner (birthday, names of important people in her life, favorite foods/whatever). Listen to what their partner is saying and doing.

\- Be respectful of all people regardless of sex, gender, race, ability, sexual preference, etc.

\- Respect physical boundaries. This shouldn't be needed to be said.

\- Attempting to show they care about what their partner or friends do. They show sympathy if someone in their partner's life dies even if that person wasn't a nice person. They show interest in what their partner likes and doesn't expect their partner or friend to immediate want to join whatever hobby.

\- They don't defend creeps or shitty men (or women).

Exceptional: This all depends on the person. Like, my partner is a snarky, particular social worker who loves cats and has the same sense of humor as I do. Not every woman is gonna love him. That said, I do. We have similar values, similar hobbies, and similar senses of humor.

I know he loves me because he'll brush off my car in the morning before he leaves for work or he'll make me an egg in a basket for breakfast. He knows my moods and personality well enough to know when I could use a pick me up cocktail or bath bomb on a hard day. He listens to everything I say and can remember details about specific students or clients I have or what happened in the Bachelor. We can talk for hours about anything and conversation has yet to have a lull. He takes what I need into consideration and asks my opinion on important decisions. We have a thousand inside jokes and make each other laugh all the time. When we didn't live together, he'd go out of his way to see me.

We just click. He's a good person with a great family and is loyal to a fault. I never have to worry about his intentions because he's a very honest, transparent person. He tries to build me up and sticks up for me when he feels like I'm not being treated fairly.",1583021042

I'm trying to get the pi to output GPS coords \*at least\* on the command console.

This sony DVD/VCR has hdmi output

Review : https://www.crutchfield.com/p_158SLVD570/Sony-SLV-D570H.html

[This little cutie](https://i.imgur.com/hSwUDj0.jpg) is bluray/vcr combo! I didn't know these existed. It's only $2,500 on Amazon. Came out in 2010 and ""up converts"" vhs tapes to 1080p. Sounds like a gimmick but the reviewer seemed impressed with it.

&gt;I noticed how color bleed was virtually non-existent, video noise was dramatically lower and black levels appeared richer than they ever had before...Again, this ain't Blu-ray, but it may be the best your VHS tapes have ever looked or will ever look.


Review: https://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/Panasonic_DMP-BD70V_VHS_Blu-ray_Player.shtml


So that's kinda cool. I'd like to see how terrible it would look on a 65 inch 4k TV lol. 

I'm assuming a tv/vcr/dvd combo unit with hdmi doesn't exist. All of those combo units were known to break down faster than separate units and repairing them was absurdly expensive (like more expensive then the unit itself). So, good riddance. But... it would be fun if it existed.

Edit: oh i forgot to mention lol. I've used an rca converter (well.. My reciever) to play ps2 san Andreas on a 4k 65 inch tv. It was even auto up converting and it did indeed look like ass. My Dreamcast with the proper setup looks freaking amazing though.",1583021044

The fucked up part is I did it to help with an issue where I couldn't finish during sex. I know of wasn't death grip as I had no issues finishing with a flesh light, but still wanted a break to see if it'd fix it.

It didn't help at all. Seven months no porn or jerking off and it didn't do a damn thing. So I went back to jerking off and living my life, sex aint worth the hassle anymore.",1583021044

"TheWattsCase","t5_276ejo","I'm only suspicious that DA Rourke might have been under pressure to close the case as quickly as possible. We have to ask the question - what if Chris had not agreed to a plea deal? It was Chris who made the decision to take a plea - not Rourke. If anyone should be under suspicion for coercing Chris it would be his defense attorneys. To coerce Chris his attorneys would have had to have been complicit.

We also have to keep in mind Rourke could have made himself famous on this one. (Think Juan Martinez of Arias fame.) A once in a lifetime opportunity. That had to be pretty tempting. Way more tempting than temporarily kowtowing to an oil company. (Although there's always the possibility of Cayman Island bank accounts. LOL!)

I would be REALLY suspicious had Rourke given up anything on this case. Had he dismissed or lessened the charges I'd be the first one screaming foul. I'd have led the pitchfork and torch charge right into his office. But he didn't.  All he traded was the death penalty which we all know is worthless in Colorado anyway.

Rourke put him away under a plea deal too. Next to no possibility of an appeal. Ever. Nice.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","(Mind that this has in mind my own version of the 14th Doctor which has a very specific marketing idea behind it)

We follow as we see a girl is piloting a burning TARDIS and is trying to escape from a different time lord all together. She lands on Earth and goes on the run. She meets up with some UNIT undercover agents and they assume she is The Doctor and we follow them for the rest of the first episode near the end she is revealed that her name is ""The Master""  but when asked if she knows who The Doctor is they are only met with a puzzled look. 

By the end of the first episode we find out who the 14th Doctor is. By the second episode he learns that her name is ""The Master"" and when asked about number of incarnation she replies 1st. They soon find her TARDIS which has stopped functioning but The Doctor is capable of examining it. Soon enough the other timelord shows himself and ever so casually mentions his name ""The Valeyard"" The Doctor gets out from the TARDIS and (in a bit of defeat) uses the Sonic on them. Finding out that they don't have the same biology as he does plus a load of unknown energy surrounding them and quickly suspects that they are from a different universe. 

After a lot of running around and fighting The Valeyard they soon find out that some universes have started to collide with each other by a Omniversal force.

Tbf the first series would really be a set up for the second series which has both The Doctor and The Visioner (as she decides to rename herself to future proof any possible encounters) trying to understand how to fix it and then in the second series would be the actual fixing. Trust me there's a lot behind this to the point of it requiring an entire video to fully explain it",1583021046

"castiron","t5_2s8x6","Today I went to the second day of the auction in Leroy, IL that u/jmda90 went to yesterday.  It was a long sale with over 550 items sold (and way too many lots of ""buyer's choice"").  I'm pretty worn out but I'm sure not as tired as the auctioneer who worked from 9-3 non-stop!

There was quite a lot of iron and I managed to win some of it: a W. C. Davis waffle iron, an Orr Painter &amp; Co. waffle iron (size 6/7), a Favorite waffle iron and #9 skillet lid, a Shaeffer flop griddle (unmarked except for patent date but thanks to u/dougmadden, I can now find information like this https://patents.google.com/patent/US411619), a Wagner square egg skillet, and a Griswold sad iron and stand.

I bid on but lost out on a pretty exciting lot - half of a Griswold rabbit cake mold and the extender piece that ended up going for $500! I talked to the high bidder after the sale and she was willing to max out at 700 so there was no way I would have won the bid.

For starters, Lili has a very standard punishment and while-standing punishment game which are very easy to execute and follow through, compared to Zafina's, and we can agree on that. However, the whole gist of what I'm trying to point out here is that if Zafina is better than Lili overall as a character, and it's probably not by much as you think.

For this sakes argument, of saying whether Zafina is better than Lili or not, and vice-versa, we'll use this context. So, let's compare their poking game. And this is also where it gets tricky, because what's considered a good move to you, might be a terrible move for another person. And, largely the selection of moves used depends on the match-up, character knowledge, reactions of both players, etc.

But, we'll just try to make this as simple as possible. We can't be writing a whole book here now could we? So, let's pick any low, like... Zafina's b1+2. This move is considered one of Zafina's top moves, but it's launch punishable, steppable, and only deals 12 damage. Now, let's pick another low, Zafina's d2; which is -15 if she doesn't go into stance, and -13 during. Another low would be d/b3, which is safe on hit and block, and can go into her scarecrow mix-up game. Then she has W/C d/f3, which is -26 on block but looks really similar to d3 so it can be difficult to punish properly; it also has some decent follow-up. Then there are a couple of other lows that I didn't name that aren't from stance, but are generally not considered low pokes. Alright, so what is it that I'm getting at here? Basically, aside from these low pokes mentioned, most of her other pressuring lows and mix-ups come from the usage of her stances. This is both a double-edged sword for both players. It's like that video posted on this sub a couple of hours ago called ""All you need to know about Kazuya's Vortex"" or something like that. This forces a mix-up which can take a bit of some guesswork and a bit of luck. But, it's not like an in-experienced player would know that if they didn't know how Zafina works, hence why she'd seem stronger than she really is against those without the character knowlege. In conclusion, what makes Zafina dangerous is her mix-up game from stances, and you can nullify that if you're aware of it.

Since this is a discussion about who is better, and there are way too many moves and situations to compare, we'll keep this one short and on this one aspect: low pokes not from stances. Lili's d1 is a quick low poke with extension and high crush, and only -11 on block. Lili's d3 low poke is akin to Negan's d/b4, and it has some good range to it, plus is relatively safe at  -12 on block. F,f3 people is only somewhat reactable at i22, but if landed, it's a chunky low for 23 damage, +4 on hit, +9 on CH, and only -11 on block. Lastly, there's Lili's W/C d/f3 low which is launch punishable at -18 on block and i23, but with a vastly superior W/C d/f2 mid mix-up to mix-up opponents. So, that's pretty much all of her low pokes with some few low extensions here and there from her jab strings and ws 1,2,4 (which does 51 damage if the opponent is unaware while using an i13 ws punishment), etc. 

On paper, Lili has better and safer low pokes from the neutral. Plus they all help her close the gap with her opponent and to start using her other moves to pressure her opponents. But that's for another time and place. You'd be surprised at what strengths a character has just by hitting the lab with them instead of comparing. Anyway, this discussion can get very long and I hope this could serve as one instance out of many.",1583021046

4. Jake Hager vs Dustin Rhodes- Jake Hager wins to make him look strong. 

5. Nyla Rose vs Kris Statlander- Nyla wins clean. 

6. Hangman and Kenny Omega vs Young Bucks- Young Bucks win. I predict Hangman will act like a dick and won’t tag out, which will lead to Kenny Omega walking out on him. Hangman won’t be able to win a 2 on 1, so the Bucks win. 

7. Cody vs MJF- MJF wins after Arn either turns on Cody or does something to accidentally cost Cody the match. 

8. Chris Jericho vs Jon Moxley- Moxley gets the win despite interference from the Inner Circle. Moxley celebrates with the fans as the show goes off the air and Jericho throws a tantrum.",1583021046

- Paperpals, if you wanna include them. They were characters in FNaFWorld, so they may count? There's also a second set of them from FNaF6.

- On the topic of FNaF6 if you wanna get to the even more vague characters you coudl include the ones like Gumball Swivelhands, or Music Man

- Glamrocks. I thought maybe it was due to them not having a canon design in color yet (and it may actually be), but Vanny also doesn't really have one but she's included

- If you wanna bring some more FNaFWorld rep in, maybe consider Mendo? He was the big purple endo who upgraded your partys endoskeletons

- Also I believe his name is 'Grimm Foxy' (with two m's)

- There's also Bite Victim from FNaF4 (or older brother if you believe MikeVictim)

- Withered Golden Freddy

- There was also Shadow Freddy from FNaF3, but it depends on if you think he's just Shadow Freddy or a different ('phantom') variant

- You could also maybe include other endos like the Nightmare endo (he was in Help Wanted, using Nightmare Fredbear's endo model), or the springlock endo maybe?

Just some random suggestions! Feel free to use them if ya want, if not no worries obviously! Excited to see what you have planned bc I've been craving a good FNaF rpg ever since FNaFWorld tbh. :)",1583021046

It would explain why cops stay outside, why the perps are shooting people while telling them they will die anyway from a live bomb - even why there were two bombs, and give the plan a bit more of the focus on cops you seem to find lacking in the usual story. Even on the usual story you have the car bombs and the potential shootout.",1583021047

The input goes into a PIC18 ADC, and with a stable input (e.g. both inputs tied together with a jumper) I'm only getting a variance of +- 1 on the ADC.  I'll call that a pretty big win.

this is EXACTLY how the F-4D manual discribes the gunpods, but not the Nose gun for the F-4E, because that gun is NOT boresighted along the FRL.

Have you ever been bullied, teased, or had someone’s expectations pushed on to you because you did or didn’t fit a certain stereotype?


Definitely, I have. I definitely fit the ‘quiet girl’ stereotype in seventh grade. It made me an easy target for verbal harassment and I got many questions such as: ‘do you ever talk?’ Or ‘Why don’t you speak more?’




How do you feel sexual orientation plays into female stereotypes? Does it exclude you from them? What are some stereotypes that are specific to your sexuality?


I feel like the most common stereotypes that fit into my sexuality are the ‘basically straight girl’ or the ‘overly promiscuous girl’ and once people figure out my bisexuality is so one sided I could be lesbian, it turns into the ‘artsy queer girl’ stereotype which I actually don’t really mind. Some  bi girls I know are totally fine with being labeled as promiscuous. It’s only negative when you give it negative connotations.






How do you feel about slut-shaming and virgin worship?


I feel like virgin worship shouldn’t be a thing. I agree that there is a certain age you should and shouldn’t be loosing your virginity, but once you are mature, that type of pleasure is yours to enjoy and nobody should shame you for not being a virgin.

"DeathStranding","t5_3f19t","I’m gonna have to disagree with you here. Ziplines take only 500 “Points.” Other Structures require more but I didn’t have to create any (hence me not remembering actual numbers). But more on that in a minute.

In my experiences I’ve had no issue building Ziplines outside of someone else’s odd placement. Part of it is that I pretty much have all Locations at 5 Stars, allowing for greater Coverage, and work with others who have set up lone Ziplines in spots where you can build upon them. There was no way I could have accomplished this when I first acquired the PCC Upgrade allowing for construction. Or alone for that matter.

I have the entire Eastern Region covered between all Stops featuring Level 02 Structures with a solid helping of Level 03 Structures. The Mid Region is all but covered with the exception of it’s own Southeast: The Timefall Farm up to the Weather Station needs coverage. It’s all set otherwise. I’ll also add in that scouting these Areas was equally interesting and fun traversing. I also didn’t have to build my own Postboxes, Generators, Bridges, Shelters or Resting Areas. There were plenty of them provided allowing for Zipline coverage.

All of this took a lot of time for me to fully implement but the result was so damned worth it.",1583021049

Montessori preschool classrooms are age 3 through 6 in the same classroom. I was in that, my kids are in that, there were no problems as a result. 

Have you considered letting her stay in this daycare an extra year instead of starting school the minute she's eligible? I think being the youngest kid in class for her entire educational career would affect her negatively much more than being a 5-year-old in the same classroom as some 3 and 4-year-olds. If you give her an extra year to mature, the ADHD and dyslexia (which she might not even get) might be less disruptive just because she'd be more mature.

And not to mention, with the money you save on daycare, in her last year there you could afford some really cool educational activities for her outside of preschool time.",1583021050

My father was an insurance salesman and that works where the company will cover half the cost of the rent &amp; computers and such but the agent pays the rest. Best rate he could get from the company he was working from which was required of course, was $1000/month for him and mom. 

Larger companies can negotiate better rates but they're still paying a lot and that's why that guy is only making $12.50 in part. 

I quit a job and used Cobra for a couple of months so I paid what my employer, the county was paying. Over $600/month for a single   person. IIRC last time I checked my current employer was paying $7-750 per month &amp; I pay a little on top of that each paycheck.

"news","t5_2qh3l","He needs to be in a mental institution or penalized in some way, and I’m sure people want to kill him cause he’s gross and all that, but i don’t see that as a viable solution to stopping the other weirdos out there. Also, you can’t just kill someone for the reason that they do not benefit society. You can ostracize them and not be their friend, and make fun of them on the internet, but their death won’t be a fitting conclusion to stabbing a needle with semen in the buttocks of a stranger.

What we really need is to understand why he did this- I’m guessing he targeted women. From that, we can try and solve the overarching problem, which may not be simply weirdos like him, but other people who try to take out sexual frustration or misogyny in a dangerous way. 

Let’s put it another way. Harvey Weinstein and dozens of others have been accused and some convicted of sexual assault. They were never going to the get the death penalty. So just cause this guy is weird, since instead of rape he pricked someone with semen-stained needle, doesn’t mean he should die. Who knows maybe he will get better, and find consensual ways of giving away his semen. I don’t know. I think death should be reserved for high priority targets in which continued existence would continue to cause death and strife.

"MarvelStrikeForce","t5_4bjjb","I would drop Rocket for every node without Deadpool. When you start a node, don’t use Fury’s ult, just stick with his basic until your side is full of Ultron minions, then press auto. He won’t use his ultimate if the battlefield is full, and he will act as a positive effect battery for Ultron on nodes where you can’t consistently kill every turn. Rocket is good, but Minn-Erva and Ultron deal more than enough damage for a tankless setup.

On the nodes with Deadpool, I would rather have Rocket than Fury because being able to slow him immediately after he takes his turn and then lock him down with Accelerator’s basic attack basically turns him into a non-issue.

That being said, it hardly matters. You can drop anyone not named Minn-Erva and you’ll be able to complete it now that you have the shiny boi on your side.",1583021052

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Why would parents have to agree to it?  Do you believe that parents should have to agree to their pregnant child receiving an abortion, or do you believe the child should be able to get it anyway?  Because the general (progressive) consensus is that they shouldn't need their parent's permission, and that if you disagree, then you just want to take away their bodily autonomy/prolong the child's suffering by making them carry out an unwanted pregnancy.

So, then, how do you plan to hold onto a tenuous (and currently nonexistent) restriction that the parents must consent, when everyone is shouting in your face that you just want to take away peoples' bodily autonomy and want to prolong the suffering of depressed children?

Further, what if the parents are abusive or abandoning?  What if you're an extremely concerned uncle, or cousin, or even just friend, and someone dear to you is deeply depressed and suicidal, in part because of neglect from their parents -- then you believe it's not only justified for the child to commit suicide, but also MORALLY WRONG to attempt to stop them?  Because then you're just trying to prolong their suffering?

When we dispense with the sacredness of life, so many things snowball out of control.  The progressive stance is literally swerving from *'save potential victims of suicide' to 'if you prevent suicide, you just want to violate peoples' bodily autonomy and prolong peoples' suffering.'*  These are not obscure, slippery-slope scenarios.  Youth are depressed in record high numbers now, and many students would simply 'opt-out' of life, and you'll be considered controlling and reprehensible for insisting that this is wrong.  How do you resolve these sorts of scenarios?",1583021052

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","Because I hate Leif and don’t have any desire to use him. 

I’d rather a unit with good fodder wins and Edelgard beats him by a HAIR. Her C skill is one of the the only buffs that works on solo units that run off and do their own thing. 99% of buff skills require you to be grouped together so if you use Galeforce Tibarn or Legendary Ephraim or whatever, you can finally fully optimize them. Leif gives a crappier version of B!Camilla’s A skill. 

Ideally the winner will be a character that will be useful for people who want to use the hero, and people who want to fodder the hero. But some of y’all are so damn focused on “I want a winner that I personally can use in battle” to think of it that way. You said it yourself!

I was a 6'2"" as a freshman in high school, and played 3 sports all 4 years. That meant my understanding of portion sizes was ""how much fits on my plate?"" And even then I'd probably get 2nds. That works great when you grow like a weed and excersize 2hrs a day, but not so much when you start cooking for yourself. Hit college and my weight ballooned--even though I was still decently active.

  


Learn to evaluate how much you really need on your plate to feel full. I did intermittent fasting for a month--not to lose weight, but because it taught me how to feel a little hungry without reaction-eating 1500 calories.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree. It's a branding and categorization tool. I don't care if the ship is canon or not, don't care if you call it slash or male/male romance or yaoi or BL or gay fic, but if I'm in the mood to read about two boys (or girls in the case of fem!slash)  boinking, I want the fic to be categorized that way so that I'll be able to find it easier. 

Like, you're not gonna stop calling Sci-Fi Sci-Fi just to stop it from being overlooked by ""literary fiction"" snobs.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Okay, quick clarification question so are you thinking for a new dog way down the line or post (sad topic but...) current dogs passing, possibly switching current dog out, or having getting an additional dog now. In 20 you said no but just a curiosity on my point. Now to my personal answer I would recommend a blue heeler or red heeler (same dog different coats) they are hearding dog because of this they tend to try to be more alpha pack leader and may try to establish dominance with dogs that they are around for a while but I wouldn't describe it as agression. So, I've never had one myself, however, a friend of mine/hiking buddy had one and its in your medium dog size desire. Max was the pups name he was super smart, loyal, followed commands well, handle being alone when my buddy was in college classes or at work, overall pretty great dog. Max was a great hiker too, great off leash, was great meeting other dogs on trail or leaving them alone if we wanted to keep moving, handled being picked up and lowered down on the occasion when needed. He was great in appartment living as well trained to only ""go"" outside and didn't bark with exception to alert my buddy if someone knocked. However, and I cannot reinforce this enough, there is no guarantee if you do get a heeler that it will follow anything I just described. All dogs while they have their base instincts (prey, herding, guarding) their personality is a crapshoot especially if you going to a shelter. That's because if they are a pup you can kinda tweak personality to fit a mold but for adult dogs they generally have an established personality. That being said I commend and agree with your desire to get a dog from a shelter. But yeah a blue/red heeler is my recommendation.",1583021054

All we have or ever will have is *number of deaths/(number of deaths + number of recovered)* I.E closed cases. I’m not trying to be a scientist in this post. I know that mortality rate is a convoluted figure. All I’m saying is what we do have could be emerging data that could be useful. 

It’s most likely only due to Singapore having a gold level response that the western world will not be able to replicate well, as the articles I linked say.

"Slovakia","t5_2qyjb","There's nothing for general audience apart from only the post-velvet revolution era, which is fairly recent. Nothing about the history from say the Slavic migrations into the area in the 5th century onwards.

I can recommend two scholarly books though. One from an excellent Italian scholar Maddalena Betti called [*The Making of Christian Moravia*](https://brill.com/view/title/20594?language=en), which can be gotten for free by other means.

The second book is not available in a PDF, but usually can be bought for between 15-20gbp in paperback. It's Patrick Geary's *The Myth of Nations - The Medieval Origins of Europe*, which is not specifically about Slovakia, but covers a lot of the early medieval history from which the 19th century nationalistic movements across Europe constructed their national identities, including Slovaks.

These two books do offer a great overview of Great Moravia and history of Slovak identity derived from Great Moravia.

‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭14:34-35‬ ‭NASB‬‬

Why would pastors be trying to learn something in church? From this part of his letter he’s instructing all the women to be silent in church. Not just pastors.

I agree I don’t think he was talking about all women throughout all time given other women did. But you coming to that conclusion based on this passage doesn’t make sense. 

Context is important, I agree. Which is what I explain in my post - both historical and the fact that most of these letters were spent critiquing the churches because they weren’t acting how they were supposed to.

Biden shouldn't be rewarded for doing well in a primary that's going to be overwhelmingly +55 in age and mainly African American.

I'm not saying their votes don't matter, but let's face it, they won't be the swing votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin that are going to matter in November. We don't need to celebrate candidates for being victorious in the states they should do well in. We're not going to paint Klobuchar as a contender when she wins Minnesota. Candidates shouldn't be judged by how they do in states where the demographics suggest they should win, they should be judged by how they do in states that don't favor them.

That's why candidates like Sanders should be rewarded for doing well in Iowa and Nevada. Sanders wasn't polling that well with Latinos last time, he earned that support. That's what should be rewarded.",1583021055

I do not rev bomb. I do not purposefully make my bike loud unless you're threatening my life (like merging into me when your beside me).

My bike is only a 300, which is so quiet my parents dont even hear me in their driveway, when they're in their house. I got an exhaust to make it slightly louder, not obnoxiously loud, because if you dont hear my horn you will damn well hear my bike if I rev bomb you (which again, I only do if you're about to kill me).

For all the people being aggressive towards me, consider this. You may hate bikers but not all of us are assholes. Just like bikers may hate car drivers but not all of them are assholes.

"China_Flu","t5_2dar36","Well, I'll give you my two cents.  I live in the Chicagoland area.  We had a case maybe like 50 miles away but so far, nothing that is significant.  Today we had a luncheon/Celebration of Life for my mother in law.  About 120 or so people at a restaurant that was family, friends, or acquaintances.  Now  normally, we don't go out to eat, especially now with influenza b and rotovirus going around.  But being that it was a luncheon for her mom that passed, it was mandatory.  Nobody there looked sick, but I keep thinking about how we just don't know.  We don't know who is and who isn't carrying this.  Maybe we'll get it from there, maybe one of my kids will bring it home from school, maybe something else.  We just don't know.  So why prevent yourself from doing things because you can't miss out on things in life.

  

I look at it that we're all going to get it sooner or later, and that the best thing to do is prepare for it like you would the flu.  I have enough meds on hand at home to treat the flu, so I'm hoping for the best.  And it's not totally floating around us just yet around here that we know of.  Schools and everything else is still open.  

  

What I would suggest to you is go to the party, try to educate your kids on limiting contact with others and not put your hands on your face, and to try to keep your distance with others.  But like me, I'm sure you're going to be freaking and thinking it in the back of your head.

And that's why you should talk about your sex partner about that. Making clear that you losing your erection has nothing to do with him solves one problem: him probably thinking he's not attractive enough for you. And it solves another thing: him thinking you could be weak, because admitting your weakness is actually a sign of being strong.

Tbh it's just a mind thing in a vicious circle. The more you think about it, the worse it gets. The worse it gets, the more you think about it.

You can go to that page in your browser and see how the response looks to understand how you need to parse it. (I recommend using a JSON formatter extension such as [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa).)

Also, I see you're mentioning snekfetch in your comments. Snekfetch has been deprecated a while ago, so you shouldn't use it anymore. So look around for a newer request library (I use [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) myself, but there are many to pick).",1583021058

If you want to help the mushrooms out and defend against mold. Get 3% peroxide and mix it as a 1 to 10 ratio. Spray with this and it acts as an anti mold and helps the mushrooms grow. 

Also you can leave the light on 24/7 it won't hurt the mushrooms in any way. I did this with mine and i got monsters from it.

&gt;The inside story of the secret deal between FIA and Ferrari

&gt;Column by editor-in-chief Christian Nimmervoll: How whistleblowers got Ferrari into trouble and the affair could still cost millions

&gt;Dear readers, it was 15:30 when Mattia Binotto appeared before the press in Barcelona on Friday afternoon. A harmless media event, actually. He repeated many things he had said before. That others were faster than Ferrari, that he did not expect to be able to win in Melbourne. And no, that this was not a bluff, not a low blow. It's the truth.

&gt;Less than three hours later (the FIA e-mail arrived in our inbox at 5:49 p.m. CET on the dot) Ferrari was hit by an earthquake. One with a quite harmless sounding title: ""FIA finishes analysis of Scuderia Ferrari's Formula 1 power unit"", is written in the subject line of the highly explosive document (at the end of this column in the original wording).

&gt;Max Verstappen already put the nasty word ""cheat"" in the mouth in November 2019 with regard to the Ferrari engine. Highly official, during an FIA press conference. And he was reprimanded for it. He was ""immature"" and ""not professional"", Sebastian Vettel, representing the Ferrari camp, fired a verbal volley in the direction of stowing away.

&gt;Now the 22-year-old is rehabilitated.

&gt;**FIA broadcast: What's between the lines**

&gt;There is only one interpretation among experts for the FIA announcement of Friday evening: The Ferrari engine did not comply with the regulations in 2019 - exactly as many suspected anyway. After all, Ferrari voluntarily made a deal with the FIA, which leaves Ferrari in a crooked light on the outside. Even if without a concrete verdict of guilt.

&gt;We deduce from this: Ferrari would never have accepted such a look if they were not aware of any guilt. And one asks oneself now: Why isn't Ferrari being punished? And what is swept under the carpet under the guise of a ""settlement""?

&gt;It is no coincidence that the FIA broadcast was published just ten minutes before the end of the last day of testing. At that time the journalists were busy under high pressure to formulate and distribute their coverage of the most important test day of the winter. And most of the team bosses had long since left the paddock.

&gt;Presumably, those responsible had hoped that no media representative would speak to a team boss in this way until the small Formula 1 community met in Melbourne in mid-March. And that the news would get lost in the headline-driving coverage of the corona virus and possible Grand Prix cancellations.

&gt;We contacted several team principals on their cell phones late on Friday night. Three actually called back - and were quite willing to talk. Nobody wanted to make an official statement. Understandable with such an explosive topic. But what is being told behind closed doors is not far behind the ""Crashgate"" affair in terms of its potential for crime.

&gt;**2019: That's how it all began...**

&gt;The fact that Ferrari casually said ""shit"" was already suspected in 2019, when Ferrari suddenly had the best engine in the field overnight. The competing teams bombarded the FIA with technical inquiries based on their suspicions. And the FIA published a whole series of technical guidelines in response. Initially without any consequences.

&gt;It was only in the autumn, when the Formula 1 circus was in America, that the ""shotguns"" of Red Bull, Mercedes &amp; Co. scored their first direct hit. The FIA eliminated a regulation gray area in terms of fuel flow. How exactly this could have worked, we have already gone into this in our big video review of the year.

&gt;In Abu Dhabi at the latest, the patience of Red Bull and Mercedes was at an end. A secret meeting took place. On Sunday before the race, the amount of petrol on the data sheet sent by Ferrari to the FIA did not match the actual amount of petrol in Charles Leclerc's tank. The FIA let Ferrari get away with a 50,000 Euro fine.

&gt;Over the winter, the matter only calmed down superficially. But behind the scenes the pressure on the FIA to do something increased. The optics, when the suspicions against a team are substantiated but there are no consequences, is inevitably crooked. Especially when the FIA President is Jean Todt and the team is Ferrari.

&gt;Helmut Marko already made it unmistakably clear to 'Motorsport-Total.com' at the end of 2019: ""I assume that such Ferrari escapades will no longer take place next year. If the FIA does not act, Red Bull will become active, he announced: ""If we suspect irregularities again in 2020, we will definitely lodge a protest"".

&gt;**Whistleblowers get the ball rolling**

&gt;In the weeks that followed, two decisive things happened in history. First: Whistleblowers from the Ferrari camp, possibly those who were not fond of Binotto's leadership style or simply did not want to have anything to do with fraudulent activities, provided the investigators with decisive clues that incriminated Ferrari. At least, according to one of our informants.

&gt;At the same time more and more information from FIA circles leaked to some teams. Officially the FIA did not inform the other nine teams at all before Friday evening about the status of the investigations against Ferrari and the planned broadcast. Unofficially some team bosses knew already in December, some not until January: The rope around Ferrari is getting tighter and tighter.

&gt;The FIA, so tell people who should know (and who attach great importance to their anonymity), did not show much interest in accusing Ferrari of fraud in a public way. At best, because they were afraid that they would not be able to provide sufficient evidence for the accusations if it were to go into a tough appeal process.

&gt;In the worst case, because powerful, influential men in the FIA wanted to prevent Ferrari from being damaged. And all this in a highly sensitive phase in terms of sports politics, in which a new Concorde agreement is currently being negotiated. A snuffy Ferrari team threatening to leave the Grand Prix circus would be a catastrophe for the stock market price of Formula One and rights owner Liberty Media.

&gt;**Meetings: Why did Binotto suddenly become tame?**

&gt;Some already suspected at the end of 2019 that dark clouds were brewing over Ferrari. Binotto had always appeared quite self-confident in various meetings until autumn. After that he suddenly became subdued. The change in character coincided with the time when Ferrari suddenly abandoned its reservations about the new rules in 2021 and withdrew the threat of a veto.

&gt;And when Ferrari in Austin, when the first technical rule had been made, suddenly followed on the straights, Binotto suddenly talked about a change of tactics. The set-up had always been based on low air resistance. Now you try it with steeper wings. The lower top speed had nothing to do with the fact that the engine was weakened by an FIA directive.

&gt;Nowadays, some people assume: Binotto already knew at that time that Ferrari would not be able to transfer the engine tricks of 2019 to 2020. And prepared Ferrari's ""alibi"" with such statements.

&gt;On Friday afternoon, less than three hours before the FIA bomb burst, he said: ""As far as the overall performance and the peak power of the engine are concerned, we are not as strong as last year. I don't think anybody will take away the addition, he said, because the focus was on reliability.

&gt;The fact that Ferrari is suddenly losing unusually much time on the straights was already noticed by the competition during the first Barcelona test week. Mercedes still assumed that Ferrari was driving with reduced power. In retrospect, one believes Binotto when he says: ""We are not hiding anything. This is our real performance."" What's being covered up is why the power's suddenly gone.

&gt;**Mercedes press release: Part of an overall strategy?**

&gt;Of course, in retrospect, one can ask oneself whether the Mercedes text in which Ferrari was accused of driving with reduced power was not a nifty attempt to draw attention to the subject. At the latest in Melbourne, when Ferrari cannot improve its performance even in the race, the world would wake up and guess that 2019 could not have been the right year.

&gt;In the larger context of this story, however, that doesn't matter at all. And the strategy of some involved parties to put so much pressure on the FIA in the Ferrari case that President Todt can't afford to do nothing at all was at least partially successful. Even if the official broadcast reads harmlessly: everyone in the industry understands what that really means.

&gt;The FIA seems to be of the opinion that Ferrari is sanctioned hard enough even without official punishment. Water on the mills of those who have always thought that the F in FIA does not stand for Federation, but for Ferrari.

&gt;But on closer inspection Ferrari does not get off scot-free as it seems at first.",1583021059

"bigdickproblems","t5_2sqd6","Big dick and doctor here, so maybe I can give you some insight about your bleeding.

Remember that part of how the IUD works is to create a small amount of inflammation and swelling of the cervical opening (due to a foreign body reaction).  Also remember that most IUD's (other than the copper ones) have hormonal release.  In some women, this can cause endometrial overgrowth.  

Cervical trauma from sex can certainly cause bleeding, but not for 3 weeks.  Bleeding for that long is hormonal or possibly anatomical like fibroids (an ultrasound would rule out fibroids or other anatomic cause).  If your ultrasound is normal, you can try a course of oral depo to ""reset"" the hormonal balance and hopefully stop the bleeding.  However, if it continues, you will need IUD removal and another alternative form of birth control.  I am a fan of the NuvaRing, because in the case of a large cock, it actually acts as a bit of a buttress to stretch the vagina near the cervix, which allows for deeper penetration without the painful stretching.  So in this case it may help with some of the vaginal tearing, as well as copious amounts of lube.",1583021061

I honestly wouldn't go to the after party. Which I think is the reception. 
They might have a wedding venue that has a cap on the number of people that can be there and reached it. Because they didn't know you it was easy to let you go from the list. 
To me being disinvited but hey come to the after party is them trying to get a gift from you. The after party they have to pay for a plate for you (to eat). Say you go and you and your SO bring a joint gift. But she expects you to each bring a gift. I'm not saying that will happen. But I see this happening and I wouldn't want you to go through that (maybe I've read too many entitled threads).
If you are upset about going I would sit SO down and tell him. Be upfront you are upset but if he feels like he wants to go to go. That it won't negatively effect your relationship. 
Another part of me thinks you are invited to the wedding because you mentioned in a reply your SO cheated on you and they don't think your relationship will last. So they don't want you in any wedding photos (even as a guest only). Just a thought.",1583021061

I dont mind spending a bit more for a local product and this stuff is actually pretty nice. Was impressed that the budtender recommended it when they had no Reign Drops in stock.

Did a dropper (1ml) earlier and had a great mellow fun afternoon.  Has a milder weed taste but you'll still be burping weed oil for hours just like any other...certainly not unpleasant to eat straight though - or dose sublingually.

I'm very familiar with edibles and was surprised that this hits so nicely.  One dropper isn't gonna knock my head off, but more than that and I'd definitely be zoomin'.

I assume my admission was a combination of veteran status and high SAT scores (took the SAT near the end of my Army service).

I got mediocre grades in college. Found a good job that played into my strengths (which obviously wasn't ""academic"" things like R&amp;D), put in my time and built on my strengths and maneuvered myself into a niche were I have thrived.

A budget pick is something that can be effective and has a reasonable price. Swampert, rhyperior, machamp, Dragonite and possibly Metagross can all be accessed relatively easily, don't require as much resources or time to raise, and  are all powerful. Even if you can't get your hands on one, a veteran will have no trouble giving you one as long as it isn't perfect or has a legacy/exclusive move. You can't do that with hydreigon (a Pokemon I've never seen in masters), you just can't.

Because they can’t fit well in the Republican Party, I think they tend to cram the whole left-right spectrum into the Democratic Party.

What worries me more are comments about black people being ignorant of which candidate really helps them or whatever. Assuming you know what’s in black voters’ best interests better than they do can be a form of racism itself.

The short of it is that it wasn’t nearly as crowded as I would imagine it would’ve been considering to talk about enthusiasm. Along with that I should add that it could just be a quirk of where I voted but I was easily the youngest person in line by probably 15 years (only 24). Other than that everything ran pretty smoothly except they had a kind of weird voting system where it was basically two steps to cast a ballot which I thought was very strange.

"HidingInMyRoom","t5_3nlhg","True, he makes enough off youtube to stay in cheap airbnb's, eat cheap food, buy a sex worker or two, maybe bamboozle a granny or crazy. But he must flee back to his childhood room as a guy in his 30's so he can leech off his mom and save money for the next discount trip. What has he learned all the years he has done this? Nothing. He will do this rest of his life. And the momentary joy he feels blowing his load in a sex worker or low-tier woman, or buying some thing he will soon tire of, or feeling optimistic like he can get the kind of woman he desires, all these things are momentary and leave him lonely and unsatisfied again. Do you really think Daniel will do anything other than this with his life? Think he'll get some oompf and become an artist? Nope. Fall in love with someone other than himself? Nay, he won't. Know the joy of being loved and admired by another for himself, for his good qualities and accomplishments? Never, he is too toxic.  It will always be this human existence of barely living. Into his 40s &amp; 50s and on, he will repeat this cycle of delusional, discount sex touristing and then returning to leech off his mom so he can save for the next repetitive cycle. This isn't success. It is a hamster stuck in a cage, going round and round on a wheel and getting nowhere. Unlike a hamster, Daniel can change his condition but chooses not to. His choice. So hookers, low-tier hookups with grannies and crazies, and a lifetime of hiding in his room, looking out on other people's happy lives is the soul prison he has chosen. Seconds, leftovers and the rotten discounted things in life that only a minority few would settle for.",1583021069

I'd do shit like excersing, going for a walk , looking over class work etc to try and keep my mind off it and if i got to a point where i really needed to smoke I'd smoke some weed.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face.

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Gilberts in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the balls and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

2. Fortnite is also considered cringe. I don’t know why, it just is.

I’m assuming you’re American and this is a financial concern. Talk to your doctor about doing less visits. They can’t force you to come in.

But there are many other settings that let their ridiculousness blend into the background to focus on the characters. There are many races in Dr Who that would barely be slowed down by most of 40k all combined. A single Culture ship would probably find dismantling Holy Tera and Mars an amusing distraction, and be giddy trying to figure out the chaos incursion after the throne fell. Hell, the Empire in Star Wars could drown each astra milatrum grunt in a hundreds of imperial gaurd bodies, each space marine in tens of thousands of storm troopers, and each ship in a dozen star destroyers, and they can build/recruit them many times faster. 

40k is middling to high in the grand scheme of things, but the way they wear it on their sleeves make them feel a lot higher. 40k's biggest weakness is they're *just* WWII, but **big**, with basically the Necrons being the exception. Much lower tech universes have the hax to mess up some of their factions, allowing them to hit way above their weight.

"r4rDFW","t5_2ta8v","We had to remove your recent post on /r/r4rdfw because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4rdfw).

Finally, please make sure you read the the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","UPDATE: I went to a few stores today to try on a bunch of bras, in part so I have a better idea before I try ordering anything from online companies. (I visited Macy’s, Pink, Nordstrom Rack and a local boutique).

I ended up settling on a 38B, which I know is weird but a 38 band size is exactly the fit I’m looking for. All of the 36Cs I tried on were still too tight.

My boobs are flat (?) on top and full on the bottom, so a lot of the bras I tried on had a bubble of space at the top of my boob or over my nipple. This also true of most lacy bras that are “full” coverage—there is a lot of extra fabric that collapses at the top. I think Demi bras are going to be my best bet.

I did end up purchasing 2 bras I think I’ll like:

Calvin Klein invisibles bralettes in L

Natori feathers plunge bra in 38B

I’m thinking of ordering some True and Co bras now that I’ve gotten a better feel for what size I’m comfortable with.",1583021075
"AskARussian","t5_2xzpo","There were some difficulties with the Chinese in St. Petersburg. For example, not so long ago (I don’t know how now) the Palace Square was always strewn with empty packs of Chinese cigarettes. They just throw trash on the ground. They are very loud, VERY. Not so long ago, a memo was compiled for Chinese tourists to behave properly in Russia, and besides, the Chinese authorities seemed to be preoccupied with this issue, so it is probably already irrelevant.

"history","t5_2qh53","There was a wide variety of opinions before the war; some people were ardent anti-fascists (so wanted the US to join and also thought it was inevitable), some were communists (and so followed the Soviet party line - which was mildly pro-Nazi from 1939 to 1941, and then strongly anti-Nazi once Germany invaded the USSR).  But the majority of people were sympathetic to the UK, more hostile to the USSR, and generally wanted to stay out of it.  It started in China in 1937 and in Europe in 1939 ('38, if you count the dismantling of Czechoslovakia) - so there were multiple years of world war that already passed without the US being involved. 

Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was such a shock because so many people did think they had stayed out so far and thought that would continue, and they hadn't attacked Japan.  

If you look at Roosevelt's third inaugural -  January 1941 - there's no mention of war or Germany or Japan at all.  Just that democracy was swell and America was swell for being a democracy.  Which implied that democracy is important to defend, but it was more of a subtext that American democracy is important to defend and protect.",1583021076

For example, even if its not strictly related to our childhood or our mother, me and my brothers all share heavy Pluto aspects in our chart. Mine is in conjuction to the sun and mercury, my older brother has it in his first house and in conjuction to his rising, my younger brother has it in opposition to his rising in the 7th. 

Even if we all have different charts, personalities, and perceptions of our childhood, I think this placement speaks drastically of what we went through (even if we didn't perceive it exactly the same). 

The three of us also share a moon-saturn relationship (mine and my younger brother in conjuction, while my older brother in opposition). And the three of us also happen to share having sun-moon in the same sign (scorpio-scorpio for me, aries-aries for the older one, pisces-pisces for the younger one). I think this also speaks of a similarity in the three of us in the process of building our identity, even if those identities differ deeply.",1583021076

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","“Ebola” was another example of the classic scare.

The “Ebola “ everyone was concerned about was not actual Ebola.  It turns out that there are families of viruses that share similar properties but not in the same strengths as the others.  An animal world comparison would be Samoyed, husky, malamute, wolf in creasing size and strength.

In our discussion wolf would be Ebola.  The virus in question was Marburg disease, akin to malamute in our discussion.

Marburg disease is not as virulent as Ebola (kills most everyone exposed) but we were led to believe it was.  During time of this scare we were sending troops overseas to West Africa and Nigeria supposedly to help with treating those afflicted, but news reports from over there said we were suppressing an insurrection of some sort that would have otherwise had negative implications here at home.  

To those Wall Street pundits, this was an excuse to hit the markets for a pullback.  And like the Ebola scare, it will go away and no one will remember it much 2-3 years from now.

As for those flus being easily treatable-no.  The US had SARS or MERS a few years ago but like other contagious diseases, failed to report on their presence in the US.  103-4 fever and coughing so much you couldn’t keep up the strength needed to keep coughing.  

The numbers tell the story.  We still don’t have 3000 deaths world wide and the flu season is nearly over, and you note the US had a 60,0000 death count from flus 2017-8 and nothing came of it.

This is yet another hoax designed to scare people.",1583021077

"googlesheets","t5_366bm","Read the comment thread for the solution [here](/r/googlesheets/comments/faz8vi/finding_the_correct_column_scanning_the_dates_and/fj1muru/) 

&gt; The solution in AG7 would be this:
&gt;
&gt;    =QUERY({AK:AM},
&gt;      ""select sum(Col3) where Col1 &gt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(C7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' 
&gt;       and Col1 &lt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(G7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' label sum(Col3) ''""
&gt;    )
&gt;
&gt;But you can't drag it down. If you want to drag it down, it needs to find in row 1 the ticker that is in column B.
&gt;
&gt;    =QUERY(
&gt;      {INDEX(AK:ZZ,,MATCH(B7,AK$1:$1,0)),INDEX(AM:ZZ,,MATCH(B7,AK$1:$1,0))},
&gt;      ""select sum(Col2) where Col1 &gt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(C7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' 
&gt;       and Col1 &lt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(G7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' label sum(Col2) ''""
&gt;    )
&gt;
&gt;For AH7, replace B7 with Z7 (the two of them):
&gt;
&gt;    =QUERY(
&gt;      {INDEX(AK:ZZ,,MATCH(Z7,AK$1:$1,0)),INDEX(AM:ZZ,,MATCH(Z7,AK$1:$1,0))},
&gt;      ""select sum(Col2) where Col1 &gt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(C7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' 
&gt;       and Col1 &lt;= date '""&amp;TEXT(G7,""yyyy-mm-dd"")&amp;""' label sum(Col2) ''""
&gt;    )
&gt;
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;That said, it is highly recommended to put data in columns when you want to sum values like that. The reason is simply that your formulas will be simpler and faster and problems will seem less complicated.
&gt;
&gt;So from this:
&gt;
&gt;||AK|AL|AM|AN|AO|AP|
&gt;|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
&gt;|1|**MO**|||**VQN**|||

&gt;|7|12/23/2013|$0.4800|$0.4800|12/24/2013|$1.0080|$1.0080|
&gt;
&gt;To this in another tab:
&gt;
&gt;||A|B|C|
&gt;|:-|:-|:-|:-|
&gt;|1|**Date**|**Ticker**|**Div**|
&gt;|2|3/13/2013|MO|$0.4400|

&gt;|9|12/24/2013|VQN|$1.0080|
&gt;
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;And then the formula in AG7 would be:
&gt;
&gt;    =QUERY(Dividends!A:C,

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Usually when watching a game you can feel aggrieved by a referee, a player's mistake etc. But most of the time you feel you could take something out of the game no matter how small the positive.

I implore anyone to please watch a Bulls game to see how players just mentally implode. It's baffling to watch professional level rugby player have the utter most brainfart when trying to use a fraction of their brain.

The amount of soft penalties from an attacking team being conceded must be reaching boiling point.

The Bulls players just concede and concede. It's as frustrating and disheartening to watch as it is intriguing.

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","1. No the story hasn’t been aimless at all and you list know reasons on why you think so. I strongly disagree that the “Majority” fanbase agrees with your claim and even if they did it doesn’t make them right. Being in the Majority does not make your claim more valid. Regardless you said the story is aimless so let’s take a look shall we? 

Provisional License Exam: Students need license to fight villains, story arc has a clear aim.

Overhaul Arc: Introduce Yakuza to the mix, foreshadows all might possible end, shows why Deku needs to focus on perfecting his long range attacks, and introduces a potential important character which is Eri. Quirk erasing bullets were introduced.

&gt;!Gentle: Eri is still traumatized, as she should be. Fun arc for her to forget about for just a moment. !&lt;

&gt;!Pro Hero: Of course Hori needs to showcase the Number one hero, now that all mights gone. Regardless  it introduces some of the top heroes, and potentially important characters like Hawks. Also tells the reader the heroes are in for some trouble, if the Number one hero is having trouble with one Nomu.!&lt;

&gt;!Joint Training: Introduces the seven quirks, showcase why Shinso deserves to join the hero course.!&lt; 

&gt;!MLA: Introduces a threat foreshadowed, Shigaraki is now an actual dangerous threat to hero society.!&lt;

2. “Lack of world building”, this is frankly an outrageous claim to make. You seem to be one of the fans who believe world building must mean new countries or new nations!  Take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/bf36yg/why_i_think_horikoshis_worldbuilding_deserves/) 
“There no main objective for either side”
No this is just wrong, the villains in this story are not a a monolithic. They each have there owl individual goals. Stain main objectives was heroes to be classical, with secret identities saving people for the sake of it and not for fame.

Overhaul: Wants the Yakuza to reign over Japan again, and not villains.

MLA: Want free usage of quirks.

Shigaraki: Wants to destroy society. All For One: I can’t say for sure yet.

Gentle: Just wanted to crap on hero society I guess.
Heroes: While they all want to be heroes for different reason , some characters motivations have been explored others not. Mineta: Wants to be cool with Girls.
Kirishima: Is inspired by his idol Crimson Riot and wants to be a man.

“Set in modern hero society”. Also just because the hero’s aren’t supposed to kill villains, doesn’t mean a villain will never be killed in the story. Jedi aren’t supposed to kill unless absolutely necessary, that didn’t stop Anakin from calling unarmed prisoners like Count Dooku, or killing children Tuskin raiders.
There has been no villains to break out so I got no idea why your saying “rinse and repeat”.
 
“Hori doesn’t know how to improve other core cast members like Bakugou without having to resort to some pointless power handoff”. What do you mean by improve, and give some cannon  **examples**  of pointless power hand off. Your last sentence confuses me, nice opinion though.",1583021080

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Avoiding friendships *just* because someone isn't fully vegan yet is pretty damn shitty, surely you could see why that might rub people the wrong way. And just because someone isn't vegan yet doesn't mean they're ""choosing"" to be ignorant and pushing them away from your friendship unless and until they fully transition to pure veganism is only going to do just that, push them away from you and quite possibly veganism in the process.

If that's not what you mean, then idk what you'd mean by not being friends with a non vegan then. If someone was open minded and curious about it, maybe even actively looking to reduce their meat intake but still cautious and taking a long time to fully transition because of all the misinformation they have heard, but in every other way would be a perfect match as a friend, would you deny them your friendship just on that lack of purism alone? I get you're saying you wouldn't socially avoid them entirely but what if they aren't convinced yet but actively want to be your friend and talk about it from time to time?

And I'm not quite sure I get how you're answering my question... Are you saying I'm racist if I like dark humor just because it isn't ""pc""?? 

&gt;Because defensive people like you often make my life a hell

If you aren't disrespectfully comparing people to racists, rather you're claiming equivilence or not, just for not being as dietarily pure as you without knowing a damn thing about our lives or why we might not be entirely vegan yet, then from people ""like"" me you wouldn't have anything to worry about. With that being said I can agree that those that truly refuse to accept the facts and learn are shitty and wouldn't blame you from not associating with them one bit. But I have been rather open minded yet still largely ignorant on this for years now before beginning a change. There is a world of difference between just plain ignorance and active willful ignorance.",1583021081

"Adelaide","t5_2r1ca","If your router was supplied by your RSP, then it may not be as good as you think. Most treat all traffic equally whether it is on WiFi or cabled. The issue with routers is not so much the raw routing bandwidth, but the number of individual connections it can manage. One device doing a speed test can show 96Mbit, but if you've got 4 devices streaming, two iPhones doing iCloud backups, a game client doing a P2P based software update and a computer downloading an automatic software update, it can put significantly more load on a router.

Some cheaper ones also start to slow down if they get too hot, so ensuring they're well ventilated can be helpful.

The other issue is that a lot of people don't actually realise how many devices are actually on their connection. Once you add phones, tablets, computers, TVs, game consoles, streaming devices, smart devices, it can be surprising. The other issue is, as I said before, the slowness may be someone in your household doing something you're not aware of like downloading TV, software, uploading video. Many people are not aware that if you have someone saturating your upload, it can cause issues with downloads/streaming. Reason for this is that the way the internet works for most things, a packet of data hits your device, then your device replies back saying ""yup, got it"" and if the source of the packet doesn't get those acknowledgements, it will stop sending them.

So uploads can include things like live streaming, uploading to YouTube, streaming your gameplay to Twitch, even cloud backups of computers/tablets/phones.",1583021081

The 7th began with another reliever on the mound, this time sophomore David Luethje. Luethje became the first Gator pitcher of the day to throw a 1-2-3 inning, getting the Trojans to ground, fly, and strike out. Ortiz, who pitched 6 innings while allowing 4 runs (3 earned) on 9 hits, did not return in the bottom of the inning. Instead, Troy introduced junior Dalton Wilder as their first reliever. Wilder allowed a single and a walk to his first pair, giving Florida another scoring threat. [Jordan Butler proceeded to sneak a single through the right side](https://twitter.com/GatorsBB/status/1233899723641126912) for another RBI, making it the 5th straight inning in which Florida scored a run. A walk loaded the bases, leading Troy to switch Wilder for senior reliever William Fultz. However, Fultz's first pitch was plopped into center field for an RBI single by Brady Smith. Fultz got the next pair to pop out, but a walk tied the game at 7-7.

"ArtefactPorn","t5_313fb","""Inscriptions often decorated household items, clothing, and textiles in the Middle East and extended areas of the Islamic world, an indication of how religious observance permeated all aspects of life. Encircling the top band of this vessel is a copper inlaid inscription in stylized Kufic calligraphy-one of the most expressive forms of Arabic writing-that bestows a blessing for glory and prosperity.

This mortar would have been made in one casting and then worked afterwards without heat. When the artisan engraved lines on an object's surface, he sometimes left edges of bronze, which would later be inlaid with copper.

In addition, the bronze alloy used to make the body of the vessel would be mixed with lead, making it heavier and more suited to its purpose of grinding material. Almond seed-shaped bosses decorate this mortar's surface.

and interspersed between them the artisan engraved triangular shapes enclosing a vegetal design motif. He rubbed bitumen or some other substance into the engraved decoration to make it stand out.

We do not know what this medieval decorated bronze mortar was used for, but it could have been employed to grind medicinal powders or pigments. Not a common object, it likely belonged to a household of some wealth and status. Its design suggests that it is likely from the eastern region of present day Afghanistan, perhaps in or the near or in the city of Herat, which was known during this period for its inlaid and elaborate bronze vessels.""

I basically only play enough to clear every event and daily mission and I'm only missing tsum which were last available before I started playing - which, as of this moment, is three tsum. Out of 295. Three.

Also, assuming that you've been playing since day one, you've been playing for one month shy of three years before I started. 

&gt;Me missing Tsums is 1. No coins or not enough coins 2. I wasn't playing the game to see the new Tsums available.

Even though you've been playing since day one? You would have plenty of coins by now if you were indeed honest about only wanting to complete the collection and didn't prioritize maxing out literally every single tsum.

edit: And in recollection of this thread you previously made here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TsumTsum/comments/emlu7p/tsums/ - you would not have been asking those kinds of questions if you were playing since day one. You would have known all of that information years ago.",1583021086

I think maybe a possible approach is to find ways to nickel and dime them like they do to us.  Don't automatically renew expired listings.  Don't create new listings.

Mine recently jumped to 5.5 but keeps 5.4 updated anyways, so other than downloading new virtualbox host modules, you might want to uninstall some old kernels from time to time (once a year or so) but always keep at least 2 installed in case the new one doesn't boot.

* Even after removing the Bird-Jones corrector and collimating with a Glatter laser, it still took around half an hour to get the damn thing aligned.

* Views through the scope even with a 25mm eyepiece were fuzzy and had significant ghosting and reflections. High power was unusable. 

* The fucking leg locks on the tripod broke when I set the scope down to observe.

* It is physically impossible to balance the scope in RA.

Even interacting one-on-one with neurotypicals at work doesn't bring me any joy.

The library was meant to have rooms in the upper portion of the atrium which were to give access to these areas. These rooms were not built, as a decision was made to get production done more quickly on the library, rather than follow the original building plan. 

The back wall of these upper shelves were instead painted with images of book-spines prior to the building's opening, giving the appearance they're full of books - whether the shelves hold any or not. 

Regardless of this, the Eye (which does, in fact, look like an eye when viewed from the exterior) still has the capability of holding over a million books, and boasts a number of outlet facilities outside its function as a book repository",1583021088

"nagios","t5_2rtzi","I should also mention, I originally tried separate Naemon instances in each DC, with the Thruk GUI on each one accessing the others via SSL encrypted Tcptunnels to remote Livestatus UNIX sockets.

The result was constant timeouts between thruk and livestatus, making the GUI unreliable. Either Tcptunnel was too slow, or the GUI just couldn't handle the lag to shift all the data about thousands of hosts between DCs. Shifting the lag to the Gearmand queues and individual nagios plugin check level instead doesn't cause GUI issues. Except when you force a check on a local system only takes a couple seconds, but on a remote system takes upwards of 10 seconds.

I'm also planning to turn my head end Naemon/Thruk/Apache/GearmanD instance into a Pacemaker/Corosync High Availability Pair, to improve Naemon/Thruk reliability and uptime.",1583021089

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","I agree with you that the border security we have is not very effective considering the amount of money that we put into it.

I have a clarification question about open borders. Would opening the border entirely mean that anyone who wants to can become a citizen just by showing up? Or simply that people can come and go as they please as long as they follow the law and pay the appropriate taxes?

https://cis.org/Report/63-NonCitizen-Households-Access-Welfare-Programs

63% of non-citizen households use some form of welfare.  If anyone in the world could just say, ""I want to be an American"" and then become one with no effort, I think we would have a drastic increase in immigrants moving here to live off of welfare.

Even if the negatives are slightly cancelled out as is, I have two criticisms with your view.

1) I don't see evidence that increasing undocumented immigration would not shift this impact from positive to negative if we gave people free reign to move here and use welfare programs.

2) Even if the effects of illegal immigration are slightly net positive, they are not contributing their fair share.  Your article states that legal immigrants, especially high skilled legal immigrants, tend to have a higher net benefit than illegal immigrants.  As an analogy, people like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates have undoubtedly had a very large net positive impact on the American people, but that doesn't mean they should be above the law, or free to not pay taxes, or able to freely commit welfare fraud, right?  Many of the billionaire CEO's that Reddit loves to hate have had a greater positive individual impact on the country or the world than almost anyone else in the country. But does that mean they shouldn't be expected to contribute their fair share in taxes or obey the law? Of course not.

So why does the slight net benefit of illegal immigration mean that illegal immigrants should be above the law or allowed to contribute less than their fair share?


Additionally, illegal immigrants are not evenly distributed, and while the net impact on the country may be slightly positive, it is often negative for the communities that most directly experience it.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/politics/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-illegal-immigration-but-didnt-know-who-to-ask/amp/

This article points out that, while the state does come out slightly net positive, local communities, hospitals, etc. come out nearly $1 Billion net negative from illegal immigrants in Texas alone.

It also points out that if you include the cost of children who were born here to undocumented parents, the net benefit for the state quickly goes to a large net loss.",1583021089

Not having access to cyclone so we can play around gravekeepers really messes up the deck because I cant fit cyclone into at all without killing my consistency.

"AstrologyChartShare","t5_3nnef","thank you so much for all of the depth in your input! i definitely struggled with showing my emotions (restraining them) in the past (especially with exes &amp; potential suitors), though i’m alot better at expressing &amp; being open with them now whenever i feel comfortable/connected with someone on a deeper level. but when it comes to the public, i can still feel extremely vulnerable &amp; sensitive whenever i make/share any type of post on my personal social media for some reason, even though a part of me really wants to shine &amp; express my individuality. i don’t have this problem when it comes to 1 on 1 comfortable connections though. 

can you explain what you meant by “you don't know how to express love other with a passionate, often physical reaction”? i want to fully understand what you meant by that. i can recall all the times i’ve felt “toyed with” too. i have my Venus in retrograde &amp; i remember hearing about past lives/karma for people with that placement- it really makes me wonder about my past lives. transformation has always been a deep &amp; resonant periodical occurrence in my life- whenever it happens, it’s extremely profound for me on a personal level. 

i find myself being drawn towards people who either have a strong, deep, and/or eccentric (yet amusing/intriguing) personality. i honestly never really cared for a man’s social status or how shiny they appeared. they could be eye-candy, but some form of unusual, stronger attraction has to be there for me to remain interested. i have attracted selfish/self-absorbed connections &amp; suitors before though. i’ve noticed how i have an odd pattern of being attracted to guys who happen to have depression and/or anxiety. i’ve been abused in the past but it was only by my brother. i’ve only been emotionally hurt by a potential suitor once who seemed to be a karmic connection at the time, but i refused to ever be abused or deal with a toxic partner in an actual relationship because i have a sense of self-respect. i’ve only had 1 “real” relationship throughout my entire life but that was back in 6th grade so it wasn’t much, though it was very dramatic. i’ve been single the majority of my life, despite how easily i can attract others (most of them are on a superficial level though).",1583021091
"Thetruthishere","t5_2sntx","Years ago I read this very old book (which, admittedly, was sensationalized) called Stranger Than Fiction that covered all kinds of paranormal/unexplained stories.

It's been a long time since I read this, but I think the man may even have had people witness his disappearance- like he vanished in front of them- but I'm not sure.
Also, I've heard that the Philadelphia Experiment also resulted in personnel disappearances where the missing could be heard but not seen.

"news","t5_2qh3l","All accounting isn’t controlled by the government. Medicare for all is fully controlled by the government. If you disagree with something in the government accounting, you can get a private sector accounting job. That wouldn’t be possible on a nationalized health system for doctors. I agree there are benefits to nationalized health care, but I think the main one is something that can be fixed in the current situation, which is cost. Lowering pharmaceutical prices and other medical expenses and making things more affordable should be the end goal. Also, I noticed comments (not from you) about never being denied in the ER but costs crippling you afterward. If you incur a financial hardship from a medical bill, there are programs that help cover this provided by the government. I don’t think we should need these at all though because I think healthcare should be affordable. But I also believe nationalizing medicine wouldn’t be the answer.

Edit: also I don’t think you’re a moron, I believe there are benefits to both. I just think we both believe in a different path to get there",1583021091

Brawler beats kael every time even though kael is geared and full masteries.  You want buffs and debuffs.  Attack down and defense down, defense up and attack up,  etc.  Those can make a huuuge difference.  Masteries as well are absolutely huge.",1583021092

She took me two tries and the first time I faced her was in NG+1.

MWN on the other hand moves like a tanker - if she could pivot fast to catch you while you were chasing her backside, she'd be an actual challenge. Who cares that the bitch has 6 arm-swords if it takes her a week to turn around to face you? Literally none of her attacks are dangerous as long as you slowly walk away.

You are in control of your life.  It seems like you’re trying to live up to someone else’s expectations.  It doesn’t seem like you feel any sense of accomplishment after working 80 hours a week.  Find a job with a 40 hour week where you feel like you make a difference.  With colleagues who don’t make you feel “less-than”.  
Not everyone with a family or in a relationship is over the moon happy and delighted.  Kids are a pain in ass and healthy relationships take work.  
I’ll tell you what I tell my son who is in college:  Don’t let life happen to you, make your life happen for you. What makes everyone else happy might not make you happy.  I went to school with a woman who earned her Ph.D. and hated it.  So she went back to cutting hair and she’s happy as a clam.  Do what makes you happy.  And you articulate your issues clearly and concisely.  Find a therapist and go.  It sounds like you could benefit from CBT or talk therapy.  Live the life you want.  Make yourself happy.

"comics","t5_2qh0s","That's a massive hack and generally only used for important security updates -- it won't help with system stability, and it won't go out of its way to even apply bugfixes unless they're critical security fixes. So that part that tech support suffers through where people say ""I totally rebooted!"" with an uptime of six months is a problem live-patching makes worse, not better.

And that's just the kernel.

If there's a glibc update, then you have to restart every running process that isn't statically linked -- like u/pixl_graphix says, if you have to restart your window manager, most users may as well reboot anyway. If there's an update to, say, sshd on a server you're ssh'd into, the *best* case is your distro will restart the part that listens to new connections, but your current ssh session will be running the old (vulnerable) version until you reconnect. It varies a ton -- a bug in glibc requires you to restart every non-statically-linked binary on your system (which is usually just *every binary*); a Bash bug like [Shellshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug\)) will just apply immediately.

So these days, on the desktop, one of the most important things to keep patched is your browser. Despite being a bunch of separate processes, Chrome very deliberately makes sure that when you update it, none of the patch will apply until you restart Chrome. How many people do you know who keep hundreds of tabs open, and will put off restarting *their browser* for days, let alone their whole OS?

The irony is that Chrome might typically be more secure on Windows, solely because Windows forces people to reboot, thus forcing them to restart Chrome.",1583021093
