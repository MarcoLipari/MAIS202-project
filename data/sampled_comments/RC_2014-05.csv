"OCD","t5_2qvqm","I was raised very strictly Catholic, but entering my mid-teens began to lose faith and willingness to practice religion to the fullest. I know identify as agnostic, but leaning towards atheism (my stance is that I have no evidence for a higher being, but I still concede that there is 0.0000001% possibility of there actually being a god or gods, so... agnostic fits better). 

When I left the Catholic Church, I did experience a decrease in religion-based obsessions, but these were quickly replaced with secular ones. An intrusive thought about sinning, for example, has now become one about hurting others. However, it is nice to not have institutionalized obsessions, i.e. ones that are repeatedly reinforced by an authority figure, and to have slightly fewer ""bad"" actions on my list of things to worry about (blasphemy, disbelief, not going to mass, etc). 

My obsessions didn't go away, and although I don't fear a god, I still catastrophize about fate/karma/whatever, just the general progression of life. In other words, whereas before I thought God would punish me for, say, accidentally using profanity, I now fear social rejection or being fired or having my family disown me... You get the idea.

Gangplank has a strength no one else has, although it might also be because his strengths aren't that major, and he has no giant weakness either. **He can build almost anything.**

You seem to want the following: 1) Solve mana problems, 2) become tanky, and 3) have considerable damage. 

**1) Mana on GP** is most easily solved by having a need for Gauntlet, starting with Flask, or buying mana pots, which I highly recommend, because maxing W makes mana pots much more efficient than what health pots would give you. GP can easily avoid all-ins, and thereof, Flask is an ok route. 
Also, when playing GP, you can't really poke as much as you want. GP was nerfed multiple seasons ago because his poke was impossible to deal with. Mana is the only thing which prevents GP from rolling over top laners. You have to manage GP's mana through decisions. 

Personally I play like this: until I can get a substantial amount of poke power, I spend mana on sustain (W maxing), Q for short trades or securing last-hits when I'm not in range or I just AA'd another creep. You simply cannot poke as GP early on, because you'll run dry on mana too quickly, and that leaves you susceptible to being forced out of lane, or ganked.

2) Becoming tanky in lane with GP is not just through building items and resistances - maxing W/oranges is the way to go. Gangplank, when played smartly, is hard to force out of lane. It makes winning trades much easier, and it doesn't increase in mana cost. When trading as GP, you don't want the trade to go any further than slightly bad, because your healing can only do so much in a shorter timeframe. 

3) If you want damage on GP, you rely on items almost completely. You have many options open to you - against heavy AD, there's Sunfire cape. Against magic dmg users, multiple items - Chalice if you feel safe (solves mana problems too), Visage to upgrade your W heal even further, Wit's End. In an even matchup you can build what you feel like without too much consideration. If you're winning however, you have a couple of options which are sure to snowball your lead. Statikk Shiv is good in any matchup which isn't bad, and due to its price you can also afford something like Giant's Belt while you're still laning. 

Also, BoRK is NOT good on Gangplank unless you're up against a health stacker. You don't have any particular synergy with anything that it gives. You don't need the slow or the movement speed because you already have such things in your kit. You're also spending money on further amounts of sustain, which you could instead spend on better damage items.

http://imgur.com/soWTYCG

As you can see, I went Critplank and started Flask. BUT, I did get Executioner's and Warmogs, specifically to counter Irelia. In the other match, when I went up against Garen, I got ahead, snowballed out of control, and proceeded to go for the 1-shot build. How did I manage this? I don't spend mana unnecessarily; I out-sustain and win trades by cancelling CC. You can also bait people VERY hard. Gangplank's Q is not meant to be maxed and used on every possible creep. It works like an extended AA. Gangplank's whole kit is full of utility. It's hard to get away from Q + ult. 

You just need to experiment on him.","1398902403"

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","You need to educate your husband, first of all. It's very difficult for human beings to relate to experiences so far outside the norm as depression, or mania, etc. If you don't experience depression, you just see it as ""well I feel bad some days and I just suck it up and move on with my day and feel happier.""

Education can never give someone that firsthand ability to genuinely empathize, but it, to an open-minded person, can at least give them *respect* for depression as a legitimate illness. 

I would also recommend talking to him about saying you bring your problems on yourself - that's amazingly insensitive and unsupportive. Like I'm actually mad for you that he would say that - it's all kinds of fucked up to say to ANYONE, let alone your wife. It's demeaning and serves no fucking purpose - even in a different world where it was true, what is telling you that evne going to accomplish aside from letting him brush of your problems as just you being a bad person?

Other than that you need to evaluate if you are happy with the quality of life you have right now. That's a personal choice, but it's also a choice you have to make for your child. If your energy and mood aren't good enough to give them the best that you can give, I think it's really time to consider medication. 

I know you had a bad experience with SSRIs, but there are obviously other options, and stick to your guns about not taking another SSRI unless the doctor can clearly explain why you should try again despite the previous effects. It is very possible to get on a medication dose that deals with your symptoms adequately without making you all fucked up in other ways. 

Look into a therapist too, if you can afford it. It's good for literally everyone, and it can teach you coping mechanisms for dealing with your depression in a way that allows you to function at your maximum (taking into account the depression, obviously!). 

I wish you luck. My personal feeling from what you're written is that the status quo isn't working for you (or why would you even be making this post to ask?) and that you should at least talk to a doctor. If your husband can't be made to see why that's a good idea, hopefully you're not in a position where his opinion can prevent you from seeking care. ","1398902404"

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I'm a bit late to the party, but Naut has never really been appealing to me. Not only does it come across as entirely generic and uninspired, it's just trying so hard to be stereotypically modern that it has no character at all. It feels like every other ""modern"" design I've ever seen.

This subreddit has a lot of character to it design-wise, and I've always respected the fact that you guys took the time to make an original theme. Converting to this new /r/Naut phase seems like a really bad idea. There's nothing wrong with the theme that's currently being used, and it's a lot easier on the eyes. 

Also..as the self-proclaimed /r/assassinscreed banner maker, I REALLY don't like what the new theme does to the banner. It appears to be limiting it in size, and does to it what iOS7 did to iphone backgrounds; they become irrelevant background images, as opposed to a solid part of the subreddits design. 

**EDIT:** This is a smaller concern..but the floating banner on the top when you scroll down is really annoying.

**EDIT EDIT:** Slightly off topic, but related to banners. I'm not entirely sure HOW you could go about this (I should probably google it), but I think locking the banner of this sub to the right side of the screen instead of the left would open up many more options for banner design. The current one prevents any really great details from being added to the left side because of the need for a snoo and a logo, and obviously no big details can be added to the right side because of the fact that screen width varies and some or all of a banner ""focus"" could be made invisible to a viewer. 

This forces banner details to either be center-focused, which again varies based on screen size (and is ugly), or non-existent like the current banner; I'm a fan of panorama's, but they're not very fun.

With this change you would have to move the mail / profile / karma feed over to the left a bit, but I think it's ultimately worthwhile. ","1398902406"

Buddhism's basis is in prajna, an unbinding wisdom of the interdependent nature of all things, and not in experience of a unifying substance as it is in Advaita. So yes, there is a big difference.

&gt; Nirvana is not seperate from the aggregates, like a pure self, but rather knowledge of the nature of the aggregates

"mtgoxinsolvency","t5_30lhf","Completely understand your viewpoint -- my only point was that people in the IRC seemed to be implying that they were offering us 16.5% equity for the 200k BTC which is false.

Really I think it comes down to whether you think 16.5% equity and the audit is worth 10m dollars. I think it is, but I understand you don't and respect that you are at least laying out facts.

In terms of the 10% bounty that people are up in arms about, hell if it motivates them to actually hire who they need to hire and find the coins, then I'm all for it. Any non-funded audit with no bounty is going to be run by amateurs who find nothing.

In terms of cooperating with the Class Counsel I don't see the problem as I think Sunlot (or any takeover company) would want to find as much of the assets as possible for their bottom line.

In terms of immunity I really dont care if Jeb McCaleb and Gay-Buchery (wrong spelling I'm sure) get immunity or not. You know what I care about most? Getting the most I can out of this shitty situation. Mark is the only one who 100% needs to take a fall, if there are other insiders and they get immunity but help us find coins then I'm okay with it. It's not ""fair"" but life isn't fair and at this point we ALREADY got screwed, getting ""revenge"" isn't going to get us our coins back. I care about my own personal bottom line and that's it.

Liquidation provides no hope of ever getting above a small % back. I would rather gamble with Sunlot and see what happens than have it go to Liquidation. I'd prefer OKCoin but I think way too many people are being immature and raging at Sunlot for ""scamming"" when really they're just still reacting to getting scammed by Gox in the first place. Nobody wants to face reality that these deals are the best we are going to receive.

Take emotions out and try to focus on what option gives us the best chance of the highest payout. To me, that is ANYTHING BUT liquidation.","1398902410"

If you google ""Indian actress,"" you're going to come up with lots of very light skinned Indian women.

From wikipedia:

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Unless you plan on going for a 4xGPU setup, that is not really a problem.

[this](https://www.komplett.no/msi-970a-g43-socket-am3/773523#!tab:extra) is the cheapest AM3+ MB I can find in my preferred on-line shop. It's just shy of $100. It has 2 16x PCIe 2.0 slots. Or, if you'd like, plenty for a dual GPU setup. If you need more than 2 GPU's at the same time, and don't plan on using two ""dual GPUs"", then this setup is not ideal. But this is the cheapest. And really, there are very few games that scale at all at 3 GPUs. If they do, scaling usually goes like this:

 * 1 GPU = 100%
 * 2 GPU = 195% +-
 * 3 GPU = 260% +-

That third GPU will at best only give 50-60% more performance , rather than 95 % for the second GPU. 

This is in addition to the fact that there is next to no scenario today with ""consumer"" GPUs that will even reach 8x PCIe 2.0 needs. Last time I saw any test of the kind of how much the PCIe link speed affects game-performance, it was everything above 4x PCIe 2.0 is ""good enough"". That's a few years ago, so call it 16x PCIe 2.0 is ""good enough"" today. All in all, unless you are running 3 AMD r9 290x at insane resolutions, as in multiple 4K displays, there isn't gonna be a PCIe bottleneck any time soon. 

To sum up, I don't care what you may end up buying, but choosing intel over AMD now, unless you go to the socket 2011 platform, and you want multiple GPU's, you are choosing between 2 * PCIe 2.0 16x or 2 * PCIe 3.0 8x. Or in other words, same shit, different wrapping. Not, multiplexing doesn't ""fix"" the problem. The CPU still only has a limited amount of PCIe lanes.

DISCLAIMER: There are exceptions, but they are few and far between.","1398902415"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The best way to do this... avoid situations where there is a high probability of police intervention and conduct yourself as if that is your intention. How do you do that, you may ask? Make smart choices, chose your associates wisely, don't fight people in public (esp. police), don't drive with anyone you don't trust, don't accept things from people you don't trust, don't drive a car that attracts a lot of attention, don't keep a gun/drugs/paraphernalia in your car, make sure your car is insured/properly licensed, never speed in your car, don't drink and drive, don't be in a gang, don't dress like you are in a gang, don't drink/do drugs in public, don't buy drugs off the street, don't sell drugs (esp. on the street), don't steal shit (esp. from stores), avoid parties with underage drinking, don't have sex with an underage person, don't rape anyone, avoid houses with serious drug use occurring, avoid riots, do not instigate or provoke law enforcement officials, steer clear of others fighting.

If you do those things, there is 99% chance you will never have a bad interaction with police. ","1398902415"

"Paleo","t5_2qzzs","Just remember, if you do high intensity exercise, your body will be using up a lot of glycogen/glucose, which is what you get from eating carbohydrate. If you want to maintain an extreme regimen of this kind of anaerobic exercise, you're going to have a horrible time if you don't up your carb intake to compensate. Even if you up your fat intake so your macros are sound (while being low carb), fat still isn't going to provide the necessary fuel for those kinds of workouts, especially if they're regular. Fat is burned for fuel by the body, generally speaking, at lower intensities (think marathon pace running). The incident you described in your OP was probably your brain running out of glucose. I'm all for low-carb, but I don't think it's compatible with a regular high-intensity workout regimen. So first make sure if you're low-carb you're getting enough fat and your macros are good, i.e. around 65% fat, 30% protein, 5% carbs. Then recognize the limitations of that diet in terms of fueling certain levels/types of exercise, then either eat more carbs (and lower the fat) or do less exercise.","1398902417"

Also, read up on and reference literature that deals with the same set of problems she's invested in in a deeper and more rigorous manner. Everything from Dr. King, whom she won't be able to reject, to proper feminists who acknowledge men's issues. Being passionate about injustice is a good thing, and can be channeled into more appropriate forms by exposure to better ideas. 

The one thing you can't do is defeat her views by argument. There are too many emotional investments at work for that to happen.

"UKUltimate","t5_2spct","Thing is that it varies so much year on year.

I mean compare Scotlands performance last year to this year and there's been pretty dramatic changes (though they're obviously still the strongest region, but not by the same margin).

Likewise if you went back a few more years you'd find the West region doing really well (Exeter were really strong 2009-2010 for example) but only scraped into Div 2 this year.

I think the important thing is that the top 8 teams in the country make it through, after that if it remains in a tournament format rather than a league you're going to struggle to get an effective ranking outside of the top 4.

For example if a teams knocked out at the quarter finals by the eventual winners, does that mean they should be forced into a maximum of 5th place? Definitely not. They could be just as good a team as the people who eventually end up second place!","1398902420"

* Season 4 - Lots of meandering around; good ending to governor's storyline. Last half of the season was a bit tedious.

The show lacks energy in moving from one place to another, and always has. I like the show a lot, but, for example, Prey? That episode was mostly filler that didn't amount to anything.

Make sure to be friends with the kitchen staff because you will probably be lining when everyone else is eating/sleeping during an early arrival. Assign a captain, so that the D.M. can wake that person up and the captain can wake everyone else up.

Don't inhale the paint too much.

Always be certain that you set the lines right when starting the backfield. After lining the first parallel line to the center, run towards where the press box would be about 15 yards and be sure you're not making them diagnals!

Get as much sleep as possible when on the bus when the arrival will be early in the morning like 3 am. You will be up just before sunrise to set another field at the new site.

Last major spill I can recall was Sept of 2004 when something like 30 loaded coal cars derailed, with several ending up in the canal.

"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","&gt;But one day after some wine, she is inclined to do it? Is that still violating consent since she disagreed before but now is consenting / offering under intoxication?

I already said - this is not illegal, it's just *fucking shady*.

&gt;But if she actually agreed verbally, how do you know if she's really up for it or just drunk?

Wait until she's more sober, and **ask**.

&gt;Does it mean that as soon as alcohol touches someone's lip, consent goes out the window because even if they verbally agree / offer sex, it can still be rape since the decision was made under intoxication?

If you are incapable of judging how drunk someone is, don't have sex with that person if they've had any alcohol recently. If you're capable of telling the difference between when someone has had a couple drinks but they're fine, and when they should not be allowed to drive, then use your judgement.

You could always talk to someone sober about this and circumvent the whole issue, of course. My boyfriend and I fuck each other a lot when one or both of us are really drunk, because sober we were both like ""Yeah you can have sex with me when I'm drunk"".

&gt;Say your GF was never down to anal, but in a drunken night she agrees / offers anal. What happens then?

Was my post confusing? JUST DON'T. It's PREDATORY AS SHIT. You KNOW she doesn't ever want to do it, you KNOW she wouldn't if she was sober. THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE'S INTOXICATION. Wait for her to sober up, and talk about it THEN.","1398902429"

Now I do understand your point, However in Peter it says scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit. Paul was sent by Christ to bring his word.  And Again the teaching of the Catholic Church is very clear on this. That is not to say homosexuals should be relegated from society but it is a sin, and you (not saying you specifically) shouldn't propagate such sin.

No, it's not a surprise. It's that this subreddit doesn't like talking about politics, so I've been avoiding it.

And while I understand (and share) the idea that the MRM does not relate to any political ideology, if I criticize a group of democrats then I am seen as a pro-republican, and vice versa.

It's almost funny, because what I loathe the most is the partisanship that rules many western democracies -like my country-.","1398902433"

Femanons, try to masturbate as sneakily and as quietly as you can.
Dirty whispering and quiet moans are appreciated.
Bonus if you are almost caught by someone.
 
=================================================================================================

I also have two addendums to u/entrechat's 100-1 Challenge 

100-1 GOD MODE
 
If you fail, you have to give yourself the same number of spanks as the numbers left in your countdown.
e.g. You fail at 15, so you have to give yourself 15 spanks and count them out loud for us.
This can be done as a separate recording.
 
THE ""FUCK YOUR 100-1 CHALLENGE"" CHALLENGE
 
The Game is that you just masturbate furiously, occasionally recording the sounds of your schlicking, and orgasm as much as possible as quickly as possible. Cum hard, cum fast, cum often.

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; literally drive someone insane

*Literally* literally. The show is *constantly* referencing Call of Cthulhu and SAN points. But it's also useful to note that the humour in the show is not *purely* referential, there's a lot of slapstick, sex jokes and a couple of seiyuu jokes. When I watched both seasons a good 95% of references (seriously) flew over my head, but I still found it fantastic and hilarious (even though the story is infuriatingly stupid). And both seasons have awesome OPs.

Also, the whole Axis can only be killed by other Axis is not necesserily canon, since it originates not in ToG but in earlier works of SIU.

From the wiki: ""It is discussed that Shinsoo itself may be the Axis field of the true god the Tower was built to reach. In this case manipulating Shinsoo may be able to harm Phantaminium as it has the properties of an Axis field.  ""

most people think that weightloss works as follows. Calories in - calories out = Weight loss or gain.
 
But its actually, weight (Fixed) = Calories in - calories out

Basically, your weight is finely regulated by hormones (Insulin in paticular) and is fixed. Its hard to get it to deviate from it's preferred weight. And when you do drop below, you will compensate by eating more or burning less.

Basically keto fixes that misregulation of weight, by controlling the amount of insulin, and you just naturally start to lose weight. (Through decreased appetite, and increased energy)","1398902437"

The only time any significant portion of our congressional houses pushed far left was just before the civil war. Conversely, we are currently in one of the deepest pools of far-right belief in our congressional history.

This may not necessarily reflect our populace's current trends, but to claim we've never had more social programs is outrageous. We've seen the passing of Reconstruction, the New Deal, and more. The first 6 years of the 1980s saw a higher percent of our GDP go to welfare spending than current predictions expect us to be spending by 2015. [Citation: Graph at top of page](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/welfare_spending)

From the same page:
&gt;the Great Recession of 2009-10 produced an explosion in welfare costs to a peak of 4.75 percent of GDP in 2010. Welfare costs are expected to decline to 2.88 percent of GDP by 2015.

While our peak may have been the highest it's ever been, it also dropped off faster than many have historically. There was an injection of welfare spending to keep the American public afloat while the banks did their best to ruin our economy, and then it subsided quickly as it was seen to be no longer needed in such quantity.

We might have more regulations, which I generally don't like, but such is the way congresses march, and most of those regulations are their own form of corporate welfare, written for and bought by companies to make money or lock out competition.","1398902438"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","We are not saying that it should be cheaper right off the bat. Its just that Microsoft is selling this game w/ the promotion on THEIR OWN STORE! Not GameStop, MICROSOFT!

There should be no excuse as to why they cannot do it for the digital copy as well. 

It's stuff like this that makes the people that want to go all digital (which is more people then expected) angry. And it doesn't help that the Xbox Team allegedly says that they are ""looking into"" promoting digital games. That's hypocritical status.

EDIT 1: I'm editing this because I've gained some reputable insight as to why this is so. After Listening to the podcast 'Rebel FM' Episode 213 (right around 1hr into the episode), Arthur Gies reads a question very similar to what everyone here is debating about... Digital sales. 

Arthur says that the prices for games on Xbox Live are left completely up to the publisher at hand. Since the publisher sells the software both digitally and physically, prices have to remain at the standard MSRP until the ""contract"" is up for retail stores. Also, slashing the prices for digital games would severely aggravate brick and mortar stores, meaning that the publisher could have a lot to lose since digital games on Xbox are out of the retailers control. And it's less of concern on other platforms besides the Xbox platform.

This makes a whole lotta sense. Since Watch Dogs is owned by Ubisoft, Ubisoft has the final say in the price they set on the digital market place. The reason why retailers sometimes have promotions on new games is because they buy the game in bulk and since they actually own the games now, they can set the price to whatever they want, promotion or not.

Hope this cleared up things guys. It's would have been cool if microsoft used the same rules as retailers for the Xbox Games Store. Then they could run sales and promotions an new digital games. It seems like that is how Sony does it. ","1398902439"

He's also a bit flexible when it comes to play styles (i.e. all combat vs all RP or somewhere in between), although he favors combat.

His worst tendency is to arbitrarily nerf (sp.) characters after they're already halfway completed. If he decides that a class or race ability is overpowered, it's out the window. Really no negotiation involved.

Also, he's outright refused to run parties with more than 3-4 players max in the past. Most of the players want a larger group, but understand that doing that is really his prerogative.

The problem is I know her well enough to know that if one person confronts her she will think they are just being ""mean"" or a bully. If more than one person confronts her she will feel ganged up on and shut down.

I was forced to be an adult from an early age. He is a kid at heart and somehow it just balances out. This whole, ""what would they have in common"" thing is just stupid to me. Our friends are the typical 2-5 yr age differences and they rarely have things in common. Usually one plays video games while the other likes to hike. One likes to read while the other likes to watch scary movies. Really I don't think age makes tht much of a difference when it comes to interests. Other things, absolutly. Interest, meh. I'm 28 I play video games, I read, I take care of the kiddos. He works like a mad man. In our down time we watch netflix or he plays solitaire while I read like most couples and if we are blessed with a date night we go to the movies/dinner. I'm blabbing now but the point is, MOST age differences of such drastic-ness ( I made that up :)) are not so good and I understand the skepticism but not ALL relationships of big age differences are just creepy older people trying to prey on the youth of today.

There's not a whole lot of difference without having other dermals or surface piercings on your body to compare with, they both can be long term if you treat it right. I haven't decided if I'll get the left redone or just replace the whole thing with a surface barbell.

The general consensus on this sub is barbell though, because it's been practiced longer and has more solid information. Just a different perspective!

* do another 5-10 folds to set the regularization parameter
* Given that parameter, set the other parameters (slope coefficients, in this case) on the outer fold's training data.
*  Get an MSE for that fold on that fold's testing data
*  Report the average of MSEs as our overall model MSE

The part that has me hung up: from the outer fold we have 10 models with 10 regularization parameters and 10 sets of coefficients. What do we use as our **final** model? An average of the outer splits??

&gt;&gt;You have to fight back if you want anything to get better. Blacks fought for decades against discrimination, and thanks to that, I lived to see a black man elected president (something I never expected to see). Gays finally had enough and started demanding equality, beginning with the Stonewall riots. Now they enjoy majority support, nationwide.

I suppose I thought too deeply, and so my train of thought leapt ahead. But he was listing groups that were not only shunned, but that they were used as tools to scare people and keep power over others.

&gt;Know what I hate? That fucking stupid song, Waiting for the World to Change.

&gt;&gt;What's your point?

My first thought was ""Who taught our generation to be so passive? Have we really been taught to be that submissive and given so much risk (which will be less than the generations before us) that we can't do anything? Why can't we organize and why do we just sit idly, hoping for a future rather than getting it?"" I suppose we've been conquered in this respect.

&gt;Just the fact that he has kept a cool head and avoided dragging us into another war despite rabid urging anytime something bad happens somewhere has been the best thing that he could have ever done for this country to promote the future. Up to this point, we were apparently prepared to drown ourselves fighting useless wars around the world

I saw this as another thing. So many people look for so many reasons to hate one man. It's pathetic. I know racial tensions have been worse in America. But I look at things like how Obama is depicted and all of the dog-whistles, slurs and bile-spewing slung his way. It's insane, and Ukraine has brought a lot of that out, again. Which made me think of the Republican party and it's ability to completely decimate the social safety net by simply making 'the other' a boogeyman.

&gt;Is that what you see is happening now in America? In the past? 

I do. In the past? That's a more tricky question. I certainly feel that the 70's and 80's were the point where Reganomics needed to be shot down before it got started and Keynesian theory needed to be looked at again. And I feel we've milked 9/11 enough already and should return to normalcy.

Where do you see us now?

&gt;Wealth is becoming concentrated towards the top, as is money. Money seems to buy power now. The people who need to vote aren't voting, which means politicians won't pander to them. People are just desperate enough to do whatever their superiors tell them, but not desperate enough to do anything about it.

I don't live in America right now. I've been in Japan for just over three years. I plan on returning to America in 2 years to get my MsED and it terrifies me beyond reason.","1398902453"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Disclaimer: this is for western music

Notes are divided up into fractions, the most basic being the whole note, which is equal to two half notes, each half note is equal to two quarter notes, each quarter note is equal to two eighth notes, each eighth is equal to two sixteenths, etc. 

We divide music up into measures, sometimes called bars. How many beats there are per bar is called the ""Time Signature."" It's denoted as a fraction, where the top number is the number of beats per measure, and the bottom is the division of note that gets the beat, for example ""4/4"" (you would call it 'four-four') would be 4 notes per measure with the Quarter note getting the beat.

 Time signature is important because it helps organize the beats into a pattern to construct our rhythm, which I'll get to in a second. 

""Tempo"" is the same thing as ""how fast"" a piece of music is. It is measured in beats per minute. Some standard tempos are 120, or ""march tempo"" which you hear a lot of dance music at, 100 for a ""downtempo"" feel, a common waltz tempo, 60 for an ""adagio"" feel, common in a lot of jazz ballads or slow, soft pieces. 


Rhythm is the ""groove"" of a piece of music. It is simply the timing of the individual notes within a single measure. It can be described as ""on the beat"" where notes mostly fall on each individual beat in the measure, or ""syncopated"" or ""off the beat"" where the notes are accented on the ""up beat"" or in between the beats. ""On the beat"" would be something like a waltz or march, ""syncopated"" would be something like funk or jazz. 

How to find the main beat? tap your foot! Everyone has a sense of rhythm, just start moving to the music and you'll most likely be in time. Tapping your foot to the music is the easiest way to find the beat.

There are a couple really good ways to count. All of them rely on using a single syllable for every beat and subdivision (the parts between the beat). 

For a simple 4/4 beat, you count every single beat going ""1...2...3...4..."" and repeat. You can divide it up into eigth notes and count ""1.&amp;.2.&amp;.3.&amp;.4.&amp;."" and then again with sixteenth notes going ""1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 e &amp; a 4 e &amp; a"" 

Now that's for a ""duple"" rhythm, where every note evenly divides into halves, or 2 is the smallest subdivision. There is also ""triple"" meter, where there are three notes per beat, or six, or 9, etc. There are a couple ways to count triplets as they're called 

I'm a fan of ""1 is a 2 is a 3 is a 4 is a"" but some like ""tri pl et"" because it makes sense. 

There is also an Indian system of counting that is more intuitive and doesn't use numbers, but syllables corresponding to different hits on a tabla (a kind of drum). I don't know them all but instead of ""1 2 3 4"" you can go ""ta ka ta ka"" and instead of ""1 is a"" for triplets, you can go ""ta ka ni"" and for eigths ""taka taka taka taka"" and sixteenths ""takatini.""

For quintuplets and sextouplets, which you probably won't hear in most music I personally just use ""hippopotamus"" and ""necrobeastiality"" ","1398902454"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","For all elements A, B, C in some Set X, the relationship A to B and B to C imply the existence of the relationship A to C.

Let a, b, and c, be the cards Dark Confidant, Boom//Bust, and Counterbalance respectively.  Let the relationship R in question be the question ""Is an element of the first set a member of the second set"".

aRb, that is the question ""is Dark Confidant CMC equal to one of the CMCs of Boom//Bust?"" and there exists an answer, it is defined, the answer is True.

bRc, that is the question ""does one of Boom//Bust CMCs equal to CMC of Counterbalance?"" and there again exists an answer, it is defined, the answer is True.

This would imply that aRc is defined, and is true.  So, the question now, is it?  Yes.  The CMC of Dark Confidant and Counterbalance are equal to one another.

To show that the transitive property does not hold, you would need to compare to a card with CMC 6.

Let d be Interpret the Signs, and all other values the same as before.  Should the transitive property hold then the relationship (aRb &amp; bRd) imply aRd.  So does this hold?

We already know aRb is true.  What about bRd?  The CMC of Boom/Bust contains 6, and the CMC of Interpret the Signs is 6.  So that is true.  However aRd is false.  And thus the property does not hold.

I asked you about it, not because I did not understand it.  But because you did a bait and switch on the relationship R.

&gt; Counterbalance says ""counter a spell if its CMC equals Boom//Bust's CMC"", so if transitivity of equality holds I can counter a spell if its CMC = Boom//Bust's CMC = 8, but I can't, because equals doesn't mean equals.

Not really?  Because like I said above this relationship here is not the same relationship as the one above.

Dark Confident is not asking the same question as Counterbalance, and thus not the same relationship.  Ergo you cannot determine if the transitive property holds from your example alone.  You happen to be correct about it for some definitions of R, but not all, and not for how your trying to show it.

&gt; I don't find it intuitive at all that ""equal to the CMC"" of a card sometimes means ""find all the CMCs of the card and add them up"" and other times means ""pick one of the CMCs and use that"", and I don't know what the criteria is for deciding which one a card is supposed to use (clearly it's not whether we're comparing things or not, since Dark Confidant is comparing life lost to the CMC).

Again, because you are incorrectly conflating the questions being asked.  I looked at your posting history, you have posted to /r/programming so I will just take guess that perhaps you might know a little bit about programming and pseudocode.

Firstly, let all cards be defined by a set of properties, one of them being a Unique Id to all cards.  These properties in question include an entry for CMC.  CMC is also a set, it must contain non-negative whole values, and must contain at least 1 value.  CMC may contain many values.

Dark confident does the following.

    Flip a card C
    select CMC from C
    foreach int N in CMC
        lose life equal to N
    Place C in hand

This is why its just the summation.  You are doing something in a loop, and those values add up.  The number of times you pass though the loop is based on the size of the set CMC in C.

&gt; Put yet another way, if I lose life equal to the CMC of Boom//Bust, the answer to the question ""Did I just lose life equal to the CMC of Boom//Bust"" should be yes, but it is not.

Because this is a type error!  CMC isn't a value, its a set of values, at least that is how it is treated.

Lets compare this to Counterbalance.  I will define a helper function to evaluate the truth statement.

    Let boolean helper(int N, set of int CMC)
        if CMC is empty return false
        select a value from CMC, and remove from set, place in int V
        return (N==V)|helper(N, CMC)

Now for Counterbalance.

    Get the CMC of a card k on the stack. --because split cards on the stack only have one CMC, we never need to worry about a set at this stage.
    Flip a card c.
    if helper(k.CMC, select CMC from C) counter k
    
To address

&gt;  ""find all the CMCs of the card and add them up"" and other times means ""pick one of the CMCs and use that""

It doesn't do that.  This is why I keep saying you're thinking about it wrong.

&gt;  I don't know what the criteria is for deciding which one a card is supposed to use (clearly it's not whether we're comparing things or not, since Dark Confidant is comparing life lost to the CMC).

So, Dark Confidant is not comparing anything.  It performs its operations for all valid values.  If you pass in [Who/What/When/Where/Why](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74358) or if you pass in no card because you have no cards left in your library.  For each value, it performs its action.

Counterbalance is comparing something.  When something is compared, if any answer works, then it works.  In effect, you can treat it as a single bit with no overflow you are summing over.

&gt;&gt; 708.6a An effect that performs a positive comparison (such as asking if a card is red) or a relative comparison (such as asking if a card’s converted mana cost is less than 2) involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if either side of each split card in the comparison would return a “yes” answer if compared individually.

Counterbalance asks a different question than Dark Confidant.  Counterbalance asks, does this cards CMC equal a value.  If any of the cards CMCs are equal to that value, then its true.  Else its false. 

**TL;DR:**  Nothing to do with the existence of the transitive property, because you are not using the same relationships.  You perform the operation over the set of characteristics, and then sum the result.... umm... there are some code examples to look at.","1398902458"

Basically they're paying to *increase* performance, as opposed to paying to avoid a *decrease* in performance, which would be the scenario those of us in favor of net neutrality are concerned about.

It would have made sense for Netflix to enter these peering agreements even in the presence of super-strong net neutrality regulations, though it's plausible that the prospect of loss of net neutrality made Netflix more eager to do the deals.

By offloading traffic from existing peering points, Netflix's moves should actually make the net faster for everyone, which is nice.","1398902473"

"bodymods","t5_2qj5t","So this is like a petition to make the government force people to stop being assholes? That's got to be the most impotent and misdirected thing I've seen in a while.

Look, body modification is a choice. You have, and took, the opportunity to express your personality and alter the body that you own. That's a freedom that nobody can take away from you. If somebody takes the ownership of your body away, or your freedom to express yourself with it, they have either murdered you or you've - knowingly or not - become a slave. It is the most paramount form of property you own.

Likewise, business owners have choices with *their* property. We can, in some cases, force the owners of these properties to offer equal opportunity and consideration to people who *without choice* are being notably discriminated against - race, disability, gender. These people did not *choose* the state of their bodies.

But the idea of forcing property owners to accept people with modifications? Absurd. For one, it'd be rampant with abuse - anyone who comes in with FUCK tattooed on the knuckles would pursue claims when they didn't get hired, and every idiot who bombs the interview would blame their ear piercings on why they didn't get hired. Worse, it's an attempt to *deprive property owners of their freedom.* People MUST be free to be fucking assholes and idiots. Hell, there must even exist the right to be a racist, a bigot, a misogynist, or whatever else they want to be. Because if they can't, if people aren't free to be what they are, for better or worse, when you start talking about legislating people's opinions, that's oppression. It defies human nature. It's been tried many times, and it's always failed.

If you can legislate people's opinions and what they do with their property, guess what the first thing to go will be? Human expression, and with that, body modification. If you think you can tell other people what to do with their property and their thoughts, you can be pretty damn sure that isn't a one-way street.","1398902474"

I originally had the ground as the outside silver contact on my SPDT rocker and this worked perfectly except for at my friend's house and then I read about people putting the ground on the gold contact so I switched it up and it still worked fine but still fried the outlet and my switch. 
Some info on the box: it is a hollowed out gamecube that has the controller and female XLR in the front and the rocker switch and power outlet in the back, the SSR is attached to the chassis with a single bolt but it is not grounded as I had read that the SSR does not necessarily need to be grounded and neither do plastic cases. I have double checked the power rating on the rocker switch and it is of the same specs as detailed here. The last time I fried it the rocker had the ground for the gold contact, the power for the middle silver contact, and the controller for the outside silver contact. Before this configuration the one that was working as well was with the power for the gold contact, the controller for the middle silver contact, and the ground for the outside silver contact.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Warning: Incoming wall of text!

Tf2 is already a very balanced game, and it's really difficult to think of a tenth class. Valve originally had an idea for some sort of commander that oversees the battlefield, but then they deemed it not very fun. Most ideas (such as superspeed or super health tanks) can be implemented as item stats on the already existing classses. And you also need to factor in things that make the class special and 

interesting to play that are unique.

All that said, I present to you the product of fifteen minutes of my brain: The Wizard.

First I need to note that as far as I could think, you sort of *have* to break the game a bit to get a tenth class in as it's already very 

balanced. So yes, I know it breaks it a bit. Luckily, it is already in canon!

Let's go for the vanilla loadout.

- Wizard: 160 HP. Moves at demoman speed. Has a magic bar, most attacks drain this, when it's low you cannot attack.

- Primary: *Wizard staff:* I'm thinking of some sort of basic projectile. Fireball is the obvious choice but I like leaving fire damage to the pyro (CM5K was a bit silly in that way IMO). So we'll just call it magic bolt (or magic missle if you like). We can give it a straight damage (say 60?) OR if we want to do something more interesting, why not have it do more damage per hit? Like the enemy is getting charged with harmful magic or something, 30 for the first hit, make it increase each time (depending on damage falloff) so at mid range a fight should look like -30, -40, -55? Or maybe make it so that the qucker you hit a target, the more damage increase you get, but the staff gets less accurate the faster you fire? However, if someone is really close range then the damage ramps up a lot faster, something like -30, -60, etc but due to the nature of the projectile it's difficult to land incredibly nearby shots.

Target deaths might have the disintegration effect of the laser weapons. And potentially to make it more interesting you would have a 
switchable spell that you could use with right click for various effects, such as placable defense shields or that sort of thing. However, 
I'm not sure I like this for two reasons: One, buffs are the soldiers territory, and two if you remember the update that removed the 
polycount sets, they did that for a reason: Invisible effects. It's important in tf2 to know what a class is capable of, and a staff that 
you could not know what their secondary spell is would be annoying. I guess just pass all the special magic effects to the secondary weapon 
that can have a unique model.

- Secondary: *Crystal Ball* There are different ideas for this. Should it passivly let you see enemy health? Or maybe it let's you get a red 
shimmer for enemy locations (not cloaked enemys) sort of like the detect life spell from skyrim. You could use it with M1 to project a sort 
of shield that would give you damage resistance, however this would drain magic, and it would take a second to start. While you're NOT 
using it, you take extra damage (say minicrits).

- Melee: *Hobbits head(?)* Attacks do not use magic. Maybe has the same effect as the wizard staff, each hit does more damage. Maybe using 
secondary fire with it shoots a slow moving projectile, that when it hits a surface near the same level as you, you teleport to it. 
Obviously this takes magic, and while casting and while the projectile is active you take minicrits.

Unlockable ideas:

- Telekinisis staff: Yes, I know the pyro already has something like this. As I said earlier I have to break the game a bit.
This staff does no damage, but has the ability to grab projectiles at the air and leave them hovering around you. Left click to grab, right 
click to chuck them back!

- A secondary that is exactly the short circuit except it uses magic and we pretend the short circuit never happened.

- Leech staff: Lets you slowly suck health from enemies, and then either give it back to yourself or chuck it at them as a damaging orb!

- The Ventriloquist: Make sounds appear where you point this staff, anything from a spy deadringer to an incoming uber! (This is a secondary)

- The Illusionist (secondary) Hard to know whether to make it so this can make people hallucinate entire players, or just things to make them 
think they're on fire. Maybe you could cast it to look like a crocket is coming their way? Or maybe combine this and the ventriloquist into 
one weapon.

- Some sort of melee that upon hit puts an effect on the enemy for a few seconds. If you right click while that field is active, you and the 
enemy switch places. (field is limited by range and time, if the enemy is gets far enough away it doesn't work. Also, I'm not sure whether 
to make it so that if you're in the air and try to activate it it doesn't work, as you could use it on a map with cliffs, hit someone and 
jump off then switch. Alternatly this wouldn't exactly be easy to pull off, airblasting someone off is even easier, so I think it is 
balanced and it would be hella fun). Probably has a slight damage reduction to account for this ability though.

- Maybe some secondary that makes a noise if a sniper has his scopes on you?

- Some sort of blink secondary for teleporting small distances if having that on the vanilla melee doesn't work out.

Anyway, I think that's plenty of ideas for now. Hope this is decent. Wizards ho!

EDIT: As far as who might be good at it, do you mean like comp players (I don't know many comp players) or types of people?

TL;DR: Make a wizard with interesting unique spells and items because pretty much every other class idea can be put on an existing class as a weapon.","1398902477"

The reason they make it available for those that want to is for 1) testing and 2) because some users like to be on the bleeding edge and see every small iterative change in the code. However, as a general rule of thumb, nightly's that are released after semi-stable builds like the M snapshots, are considered to only improve nightly after nightly.

First, that varies from person to person, one new party isn't going to cut it.

Second, your question is currently irrelevant.

We have plenty of theoretically viable political parties (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States#Major_political_parties). Have you ever wondered why they have had almost no effect on our politics? 3rd parties, through design, have been effectively shut out of the political arena. We don't need another political party, we need to fix the system to allow for other political parties.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","In proportional representation (PR), 10% of the vote = 10% of the seats. Simple as that, if 100 million people vote to elect people to 100 seats, you need 1 million votes to win a seat. Simple as that.

In first past the post (FPTP) you vote for a candidate specific to your local area. A candidate must win more of the votes than any other candidate in his or her local area to get the seat for that area. Each candidate then sits in the parliament and whichever party has the most winning candidates wins. In order to form a majority though, the winning party also needs to occupy &gt;50% of the available seats (which in the UK is about 325 seats).

The latter sounds just as reasonable until you consider that if a party's votes aren't concentrated in a small number of areas, they're likely to win no seats. For example, UKIP got almost a million votes in 2010 but got 0 seats, whereas the Alliance Party got 1 seat with just 42,000 votes because they were all in 1 area. That means that because of FPTP, the views of 42,000 people in 1 are are better represented than 1 million votes across the UK purely because of where those votes were cast. Proportionally, those million votes would have won UKIP about 20 seats, but instead they have none.","1398902480"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","1. Donating money to charity is far from the only way to help others. Being a teacher is a phenominal way to help others literally all day every day. You can't really beat that. Sure, you wouldn't be saving lives the same way you would if you were a doctor, but you also would be able to start sooner, not have as much debt to pay off, and would be working primarily with a demographic that has their entire lives ahead of them rather than potentially one that is merely trying to extend what little time they have left. 

2. The food and drinks present at a party in the developed world are not going to be shipped to Africa to feed starving children if you don't eat/drink them. By all means do whatever you can to live a sustainable and excess free lifestyle and do what you can to help those less in need, but their suffering isn't your fault and you should not feel guilty about it. Feel fortunate to be where you are and do what you can to help.

3. Charity will never save the world. Giving all of your money to charity is admirable, but it doesn't solve anything. I'm not saying not to do it, I'm just saying that you shouldn't necessarily feel guilty for not doing it more than you do.

4. Lots of people want to be doctors, lawyers, and software developers and earn large paychecks. Many of those people give lots of money to charity every year. Your belief that you should do something like be a doctor specifically to donate the money you would earn to those less fortunate is admirable, but ultimately flawed. Either you think there is an infinite supply of positions available for doctors to make high salaries (there aren't), or you think that you becoming a doctor and giving the money you earn to charity would be taking the place of someone else who would have accepted the positions you end up with and *not* given an acceptible amount of their money to charity (which is both very judgemental and also not necessarily true).

5. Unless you want to work for nonprofits your entire life I don't think your life goal should be to help the needy as much as humanly possible. I am not saying don't help the needy, I'm just saying that you can be a wonderful person without making that your absolute #1 priority in life. Personally, I think having a job you love day in and day out is higher up on the list of priorities.","1398902481"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","My definitive guide to centuries:

Don't be nervous, its just a bike ride. It'll be over before you know it. You'll probably latch on to a group for parts, enjoy it but don't get sucked into a paceline that feels like its too fast for you because you'll burn out quickly. This is why its good to have a HR monitor. So you can see your enthusiasm doesn't match your effort.

Keep riding every day leading up to the ride itself. With two weeks to go, you should ideally already have ridden a century last weekend weekend and 20-40 mile rides every day during the week. If you can do a century this weekend, that'll really help, and then take it easy (but keep riding) the week before.

Day before - do a 2 hour ride with a couple of hills that gets you out of the saddle. But not long climbs and don't attack them or do crazy sprints or anything. Open up the legs and your heart rate. Spin home and stretch for a while but stretch lightly - google ""manualforspeed stretching""

Pace is important, but saddle time is more important. You want to get your body used to being on the bike for a long time. Since its not a race, don't worry about intervals or anything like that. Don't take more than one day off in a row.

Keep eating on the day of and make sure you eat a good protein and carb packed breakfast but don't eat anything new and don't stuff your self within minutes of starting. Eat about an hour before you ride, especially if the ride starts on a hill.

I also recommend you start doing pushups right away, every other day. It will help with your arms and back being tired and achy after mile 60. Increase your number of pushups each session. Give yourself the day off from pushups the day before.

If you haven't tried chamois cream, go get some. There are a few different brands but I've had a tube of DZnuts for a few years now and its nice. Just don't get it on your dick or in your butthole. Although sometimes I put some in my crack because the hairs chafe. A lot of my friends use Rapha and Mad Alchemy. That'll help chaffing with your butt and undercarriage. I put a double toothpaste dab on each sit bone area and then smear it forward on my undercarriage.

Just drink water for the first half, and then fill one of your bottles up with an energy drink and keep the other water. Don't be afraid to pack too much food in your jersey. Stuff a half eaten bar or energy blocks under the cuff of your shorts to access it quicker. I don't like Gu/Gels. Its what I imagine oral sex is like for a woman.

When you're done, chug a recovery drink, coconut water, cytomax, skratch labs or drink some chocolate milk. Soda tastes really good after a long ride, especially with real sugar, and chips but a protein bar is good too, you can find Clif Builders Bars at most 7-11s or safeways. 

If for some reason your ride finishes up hill, try to do 10-15 minutes of a light ride to cool down before you fall off the bike.

The next day try to get a ride in, shoot for about 20 miles in the small ring. And then resume training!","1398902482"

&gt; I do think that if children can't meet standards they shouldn't pass until they do.

First of all, that's literally against the law in some cases (ESE, ESOL). 

Second of all, we have no real way to determine if kids ""can"" meet standards - just if they did on one day.

I don't think kids who don't complete coursework should pass (and sometimes they do, even in HS) but no one who has experience working with diverse populations of students would ever follow the suggestion that we pass/fail on standardized tests alone.

All this plan would lead to is less safety in Elementary and Middle Schools (it's not really safe to educate 18 year olds with 12 year olds en masse or 15 year olds with 5 year olds) a greater number of high school dropouts, especially among ESOL and ESE populations.","1398902484"

I believe EC said the removing of vouching will impact multiple thousands across the country (17,000 if I remember the last article about it). Yes you are right they are people trained to handle it, which is why EC's suggestion on fixing the discrepancies with vouching (discrepancies != fraudulent voting) was to appointed better trained individuals to handle the vouching.

I just want an inch and a half on the top, one inch on the sides and back, and no sideburns, followed by awkward silence and the internal panic of trying to remember if I cleaned out my ears that morning when they start doing stuff around my ears.

But I did something new yesterday. I engaged in the crappy small-talk. And for some reason the hair dresser seemed to be asking ""Is this okay?"" and ""Is this how you want it?"". So I finally told her that clearly she felt something was off and that she (hopefully) went to some sort of school for this and to just tell me her opinion. She told me I should taper down the sideburns more. She was willing to let me walk out of the salon looking like a puffy-sideburned dumbass. I forgive her, but really, to all hair stylists/dressers, I get that you might get a lot of people who know exactly what they want and stuff, but if you get some random guy who clearly is asking for something stupid, just tell us.","1398902487"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;It is more complicated then that. As all the people who were making 7 dollars an hour are now making 10-15, what do you suppose that will do? 

Assuming 100% passed to consumers (not impossible, but in many cases highly unlikely as competition will keep companies from passing it all on, but let's just say the do 100%), you'll see a small price increase on goods. Depends on the company, but for Walmart or McDonald's, it'd be nominal. 

&gt;This also fucks the guy who is making 16 dollars an hour, he was making double minimum wage,  now he is barely making over it. Everythings costs will go up, and all companies will have to raise prices to cover new expenses. It doesnt change anything. 

You seem to be under the impression that 100% of cost is employee expense. It's not. Far, far from it. As a matter of fact, McDonald's corporate spends about 17% of income on employee cost (and that includes management that makes well more than minimum wage). More commonly, though, fast food (usually franchises) be about 30% of cost is employees.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Feed it, but otherwise ignore it. We have one indoor cat that started out a feral sub-adult but eventually, it got used to my husband enough that he could catch it. He brought it home, and in time, Miffy became the best cat I've ever known (and I don't care much for cats). He's terrified of anyone else, but adores my husband and me. Before you think, ""Yeah, but that wasn't an adult,"" my husband also has four outdoor cats, three of which were feral (the fourth belonged to neglectful neighbours, so when we moved, we asked if we could take the cat). Of those three, one is a cantankerous old tom that the vet estimates around 12 years old. He has cataracts, a scarred front paw, battered ears, and always looks slightly dirty. Ol' Kitteh moved into the crawl space under our old house about three years ago because there was a torn piece of screening where he could get in. At first, he'd just run away if he saw anyone, but my softhearted husband started feeding the old guy, and eventually, Ol' Kitteh moved to the front porch. You still couldn't touch him, and he'd hiss at me (I don't feed the cats), but you could get within a few feet of him, and he did use the heated house we provided. Eventually, he'd let my husband gently pet him, but still hissed at me. I simply ignored him and went about my business, day after day, and he got used to me. He stopped hissing, and in time, he'd let me get close, then eventually, he'd let me carefully pet him. We live in a different house now, but we brought all of the cats, including Ol' Kitteh. He lives on the patio now, and when I go outside, if he feels like getting scritchies, he'll walk over to me and wait. He still doesn't meow, but he doesn't hiss, either, and he's got a big, rumbling purr. I may not be a cat person, but I like that old guy; I hope he has a few more years left in him.

TL;DR  Feed it, and let the cat come to you. The way to most cat's hearts is through their stomachs, and in cat language, ignoring means ""I like you."" That is probably why a cat will almost always go to the non-cat person in the room; because *that* is the person who's ignoring him. ","1398902489"

But the most important thing is that you do what you feel comfortable with, and you figure out what makes your sex life great with your husband.

I awoke to my alarm clock just as it decided it was going to do me.

The next night I prepared to fight it in my dreams and it never showed itself again. A person I met with abilities and more experience commented, more or less, that it was unable to hurt me unless I gave it the power to do so. It used the brutal imagery and the terror of the hunt to shock me, it needed me to believe it could hurt me.

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","I can't really give an answer to your question, but maybe this will still help; I was prepared doing this the hard way again as I didn't know about any good spots back on ps2, until I found out about it here. Now I've never had any trouble with this, but controlling the timing makes it so much better, and faster, which I don't think you can do when you do the wall/statue trick as lightning stays random.
I did it last night on my second try using the crater trick shown in the videos here, as I found the timing very easy with that. You basically walk straight into the small crater and dodge always at the same time and you'll hop back out. Walk back around two small dark circles in front of the crater (found that a nice point of reference) and just run straight back in again. You can really get into a rhythm like that, making it a bit less stressful.
What was hardest about it (just like ten years ago) is keeping count and don't get jumpy. First time I got jumpy around 120 dodges and pressed to early on the sound of lightning in the distance. To avoid that you could turn off sound and just focus on the flash instead. Turning off other lights can help with this too I find.
Second time I got it but I lost found several times and ended up overshooting by 60... But better safe than sorry.

One last thing; if you get it, don't save until you have the sigil or it'll reset. You probably know this already but I'd rather be the tenth to tell you than taking the risk of you not knowing this!

Good luck!","1398902495"

Then your experience probably didn't involve many big corps. Loads of proprietary software there involve extensive client side desktop UI that uses java. Ask around.

Being able to pull out a decent GUI without going insane or having to jump through fire-rings is an important selling point for a lot of dev-teams. Clojure can do that (and even if using html/js it gives you clojurescript to help), haskell can't (meaning it can do GUI, but clearly makes it a lot more difficult than what most devs are used to or care to cope with).","1398902502"

Society's hatred of ugly or fat women. Take a look at the comments on any article talking about Lena Dunham. Or the SNL facebook page comments about her. This is just one example. Her character takes her clothes off a lot on GIRLS. Personally, I think she is amazing and cute. But people (critics and average people alike) say, violently, that she needs to stop because it's not attractive and doesn't get them hard/wet. Not only do they think a woman being naked has no point other than titillation, they are ANGRY when it has a point other than titillation. Our culture expects women to be thin and beautiful. The ones who aren't are expected to be apologetic and depressed about it. If they are not, the reaction is rage. It's just entitlement to women's bodies and faces as eye-candy/sex objects.

This also goes doubly for women of color. Or transwomen. If you don't try to fit the status quo, you get violence and rage, in the case of women.","1398902503"

Did your doctor tell you that you have to cut out a bunch of foods? Because a lot of the warnings against certain things are just super over-cautious. Maybe your doctor is old school or really worried about liability. My doctor told me I can eat whatever I want. The only thing he said was to limit consumption of those certain fish high in mercury (like tuna, swordfish, mackerel and some other two). But he said sushi, deli food, etc is totally fine if you're comfortable with the place you get it from. And really, who eats from somewhere, pregnant or not, where they're like ""hmmm, this place looks unclean""?

As for the massage, my doctor didn't mention anything about them, but I found this page from the American Pregnancy Association that says they're usually okay: http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/prenatalmassage.html

Maybe you can find someone in your area that's certified in prenatal massage. I hope you feel better soon, and if you haven't already, come join us over at /r/babybumps :) I vent there on a weekly basis, lol.","1398902508"

\
&gt;Cuccia’s careless remark has passed into history as the catalyst for Mussolini’s war on the Mafia. When Mussolini firmly established his power in January 1925, he appointed Cesare Mori as the Prefect of Palermo in October 1925 and granted him special powers to fight the Mafia.[36] Mori formed a small army of policemen, carabinieri and militiamen, which went from town to town, rounding up suspects. To force suspects to surrender, they would take their families hostage, sell off their property,[38] or publicly slaughter their livestock.[39] By 1928, over 11,000 suspects were arrested.[40] Confessions were sometimes extracted through beatings and torture. Some mafiosi who had been on the losing end of Mafia feuds voluntarily cooperated with prosecutors,[41] perhaps as a way of obtaining protection and revenge. Charges of Mafia association were typically leveled at poor peasants and gabellotti (farm leaseholders), but were avoided when dealing with major landowners.[42] Many were tried en masse.[43][44] More than 1,200 were convicted and imprisoned,[45] and many others were internally exiled without trial.[46]

That being said, I thought that product was a great idea.  I would take it a step further, I would require it be installed in anybodies car with a probationary license and anyone who has received a ticket for texting while driving would also be required to install it in their car.

Of course this wont happen in the near future, but overall its not a bad idea.  I dont see any downside tbh.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Alrighty then, here we go:

Speed/mobility/reaction time: Parker has the proportionate speed of a spider. Parker can run at least 60 mph (which is Captain America's top speed who is considered a ""peak human"" vs. Spider-Man's super-human status), and using his webs he's even faster. This also means he has roughly 40x the reflexes of an average human without spider-sense. When combined with the Spider-Sense, he has instantaneous reaction times, even when he can't actually see the danger. He's been depicted as able to dodge lasers or point-blank sniper fire. Even with his Spider Sense incapacitated, he's been able to defeat multiple meta-humans through skill. Advantage: Parker.

Strength: Parker is at least a 10 tonner. He has shown regular 20 ton strength feats, but that might've been retconned after Brand New Day, I'm not sure on that. When angry, he has been able to lift 35+ tons. This is pretty self-explanatory. Advantage: Spider-Man

Stamina: Peter's superhuman physiology allows him to exert himself for hours before showing signs of tiring. ""Exert"" in this case meaning fight for his life. Advantage: Unclear

Durability: Parker has recently ridden a missile into the ground and come out wounded, but alive. He has (again) traded blows with Hulk. He fought the Juggernaut. He fights Rhino. Peter Parker takes on consistently heavier hitters than Bats does. Parker is resilient enough to break his enemies' bones by standing there and letting them punch him. He has to roll with punches so that even meta-humans like The Punisher don't break every bone in their hand on his face. Several of his main enemies regularly throw grenades at him, and he is able to tank these explosions with little difficulty. Pretty sure the Advantage goes to Spidey.

Sidenote: Parker's webs are insanely durable and use an incredibly strong adhesive. Some webbing would be more than enough to hold Bats. The webs have a tensile strength of 120 pounds per square millimeter in cross section which puts it about even with Kevlar if my Google conversions are accurate. 

There is no way a batarang to the face is even going to distract Spider-Man (who can dodge lasers, automatic gunfire, and point blank sniper fire), and he can track short range using only his spider-sense, or more precisely and over a longer range through use of the spider tracers that he always has on him. 

I don't know what you mean by being shown as unable to fight the Hulk, but he's been at that level for many many years, and Spider-Man is a pretty consistent hero. He has been thrown through buildings, smashed with cars, and punched in the face by 100 tonners like Rhino and Hulk for a long time. This isn't inflation or power creep. It's Spider-man.

I do agree with the Intelligence vs Wisdom thing, but I wouldn't say that they would be more than a few points away from each other in either category.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Wowza.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  Does she have a history of violence or harming other people?  How creepy that she'd drop it off at your home that far away.

Since there has been so much back-and-forth already, I imagine uninviting her would potentially make things worse (since -- again, I don't know her at all, but I imagine -- there is a chance she'd still show up, but angrier).  

The way I managed my (low-functioning, incredibly volatile) BPD mother at my wedding was to hug and greet her like I did everyone else and then avoid her as much as possible.  I had a smile plastered on my face the entire day and several contingency plans in place for if she started a fight, faked a heart attack, or tried any of her usual tricks, and there were hired coordinators and wedding attendees involved so that I wouldn't have to do any of this on my own.  I think this plan would work well on most dysfunctional parents who crave attention and drama since it basically assures they get none.  My mother ended up leaving before the reception even started, so everything went better than expected.  

It sounds like your mother wants an excuse to be mad at you and badmouth you, based on her refusal to believe she was invited.  I would advise pretending nothing she says or does bothers you.  If you have to respond to something she says, make it as brief and matter-of-fact as possible.  And if she tests your boundaries, try not answering at all.  How much longer until the wedding day?

"trance","t5_2qi03","This a trance track from my 3 screen live electronic audio/video trance set. It was released on vinyl on EBM records in USA in 2002 and also includes a breaks remix by DJ-X.

It introduces my sequencer in the show, which is still called Nova to this day. Although I used a PC for all live sequencing, I sampled the ""Victoria"" voice from the PPC on which I originally ran the first version of the VJ program Xpose, prior to co-developing the custom midi controlled freeware visuals program Midivid for the PC. The tracks is all made on classic hardware.
I used the same gear for live as I did for releases; In this case a Kurzweil 2000 rack, Alesis DM5, Roland MKS50, Yamaha TX81Z, a Novation Bassstation, and a windows 3.1 PC running cubase 1 for windows. It was mixed live without automation on the same mixer I used for live, a mackie 24/4 with an spx90 and a Midiverb2 for effects.

I originally lost the DAT master for this release, but it turns out EBM still had one so they sent it to me and I can now share it online with friends &amp; fans. So a big thanks to EBM &amp; DJ-X for helping me recover this lost master. The vinyl is also still out there for the Trance collectors.

I remastered it at Canmarc for levels but otherwise left it intact. Like all my other soundcloud stuff, it's free for download. 

Enjoy.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Your tax system doesn't do anything to change the how regressive it is.  The tax bills will just stay about the same, because the roads still need to be maintained, all you have done is shift the tax from small incremental fees when you buy gas to larger lump sums when you buy a car or renew licensing.  At best you will have created a flat tax and we all know how well that is projected to work out for the poor.

Again, you pick things to respond to that fit into how you are trying portray me.  You ignore reasonable suggestions and attack me personally.  I grew up poor, my family lived paycheck to paycheck.  Just because you have a chip on your shoulder doesn't mean everyone does.  For what it's worth the car I drive (a rusty '98 Subaru, only specifying so you don't try to accuse me of having it handed to me) cost me $2500...  

No not everyone can afford a new car, I was using it as an example just like you picking the most expensive new electric car.  So stop buying shitty mileage old Ford Broncos, and get an old Ford Fiesta.  You can buy a fuel efficient cheap car if you stop acting like the only used cars available are SUVs or full size sedans.","1398902524"

"backpacking","t5_2qpcz","I'd recommend the chuck keiper trail in central pa. It's part of the Sproul state forest.  It consists of two connected but independent loops. Each loop is about 30 miles. You can do just one or both without leaving the trail. My girlfriend and I backpacked through there in September and we did not encounter another person the entire time. It took us five days to do both loops but I imagine you could easily stretch it out.  Water is plentiful; you're hiking adjacent to a stream most of the time. And we saw some incredible wildlife - bald eagles, coyotes, and  few timber rattlers.

Just be forewarned - it is some serious back country. The trail suffers from lack of maintenance in a few places, and because of that, it can get a little treacherous at times.","1398902524"

"NarutoBattleGrounds","t5_2wjmc","Tonight... you, Grounded Thunder..... MAN! What a fast team. But that's not enough and I'll tell you all why. I'll start with the strategy. GT is going to target the least intelligent of Sogeki and Fenex, which is a little funny because we are the same above average INT and both have greater intelligence separately than either Hei or Hozuki. According to Hand Bananas strategy Sogeki is going to drop back and Fenex is going to create a diversion, so GT will most likely be coming after Fenex. Damn that speed but its not going to win unless we are racing. Luckily Fenex is better equipped to handle two opponents because of his Passive ambidexterity. With the ground covered in fire that's also being turbocharged by wind, both of GT will find it difficult to get to Fenex without taking damage, and if/when they do they will find their ninjutsu/battle awareness outmatched in quality and jutsus matched in number. Hokuzi is weaker in taijutsu so hes less of a threat up close than Hei. Hei can beat Fenex up close, but getting up close puts Hei in the range of 1 or 2 wind claws and explosive fireballs to combo up with, its not wise to get that close to Fenex but with 2 INT he might anyway, also genjutsu. Water trap and earth spike wont be as effective as GT hopes in catching Fenex with 5-6 NIN vs 7-8 NIN, while Sogeki is covering Fenex with ice dome (nin 5) and suppressive fire (str 4-7). Now from GT's offense and to HB's offense. While GT is dancing with Fenex, Sogeki is going to be able to fire his wind arrows unabated, and strategizing with Fenex many arrows will hit their mark. The enemy is fast but lower INT and cooldown times will allow HB to time their movements. GT can travel under ground and teleport but all in a sea of flames with no discernible way to extinguish them. Switch your sights from Fenex to Sogeki and you'll find a clay-more before you find him and after that you'll find Ice mirror assassination, plenty of arrows and maybe even an ultimate if you're lucky. 
TL;DR When GT stops moving to attack they don't have an effective offense against Hand Banana.","1398902530"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I like this question because I have similar thoughts when I look at people whose lack of physical attraction is brought on by themselves. Why don't they just unfuck themselves? The answer is obvious, of course, (no willpower, victimizing themselves, etc) but that is another topic.

 I don't think society(women) can handle a world where everyone is their best self. Think back to sexual markets for a moment.

**WOMEN**---&gt;  Looks, fertility, youth. Social status ***MAYBE*** (no one wants to be seen with trash)

**MEN**---&gt;  Money, status, social proof, talent, physique and, yes, looks.

These are how each gender is judged in the sexual market-place. Notice a difference? Men can prove themselves in multiple areas, whereas women have three things, which, to be honest, are all more or less the same thing. Now enter future medicine and procedures where every single person can magically be the best looking person they can be. For men(in general), this is great! We have one area evened out for everyone **AND** all potential mates are HB10's, 9's, and 8's. It doesn't matter for the majority that they can no longer stand out for physical qualities because:

A)They were probably in the 80%

B) They have other ways to stand out.

They can get a good job, they can still display leadership qualities, they can still have a large circle of friends.

Now, let's look at women.

A) They can't stand out for physical beauty; all is equal now.

B) Men generally don't care about a woman's education, outside of not being an imbecile.

C) Their friends don't make them more attractive. If anything, more competition, especially considering they are equal.

D) I think a woman with money might be an attractive offer to some males but definitely not all.

It'll be like when rich men started going overseas to find women, but x1000. Women will bitch and moan about how they feel objectified, how men are pigs for wanting this and creating this (I promise, we'll catch the blame for this one way or another.) and just generally hate the entire idea.

And it totally makes sense. You don't see poor people and women bitching about the government moving closer and closer towards a completely socialized republic. Why? Because they **benefit** from it. Whenever they pendulum shifts in the other direction you'll see everyone who isn't getting what they've grown accustomed to grab their pitchforks and soap boxes and bitch about it. I think instead of evening out the (imagined) SMV gap, you see it **shift** in the other direction towards men.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","I really find it humorous that the Vancouver subreddit has a double standard towards wealthy asians- especially those that are young drivers of exotic cars. 

On one hand, this subreddit is partially sympathetic to longboarders bombing down a hill (not to say that you are pro or against it). I'll note that longboards do not have ceramic brakes. Yet there are a never ending stream of snarky comments, such as yours, to young wealthy asian car owners. Although the supercar has absurd performance specs, that is not to say it is in anyway more or less dangerous than the average speeding car on.... almost every single road.

Just because the car is more expensive than the run-of-the-mill learners car most kids start with, does not mean it will kill you any more so. A crash is a crash. A Toyota Prius can just as easily hurt you- it's just a lot cheaper.

Restricting cylinders or power to weight ratio (a suggestion which I find absurdly hilarious) will not lower accidents at all.

I'd be happy to look over statistics of learners driving moderately priced cars and the amount of accidents they cause if you could provide the data.

1. Prio VR or STEM for actors
2. Virtuix or Omni treadmills for actors
3. Oculus Rifts for actors
4. High quality head mikes and earphones for actors

Put the suited up actors into the virtual warehouse or city and have them go through the script. Motion capture the Prio VR or STEM feed and record the audio of individual actors. Once you complete the play, run the actors through again a few times to create non-interactive audience members. 

I really like this idea as a virtual play. If you ever played Shenmue on Dreamcast, you'll know that one of the advertised points about that game is than EVERY character in the game, even the store NPCs had a daily routine. You could follow the flower shop lady from her house in the morning, to her job and finally back to her house witnessing her daily routine. While you would not do that for every character, you could do it should you choose. That little bit made that small area of Dobuita feel very large.","1398902537"

I would suggest getting color-matched at Sephora (it's free and it actually works!) and then getting samples if you can't make up your mind. I personally use MUFE HD and I absolutely love it, it's $42 so it's above your price range but not by a huge amount/modestly priced for how nice it is. 

Also, your foundation does seem to be too yellow for you. I have warm-leaning neutral skin and I almost always find that foundation is too yellow on me. MUFE #15 is slightly pink but not *pink* and it matches me much better. Maybe try a neutral foundation color?","1398902537"

    Of course this depends on subject but it still runs through it.
School is not only free in Sweden but after you turn 16 you get payed to go to school. It's not much but something.

  As of 2006 the right wing goverment is pushing for grades earlier and earlier mixed with a more strict school with alot of tests and homework.

2. I like Finlands style. Their school system correlate with my view on schools in many ways. If they havn't changed it since I last read about it that is :)

3. To  me the American shool system seem backwards and bad. It forces people in to dept and making the differences of income bigger.

 About 2 and 3: I don't realy know enough about them to have a opinion that I could defend more then losely but there it is :)

4. America( I asume you talk about USA here, if you are talking about the continent please exuse me) as a Country is amazing, its so big and full of things. I would like to go there some day just to look around at everything.
With that said alot of the politics that America is doing I strongly disagree with. Also many Americans seem, to me over friendly. I mean Sweden isn't the best place to be up close and friendly and American kinda is so that would be weird I think.

5. I'm not sure of the English name, but in Sweden its called "" Svärdet &amp; Spiran"". Wich translates to ""The Swords and the  scepter"".

"anime","t5_2qh22","1. It's well-written and takes itself seriously.
2. It's intelligent. The main character has to use his wits to achieve his goals, not by having everything magically happen to him via sheer force of will *cough*KIRITO*cough* Not only that, but not everything goes the main character's way. 
3. Unlike Death Note, the second half is good.
4. Secondary characters are not simply ignored, and can even die for plot points.
5. Superpower that isn't ridiculously overpowered.
6. Pacing is actually pretty good. At 50 episodes, it's longer than a standard anime, but the pacing isn't as jarring as some other animes. AoT for example started out fairly good but then it takes like five episodes to move a freaking rock. Code Geass doesn't really mess around here. 
7. It's an amazing starter anime, especially since it has one of the best dubs out there. My only problem with the entirety of the dub was the whole...""orange boy"" thing that just seemed kind of stupid. 
8. It's re-watchable. I've watched it four different times, and I say that anyone who has ever watched it and liked it should watch it a second time. You pick up on SO much more once you know what''s actually going on and where the show is going, which makes it enjoyable.

To ELI5-it, all enzymes have certain molecules (substrates) that they interact with to facilitate a chemical reaction.

The ""uni bi"" part means one more substrate binds to the protein and two products are then released.

"uhccourtroom","t5_2yodn","**No action due to insufficient evidence.** It has to be the person who is having the visual glitch to relog.

The both of us see it and when the person with the visual glitch relogged, it went back to normal for the both of us. And this has happened about 3 times to us. In my opinion, it might have something to do with a fence-glitch in bukkit. Like the auto-eating and bow glitch on fences. And if dans actually recorded him after he was banned from the server and came back, it still won't fix it. I think that if you crash, get kicked, or banned and the fact that you still have your chat doesn't change anything, it was like you never left the server and still have the visual glitch.

The steps required to perform such a task are already enough of a complex maneuver that it can't exactly happen by accident. The only way it would happen, is if someone simply didn't know that closing a game would...well... close the game, or they simply didn't care. 

In the prior scenario, as I said, it doesn't just happen by accident; they literally told the computer to close the game, and didn't expect it to close the game; you will only solve this by being more considerate and not fucking with each other.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Five actual, Morrison, turned as his tracker, a man named James spoke quietly, ""Can't tell for sure.  At least a dozen people were here for a while.  I think six people carried it out, I think they were led by one person.  These tracks are awfully soft, though.  Small folk.  Other than when ther were carrying the thing they barely left tracks at all.""

""But you can follow them.""  It wasn't quite a question.

James nodded, ""Yeah, not a problem as long as they're carrying it, but I'm telling you, these tracks were left by folk used to this place.""

Morrison pursed his lips in thought for a moment.  James was talking about natives.  He reset his radio to transmit to Dillon only, and sent the message, 'Natives?'.  After a few moments Dillons responded with 'Caution.'  Morrison was less than amused.  Of course he was going to be careful.  Also with the word was the tacit notification that he was to continue.  He looked up from the radio, ""Lets get going boys.  James, you've got the lead.""

They followed the trail.  The trail was left by what seemed to be a half dozen men carryin an inordinately heavy object, but despite that, there were a few places they had to paused while James figured out which direction they headed.  It worried Morrison.  His other two men said nothing, and kept their eyes on the jungle, but everyone felt the growing sense of disquiet.

That made it all the worse when the attack came.  Morrison's team were professionals one and all.  They'd seen combat before, and been through jungles before.  They knew what to look for, and knew better than to take chances this far from anything that might be called modern medicine.  And they had never seen Allin's hunters.  Never even suspected they had moved into position.  Only Morrison's quick reactions kept him from going down with the rest of his team in the first volley, and he had no idea what had urged him to duck, but he'd hurled himself to the ground and still caught the edge of something to the side of his head.

He recovered quickly, and rolled into a crouch.  All around him he saw small brown men materializing out of the jungle.  They wore an assortment of cloths and he was too harried to take careful note.  They moved like greased lightning, one had already reached a downed man and brought down something that looked vaguely like an axe.  Another of his men had a short spear through his leg, but he was already raising his pistol.  James lay unmoving on his back, but no evidence as to why.  Morrison brought his own pistol up with the speed and smooth timing of long practice and snapped off a shot at the native chopping up his man.  The terrible thunder of the weapon shook the jungle, and the natives, almost as one, let out sounds of surprise and terror.  Their attack didn't relent, however, not immediately anyway.  It took Morrison's other man to also start firing before the jungle men melted away again.

Morrison was breathing heavily, the entire attack had lasted only moments, but his heart thundered in his chest and he cast fevered looks at the jungle.  It took him a moment to sort himself out, then he shot a glance at his wounded man. ""Hills, how bad is it?""

""Not sure boss, I'm not bleed much, so maybe it missed the arteries, but I don't want to pull it out yet.""

""How is Tim?""

The answer to that question took a few moments, ""Gone.  Those fuckers did a number on him.""

Morrison looked away from the jungle to the one native they'd taken down.  The one who'd finished Tim.  He was unmoving.  ""Check James.""

Another few moments, ""He's coming around boss.  Looks like something rang his bell pretty good.  Boss, does that hurt?""

Morrison blinked at Hills before he noticed the side of his face felt cool.  He touched it and his hand came away bloody.  ""No... head wounds bleed a lot.  Do what you can for yourself and James.  I've got to contact One.""

Keeping his eyes on the jungle, he fiddled with the radio, and took a breath to try to explain what had just happened.

-----o-----

Their flight from the ogres had taken them far.  It had been a blind flight, but they all knew the jungle well, and gathered together as much on instinct as anything.  None of them wanted much to speak, but Allin was the leader.  He knew it was his burden, ""Come.  We must go back, tell the chief about this.""

Their trip to meet the ogres had also been quiet, but it had been the silence of anticipation, a predator moving to take the prey.  But the trip back... Allin still didn't know what had happened.  The ogres had harnessed thunder itself and used it to strike down Tumas, who they'd left behind.  Rawul was bleeding too, and although there was no arrow, thorn, or spear, it looked like there had been one, and that it had been driven through the muscle of his arm.  Still, thought Allin, the ogres were mortal, however they'd armed themselves.  Tumas had slain one of them, and two others had fallen, although their chests seemed to be somehow invulnerable, his own spear had slid off one of them as rain off a leaf.

Chief Wilipi met him at the village edge, impatient as ever.  He glanced at Rawul's injured arm, then back to Allin, ""What happened?""

""We took them by surprise, my chief.  Killed one, and maimed two others, but...""  Allin swallowed, ""The ogres command thunder.  They struck down Tumas, and Rawul bears the mark as well.""

Wilipi brushed Allin aside and took rough hold of Rawul's arm, examining it.  Rawul's face flashed only the most brief of winces, and he certainly did not object.  ""Did you leave anyone to watch their progress?""

""No, my chief.""

Wilipi whirled on him, ""So now these thunder-wielding ogres are wandering the jungle with impunity?""  He advanced menacingly, ""How stupid can you be?!  Send someone immediately!  And get Rawul to the priest.""

""I will take Rawul.  You two,"" he pointed at two other men who'd gone with him, ""Go back.  Watch the ogres, but do not move against them.  Be unseen.""

The two men were obviously unhappy, but nodded and departed.  He arrived at the obelisk only a few minutes later, Rawul's arm now drenched in blood.  Anka shot up on seeing him and rushed over.  ""What happened?""

Allin again explained the encounter, and the ogres' strange power.  Meanwhile, Anka bandaged Rawul's arm, rubbing the injury with his salves and wrapping it carefully.  Afterwards, he turned to Allin, ""So the ogres have thunder.  There are but three remaining?""

Allin nodded, and Anka was thoughtful for a few moments, ""No.  I don't think so.""

""What do you mean?""

""If the gods' enemy desires the obelisk so dearly as to arm his servants with thunder, I do not imagine that he would send only four.  There will be others.""

""Perhaps he could only send four.""

""Perhaps...""  Anka turned towards the obelisk, running his hands lightly across the impossible smoothness of it again, ""But I do not believe that.  There will be more ogres.  But they did not see you before the attack?""

""No.""

""Then the gods are with us.  No power is useful unless it can be directed, and we alone hold that.  The ogres can die.  They will die.""

-----o-----

Jake sat with a large, cumbersome headset keeping him informed of the pilot's progress and communications.  There were several other choppers bringing in men and equipment, and although the pilot was flying nap of the earth, he was experienced enough to be only a little discomforted.  Eventually they arrived at the drop zone, which, to his eyes, looked identical to the jungle that had been whipping by for the last several hours.  There was no way to put the chopper down, and dropping the equipment would be a nightmare, but the river was too far to be practical.  He gestured, ordering the first two men down.  They would fastrope down, examine the area, and coordinate the drop around where the thing had landed.

The men went out, and despite the heavy canopy, made it to the jungle floor without too many difficulties.  Their first report, area secure, was to be expected.  Their second, that the thing wasn't there, was not.  He listened to their report, someone had beaten them to it.  Probably the same people who'd killed his men earlier.  Just as well, Jake was looking forward to carving the price of their lives out of a few recalcitrant individuals.

He dropped two more men to help secure the area, and changed his deployment profile.  No equipment for now, first they had to find the enemy and deal with them.  Then they could worry about airlifting the damn thing out.  He went down himself after coordinating the remainder of the drops.

It was time to go hunting.  They had probably heard his birds come in, and might even have a rough idea of where they dropped, but it wasn't going to help them.  If they got this far undetected, they couldn't have much in the way of numbers, and he'd bet on his men in an even fight against anyone on the planet, let alone when he had them outnumbered.","1398902545"

The one-armed-gnome was a dual-axe DPS type, so no change in weapon type, just one less weapon swinging.  I suspect that happened before I got the military into full plate, which didn't happen until I transitioned to bronze.

And yes, I know where the soldiers all were during that attack, three where asleep and one was grabbing a drink.  The problem was having all of that line up.  I had a training station set up at the entrance, and these were full time military.  At the time this happened, rooms were pretty basic 3x3 with a pine bed.  Since then I added engraved stone floors and a birch dresser, and haven't had a repeat, though being down to one gnome isn't that unusual.  I'll probably add in the statue before I start digging up iron (I'm currently exploring for it but not touching it, I've got enough ore to make 1000 bronze bars, good enough for now).

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","On the difference between magic and science: If it follows a pattern of cause and effect amenable to the scientific method (repeatable, makes predictions that can be falsified) it is science, regardless of the window dressing. If it doesn't follow those principals it is something else. In 616 there are definitely examples of the latter, by Strange, Iron Man's magic suit in the latest arc, etc.

On magic and technology: if it can be turned into a useful device that behaves predictably enough to have utility, then it is technology, regardless of the ""power source"" that drives it. In 616, Asgardian devices that work the same way every time are technology, even if their operating principals derive from magic, or ""non-traditional science."" By this definition, Asgard uses science of a highly esoteric variety.

Science vs. Magic arguments are often made by Reed and Tony, but even they have found exceptions to the scientific schema they generally use. Doom is a great example of this: he's nearly Reed equal in science and there are techniques and methods that he chooses not to call science but magic.

TL;DR- if it follows regular, predictable rules, then it is science, even if it doesn't look like guys in lab coats. If those rules haven't been discovered yet, it's science we don't understand yet. If it doesn't follow those rules (more likely if it _can't_ follow those rules somehow) it is magic. ","1398902550"

"surfing","t5_2qmde","I guess I meant ""secure"" rather than ""safe""... As in ""I'm in control"" vs a boat driver or the wind. The kite seems easier in my head. Like a trampoline and a wakeboard combined with a kite. Idk... It's just not what I had in mind. I wanna work for my speed. And the boat, well that obviously doesn't meet those needs/ desires. I just really love the movement and fluidity of my snowboard and I see it translated best into surfing and maybe longboarding... But asphalt scares me to death. So surfing just seems more natural than anything for summer fun :)

I've paid $35 for a long time at a decent enough hairdresser, but my last haircut I got as a gift, and it was $125. At first I thought it'd be a one time experience, but I'll be going there again. The attention to detail there is incredible, they come with suggestions to suit you, they give styling suggestions, and you get some drinks to enjoy during your haircut, which takes an hour. You also get to get it touched up for free ever few weeks until your next haircut, which makes the price more bearable.

It should be noted though, that I don't live in the US = generally higher costs + no tipping

2. You have a simple hygiene problem. Maybe you're not washing your vulva well (use plain, unscented soap and water), or maybe you're washing inside your vagina and disrupting the normal (good) vaginal bacteria.

3. Your SO just doesn't like your smell. You could try changing your diet (e.g. drinking a lot of pineapple juice is supposed to improve taste).

I thought for sure there would be a good guide somewhere, but Google is mostly turning up crap. I did find a few things, though:

- [Genital Odor](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/genital-odor) from Go Ask Alice.
- [Keeping your vagina clean and healthy.](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/vagina-health/Pages/keep-vagina-clean.aspx) From the UK's National Health Service.

"cripplingalcoholism","t5_2s68b","I'm down 25 lbs over the past 4 months, with another 15-20 (ideally 25) to go. Heart problems run in my family too, so I understand where you're coming from. My grampa died at 60 from congestive heart failure, and he had all the same vices that I do, smoking, drinking, and **all** the fried foods. If that doesn't get me cancer probably will, so I'm half-heartedly trying to make it to at least 65. 

first of all, ""dry"" wines are fantastic. ~100 calories a glass, and very little sugar. if you don't like wine now, you can learn to love it. i hated it when i first started drinking it, now it's all i really enjoy. stop drinking pop, beer and cider :(. I eat a big assed salad with some chickpeas or a can of tuna or something like that for lunch, I try to keep lunch under about 300 calories if I can. Dinner, I honestly eat whatever the fuck I want, but try to keep it under about 700 calories (unless it's taco night). My goal daily intake is sub 1700 calories. 

I stopped snacking for the most part when I got ""hardcore"" about losing weight, and honestly I don't really miss it, if I just need to ""munch"" on something mid afternoon I eat a couple pickles or a few olives or something like that. I still feel like punching someone in the throat for chips a few times a week, but I don't need them (that's what I try to convince myself anyway). I'd sooner have an extra glass of wine than a cookie I'll put it that way. 

Honestly, I can't stop drinking either, so I cut back on everything else, and it works.

I also use caloriecount.com instead of fit day. The mobile app sucks, and I have to input a lot of the foods I eat manually, but there's a social aspect to it (calorie camp) which kind of keeps me accountable. I don't want to look bad to my ""friends"" :P No one seems to care (or maybe they don't notice) that 1/3 of my calorie intake is from booze, so that's a plus. Plus if you were on CC we could be CC friends. I find there aren't enough boozers on there for my liking :P Actually seeing what I eat was a really big eye opener for me. 

Basically this is how my intake goes. Breakfast- XL Tim Horton's Coffee with milk and 1 sugar (100 calories) Lunch - Salad of some sort or the protein portion only from dinner the night before. Sometimes a can of tuna with a bit of salad dressing (just a can of tuna with a bit of salad dressing) (~300 calories) Dinner - Chicken burger (on toasted bread not a bun. buns have too many calories) with a salad and a small handful of baked fries (like the actual serving size on the bag. 10-12 fries) or a bit of roasted meat with a baked sweet potato and salad, or like 1/2 a pork chop/steak with a big pile of sauteed kale/brussel sprouts/broccoli/etc and a baked sweet potato or a really small amount of rice (like 1/4 cup. that shit's high in calories and not very filling)...or like an omelette or something (~400-700 calories)...then I only drink whatever I have left calorie wise (usually 5-8 glasses wine, or 400-800 calories). If there's anything left I might have a couple cookies, or a SMALL BOWL of plain popcorn when I'm watching tv on the couch.  I take a multi-vitamin and a calcium supplement every day (when I remember). On the weekend I let it slide a touch and I'll have a bacon, tomato &amp; egg sandwich for breakfast, skip lunch, then have a nice dinner, but I still try to stay under 2000 calories.

Jax awaited the arrival of his opponent in the top lane, eager to see who he was dumping on next, he hadn't heard of this 'Batman' champion, but assumed he must be new to the League.  
""Ah there you are. You must be the new kid around here.""  
""Enough talk, Grandmaster. I'm here to bring you down.""  
  
Batman fires a batclaw immediately at Jax, catching him by surprise and hitting him square in the chest, stunned, Jax doesn't see Batman fly at him and land a monstrous kick on his face, knocking him back.  
Jax laughs, and Jump Strikes right on top of him, this time, Bruce is surprised and is struggling to parry Jax's Empowered blows, getting faster and faster. Bruce is starting to get beat up and manages to drop a smoke pellet and strike Jax with his cloak.  

Now the Grandmaster at Arms is disoriented and blinded by the hazy smoke that surrounds him, he barely spots a shadow out of the corner of his eye before a fist connects with his gut, half a second later, a kick to the back, elbow to the head. Jax decided he's had enough of this and begins casting Counter-Strike.  
Batman is amazed at how flawlessly Jax starts to dodge his moves, sensing a build-up of momentum, he backflips away from him before Jax can stun. Before Jax can turn and leap onto Batman again, he unleashes a flurry of Batarangs, before one firmly impales Jax in his face.

I do admire the feminists who keep plugging away, but it's much better for my blood pressure to stay away. It's not real debate, and it a pretty unfriendly board. One of my hopes was that people would discuss why they developed the views they did on a more personal level, and build some mutual understanding from there. Again, that happened with a couple people, but mostly it was just fielding ridiculous arguments. And often the arguments were so specious that it was really hard to untangle them and address the core of what was being said. It was like trying to stop a Jackson Pollock painting.

Also, my writing style appeared to be incompatible with the board. There were numerous times when I got a little jokey with ""the enemy"" in an attempt to lighten the mood, and my comment would be deemed ""insulting."" Snark is in my blood. And snark is *tone* for heaven's sake.","1398902554"

i think that's kind of the wrong way to think about it. at least for me. the reason why i love god is because *well i don't know*. it's a mystery to me.

where does love come from? do i love someone because someone else loves me? but is that always the case? god can love me and i can not love him, no? i can love someone, my mother, and just because i love her, does that mean she will love me?  

of course i believe that my love for god stems from god himself, somewhere and somehow god is the source of my love. but i don't think i love god because i think jesus is god and that he died for me. to be honest i don't know why i love god. to be honest i'm not sure i actually *do* love god, as opposed to desperate need and desire for him - which may not be at all the same thing as love, and which is easy and tempting to confuse with love.

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","I was unfortunate enough, at one time, to handle tons of condo liability claims. Your experience is typical. I handled west coast states however. 

This is a good read, and it is specific to Maryland: http://www.reesbroome.com/community/July_2012.pdf

This is also a good read specific to Maryland:
http://www.marylandcondolaw.com/the-councils-master-insurance-policy-must-insure-both-the-common-elements-and-the-units/

[Yes, insurance nerds like myself love this stuff]

Anyway, quick summary, some of which I am probably rusty on: Nearly all states have adopted a version of the uniform condo act, which has been interpreted by their courts and modified, over time, by the legislatures. 

The uniform condo act sets forth the rules by which condo associations must be organized/operated (who owns what, recordkeeping, ect).

Furthermore, the individual condo associations have their own set of cc&amp;rs (Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions) which does lots of things, but in the context of your question, can designate who is responsible for maintenance of which items in the development, who is responsible for paying, how deductibles should be handled, ect. Lots of this builds upon the Condo Act in question.

Anyway, what you are talking about is two different types of liability - a tort and contractual obligation.

First, the tort - [in ELI5 form] Did you do something wrong and, as a result of your actions, harm someone else and/or their property?

Second, the contractual obligation - Under the CC&amp;Rs are you responsible for whatever failed, for damages to your unit, the common area, other units, based on that document AND irrespective of ""fault"" (although, sometimes, the CC&amp;Rs incorporate ""fault"" into this determination because HOAs want to)? (could be one of these items, could be two, could be all...)

Did you do something wrong? Assuming your water heater wasn't in a pan, I would say yes. Your water heater was 7 years overdue for replacement and probably all corroded and shit on the bottom. If you have a house and don't want to maintain your shit that is your prerogative, but you owe your neighbors a duty of care to try and prevent foreseeable events from occurring (I'd go ahead and replace your toilet/sink supply lines while you're at it).

Second, are you contractually obligated to pay the damages? You would have to read your cc&amp;rs. It does not appear, based on the linked articles above, that you are automatically liable under state law.

Here is the rub - and where the ""game"" is played - the HOA wants to do anything and everything it can to prevent a claim from going onto the master policy. The person at your HOA management company is not to be trusted. The entire industry is notoriously shady.  So the HOA is always trying to push claims onto the unit owners, utilizing either liability or property coverages.

Maryland appears to be a couple steps ahead of many states. California is the worst(IME). I've seen claims where insured's were sent assessments for damages to the common area/units because a pipe, located in a wall 200 feet from an insured's unit burst. The association had rewrote the bylaws so that, since the pipe only serviced the insured's unit, they were responsible for the maintenance of said pipe. 1) the insured did nothing wrong and 2) maintenance of pipe(paying a plumber 100 bucks) is way different that paying for 20k in water damage.

But that doesn't stop the HOA from dropping the assessment and moving to foreclose on the insured's property if they don't pay it. Lots of times there is no coverage for these assessments under section 1 (dwelling) of an insurance policy because either 1) no damage to the insured's unit or 2) not all owners are being assessed.


I digress. Anyway, have fun.

Well regardless of what TB says, I use the videos in the same way I'd use a review. To see if I like the game.

The reason I like his videos is because he often talks about things most reviews don't. TB talks about how good the options menu is, he'll go into a bit of detail about the controls and what he specifically likes/doesn't like. Some reviewers might touch on this, but they never go into as much detail as I'm looking for.


(from your comment below)

Why put out the effort to make a comprehensive and informative video on a game as a whole when he can just read the Wikipedia article on the developer and play the first 10 minutes?

Because a lot of people don't want to buy a game just to play the first 10 minutes and see if they like it? Not many games come with demos anymore and even if they did, A lot of people (myself included) aren't going to download and play every game they think looks interesting. I'd much rather just spend 10 minutes watching a video then waiting for the game to download and learning how to play JUST to see if I might enjoy it. 

As for looking the dev up on wiki, you can always skip that part of the video. There are often annotations that take you straight to the gameplay.

That's my opinion anyway.","1398902564"

Sometimes I wish I was confident enough to congratulate people on their work too, or give them a ""good job"" or something. Especially when someone looks like they're really pushing themselves.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Seriously, their team on paper has decent players but nothing really spectacular. They just have a great team spirit and are committed to their scrappy style. Like i've said many times I think one of their main strengths is that everyone on their team can do everything. Look at a player like Arda Turan - he's 5'9 but came flying in for a header before he scored. He also tracks backs a lot, he's a great dribbler, can score goals, etc. Guys like Raul Garcia and Tiago can cover a lot of ground and defend well but also head the ball, put in a great ball, etc. But just looking at how Turan flying in for a header leads to a goal... in a tight game you'd never see a player like Iniesta or Messi doing something like that to create a goal. You look at a team like Barcelona that has so much attacking ability but with such one dimensional players that completely fall apart when Plan A doesn't work. Atletico are a fascinating team because they're almost the complete opposite of teams like Barca and Bayern who have dominated European football over the last half decade. I believe it was Tiago who said they were like Robin Hood which is quite true. Atletico have none of the star power of Barca or Real Madrid but look to have beat them for the league and very well could beat them both head to head to win the Champions League.","1398902569"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The way Canadian politics operate in practice is very simple.

There are three parties that matter: The Liberals, Conservatives and the NDP. 

The country is divided into districts. Each district is represented by a Member of Parliament (MP) who generally belong to one of the three aforementioned parties. Technically, you vote for one of the MP candidates in your district but most voters just vote for the party they want to be in power. 

The Prime Minister is the leader of the party that wins the most seats. If the party in power has over half of the seats they are a majority government, otherwise they are a minority government. 

There are three branches of government: the executive (PM), the legislative (the Senate and House of Commons) and the judicial branch (Supreme Court). 

The Senate is a ""rubber stamp"" for a variety of reasons (I can expand if you wish), which basically means they will approve anything.

The House of Commons is where the MP's sit. In Canada, party discipline is very persistent (again, I can explain why if you wish). Essentially, if you belong to the Conservative's, you will vote for whatever the Conservative's want 99.99% of the time. As I discussed previously, if you are a majority government that means you have over half of the seats.

Basically, to pass legislation, the PM proposes legislation, it gets approved by the Senate nearly automatically and by the House of Commons if they have a majority of the seats. It is then up to the Supreme Court to approve the legislation.

With a minority government, coalitions are formed (let's say between the Liberals &amp; NDP) to get enough votes to have a majority. This leads to the parties having to compromise which often leads to diluted legislation.

I hope this was clear enough for you. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.","1398902575"

It's a simple state machine, a few bus i/o sub routines, and some display code.

The firmware can be offloaded from the chip, but all one would get is machine code. The machine code could be disassembled into assembly code, but it would be difficult for a human to read, maintain, or modify.

In a device this simple, where all the code does is control other chips and respond to buttons, it's easier to write new code from scratch in a human readable language like C. It's also easier to maintain the code over the life of the device, or transfer it to other devices.

bringing in a picture of someone 'breaking' the dress code is no different than an actual person breaking the dress code, it's a matter of decency and maintaining the environment.

/u/nanagrizol argued that it is pointless because it brings more attention to it. The point of the censoring was not to make it less noticeable and decrease attention it attracts, but to maintain the atmosphere of decency and appropriate public display. 

Now, I'm not saying this isn't ridiculous - it's a little silly. Like come on now, it's a bag, it's got a hot guy (imho (no homo)) on it, who doesn't want to see yummy stuff? That's the problem - yummy stuff simply isn't appropriate for an educational environment. It's not a matter of making everyone happy or equal, but making sure the school doesn't seem like  place where you can tote a picture of a half naked model around without something going down. 

You could argue that this is another example of the notion that some entities have a goal of rendering sex and related topics taboo, unacceptable, not to be discussed, and kept out of sight. However, there is a pretty obvious difference between bring up the topic of sex and carrying around an arousing (imho (i swear no homo)) image that is implemented entirely to increase revenue through peripheral-route persuasion. 

It's silly, and a silly way to handle it, but it isn't wrong. just don't bring half naked people to school jesus christ","1398902580"

You might want to check this part out to be sure.  You would also need to show proof you can support yourself as well as tuition, and in London, that's going to be a lot of money.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","This! As someone who also does a lot of interstate travel. I've often been in both sides of this situation. I actually drive an F-150... Its red and black...

Any way. Here is another hypothetical situation:

I'm driving in the left lane going 9mph over. I'm coming up to an highway exchange. I slow down to the speed limit as I see traffic. Cars in the far right lane are making space for people to merge. People in the middle lane are going the speed limit or below and ignoring the merging to the right. Someone merging desides to hop over two lanes to the fast lane, even though they have the peddle all the way down they are only going 15 under the speed limit. My truck doesn't slow down all that fast. I don't want to slam my brakes so I slow down and am riding the car in front of me. I'll slow down to make space or speed up to maintain my momentum. This happens a lot to me. 

People think because I'm in a truck I'm slow so they cut around me. This shortens my following distance and forces me to lift or brakre thus slowing down traffic. 

I get over as fast as I can, and use signals to indicate what I'm doing. I speed up or slow down to let faster slower cars maintain there speed. If everyone did this we would have less jams and better mpg. ","1398902587"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The problem with a term like 'realityist' is that it is vague and too open to interpretation.  

You can bet that every theist will hear it and say ""I am a realityist too.  God/Jesus/Krishna/Papa Legba/etc is very real"" and now the burden of proof would be on you to defend your idea that reality does *not* include those gods.

'Realityist' would be more confrontational and imposing that view upon others than 'atheist' does.  Atheist just says 'I don't believe in your god' where 'realityist' would say 'you don't believe in reality'... which might well be your belief, but when it is accusation like that, the burden of proof might well be seen as falling back on you. 

Like it or not, the history of civilization is overwhelmingly one of different religions.  So when discussing religious notions, 'atheist' is a clearer term.

Maybe better for what you're looking for might be 'physicalist' as opposed to metaphysical, or 'sensist' referring to accepting information only through what your senses can detect. Fumbling around for ideas here, but I think 'realityist' is loaded with burden and baggage you're not going to want. ","1398902587"

I really liked ASM2, I felt it really belongs to a comic but the biggest problem it has is that it could've been better if it had a different plot structure and how others say it could've have treated its villians better (though to be fair as a comicbook fan, I didn't really expect Electro affecting the characters a lot, I don't really remember the last story with him where he has actually affected any characters personal life and I did expect him to be overshadowed by Green Goblin)","1398902589"

Source packages are always right, in every situation (or else, they're buggy). Binary packages are built from source, but are only correct in some situations. Binary packages may be specially made for a certain operating system, a specific compiler, a specific version of a compiler (.hi files)... and don't forget that Cabal has configuration flags, which each can be turned on and off.

For every combination, you'd have to make a binary package. That results in a lot of binary packages, and some combinations can't be built by the same machine (it's kind of hard to make a Windows package on a Linux machine). You might also have to do that for multiple versions of the source package.

If you'd really want to do this, it's easier to make a binary release of a collection of packages (a bit like Haskell Platform). Otherwise, it'll save everyone a lot of headaches by just distributing source packages.","1398902590"

Your Crouching Dragon limit is the upper limit of Caged Logicats under which which Zookeeper will run and produce more Caged Logicats, it is controled with Panther Rush and Crouching Dragon, Sleeping Panther levels. Your Shadow Feeder Limit is how many times the Shadow Feeder can run and is the same number as the Crouching Dragon limit but the important note is that it is already over 1000 which for now means that under the best case scenario you could run the shadow feeder the maximum number of times per NP.

I took a look at your save. You are one of the people in the situation where your Automata Control level is low enough that Zookeeper does not produce more Caged Logicats in a single moment than the Crouching Limit, this would explain the strange behaviour and changing numbers you see.

Everytime the Tool Factory runs, Automata Assemble also runs a number of times as set out by Automata Control and some of those runs go towards Zookeeper. If you currently have less Caged Logicats than your crouching limit Zookeeper will tick up as can be seen in the Caged Logicat boost. From my understanding when it reaches over 100% it will produce some Caged Logicats for each 100% it has reached, for now you don't have many runs so it is counting up slowly enough that you only get one 100% at a time and only a few Cats which is why you see the number of Cats slowly rise. BUT When there are enough cats to reach the Crouching limit zookeeper can not run at that time and the Shadow Feeder boost runs instead and feeds all the Caged Cats to the Shadow Dragon which is why the number of Caged Logicats resets to 0 and the counting up starts again.

The bonemeal count is fluctuating up and down for you because the Shadow Dragon produces bonemeal in at a rate of 1 or (#of Cats in the feeding /100 and rounded down) which for you is 10 or 11 and the choice of 1 or other # is depending on the remainder of the division being greater than a luck roll. The Shadow Feeder costs 5 bonemeal to run each time so if you are lucky you gain 5 after then Shadow Feeder is paid and if you are unlucky you have a net loss of 4 from your total which explains the decreases. As the crouch limit goes up or you increase the AC power it will improve as more cats will end up stored before each feeding and the larger bonemeal result will grow to overshadow the loses of 4.","1398902590"

 [**Human height**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%20height): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Human height__ is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a [human body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body), standing erect. It is usually measured in centimetres when using the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system), and feet and inches when using the [imperial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_system). Human height has varied from under 60 centimetres (2 ft 0 in) to over 260 centimetres (8 ft 6 in). On average, males are taller than females.

&gt;When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to [gigantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism) or [dwarfism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism), which are medical conditions caused by specific [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) or [endocrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine) abnormalities. 

&gt;In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may account for delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I guess the argument is that it's not about empathy. Law isn't about how you feel, it's about doing what's just. Having some sort of kangaroo court where we decide that rather than just take a person's life, we want to do it specifically in a way that makes the person suffer for no arguable reason, serves no justice whatsoever. It makes a country look primitive when they go out of their way to hurt people, no matter those people have done.


People say that it could deter future crimes, but people in countries under Sharia still steal knowing that their hands are at risk.

so if we factor out deterrence, what else do you have to gain? do you want to watch them suffer? Or would you prefer it was done away from your eyes, so you didn't have to think about it?

 If they suffer in a room with no one but the executioner and any mediators present, what was the point? At the same time, if you let any victims of this person's crimes or anyone else for that matter come to watch them writhe as they die, can you not see that this encourages violent and primitive tendencies in people?

Who are you going to hire as executioners willing to torture a person other than either sociopaths, or people with angry reactionary views towards this sort of subject? Do you really think that it is fair to an executioner to make them live with the knowledge that they have caused a severe amount of pain on their fellow man?

What about people who have been sentenced for 'abhorrent' crimes, yet have not received a death sentence, rather a sentence of life imprisonment? Would you accept the torture and suffering of those people, given that is it not relieved by any 'unnatural' form of demise? For instance, do you think that pedophiles being subject to constant sexual violence is okay? If I could tell you that a child rapist was being sent to a prison where it was certain they themselves would be violently raped at least once, and you could change this by sending him to a prison where that risk would be virtually nonexistant, would you still send him to the first prison to be raped?

Some of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib could very well have been violent terrorists 'incapable of rehabilitation'. Does this make their treatment just?

I hope you can see where I'm coming from here. I just feel that if you want to want to reduce sadism and violence in a culture, a good way to do that is to avoid 'rewarding' the public with displays of unnecessary violence towards those we deem below us. Someone once said that 'The measure of a man is how he treats his inferiors'. If you see convicts like this as below you, it should be your duty to treat them properly.

It is also potentially offensive because it supposes that ""black"" is shameful.  Well that's strangely a problem.  It's difficult to convey whether the term or BEING black is the shameful part.  And frankly since it's frequently self-applied, people shying away from the term are the confused ones.  Attempts at politeness can be offensive.

CEOs are chosen from a pool of candidates that are also almost all white men. Slowly, bit by bit, qualified candidates who don't fit the old boys' club mold are winnowed out, discriminated against, harassed, etc. until all that's left is a pool of white, male, connected candidates.

Straight from the article. The article isnt arguing this is a first amendment issue. Its arguing that this is a privacy issue.","1398902603"

The reality is comp sci majors with the next big program are a dime a dozen in Silicon Valley and if the plan for a young technical founder with no business experience is to ""pick up the business side because coding is way harder"" (which is being communicated to me in this thread) they are going to fail.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","I'm not really one to get upset about gratuitous scenes, but it kind of bothers me that all the rape and pedophilia going on is directed more for shock or even sex appeal.

I feel like it would have more power if it was more subtle but showing women being raped in the background for as long as they did was 1. just really heavy handed (we get it these are bad guys...) and 2. just upsetting for the wrong reasons.

Also really tired of people cheering when women make advances on little boys.  Margery hitting on Tommen is as creepy as Little Finger hitting on Sansa to me...

I still love Game of Thrones but a little disappointed with the last two episodes after the first two were SO amazing.  The Cersei/Jamie rape/sex scene and mutineer rape scene really killed these two episodes for me in addition to a general lack of the content.

I have two friends (one male, one female) who suffered through abuse and they never had a problem with Game of Thrones until these two episodes.  I feel like these issues were handled so well before but it was so brutal this time that those two friends politely asked if I could screen the episode for them first which I completely understand.

I don't know I'm sure it wasn't the writers or directors faults but these recent scene really were upsetting in a way that took me OUT of the story.

Hack **everything**, it will help you get items and hacking enemy portals will give you 100AP every time.

Capturing portals is only possible when you're stronger. For now, explore. Seriously, hack everything. Look for neutrals or low-levelled portals to capture or upgrade. 

If you can, go to places where there are lots of your faction's portals and link them. Also reach out to players in your area. Getting help from higher level players is hands-down the best way to level.

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","I would recommend that you have someone who has experience with configuring and installing Windows Server 2012. There is a lot that can go wrong in it if you do not know what you're doing. Additionally, if you plan on eventually expanding you will need a child server to work alongside the parent domain controller which would mean you would need 2 servers and 2 copies of windows server to go along with it. You will need to know how to install the roles, and manage the user/security groups/ priveledges, and understand how to troubleshoot issues related to setting up the Host and replication issues. The microsoft technet site can be helpful, but it can also lead you down paths that aren't necessary. Additionally, I don't know if you have someone helping you with your networking, but it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring someone in who understands how to setup network groups. Someone with a strong understanding of subnets and ip addressing. Usually you can find someone who understands server well, and also the tcp/ip portion as they go hand in hand. 

Lastly, I would recommend that, if you can, you run an internal wiring to a patch panel and then from the patch panel to the server and cloud via a switch. You may want to have multiple switches for redundancy, and they must be placed properly to actually make a difference in creating a fail safe for your network. You will also need a firewall installed. Selection of network cable is also important. Depending on the building code requirements you may need plenum grade cable which is specifically built to react better in the case of a fire.  The plenum cables will only need to go into the walls while you can use regular CAT5, CAT5e, or CAT6 cables going to the PCs. 

The purpose of the patch panel is essentially to allow change out of cables going to the switch in the server room in the case that one goes bad, or if a port on a switch goes bad. Cable management will be essential when creating an office network. This means being sure to label everything and also properly build your CAT cables depending on which standard you are using. cables in the walls rarely go bad unless something catastrophic has happened. 

Are you planning on using 1GB ethernet, or 100MB ethernet?

You will also need to ensure that the NIC  in your server has the same rating for speed for the switch and CAT cable that are using, or that it is autosensensing. If you have a NIC that isn't rated for the speed that you build your network for you are only going to get the lower speeds that the NIC is capable of for that connection. Most NICs now are auto-sensing and can switch between different speeds depending on the switch that they have installed. If you are using financial software that stores personal information then it is highly recommended that you install an additional server as a back up, or use a trusted remote source to back up your files. You can also use CD, and DVDs, and what not, but these need to be stored in a location where they can avoid damage from fire, etc... Information should be backed up on a regular basis. I recommend weekly.  

There is backup software out there that you can research for on your own.  All-in-all if you end up using professional help the cost will exceed $3k

I definitely recommend a RAID setup. I forget which RAID it is, but the one that creates duplicates on a separate hard drive would be best. If you have 15 employees then I wouldn't give them more than 50GB each of personal storage space.

EDIT: I would actually recommend that you have a parent and child server, anyways. I'm not sure that you want your users connecting to your domain controller, and I'm pretty sure that you need a child server. I'm in a networking and cyber security program at college and I'm about half way through my server course and have worked at help desks in the past.","1398902609"

Look at this comparison, the number of requests sounds like a lot and its being portrayed as a big scary number, yet its not out of line with the number of prosecutions that occur within the country. It shows that around 1-2% of the Canadian population will have their records requested. That's not improbable that they had probable cause that those records contained something relevant to a particular case. If that really is the extent of the requests, I'm okay with it.

 By contrast the United States requests are for more users than there are adults in the country for metadata and a host of content, then they're taping the international cables to get US content, they're engaging in extensive surveillance and data mining. ","1398902616"

The Kahlua will coat the mouth with sweet coffee goodness, preventing any bitterness you may get from the vodka. Conversely, once the vodka hits the mouth, it cuts through the sweetness of the pure Kahlua and cleanses the pallet.

"csgobetting","t5_2zume","Match Factors!

* Both teams have similar ESEA records, with Titan basically getting DQ'ed because of roster issues, that means these games could be important for playoff berths or seeding
* Na'Vi is bootcamping
* Na'Vi coming off an OT loss to Dignitas (ESEA, Inferno, Away)
* LGB coming off a loss to Fnatic (FaceIt, Mirage, veto system) and two wins against Clan Mystik (post-kennyS)


After the Dignitas (THE hottest team right now) match, bettors will be much higher on Na'Vi than they were going into today. Before going on a short break, Na'Vi seemed like one of the hotter teams on the scene. In a one week stretch they went 5-0-1 with quality wins over NiP, VP, and Titan (w/ Shox). After their break, they went 1-4. But the conditions of some of the losses are worth mentioning:

* First game after the break was on a map they don't practice (de_nuke) against Wizards (nuke is their best map)
* Two losses in matches that could have been very different if it weren't for severe DDoS'ing


LGB might still be hungover following their win in the eSportsBet cup from last weekend. They've gone 2-3 in their last 5. Both wins came against a reeling Clan Mystik today. Their three losses include an 0-2 in a BO3 with NiP and an 0-16 ass-whooping care of Dignitas.

Conclusion: In a neutral scenario, my opinion is that Na'Vi should be 60-40 favorites against LGB, a team in their general skill tier. Under normal conditions this might be 50-50. But I would bump Na'Vi up based on how they played today and the general teams-play-better-during-bootcamp factor. Its possible that LGBs two wins against CM woke them up, but overall I think they are playing below their potential. The fact that season is considered T-sided and LGB has side-choice doesn't factor in much for me, I believe Na'Vi to be pretty strong on CT. I don't expect the match to be out of hand at the half. At a current odds of 60-40 for LGB, I will definitely put a decent sized bet on Na'Vi.","1398902626"

"RotMG","t5_2s505","Well, two things. In large groups, none of the single people there matters in any way. Basically nobody in a large group deserves loot. And the smaller the group gets, the bigger is your contribution by simply being there. You can't really do nothing at the bosses after all. Either you do some amount of damage or you draw fire or whatever. And that alone is enough to deserve a chance at loot. (Unless it's actually possible to pause. But that's an oversight on Kabam's part then.)

What makes me sick the most is that 90% of the people who are against loot chests are arguing because they think they deserve more loot than others. It's the same shitty mentality that's been around since forever. ""I did so much more damage than you but you get xy!"" This game was never meant to be about dps and I for one welcome any change that doesn't favor dps classes.

Another thing that throws me off a bit is people are complaining how it's too easy to get loot in the Shatters but instantly rage when someone suggests to remove def from Abysses again. Or that nobody argues that old tops should be removed from Ceme and Lab. How is that even any different? Oh right, there's usually Dblading Warriors and Knights in there preventing the unmaxed people from even having a chance at those drops. Or at any drops for that matter.","1398902630"

 [**Nonpartisan blanket primary**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan%20blanket%20primary): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __nonpartisan blanket primary__, usually referred to as the ""Open Primary"" concept and used in [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana), [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state\)), and [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), is a [primary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election) in which all [candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate) for elected office run in the same primary regardless of [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party). It is also known as a __qualifying primary__, __top-two primary__, __Louisiana primary__, __Cajun primary__ or __jungle primary__.

&gt;Under this system, the two candidates receiving the most votes advance to the next round, as in a runoff election in a [two-round system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system). (In some cases, this second round of voting is only necessary if no candidate receives an overall majority on the initial ballot.) However, there is no separate party nomination process for candidates before the first round, and parties cannot thin the field using their own internal processes (such as a [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_convention)). Similarly, it is entirely possible that two candidates of the same party could advance to the second round. It reduces the election cycle cost in campaign costs and balloting costs, as there are 2 elections but no partisan primaries. [*[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement) – discuss*]

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Norinco 1911A1 in 45acp.  Bog standard 1911, but it had these weird grips with a skull that had a knife in it, on them.  Funny and totally ""goth"" as was the phase I was in at the time.  Eventually I decided I wanted to enhance it with a barrel bushing compensator.  (Thing was worthless and dumb looking).  While using a dremel to fit the comp around the barrel, I got the bright idea to give my gun a 2 tone look.  Totally not understanding what purpose bluing served or how to appropriately remove it I simply used the dremel and sanded the bluing off on the flats of the slide but leaving it on the top and bottom.

Looked ok...  As much as such a thing can.  Then I added some gun bling and had a little gold cross hanging from the lanyard loop.  So I took a lovely 1911a1 in actually really good shape and absolutely bubba'd the shit out of it with a redneck 2-tone sanding job, skull grips(came with), shit bushing compensator and a gold crucifix hanging off the bottom.

Eventually I realized how retarded I was and removed the extra crap.  Got a bluing pen and colored in as much as I could the slide and put on some stock rubber kimber grips my buddy gave me.

Despite by worst efforts this beast is still absolutely a tac driver.  It is my EDC and it is a gun I will never sell.  Eventually I'll learn how to appropriately remove the bluing, polish the slide and reblue it myself as a project.  Best $300 I ever spent.","1398902632"

"cellular_automata","t5_2tr1l","&gt;Did you try to balance 3 or more rules this way?

Frequently, and more. I'm going for the low-hanging fruit at the moment - the 2-rule combos of complete self-defined rules. Rules that are incomplete on their own can absolutely be layered to form 'full-looking' rulesets.

I cycle through rules on the mousewheel. Select a base rule, then add a new rule, and then cycle *that* one. It's easy to assess variations of a rule that way.

It can only run one type of combination of cells in the grid currently. I don't see why this would stay this way, though. Imagine having rules partially alter other cell's rules, while still defining the environment. That's what I want to do, eventually.

&gt;I mean a quickly crystallising grid is not objectively ""less interesting"" than say Conway's GOL.

I find this to be true. I've noticed that, with this particular way of combining rules, any ruleset that has an imbalance like stagnated or explosive growth actually provides an environmental opportunity for another rule of the set to exploit - usually resulting in unexpected behaviours. All rules that have some effect on the world are valid, but some seem to do more.

&gt;I have quite a few home-cooked CA apps myself

These. I want to see them. Please?

And yep, I'll be posting for sure, ha. I'm recording these as I find them usually, and also pulling content in from wherever I find it online.

It can be treated by draining the ear immediately after it fills up with fluid, but if the activity continues it will just come back. 

Head gear can prevent it, but has a nasty side affect of being an injury risk in boxing and other full contact sports (to the other person not wearing head gear), additionally, it is very uncomfortable to wear due to excess heat and the way it fits.

It's one thing to run into zoo over and over and eventually figure out what works.  It's much faster, to actually play zoo so you see first hand all the difficulties the deck has.

Then when you play against that deck, you remember what problems you had and you can try to capitalize easier.
 Zoo has trouble w/ big minions, also you can expect that most of the cards they play will have low hp.  Also, can anticipate that any card can be buffed at any moment, so if you can get a favorable trade right now, you probably should because next turn he could buff it and make the trade favorable for himself.

Security (Guard or Officer depending on which company you work for): we're often shown to be lazy or stupid wanna be cops, and I assure you there are plenty wanna be cops in security, but now a days a lot more of a professional approach is taken. More and more you have security guards carrying firearms (I myself am an armed guard) and you see companies actually having a ""patrol division"" complete with cruisers and a dispatch (my company has this as well).

"mechanical_gifs","t5_2wg6i","Well size is a very important aspect of engine design, huge pistons exert huge forces on reciprocating assemblies, and in turn make connecting rods and crankshafts have to be bigger to deal with the added mass.

RPM is a direct factor of how much internal engine components weigh and how fast they can travel.  You need to get it to 4000 RPM to make max power? well nope, the piston flies apart at 3000 RPM

I see what he is going for, but most of what I can comprehend is that the engine is designed with mostly ""theoreticals"" in mind.  It might run in a computer simulation, but it wont work in the real world.

As for the piston being supported by the wrist pin, it can't hold the piston properly and still allows the piston to rotate on the pin.  In a conventional engine the piston fits inside the bore with a few thousandths clearance between the piston and bore, the rings need the tension to provide a proper seal during the compression cycle as pressures get up to 180 PSI or over.  The entire concept of building power happens when the expanding gases push the piston down.  If gas bypasses, power is lost.

I'm pretty sure there would start to be extreme wear on the top of the torus where the piston runs due to the momentum of the piston pushing into the cylinder wall as it starts to rev up.  

Conventional engines work because the piston stays moving in a linear direction, up and down, while this is moving in a circular direction, its going to have some interesting characteristics as you change the direction on that mass quickly.

And lets not get into the machining of the engine case to manufacture something like this! That would be an even greater challenge.

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","It's not a real guaranteed problem, and it would be awesome if it does become a problem. The key is that offers are not equivalent, and you can't predict the quality of a company's potential offer -- besides monetary offers, you can't evaluate team fit and potential projects until you've done the interviews. 

If interviews aren't stacked on top of each other so that they're within the same window, you're forced to make a choice about offers. Say you interview with company A and get an offer that expires before your interviews with companies B-E. Unless they're willing to extend the offer deadline, you have to decide to either take A's offer, or wait and opt to take a chance with B-E. That's especially difficult as a new grad, because you're not too sure of your worth. 

I ask this because I was in a similar situation earlier this year, but with internships. I ended up turning down an offer because I felt it undervalued me and they were not open to negotiation (investment banking / securities company). I ultimately ended up with an offer paying 50% more with a company I preferred, but that was a gamble.

That gamble can be avoided if interviews are scheduled within some overlapping window. When applying for internships, I didn't have much power as far as scheduling interviews went, but this time around I anticipate having more control over when interviews will happen. So, if I can figure out how to maximize that safe window, why not? It could potentially avoid such a dilemma. ","1398902643"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","&gt;You claim to be against poverty, but I challenge you to show me meaningful policies that alleviate poverty without redistribution.

Trade. It is lifting millions out of poverty in China, India, and all other developing nations. No redistribution required.

&gt;the best way to improve the lives of the poor is to take some from the rich and give it to the poor.

Maybe for 1 day or a week, but not for a year or decades. Standard of living dropped sharply all over the USSR after the revolution. Native communities in Canada are in deplorable conditions despite constantly receiving redistribution monies. I would say the only thing redistribution is good for is pacifying them, and turning people into dependents.

&gt;The uncomfortable fact of an unequal society is that the elite enjoy the benefits of others' hard work.

To the contrary, in an equal society, the entrepreneurs and leaders are getting shortchanged, as they provide vastly more in value to society than that of a single worker.

&gt;Perhaps people's lives overall have improved

That is the goal isn't it? I could understand calls for redistribution, if the bottom 10% was worse off now than 10 years ago, but they aren't, because free markets work towards the benefits of all.","1398902646"

I didn't say they can't have any rational conversations.

Some people with PTSD aren't capable of dealing well with certain subjects or scenarios, one example of which would be being unable to talk about what's bothering them. Some can talk about what triggered their PTSF and some can't, it's a diverse disorder which manifests in lots of different ways. Last time I was reading about it I remember reading that they are actually considering Borderline Peronality Disorder as a form of PTSD and some people with BPD have very erratic behaviour and poor coping mechanisms. 

And I didn't talk about any qualifications except A levels that are completely meaingless. I might be a postgrad, I might be a student, I might know nothing.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I think people's first inclination is that a function is a great delineation for unit. Many times it is when you are already in a solid feedback loop where you are constantly refactoring as you code. However, when you first start testing you just make this assumption and don't realize that your code boundaries don't truly align with single units of *behavior* which is what you want to be testing in reality. Maybe starting off with BDD right away makes this transition more obvious and smooth for folks but I started out with it before there were any great BDD tools out there (afaik anyway)  so it was less obvious. I just hate when people just completely disregard TDD and unit testing and I wonder how many hours theyve really put into it. It's a skill just like learning a new paradigm like functional programming or OOP and it takes a lot of effort and and more importantly, failure, to get to where you want to be (which is true of just about everything). Hell...failing is step one of the TDD process and maybe that is why people still have trouble acclimatimating to it. It does take a bit of unlearning to embrace failure. ","1398902648"

Its more people in the early part of the game won't have the same soul memory, so they will not see any signs until they match up again with the general population. I beat the game with 1.5m SM and with a juicey 700k boost they might be near that.

"RomeSweetRome","t5_2stb9","a few years before the RomeSweetRome phenomenon took off, another author wrote a book based on a similar concept (called Pax Romana) to the spontaneous RSR concept. When Prufrock realized after RSR went viral that there was a similar concept someone had already done, Prufrock decided to write to that author and apologize that the concept he had become the force behind 'stole some of the thunder' from John Hickman's original. JH wrote him back, and said basically 'no sweat, don't worry about it, and i hope your RSR project goes well'. So as i understand it they only communicated because of the RSR thing, but didn't know eachother prior to that. Infact, Prufrock hadn't even heard of Pax Romana until after RSR took off.

Also if they feel intimidated by former IG members, what will it be like when MSU fans are sitting there yelling ""fuck you,"" right to their face and harassing band members. Can they go to Ken Dye and Larry Dwyer and be like excuse me they are intimidating me can you tell them to stop. No they can't. During home games you don't need the protector status of the IG, but some of the hostile environments that ND plays annually at I have seen firsthand that the IG can help defuse situations.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I did not mean 'salt' in that sense, I just wanted to note there are different varieties to amphetamines in Adderall. Adderall is composed of 75% Dextro and 25% Levo.

Also, in reference to Speed. Adderall does not contain methamphetamine. Speed referres to a variety of different amphetamines, pretty varies depending on which street pharmaceutical salesman you get it from.

Desoxyn, does contain methamphetaime. It is the closes thing to ""speed"".

Lastly, you are right that Adderall does have an instant release formula, but it is in ""instant' in name only. Adderall was formulated to make it easier to manage the sideeffects of amphetamines. Snorting or injecting some methamphetamines will make you feel significantly different than Adderall I.R.

Desoxyn is straight up methamphetaime-HCL. There are no beads, no fancy capsules, nothing but a pill. Take one and it hits you like a freight train of awesome, time to destination: a few hours, destination: the lowly pits of withdrawl.

Om de inte har något logiskt motargument så får man snart höra att ""det handlar om människosyn"" och att man är en ""dålig människa"" om man röstar borgerligt.

"aoe2","t5_2sg7u","I posted this before, but I'll share again. Basically, in the castle age, castles are very powerful and hard to take down. But in the imperial age, with the advent of gunpowder and heavy siege, castles fall like paper. Obviously from a historical standpoint this makes sense, and I'm okay with it. 

What I'd like to see is a type of super castle, which I've cleverly named ""The Citadel"", which would be an extremely powerful fortification, much like the star-shaped forts of Europe. It would require the same investment as a wonder, and quite some time to build, but would represent the pinnacle of defense for a city. I don't see anyone realistically building an offensive Citadel, but building one in your city would make it very difficult to take.

I imagine it would have an 11 range with arrow fire, a 12 range with bombard cannons mounted on the walls, the ability to produce unique units, trebs, mortar cannons(extremely slooooooow moving anti-siege gunpowder unit requiring packing/unpacking to be used) and barracks units.

This building would still be vulnerable to siege, but only trebuchets, and nothing else. It's armor would make it pretty much impervious to anything else. ","1398902658"

"tea","t5_2qq5e","Oh, I see. Have you worked there long? They used to have glass tumblers which weren't tempered right and were at high risk of breaking if you put boiling water in it. But in general I'd say glassware is kinda hit or miss on whether or not its going to be easy to break. I've had several glassware items for years and I've broken a few more. 

It starts with the tetsubin (cast iron pots). They're meant as kettles without glazing on the inside, to be used over heat to boil water. Once you take that away, you've just got a heavy, heat sucking, rust-prone (I have yet to see one last more than 3 years without somehow rusting away) weight in the shape of a tea pot with a very expensive price tag for absolutely no benefit. Sure everyone's all like, ""but I'd like to keep my tea hot while I take several hours to drink it!"" but doing that then again puts the pot at risk of rusting... And its not like ceramic pots aren't decent at holding heat. I think bone china is supposed to actually be the best in that regard, but I am a gongfu style drinker (aka I make my tea and I drink it then haha), so I can't say from experience what holds the heat of the tea for the longest. As for making this into a cup, then you've got a very hot (are you still told to sell them doubled up?) and heavy cup which absolutely must be heated before being used (every single time) because otherwise it's going to suck the heat from your tea (defeating the purpose of having a teapot that retains heat for a long time...). And recently when studying Japanese tea ceremony I was instructed to never touch tetsubin with bare hands if one could help it because the oils from your skin would discolor it. I've seen the paint look worn from very frequent use definitely on the store example (I used to work in Teavana) as well. So now you've got a very heavy cup you're not supposed to touch with your bare hands, that you have to heat up before using every time, that's going to then burn your hands. /*SIGHS* Its just such a massive marketing scam.","1398902661"

I saw on nyc.gov that it went up around 7% from 2012 to 2013. Again, this is NYC. In 2008 in NYC, rents got really low because everyone lost their job and were moving back in with their parents. So if you're talking between 2008-2014, I can most definitely see a 20-30% jump. Now I agree, you can't just flippantly make that claim unless you have evidence to back it up. Is it true? Maybe.

the case statements are conditional checks. The first one, case WAITING, is comparing the value of currentState to the value of WAITING. If they are equal the code beneath the case will execute. 

The break statement at the end tells the program it is done with the case statement and should exit. If break was not there the program would execute all of the code in the case statement that is below the first case that is met. 
For example: if current state is RUNNING (or 2), the code would not execute beneath WAITING or PRIMING because the condition is not met. When it reached case RUNNING the condition is met and the code beneath is executed. Once the break statement is hit the case statement is exited. If the break were not there, the code under case ABORTED would also execute which would not be what you want.","1398902665"

"FancyFollicles","t5_2sa9a","Kk since you're using box colour, they automatically give you a lift and deposit colour, and usually at 20 vol. That being said, when you colour your hair, you should apply to your roots, then in the last 5-10 minutes, pull it all down into the rest of your hair, just to give it a touch up and some more shine. If you are applying 20 vol to your hair from the roots down through the midlengths every time, you are definitely damaging your hair. It should stretch be able to stretch  a bit more than that, which is a sign of poor elasticity. When you wash it next, pay attention to how it feels, like you said. It shouldn't feel like straw or mushy at all. 

 I think it's safe to say you could use a trim, but realistically a lot of us are due. It's a good thing to do at the least every 6 months. But the best thing you can do is to start applying the colour like I described above. Also a good emulsion at the end will help. This is where you add a touch of water to your hair and massage the colour in everywhere for a few minutes. Also perhaps look into a deposit only colour that you can use in between root touchups to revive your colour. These only use 10 volume, which is far less damaging to the hair. 

I hope this is of help :) ","1398902666"

It'd be a royal pain for them to go out of their way to re-write all of the systems and subsystems in OOT, I'm pretty sure they only rewrote what they needed to (for the new features/enhancements) and copied the logic for what they didn't.

They wouldn't be able to accurately recreate the feel of OOT in a reasonable time frame if they didn't copy most of the logic from the original source code anyways, it'd take too much time and effort.

The winning faction could get like a couple weeks early access to a new NS weapon or vehicle system, like a new liberator belly gun. This would only be available to people who participated a certain amount in the campaigns, so people who just have minor alts who just login for the free certs wouldn't get the easy access.

Maybe even have a system where the winning faction can only retain the early access if they maintain a specific objective, like always keeping one continent under their control.

I grew up not liking hip hop having been brought up on rock classics like Zeppelin, Queen, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, etc.

Then my cousin introduced me to this album when I started middle school. Man, when my ears first experienced that piano loop from CREAM it was over.

&gt;Let's put it like this, not a single page in any history book in the future, not a single paragraph, not a single sentence will be devoted to this. 

Jeez, I wonder if you even consider your ability to see into the future to be 'revolutionary'.

&gt;I sincerely doubt this means 'revolutionary' in most people's vernacular. 

A pocket-sized, iPhone-compatable, affordable, consumer spectrometer *definitely* qualifies as revolutionary to most people.

&gt;I wouldn't even surprised if scanners of this size already exist and are readily available for purchase for people who want it.

Not really. Your examples provide somewhat similar functionality, but if you took a look at how they worked, they're very different, much different in functionality and range of use, and really don't do the same thing or have anywhere near the same accuracy.

&gt;Illustrating ""potential"" of making something smaller hardly signifies a revolution. Like I said, you can make everything smaller, the issue is if people are willing to pay for for it. 

Actually, illustrating something as having revolutionary potential does exactly that: signify it. 

&gt;Like I said, you can make everything smaller, the issue is if people are willing to pay for for it. 

I couldn't find where you said that, but whatever. Getting people to pay for this sort of tech shouldn't be hard at all, considering the potential applications in hundreds - or more - fields, consumer, commercial, and industrial. 

You mention that no history book will ever refer to this, and while you may be right (again, that ability to see the future is pretty cool), history books are full of people claiming, at the birth of tech revolutions, how the tech is neither revolutionary nor a viable consumer tech. And those same history books also go on to say how wrong they were.","1398902676"

I loved my older models, but the Glo is constantly on the fritz and I had it replaced like 3 times, so I got used to reading on the Overdrive app for my phone, especially since a) that way I can take books out directly from anywhere and b) it's a little more subtle when I'm reading at work. 

I mostly borrow ebooks from the library, but I'm with you on buying books that I've borrowed. Especially for a series, sometimes I'll take the first one or two out from the library to make sure I like it before buying, but then I still have to buy the ones I've already read because I hate not having a full series. I love all the free classics for ebooks, but some of them are definitely better in print! I read Jane Eyre earlier this year and I don't think it would have been the same on the Kobo.

(To be 100% correct the `*foo` dereferencing above doesn't work in general, only for `Copy` types, since it's taking the contents by-value, and we don't have overloadable by-value dereferencing; so it's exactly the same as taking by-value from behind a `&amp;`.

 [**Event horizon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event%20horizon): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;An __event horizon__ is, in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity), a boundary in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In layman's terms, it is defined as ""the point of no return"", i.e., the point at which the gravitational pull becomes so great as to make escape impossible. The most common case of an event horizon is that surrounding a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole). Light emitted from beyond the event horizon can never reach the outside observer. Likewise, any object approaching the horizon from the observer's side appears to slow down and never quite pass through the horizon, with its image becoming more and more [redshifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) as time elapses. The traveling object, however, experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the horizon in a finite amount of [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time).

Your statement presents the idea as being a simple historical fact.

Sure I can.

Now what does the claim that the Pharisees saw Jesus as a threat to Rome have to do with your argument? All I see is a very convoluted argument conceived in the attempt to avoid admitting that you misspoke.

It saddens me that sexual activity is so downplayed in the church that when the time for marriage comes couples are confused if what they are doing is okay. There are married couples I know who try to avoid it since they still think it is sinful, which is such a terrible misconception to have.

"Military","t5_2qh8y","Here are pages 9 and 10 of 401 to give an idea of the novel.

Golden air filled the land, not the beautiful type of shimmering gold as one would witness when watching a sunset. It was a rusty, grimy gold, caused by the invasive powdery dust that covered everything.  The days were an eternal twilight of golds and ambers that the sun’s rays could barely find a way through. The only escape one might discover from the putrid glow was the dead of night when the world turned black as ash and the stars could barely be seen over the surrounding mountains. Such it was during the months of the dust.

The wind was ever present, scattering the powder of dust upon everything it would find. A villainous force the wind was, adding insult to injury- never letting the air clear of the choking haze. The moment a Marine would step foot off one of the ships anchored at Porto Valdo he would be painted with a new shade of tan, grey and brown. It would not matter if his jacket was originally the dark green of the line battalions or the gold and crimson of the royal horse companies, he would soon find himself a walking, living, breathing mass of earth. The sweat dripping down his body from the baking sun would only worsen the muck of dust and there would be no ridding of the menace till travel to a more temperate climate and long baths to scourge away the desert.

The young Marines shuffling and tripping down the ramps from the transport were just now meeting their new enemy of nature. Jackets which only last week were washed, scrubbed, pressed and meticulously gone over time and again by fearful eyes for any sign, smudge, crease or spot  were now coated in an ever building layer of filth. But not a one of the new joins for the Eighth Regiment of the Verdan Royal Marines noticed the sand, wind and dust as they came off the ramp hurriedly pushed along by sailors in soiled ragged clothes. The young men lugged their packs, sacks and rifles down and were pushed roughly out of the way by the litter bearing teams of yet more sailors and medical personnel carrying stretchers up the ramp laden with blood soaked, bandage covered young Marines and soldiers that had arrived on some other transport ship not too long before. The fresh young men’s eyes widened and then they flinched as an explosion ripped across the port.

“Move!  Come-on!” A huge man strode through the crowded dock towards the crouched new joins. “You’re the combat replacements for the Eight Regiment?” The giant asked, the men nodded as they fearfully glanced south at a rising smoke cloud. “That mortar was at the Helspon- nowhere near here so get your gear, get up and don’t die before I get you to the Lieutenant or he’ll have my stripes and what’s left of you will be back home under dirt!”

The new joins stared open mouthed at the colossus before them. He was at least six and a half feet tall and could weigh no less than three hundred pounds. The Royal Marine trousers he wore were in tatters and tied at the waist with a ragged bit of rope. His boots were scuffed and torn but nowhere near as bad in condition as was the Marine’s jacket. It was missing its sleeves and was only held together by two of the original twelve brass buttons. The rifle he carried was the only thing about him that was proper according to the training the young privates had received- it gleamed black as death and had not a speck of dust upon it. One by one they rose and shouldered their packs. Sergeant Jose Black scowled from under a massive scar that ran across his left eyebrow and shaved head, turned, and led them weaving through the human maze along the boats, towards the sounds of the war they had been sent far from home to partake of.

I'm going to go with Foundation by Isaac Asimov.  For starters I'm a huge sci fi fan so that helps, and sci fi literature is way better (for the most part) than sci fi movies.  In addition Foundation focuses on psychology as a science (my major) and shows us one thought experiment that might be if we took psychology to the extreme; if we knew enough about human behaviour could we predict the future of societies with large populations with advanced statistics?

The basic story is that there is a galaxy wide empire populated by more humans than you can imagine.  They have long forgotten their home world and everyone lives in relative peace. An advanced researcher develops ""psychohistory"" which can predict the mass behaviours of massive groups of people.  They liken it to how even though particles can appear to behaving randomlyv when you put enough together we can see far more predictable Newtonian physics. Anyway he uses his science to foresee the downfall of the empire but also uses his models to establish a foundation that is set to counteract the negative effects of the downfall.  The book follows his foundation after he dies across hundreds or possibly thousands of years.  

 The book is very unique in a number of ways. In many ways it reads like a number of short stories as the book follows events throughout history. It also has no real hero. There are a bunch of important people throughout the book driving events but one of the messages in h the book is that these people were expected,  statistically,  to do this and were not really remarkable.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Except Bjergsen snowballs games on assassins, assassins weren't really viable in 4.5 due to triple heal ridiculousness, Soraka, and buffed exhaust. When you think about TSM playing well, it's generally Bjergsen winning his lane 1v1 as an assassin, then snowballing the other lanes for his team through roaming. They played a very S3 style game.

The problem with 4v0 is that
1) Simultaneous with making assassins unviable due to other changes which nerfs Bjerg's champion pool.
2) Negates mid lane roaming to some extent and takes away the playmaking ability of mid laners.

So what you saw was Bjergsen doing fine 1v1, but the rest of TSM gets screwed without the fed mid laner to snowball their lanes for them and their macro level mistakes hurt more because they're not able to win the laning phase anymore since it doesn't exist.

Haywyre's unmistakable piano (Peacock Remix, Prologue Part One, Voice of Reason). I would go on about Muzzy but that horse has already been beaten beyond death.

I'm not saying pick up the pitch forks, just realize that SW isn't the only one who has developed a ""style"" as some of you defensive people like to call it. I love all of the artists here, and they do have amazing talent...

Seems rather that, based on past ethics and current actions, eating meat is more of a universal ethic than veganism is.  I do not honestly see right/wrong/good/evil/ethics entering into eating meat or not eating meat.  I just see rationalizations for a personal choice outside the norm.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","I hope it takes the friendship/rivalry system from the first two games to a new extreme, and has them affect the story in a big way.

In KotOR 2 (Obsidian, not Bioware, I know), you could gain ""influence"" points with your squad, and depending on how much influence you had with them, the more they were dragged down or up into the dark or light side with you.

I hope by doing big actions that our squad approves of, or big ones they resent us for, we change their characters in even more meaningful ways than Dragon Age 2. For example, helping a selfish character become more selfless causes them to sacrifice themselves for another towards the end of the game, but encouraging them to be selfish causes them to sacrifice another squadmate for themselves. Quests are opened up or closed off: making a vengeful character more forgiving causes them to let an enemy go, just to be hunted by them later, while encouraging their revenge makes them kill the enemy, actually destroying the threat and letting that character move on to another stage of development and an actually different quest, not just a recolored flavor quest.

Scooby snack. Midori (melon liqueur), Malibu coconut rum, pineapple juice and a little blast of whipped cream (or a splash of milk or cream, but whipped cream makes it less heavy) shake, pour over ice. Or for better results (if you can't stomach dairy with alcohol; it can be a bad combination), skip the cream, pour over ice, then top with sprite. It's a go-to drink I make when people want a ""yummy"" drink. Plus it's all green and pretty.

Tic-tac: orange vodka, equal parts orange juice and red bull. Tastes like an orange tictac.

Jolly rancher: citrus vodka, sour pucker of your choice (grape, apple, watermelon), sweet and sour mix, topped with sprite. Done correctly, tastes just like a jolly rancher.

Another favorite that's a bit simpler is tropical fruit vodka mixed with cranberry and orange juice.

Or if you're looking for something pre-mixed at the store your best bet is Mike's Hard Lemonade or an apple cider like Angry Orchard or Redd's Apple Ale.

Edit to add: Liqueurs like amaretto and peach schnapps have a significantly lower alcohol content than other liquors and are loaded with sugar (which is why they're so yummy), so drinking them in mixed drinks without something else like vodka or rum in it won't get you as drunk, and can leave you with an upset stomach before you even get fucked up.","1398902697"

That quote is out of context, first, and it probably mentions administrative organization.  The Catholic Church believes it was founded by Christ.

&gt; 606 - first pope. Nowhere in the bible. 

The first Pope was Saint Peter.  The office of the papacy was established by Christ.  I already linked you something that references that.

&gt; Penance, sale of indulgences that funded the building of basilica. Evidence of that perversion. 

By penance I assume you mean the Sacrament?  See [this](http://www.catholic.com/blog/tim-staples/is-confession-in-scripture-0) for Scripture on it.  The sale of indulgences hasn't been practiced for centuries due to abuses of the system.

Holy Water is a sacramental, not a sacrament.

Clerical celibacy is a discipline, the Pope could get rid of it tomorrow (allow new priests to be married)

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;I didn't know about all the churches that were destroyed/converted, that's interesting, I know that initially Mehmet was conscious of destroying churches, in fear of riling the orthodox population, but makes sense that he would later convert/destroy once the Ottomans had more control. 

While it's a problem citing Wikipedia, this map is a wonderful tool. It shows many of the churches, monasteries and other buildings that existed in Constantinople: 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Byzantine_Constantinople_eng.png

Keep in mind that some of those buildings were already in decay before the Turks took the city. In fact, a lot of the land between the Constantinian and Theodosian walls was virtually a countryside within the city. As the Turks advanced through the city after they broke through, the little clusters of buildings and homes (almost like villages) individually surrendered. This meant, to the Turks, that because these little ""villages"" surrendered voluntarily, they could be spared, but for the most part, the most urban part of the city wasn't, due to the resistance they had faced prior.

This is also a really cool project:

http://www.byzantium1200.com/

Where they are slowly recreating Byzantium in 3D models based on an idealized image. They cite the ""1200 CE"" date, but even admit that's a bit ambiguous since some of the buildings they model were already decaying by that point in history. It was a massive city, and obviously it's hard to find what it looked like exactly at a point in time. But the models in there do show interesting features of many churches that the Turks altered. One being Hagia Sophia itself, which had a large atrium/courtyard (like Hagia Irene) and a large fountain: http://www.byzantium1200.com/hagia.html

There were also plenty of secular buildings that were taken down by the Turks. Like the rest of the Hippodrome, the Imperial Palace and the Forum of Constantine. 

&gt;I meant to imply that the Orthodox church seems to gain more land (not literal land, but more area, and more people, that fall under the patriarchy). 

I understand, but the other thing is, the Ecumenical Patriarch did gain more area. However, the Serbian and Bulgarian Churches had their own Patriarchs by that point. Prior to having their own Patriarchs, they were part of the Ecumenical Patriarch's jurisdiction. So when Mehmet put the Ecumenical Patriarch in charge, it basically returned them under his jurisdiction (which they were prior to their autocephaly). For Serbia, this didn't happen till the Patriarch &amp; other Bishops had died, same for Bulgaria. But at least for Serbia, it wasn't long until they regained their Patriarch. Bulgaria's Patriarchate wasn't restored until the 20th Century. Bulgaria ended up bearing the brunt of the Phanar's authority. 

&gt;I attribute this to Mehmet wanting to make Constantinople his new capital, therefore he would be more interested in not killing off everyone, and destroying everything. Otherwise, I believe Mehmet would have treated the city more harshly than he did.

That was part of it, but the other part was that Mehmet for one, had various members of the government surrendering to him after the walls fell, and because there were many more walls, villages and neighborhoods inside the city, by the Islamic law he followed, meant they had to be shown mercy.

The other factor was also that Mehmet wanted himself to be seen as sort of the new ""Roman Emperor', but as a Muslim and an Ottoman. Obviously this wasn't the case and the claim eventually disappeared, but it helped his legitimacy to that title to keep some of the Greeks and their buildings intact, even if he repurposed and took over many of the buildings for himself.","1398902698"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Short explanation: Men want to spread their seed as often and among as many women as possible, whereas women want to only receive the seeds of those men they deem fit.

Long explanation:

Like many things about human behaviour, it goes to back the times when our ancestors lived in caves. Men went out to hunt, exposing themselves to danger. Thus Mother Nature programmed men with the desire to spread their genes among as many females and as often as possible so that their lines continued to exist should they happen to die.

Women, on the other hand, were programmed to be far more selective. Since pregnancy lasts quite long when you compare the length of pregnancy with the average life span even women had in those times, they were programmed to pick only the best available choice as father of their offspring.

Mildly interesting side note: These cirumstances are also the reasons why even today men tend to be more horny in the morning whereas women tend to be more horny in the late evening/early night. Men want to spread their genes before going out and risking their lives, women want only to receive from men who made it back alive.","1398902699"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","We're not talking S2 where that was a viable strategy and Froggen/Doublelift's were some of, if not the best in their position at the time. We're talking S4 where top tier teams understand how to take control of the game if the enemy mid laner isn't putting pressure on the map. Froggen is a beast, and he doesn't always play like that anymore...only on certain champs. 

With that said, yeah I think that play style is really shit and comparable to Meteos S3 playstyle. That playstyle will, in theory, get you crushed if you're against a top team. 

The old Froggen playstyle wouldn't work against the likes of SSO, NJWS, Blaze, etc who know how to take advantage of an AFK mid laner, is what I'm saying.

Froggen is still a beast though.","1398902701"

Not only that but the Clippers are always brought up as a team that needs rebranding in the reddit threads.  

They wear the red white blue that is overused in the nba, they have always been a loser team until lately, and I'm sure there are more names that could represent LA a lot more than Clipper ships.

The Clippers need to seize this moment of relevance to bring new fans and a big rivalry. 
As soon as Kobe is gone, they need to take the opportunity to take as many Laker fans to make them their own before the Lakers are inevitably back in the playoffs.
 
A name change would help a lot.

Arrows will vary based on several factors as will the fletchings on them so you will have to determine which bow you think you like most before you choose arrows.  Don't buy expensive anything until you get that far and you know you will stick with it.  Most clubs give free or low cost lessons so you can check it out.  If you haven't looked already this is the US coach locator:

Also, there is NASP and 4H shooting programs in addition to JOAD.  If there is anything else I can help you find, just shoot a message to any one of Emma's social media sites. She tries really hard to help beginners and give out information so that it doesn't cost so much money to start.  It doesn't have to!

This is bottled at 45%.  I paid $29.99/750ml   Tasted neat in a glencairn.

Color – This one is pretty standard bourbon brown.

Nose – corn with some mild oak, very sweet, lots of brown sugar, sugar cookies, vanilla extract.  This is like dessert on the nose.  That sweetness fades into some citrus with honey and a mild sour cherry note.

Palate – Boom, even more sugar, pecan pie,  caramel.  Buttered popcorn shows up around the sides of the tongue. It has a wonderful mouth feel.  A little bit of baking spice.

Finish – The finish on this barrel is a little herbal, medium length, nothing to complex, but not boring by any means.

This isn’t the best bottle of ETL that I have had the pleasure of drinking, but I think it isn’t far off.  It has that traditional sweetness that Elmer was so good at picking out and is an all around quality bourbon.

90/100

"Phenomenology","t5_2qs0b","To justify the need for a state to manage social deviance in an ""unbiased"" way. In other words, to enforce social norms bureaucratically instead of vigilantes executing crude justice. 

By prohibiting certain actions, like domestic violence or possession of drugs, states remove the possibility that they can become normal behaviors. Violations inevitably happen, at which point the state intervenes, setting an example for others who might be deviant, while punishing the individual for their lack of respect for the government. 

Sc: sociology of incarceration, foucault's discipline and punish, and my own thoughts about the basic function of 'criminality' in the context of the state's ideal population (which must include criminals, who justify the continual need for a state, similarly to how military force is abused). 

Tldr; without crime, who needs a state?

"bigdickproblems","t5_2sqd6","Again, please stop spouting confirmation bias based lies. Here's some mythbusting for you, rooted in facts and science:


*     **Circumcision removes half the penile skin.**
    The amount of skin removed varies from little more than the constricted tip of the foreskin to an amount just slightly longer than the glans. The glans is rarely more than a quarter of the length of the entire infant penis (and proportionately much less in an adult). The lie comes from counting the foreskin length twice ""because it has an inner and outer layer"". This fact is really irrelevant because coverage is only provided once.
      

*     **Circumcision removes hundreds of miles of blood vessels.**
    'Hundreds of miles' is a gross exaggeration which most people can clearly see through but even so, the blood vessels in the foreskin serve only the foreskin itself and hence their removal with the foreskin is of no further consequence. 
      

*     **The foreskin contains specialized nerve endings.**
    All nerves are specialized. There is nothing more or less special about those in the foreskin compared with those elsewhere in the body. The glans also contains nerves which don't usually get fully stimulated when sex is experienced through the foreskin. 
      

*     **Circumcision removes 20,000 nerve endings.**

    This is an outright lie. The figure of 20,000 has been admitted to have been made up by an anti-circumcision activist to make it look as if really serious damage is done by circumcision. There is no scientific evidence that there are even that number of nerve endings in the entire penis.
    Whatever the number, however, the nerves in the foreskin are almost exclusively related to protecting the foreskinitself from harm, just like those elsewhere in the skin. When the foreskin is removed these nerves become irrelevant. 


And here is another well written article pointing out the lack of factual information: http://thecircumcisiondecision.com/20000-nerve-endings/.","1398902717"

While it may be nice for browsing and typing, you can't really game with those resolutions.

Movies, magazines, celebrities, the very culture of engagements and weddings. These are the things we grow up with that are glorifying diamonds and affecting how valuable or ""liked"" they are. These are also all calculated moves by De Beers over the decades.

I'm not saying nobody would like diamonds if it wasn't for De Beers, I'm saying nobody would be shelling out multiple months salary for diamond engagement rings had it not been for their shady influence over the generations before us.

They played us (and continue to play us) like a fiddle and I for one don't like being played. I'm encouraging people to think for themselves and not take for granted the common perception of diamonds.

Like I said elsewhere in this thread; don't believe me? Go buy a diamond ring from Tiffany's and try to sell it to another jeweler for half of what you paid. You won't be able to. Jewelers know that diamonds are marked up far beyond their worth. Try the same thing with an emerald or ruby?

We had sysops (mods to you) who took 3-6 hour shifts and the sysop on duty would read every single message on the boards, helping those he/she could, moving misplaced questions into the correct place, fixing titles now and then (from ""HELP!!"") and removing from sight (never deleting) those that violated the rules and very politely informing the author.  I had sysops in East coast, central and west coast US, Hawaii, Japan, Germany and UK and each would take their shift, hand off to the next sysop and we'd get coverage 24/7.  Fortunately for us, we had software that could pull every single message over a time frame that we could use to monitor.  In practice, you'd only need to make a run every hour or two and it didn't take that much time to read all the messages.

It's work to manage, but we had such camaraderie and the board ran incredibly well.

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","This seems like an useless article which just reiterates the simple notion that men may also be victims of rape and deserve the same support as women rape survivors. I realise gender roles and stereotypes play a role in this too but 27 ""reasons"" which paraphrase the same idea is pretty redundant. 

I should add that I completely agree male victims are often neglected in rape statistics and there should be more awareness supporting all genders whom were unfortunately traumatised with such an experience. ","1398902725"

&gt;* The WHO says more new antibiotics need to be developed, while governments and individuals should take steps to slow this process.

I don't know why the fuck they are going halal. Most of their customers would be 20-35 Irish office workers or students. A demographic who love their bacon (we consume the fifth highest amount of bacon in the EU).

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Let me very carefully explain to you a very laymens understanding of wingloading. All of this pertains both to real life and the game, but moreso the game, obviously.

Higher wingloading = USUALLY better in high speed, bnz, hit and run type maneuvers. The Fw-190 A and D had 241 and 238 kg/m2 respectively. The Ta-152 had 196 kg/m2, but because of its wing shape of the H-1, the rolling is neutered and doesn't give  it a maneuverability advantage at lower altitudes vs something like a D-9. This is why the Ta-152 C was conceived with a shorter wing span.

In comparison the Spitfires have WAY lower wingloading then ALL of these planes. the Spitfire Mk. Vb alone had 133 kg/m2. This is one of the large contributing factors to a Spitfires turning prowess, and the higher wingloading is why the 190 and Ta-152 can't turn quite as well as one.","1398902730"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; One would expect to find unicorn bones if unicorns existed. One would not expect to find God bones if God existed.

Granted, but it seems reasonable to expect that the existence of a deity would leave some trace somewhere.

&gt;That's not what evidence means.

In fairness, you asked for evidence of a simple explanation.  Do you beny that the fact that nothing we are aware of requires a god tends to support the presumption that there isn't one more than it supports the presumption that there is one?

&gt;I don't think you understand the argument. The theistic urge seems pretty universally ingrained in humans.

I think I do.  The theistic urge is actually more of a spiritual urge.  For most of our history, mankinds religions were animalistic.  God evolved much later.  There are theories about the source for these, and eventually we may learn there is an organic explanation for them.

I'm not saying there is no god.  All I'm saying is that the existence of a deity is much less likely than non existance given that there is no evidence either way.  Every phenomena we explain that doesn't require divinity adds support to the proposition that none exists.  All of the phenomena that have ever been attributed to a deity are either subsequently shown not to be supernatural or are dubious claims to begin with.

I've never heard of anything verifiable that supports or suggests the existence of a deity.  Why would existence be a preferrable assumption to nonexistence under these circumstances?

They paid real life money for an imaginary ship. Let them have their cake.  If you have an Aurora, congrats, you have a challenge. 

Just because the Hornet is considered a premiere dogfighter doesn't mean it will be king.  I've flown plenty of flight sims to know just because one plane is considered better, doesn't mean you're going to die. Skill based game.  

  I swear if it's not one thing, it's another with people.  CR said it himself, you can't please everyone.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Maybe so, but it is at least possible to provide primary source documents relevant to some of the questions I am posing, such as if any other prominent southerners viewed an offensive against the north, such as the assault on Fort Sumter, as suicide. 

The history that we grew up with, that the south launched the attack on Fort Sumter because it viewed a show of force as the only way to firmly obtain its sovereignty, is only one side of a larger story. As evidenced by Robert Toombs, it is clear that not all agreed that a first strike was the appropriate response. 

Important primary sources that could be provided that would be relevant to my questions could include accounts provided by northern war-hawks eager to go to war prior to the start of the conflict, statements from southern dissenters who disapproved of launching an offensive against the north, and many other primary sources. 

If primary source documents from prominent northerners indicate that they were clamoring for war with the south, then you could reason that yes, war was inevitable and it was just a matter of time before the north initiated the conflict. However if the opposite was true, and we see disdain for a potential civil war, then is it preposterous to reason that the situation would not have escalated if the south simply left alone the federal forts that refused to surrender?

Mainstream history tells the tale of the initiation of the war by the south, ultimately thanks to the decisions made by Jefferson Davis, but Jefferson Davis was only one man of the south and did not represent the opinions of all despite being the president. ","1398902735"

I've met several pet foxes. They were not much different from a dog, in all honesty. Their personality is different, which is, I believe, why people choose to bring different kinds of animals in to their lives. There are bound to be bad fox owners, but there are also bad dog owners.

&gt; Do believe foxes form better pets than tigers and chimpanzees.

I assume you missed a word and intended this to be a question, so I'll answer it as such.

Yes. Tigers are dangerous, and chimpanzees need far more attention than the average person can give.

4 [[sedge scorpion]].    
4 [Pharika's chosen]].   
4 [[eidolon of blossoms]].   
4 [[grisly salvage]].   
4 [doomwake giant]].    
4 of the JOU new self miller creature (can't remember).    
4 [[putrefy]].   
4 [golgari charm]].  
4 temple of malady.  
4 overgrown tomb.   
8 swamp.      
8 forest.  

The basic synergy of the deck is that Pharika's ability gives instant ENCHANTMENT snakes... With death touch

I'm considering putting [[strength of the fallen]] and taking out either Pharikas chosen or sedge scorpion.

Each button-mash positive frame advances the timer before they are automatically let go. This timer is set to a longer and longer time depending on percent.

In addition being hit while in a grab adds to the timer, but no pummel adds time faster than the timer ticks on its own (either that or pummels dont affect the timer like other hits I'm not sure).

It's not going to get anywhere with both of you playing relationship chicken. You're gonna have to ask him out. The signs are there that he will accept, all you need is a little faith, and try not to make it seem like a huge deal, so that if you were wrong, you can just change topic easily and avoid awkwardness. 

Honestly, there's two outcomes, the first, he says yes and you get to tell each other how you feel more openly and act on those feelings, or the second being that you know for sure that he doesn't see you in a romantic way and you can move on and meet someone who does.","1398902746"

If you want to send your money to NCIX in Vancouver so be it but it is nice to support Regina's retail industry. Just because OTV doesnt buy enough product to increase their margins and allow them to sell cheaper doesnt mean that money isnt helping. Your taxes on those purchases stay local, local businesses help sponsor events and charities in your community and it can allow you to build relationships with people who live in your community. You dont have to make all your purchases local but i bet in a lot of cases if you get a dud or have a warranty issue it is a lot easier to deal with a guy down the street to then packaging something up to send away.

I thought it would be more of a culture shock--I lived in Chicago my entire life--but so far it hasn't at all. I tried public trans for a while before I got a car, and it is challenging. I took a lot of buses, and while riding them was fine, it would often take 2 buses to get where I was going and the waits were often really long. The trains seem nice, if they work for your routes.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","It's sobering to think about this.

All growing up you think as soldiers, men who went to war, were just that. *Men.* But you steadily realize, as you realize adults were people, that these men were people too.

These people had hopes and dreams. You knew that the whole time, but didn't really connect it. They had hopes and dreams, almost like you.

And then you realize that you are nearly them. You are but a few years younger at most. Many men went to war at your age or a little younger. (Or older) They snuck in, they falsified information, they **wanted** to go to war.

But then you realize even further. These men are your age. That makes you a man. (Or woman, just going off the historically *male* soldiers) You are still a child, you always thought of yourself as one. But these people, not just men, went and died by the millions. You never thought as yourself as one of them.

But you are.  
You are nearly an adult, if not already.

You could've been one of them. You could have sacrificed yourself to let your buddy live. These men did great honours while you sit wondering about seemingly petty things.

But even further thought reveals that you could have done those things. They had equally petty thoughts, they were insecure teens and early 20-somethings. By that same logic, you may lay down your life.

Everyone is capable of something. I'm not saying you shouldn't respect these men. They DID die, went above and beyond their duties in many cases. They died for your safety and freedom.

But you remember they are people.

&gt;

&gt;The [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) ___Glycera___ is a group of [polychaetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychaete) (bristle worms) commonly known as __blood worms__. They are typically found on the bottom of shallow marine waters, and some species (e.g. the common blood worm, *Glycera dibranchiata*), are extensively harvested along the Northeastern coast of the United States for use as bait in [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing). Another common species is the tufted gilled bloodworm, *G. americana*.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","&gt; I'm not sure why you're giving me international data I already know.

Because you are apparently okay with being in the bottom third of OECD member countries in academic achievement.

&gt; Culture is.

Which is why we have standards we should meet.  It takes all the other aspects you want to hang your hat on out of the picture.  If a students meets standards they move on.  If they don't, they need remediation.

&gt; Everyone has something to offer, and expecting everyone to fall into a narrow range of testable skills is unrealistic.

There are basic skills the states have decided every student needs to master.  If you let every special snowflake decide - in 6th grade  - to express themselves how they want, then we've reached the peak of American society.  They all want to be video game testers.

&gt; so I see no indicator that testing is the answer.

It's an indicator that you keep trying to toss out as if it is somehow invalid.  It's not THE answer, but a school with 47% of kids at standards over the past 3 years needs to be looked at and shaken up.

&gt;  ""middle school teachers""

There you go with that unattributable quote thing again.

&gt; how your having hostility towards teachers and students

I want kids and teachers to meet standards.  That's hostile?

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostile

&gt; Honestly, a big part of teaching is attitude, and yours comes off as terrible.

Yours comes off as defensive.

&gt; . I suppose if all the high schools blame the middle schools and all the middle schools blame the elementary schools and all the elementary schools blame the parents, we'll all just be okay. shrug

Cute.  How about we hold EACH accountable to STANDARDS?  

&gt; your disparagement of middle schools was

""It's a challenging age to teach. I'm hoping to get hired at a high school myself. I want to teach thinking skills, not coloring.""

In rebuttal, you've tried to explain the subtle nuances in the amount of time required to color a poster, shifted the discussion of failure to meet standards to a more comfortable one of why testing is not an accurate measurement of all facets of student growth.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Mir (M not W :P) has been delayed yet again, and Canonical says that that Mir should be the default ""by"" 16.04. AFAIK, no other distro has expressed any interest in going near Mir, still.

Wayland isn't the default anywhere mainstream yet either, but IIRC Fedora now has the option of running Gnome under Wayland, without having to perform an any black magic. XWayland support recently got a sizable improvement (it's pretty much a first-class citizen from Xorg's PoV now).

If you're looking towards the death of X11 (including XMir/XWayland), I'd say check again at the end of the year, and it might be possible if you're willing to limit your app selection. It probably won't be the greatest experience for a while more even then, as likely a huge amount of bugs/regressions will be discovered once Wayland gets in the hands of far more users.","1398902765"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","That sounds extremely frustrating.  I haven't gone through that yet, but I get frustrated just contemplating some aspects of pregnancy - like, if I was pregnant and drank half a glass of wine, and got berated for it by a stranger, which of those actions would actually harm the baby?  Probably the stress of being berated by the stranger, but not the half glass of wine.

It seems like we expect pregnant women to become this idolized perfection and judge them harshly if they don't live up to it.  I hope I'm just over thinking things and they don't turn out that way.  But for you, I hope that in the end you realize that stress and being upset causes your baby more harm than the food/drink/massage/whatever, so telling the world to go to hell and enjoying the food/drink/massage/whatever (when you can) isn't you being a bad person, it's you taking care of yourself and the thing growing in you.

Some day, some way, I guarantee you, he'll use the arsenal. Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act.""

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Hi grux, its a tough situation to be in i think for a lot of Brawl players in this community. Melee was hated on by the FGC for a while and they overcame it, but melee and fgc never really paid attention to one another in a big way so it didnt affect the melee community to the same extent. Brawl on the other hand receives tons of hate in house from its parent games, and since its in house people pay attention to it who are active and new to the community and it trickles through to lots of members, TSB didnt do the game favors in terms of positively growing its outreach, brought a huge recreational audience to Melee but made a lot of people have a bad taste in their mouths upon their first impression of Brawl. The game is full of passionate people that are talented,dedicated and skilled, but its hard to sift through all the hate when its so widespread sometimes. Melee worked their asses off and earned the respect and growth they achieved. This isnt to say that Brawl is the victim here, lots of problems within the ssbb community itself that have put it in the position its at right now, I started to be more vocal because i couldnt sit back and watch things deteriorate like they were but who knows how things will play out. Things are improving, the podcast group is almost at 2k and discussion is becoming a lot more productive and inclusive to generate new players and interest, more people need to step up. The community is what dictates a games worth, so people need to make the investment if they want to see it grow. The game has been competitively going strong for 6years now, thats impressive in its own right, but if people want it to elevate to the same levels of Melee for ex, still a lot of work to be done.","1398902769"

"running","t5_2qlit","1.5 lbs/week might be a bit much. Focus on improving the *quality* of your diet while making sure not to go overboard. Weight loss is much more dependent on diet than exercise, so nutrition will have to be a focus if you are serious about losing weight. That being said, if you combine exercise with a good nutrition plan, the weight loss will definitely be easier. Not easy, maybe, but easier.

Losing weight will have a major positive effect on your running and your half time as long as you lose weight smartly. Consistency is the key, both for training and for nutrition.","1398902771"
"dotnet","t5_2qh3h","It's not hard, you just have to learn how the DOM in SharePoint works as opposed to non-SharePoint stuff.

Site collections (SPWeb) &gt; Sites (SpSite) &gt; Lists, Libraries (which are really just modified Lists), etc.  Most stuff you'll do is fairly easy to get, once you learn your way around.  There's a book about SharePoint Web Parts by Manning publishing, they have an ebook for it also, and it was amazing in learning how to code for SharePoint.  A key point that it pushes on you is that, although you CAN create something from scratch, sometimes you don't need to - existing web parts can work for a lot of jobs, and if you have to copy that and modify it, then so be it.

"OaklandAthletics","t5_2scld","Once again, showing that they drew well for a handful of years when they had
1) the best team in baseball with 3-straight WS appearances
2) multiple HoF'ers and the most exciting players in baseball (Rickey, Eck, Bash Bro's, etc)
3) A much better stadium than the Giants, and far more accessible by public transportation
4) a wonderful owner 

Yes, when all those thing combined, the A's had a few years in a row where they cracked the top-1/3 in attendance, and even got close to the top two years. 

Take away any of those factors, any of them, and the A's did not draw well.  Winning without the great owner? - look at the early 70's.  winning without the better ballpark than the Giants? - look at the early 2000's.  Great owner and ballpark without the dominant team? - Look at 83-87 under Haas. 

At least one of those factors can no longer happen (much better ballpark than the Giants) so that advantage is gone.  The Giants have also won some championships now, too, so the completely 1-sided winning history is gone as well despite our advantage there. 

Listen, the A's in their 45 years in Oakland have more WS appearances than top-1/3 attendance years. They have more playoff appearances than top-half attendance years. their league rank in attendance has only been higher than their rank in wins [Edit] 4 times in 45 years, and all four were down years on the field following playoff years so a hangover effect on attendance. 

It's not good.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Basically goal tending is defined by a few styles, a complete butterfly, a profly, Finnish bullshit(glove focus), crazy. A goal tender who prefers a flat butterfly will drop down once he thinks the pass isn't there, he will expand upwards, downward and side to side in order to increase size. Mason does not do this, or doesn't focus on it. Profly is the half way margin, the butterfly becomes a tool rather then a focus. You drop at the shot so you are as high as possible, if its a high shot you are in a better position and if you are fast enough you can cut down the five hole by dropping quickly. Essentially artificially extending your butterfly. Finnish bullshit is basically trying to play goal tender like a baseball catcher, if someone uses their glove a lot they either are Finnish or played baseball. Mason is almost like this, except he tries to use a more standard butterfly. Finns like Niemi splay out in very odd butterflys and hang low to the ground centering the glove in the net give it a good position to go anywhere. Like a cat crouching almost. Then you just have people who have so many styles taped together it just looks like insane noise, like Tim fucking Thomas.

Go to Select &gt; Color Range...

You can either use the tear drop tool to select the specific shade of black (or white), or you can just select it from the color wheel. 

Set fuzziness to 200 for maximum coverage.

Repeat the process for the second color.

Once everything is selected go to Image &gt; Adjustments &gt; Invert. Or you can use [Ctrl] + i.

The selected colors should now be inverted.

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","Personally, and this is just what I enjoy doing a lot when the teams are balanced, here we go.

So. Clusterfuck one side of the field. Just throw numbers forward and get their attention. Have a few people going down the middle and other direction. Once you have their attention (and you will get it, I mean, you're pushing very quickly and powerfully one side of the field), you best be prepared for two scenarios.

A: They are logical and decide to try to push the flank opposite to you to try to get you trapped on a side of the field. Fighting on both sides never works out. To prevent this, I usually have the people best at suppressing and holding down areas to hold here. I will usually be lurking around here as well. If they decide that it isn't worth pursuing you down this side, your team is in a prime position to get a small group to then go around that weak side and completely surprise everyone. If they stay and try to push the weak side, your team just goes for it and tries to take advantage of their lack of numbers. Not doing this is rather stupid because your small number of teammate trying to control the weak flank and middle will not be able to hold very long. 
B: They do what you want and commit everyone to that side. You take a small group of people and push your teams weak side where you will have little to no resistance and surround them.

Obviously not every game works out this way, but hey. you asked go to. this is what I usually try to accomplish. Unless its an objective game where you have to attack a base and you have unlimited respawns. In that case, everyone suicide ""y0l0swag hsp combat center suicide "" rushes it. You have unlimited respawns. Take advantage of it. ","1398902781"

"AskNetsec","t5_2t3w8","It's a fair point I'm having trouble asking the question. I'm talking about practical knowlege as opposed news like stuxnet or pure theory like learning about buffer overflows.

Ok, meet Sammy. Sammy's a hypothetical guy who knows his shit. If you put a particular Apache box in front of him he knows that this exploit will get him so far and then he can run that exploit and get furthur. You plonk a different box in front of him he knows another vulenerability that will get him in. But sammy isn't just a skiddy, sammy knows how the jist of most of these exploits and knows a couple in dept. His knowlege isn't just research, his knowlege isn't just hypotheticals, and his knowlege isn't about the news.

I can't describe it well but there are a lot of people walking around and on /r/netsec that know this stuff. What I'm asking is how you get to there. Obviusly you can't memorise the whole CVE database and every line of code, there's a limit. Conversly you can't just know about MS08-067 and leave it at that, people like sammy must 

1) Be reading about this stuff somewhere

2) Qualifying that's worth learning about

3) Qaulifying to what dept to learn about a particular exploit/vulnerability

4) Getting interesting reading matterials on them from somethere

5) (I don't expect this one to be answered) This information must be organised in their brain somehow.

So If I was trying to get to where Sammy is. Do I sit down with with a table and start memorising....

You can use malathion but it may damage the plants if you use it before they vine.

Additionally:

1.) you **will** end up eating chemicals - and that's not cool.

2.) broad-spectrum insecticides kill everything.  Including the beneficial insects - bees, to name one.

You can use kaolin clay if where you're growing them is sunny.  Kaolin is in toothpaste and is the main component in porcelain (fine china).  It works because you spread it over the plant which kinda makes it invisible to the bugs.  Instead of seeing and smelling a tasty plant they see and taste clay dust.  One of its commercial names is Surround WP.  The dust cuts down sunlight getting to the plant which is why I specified a sunny location, BTW.

You can also use pyrethrin.  It is made from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium seeds (aka ""mums"").  Pyrethrin will kill on contact (it's a neurotoxin so don't get it on YOU).  It breaks down in the presence of light or oxygen so if you're careful to spray when the bees aren't as active you'll hopefully not kill as many of them.  Bonide - and many others - make a pyrethrin solution for home gardeners.

I'm sure there are a lot of other organic solutions.  These are two suggestions my neighbor and I use.  The pyrethrin is easier to get a complete coverage of the plant with because it's a spray.

**Big point** by the way - whatever method you choose don't forget the underside of the leaves.  The bugs hide under there.","1398902782"

 [**Image scaling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image%20scaling): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In computer graphics, __image scaling__ is the process of resizing a [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image). Scaling is a non-trivial process that involves a trade-off between efficiency, smoothness and sharpness. With [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) graphics, as the size of an image is reduced or enlarged, the [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) that form the image become increasingly visible, making the image appear ""soft"" if pixels are averaged, or jagged if not. With [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) the trade-off may be in processing power for re-rendering the image, which may be noticeable as slow re-rendering with still graphics, or slower [frame rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate) and frame skipping in [computer animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation).

1. Clarity. Sounds are more isolated from each other. An example of this is that it's easier to make out individual instruments in an orchestra.

In fact, most RoUK people don't. I would even argue that the standard expected for A-levels is a bit higher than what you would expect from your standard High School diploma in the US. The reason has to do with the fact that students are expected to specialise in a few chosen subjects (usually 3, possibly more) to learn them to greater detail. Perhaps a parallel could be drawn between American AP exams and A-levels. Though even this isn't accurate entirely because A-levels are generally two year courses rather than just a single year.","1398902784"

"DarkSouls2","t5_2vqni","If I may add to this, Ornstein's job was to protect the princess; obviously he would not be doing a very good job by standing around the illusion of her. Perhaps the O that we fight in DkS1 was one of Gwyndolyn's illusions whilst the real one left Anor Londo with the princess, the one we fight in DkS2 could be the real one. 

Also, we see in the first one that there are no regular giants left in AL at the time of the first game, the ones we see are all illusions that disappear with Gwyndolyn's death. Whilst it is possible that they all died out or just left on their own, I believe it's far more likely they would have gone with the wedding procession of Flann and Gwynevere. Hence the fact that there are giants in Heide.


But why is Heide such a ruin, and where would Gwynevere have gone? Well, one interesting thing that I've just found are the description for Divine Blessings. In DkS1, the description for them specifically mention Gwynevere, she's the ""godess"" in question. However in DkS2, the description (specifically) 
&gt;*...Water blessed by an ancient goddess. Her name is long forgotten, and the Magic Academy of Melfia denies even her existence...*

Note, Melfia academy does not question her existence, but outright denies anything of the sort. Is it possible there was some sort of conflict between Heide and Melfia, which subsequently led to Heide's destruction? Is it possible perhaps Gwynevere and Flann had to flee, or even were killed?

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Let me also add that Erik Mueller, one of the key researchers on the Watson team, was working on deep reading a few years back, and is an expert in automating commonsense reasoning.  Have a look at this paper:

https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/tupra.pdf

From the abstract:

&gt; We present a framework to represent and reason about narratives that combines logical and probabilistic representations of commonsense knowledge. Unlike most natural language understanding systems which merely extract facts or semantic roles, our system builds probabilistic representations of the temporal sequence of world states and events implied by a narrative.

In the conclusion, they write:

&gt; In this paper we introduced a framework together with exact and approximate reasoning algorithms for representing narratives and answering queries about them. We suggest that using action theories allows understanding semantics of the narratives as well as answering questions whose responses are not contained in the text using reasoning in the framework. We demonstrate our results in a Robocup commentary domain and a less structured domain of children stories.

&gt; Our current system is a flexible structure that can be augmented with richer NLP tools such as disambiguation, co-reference resolution, etc. For example, have ice cream in our story should be disambiguated to eating and therefore a branch of the tree should be removed. Our immediate future work is to augment our system with such NLP tools and apply it in Remedia corpus for reading comprehension. Our idea is to manually construct effect axioms for some events and a noise event Nothing . This way we can model all the verbs of the stories. Our current approach only works if the sentences are consecutive; In future, we would like to apply partial planning ideas and deal with overlapping events that happen in the narrative. Also, we would like to use this approach to find missing events of narratives.

Wonder how that work is going...

A more relevant article, perhaps, is this one:

http://people.hofstra.edu/vern_r_walker/Ashley_Walker-Toward_Evidence-Based_Legal_Arguments-ICAIL2013.pdf

It shows how Watson could construct legal arguments.

These articles and capabilities I mention are, however, only a drop in the bucket of the vast collection of algorithms that Watson uses -- assuming it even uses these particular ones, or close variants.  It will be interesting to see what Watson is capable of in a couple years... ","1398902786"

But they've only polished them, really, they haven't made them more challenging or engaging as the ability toolsets players have to utilize and the overall skill level of the population have grown. Your typical dungeon group found instances quite challenging back in the day, and it was not uncommon to wipe a few times on bosses or even abandon the run because it was too hard. While I'm sure Blizzard doesn't want people giving up out of frustration, why can't we go back to dungeons being at least *somewhat* of a challenge? RFC, WC, Stockades, BFD and such, fine, make them facerolls. But there's no reason for Scholo, slave pens, nexus, and all the rest of the dungeons as you level up and get better to be equally effortless.","1398902790"

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","so its especially pointless? the servers on the Wii U have been fine as far as up time goes; the E-shop had problems during large scale releases like pokemon but game play servers went largely unaffected. any company who chooses to not run their own online servers can opt to use P2P hosting; there is not a single technical reason to justify gold other than poor hardware manufacturing efficiency.  gold was a subsidy for the console on release because of the overwhelming losses on hardware; now that the hardware is being sold at a profit or at cost its just greedy; mr toad would clap his hands at the prospect of this ""wild ride"".
 if you think gold is worth it because  ""better servers, and also a larger number of people online"" you have low standards because the PC as a gaming platform don't typically have ""Poor servers or low pop"". if-fact if they let people game on silver accounts; gold members would have more people to play with. 

gold needs to be a service not a price gouge; free games seems like a start towards that end; but when you factor it they are only doing it for the console near the end of its lifespan, that is not backwards compatible. its basically just being done to inflate the sales figures of titles that are out of print.","1398902793"

Concentrated HCl would therefore be approximately 1000 times more corrosive than your stomach acid.

It would be way easier to both splash for more colors since even Guildgates are many times better than basics (black for Bump in the Night *and* white for Lightning Helix would be ideal, probably), and with scrylands you'd actually have a way other than Magma Jet to smooth out your draws and ensure you don't draw too many lands.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","Ok, warning, I'm feeling hella bitter. 

A few weeks ago I told my boyfriend of over six months I love him. He said he didn't feel the same way. I'm hurt but don't want to pressure him and say it's cool, no pressure.

Fast forward to this weekend. I went to visit my boyfriend as I did every weekend for the past month. We've been on co-op because of our college but previously lived in the same dorm. The weekend is completely happy and normal. The night before I'm supposed to leave he got back from using the bathroom, climbs into bed, kisses the top of my head and we start talking about our plans for break (literally that morning he told me I should come with him). Then he goes ""Actually, I don't think this is going to work."" I ask ""What? Seeing each other over break?"" He said no. Us. I'm in complete shock and make a horrible hour long drive home in the dark. 

Apparently he felt that he couldn't give me what I want in this relationship and we never felt ""right"" to him. Really. Took six freaking months to figure that out? Thanks. 

But hey! At least the next morning he texted me saying we should be friends!

tldr; took a dude six months including basically living together and bringing me home to his parents to realize he couldn't love me and broke the news while snuggling thirty minutes after having sex.","1398902794"

The idea of a hobby can help, I suppose, but I feel like if you devote your time to something so you will think about her less, you will just spend the time doing the hobby, thinking about her more. (Human mind is frustrating like that.)
Try to figure what /specifically/ triggers feeling clingy or jealous. Is it because you feel discluded, or that the friends/her are doing something?... If you understand what is directly causing it, you will have a better time dealing with it.
You need to talk to her, especially about jealousy. Tell her that you've been feeling jealous, and that you want to get over that feeling. Maybe there is something simple you or she could do. Maybe you just need to clarify intentions, out in the open, instead of brooding about it.

Best of luck, it's tough dealing with these feelings but seriously, wanting to do something about it is a big step.","1398902795"

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

I think it works on the same principle as Disintrigate. AD applies on the first cast, not first ""tick"" of damage. So all 4 should get it. Also it definitely doesn't remove stacks when the individual orbs go off, so that would support my original theory. I'll try to do some real testing tomorrow so that I'm not sitting here spreading wrong information.

EDIT: It also super synergizes with Explosive Blast. Because you can do this: Blades x5 -&gt; Orbit -&gt; Blades x5 -&gt;explosive blast. And if you get your CDR and timing right, you should be able to cast 5 Blades for max stacks before you can cast it again. Also lets you really stack attack speed in a useful way that won't just tank you resources. Since like I said you don't ever need to worry about them. So you're constantly procing max stack AD on both EB and AO and you'll do damage way above your sheet DPS.","1398902808"

Haha I wouldn't be surprised if he or some other people actually believed that.

&gt;But seriously, dude is making the worst point ever.

I just don't like when people insist they know better than those who have gone through it themselves. He's never been a woman (that I know of, at least) so how can he speak for what's easy/hard for women? Doesn't make sense to me.

&gt;I'd agree that you're above average, based on some of the pictures you have posted.

Thank you, I appreciate that! I personally consider myself to be below average, but for my entire life most people have told me I'm pretty so I've finally been able to battle through quite a bit of self-esteem issues and accept the fact that there *are* people out there that actually consider me attractive. (Note: this required years and years of therapy!) Again, thank you for the compliment though :)

&gt;Personality makes a big difference to attractiveness too. In the random hook-up scene it really doesn't help when you don't get to know a person. I think most of us who are average or so looking don't really know any better because we've never had the crazy attention that thin, hot chicks get. And I'm pretty ok with that!

I agree completely. I still get plenty of attention, but I don't get hit on everywhere I go, all the time, 24/7/365. And like you said, I'm okay with that! I don't think I would enjoy getting a whole lot more. I just hate this myth that any average-looking woman can walk into a bar and be guaranteed sex that night.","1398902808"

Yet none of us here know what came before in the conversation and none of us know you... so let's not jump to conclusions. I hate it when I try to open up to someone and explain what I'm going through and they think they know better than me what's going on inside of me. ""Oh, you're depressed? Go to some parties, that's what I do when I'm sad"". People really have a hard time putting themselves in other people's shoed (or even trying), and think what works for them works for everyone, even when you tell them ""it's not that simple for me"". They aren't interested in listening or are uncomfortable and just want the conversation to end, I guess.

Maybe you do have a problem with not being positive enough (I sure do), but that's not what HSP is about at all. And ""being positive"" alone doesn't solve everything, it doesn't magically alter your brain chemestry...

The PvP is basically a giant zergfest. I heard this was one of the ""high points"" of the game, and you'll quickly realize it's just people running around in giant groups spamming AOE and ranged attacks. There's not really anything fun about it.

Even less fun when you run into your first Vamp DK who can take on 20 people at once. It's just stupid and should have been hotfixed.

The class system is very confusing and in my opinion counter-intuitive. You'll just have to look into for yourself but basically outside of class skills any class can use any armor, any combat skill, etc....why? I don't know. But EVERYONE uses bows all the time PvP.","1398902819"

There is a school year before Year 1 known as Reception. This is typically a transitional year, with some children not starting school, or attending for the full school day until partway through the academic year (this depends on the age of the child and the local council).

Also most primary schools cover Reception up to Year 6, but some only deal with Reception to Year 2 and Year 3 to Year 6, these are generally known as infant school and junior school, respectively.

Additionally, what we refer to as colleges often also offer A-levels and re-taking of GCSEs, as well as vocational courses. In short, colleges cater for students that have GCSEs (or equivalent) as their highest-level qualification.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","No offense taken at all. It has to do with the shop pricing model.  The idea is that shops have ""minimum prices"" they can charge.  They do this because Specialized, say, wants people to stock its bikes.  To do that, you have to be able to make money on them.  To do that, you can't have them as a loss leader in the store, or you'll stock bikes that you can make money on.  Specialized, Trek, etc. can't sell bikes without their distribution network, so they solved this problem by having ""territories"" and ""minimum prices"" to incentivize stores to carry their gear.

Minimum prices work fine that way... unless you violate them.  So, for example, they might have a discount for employees, but that technically violates the minimum contract.  You really don't want customers knowing about those deals or those margins or they'll all demand them, and now you're in an awkward situation.  It's a lot easier for all involved if you just don't say anything.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; What you're talking about is when the brother get's double the sister when their Father dies. And that's because the brother is now the one who is obligated to cater to the family's financial needs. 

And that's not gender discrimination? Please know that in the 21st century and well before, women have taken full responsibility for families. Some of them have lazy ass brothers who still get double their share. And, BTW, what happens when a father has only daughters? Even in that situation the daughters don't get 100%.

&gt; A woman's testimony before a judge is not half of a man's.

While the ayah is about debt only, and assumes the woman to be forgetful, hadith clearly states that a woman's testimony is half of man (with no qualification).

Al Baqrah, 2:282: ""And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. ""

Sahih Bukhari (authentic hadith): He said, ""Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?"" They replied in the affirmative. He said, ""This is the deficiency in her intelligence.""

&gt;If you mean little girls can get married at a young age then that's also wrong. 

The Prophet married a six year old, consummated at 9. Per Sahih hadith, Aisha was playing with her dolls when she was sent to the Prophet's home. Because of this, Iraq and Pakistan are trying to pass laws (with religious scholar support) that reduces the age of consent to the pre teen years. And any challenge to this is contested on the basis that it is Sunnah.

And if you're talking about maturity, how many girls/women who are ready for marriage are playing with dolls?

&gt; Back then wife beating was the norm. 

OK, but if it's wrong then ban it. Alcohol was the norm and it was banned. Why not ban wife beating? Also, why doesn't the woman have a Quranic right to discipline her husband for disobedience?

&gt; So 'light' beating isn't really beating. 

Seriously??? Every scholar says that beating is allowed. For 1300 years it was never qualified to be ""light beating"". Today, since wife abuse has become such an important topic, the scholars have redefined it as light beating. But still, the right to discipline your wife, including light beating, is enshrined in religious law and not challenged.

&gt;muslim men don't hit their wives

Maybe Lyanna spurns Robert Baratheon, who then rises up to kill Rhaegar.

Was in gas station, kind of out of it, getting soda. Had cup on soda machine, sitting in a way that it was angled so the cup would be pushing against the pedal thingy that makes the soda come out. I'm awful with technical terms. I was grabbing a nearby bag of chips, turned back to my cup, and discovered I made a bad miscalculation, at the cup somehow tipped away from the machine (cue internal horror), sat upright for a second (cue internal relief), and inertia carried the tipping of the cup so it started sending itself off of the edge of the drink machine (cue internal horror, cursing of physics).

Managed to stop the cup from dumping completely, but it did leave a bit of a mess. So I immediately scrounged around for a towel, dutifully cleaned up the spilled beverage off of the drink machine, countertop, runoff heading down the side of the cabinets, and whatever I could clean up that hit the floor. Would've mopped it up if I could find it.

Told the guy behind the counter that I made a mess, cleaned up the best I could, and that they should probably put a wet-floor sign there. Guy's response was shock and confusion.

&gt;&gt; Attendant- Never seen anyone actually clean up their mess before. Most people don't even tell us when they've made one.

University students differ from the community average by age, ethnicity, intelligence and the degree to which they desire to go to university (and probably a lot of other ways).

It's important to remember that a lot of articles aimed at the general public are phrased in a manner which denigrates men or minimises men or their achievements.  This is casual misandry.  This article suggests that men 'lose their minds' while women do not, which is not at all what a result like that would suggest even if it is true.

.. that either every man in a region gets to vote in, or some fashion for individual men to opt in-out of what privileges they want to apply to them.

The thing that irks me about the popular feminist doctrine regarding things like patriarchy and privilege is that they take every instance of two genders being treated differently, and by the power of ""the grass is always greener"" they extol the virtues of the male societal expectation while bemoaning the female societal expectation.

Then, and here is the important part, they work to gain every benefit they view the males as having while fighting to retain every beneficially sexist aspect they already have under their belts.

"CNC","t5_2ralu","Seconding this: plasma isn't very useful for FRC and FTC bots, it lacks precision. Laser or waterjet shops are what you want.

But personally, I think you should be looking equally hard into getting a machine for your team to use yourselves. This may be a better discussion for /r/FRC or /r/FTC depending on which you are, but my basic reasoning is that if you send your parts out to be made by somebody else, the students don't learn anything. They don't learn how to program, set up, and run a CNC machine, they don't learn how feeds and speeds work, or tooling choice, etc.

If you are going to get a machine for yourselves, don't bother with laser, waterjet or plasma. They're either prohibitively expensive, or, as I said, inaccurate.

Look into a CNC router instead. They're much less expensive, just as useful, and are even more capable, because they can 3D and 2.5D work (Pockets, counterbores, champfers, etc). Also, with a little research and know-how, you can build your own pretty easily.

That all said, if you're still intent on sending the work out, look into local colleges, they often have machine shops with all the fun toys, they're interested in education (might even teach your students how to run the machines), and probably have a large enough overhead that they don't have to think twice about the cost of donating the machine time.","1398902831"

After a few hours I go to the bathroom. When I come out I'm greeted by my friend. He pulls me to the side and tells me that he has a huge crush on my bf. I'm a little taken aback by this and I ask why hes telling me this. He kind of blushes and tells me he wants to fuck my bf. Before I can answer properly he tells me I can have his bf if I wanted.

If a couple is already at the point where they're talking about having sex, then the existence of condoms is only secondary.  It's going to happen, but it's going to happen in an unsafe fashion.

Currently my mechanics are definitely above average and in terms if the game my most strong aspect is laning and early control over the other jungler. I play pretty much exclusively mid and top, but I can jungle effectively. The biggest problem I have is late fame rotations and team fights; late game is basically the game of throws because no matter the lead the team has we just don't have good objective control and good team fighting as a team. I've tried just staying in a side lane and if they send 1 I kill them if 2 I either kill them or run around wearing them down and wasting their time. 

TL;DR I need help with late game but my mechanics are quite good.

"argentina","t5_2qlht","A los 17 me fui de mi casa. En ese entonces estaba trabajando en un locutorio.
Después de eso estuve 1 año viviendo en villa gesell, porque había conseguido trabajo en la cocina de un complejo de vacaciones.
Después volví a mdp y me quedé.

A ver... lo que más me costó a mi particularmente fue el manejo de mi propio dinero, llegar a fin de mes, etc... ya que siempre fui de delirarla bastante en boludeces, y salvo por momentos concretos no fui de ahorrar.

Sacando lo anterior, calculo que me hubiera costado mucho MUCHO MUCHO el desprenderme de cosas materiales, aunque por esa época no tenía mucho...

Lo que quiero decir con esto es:

En el tiempo que estuve trabajando en el locutorio, alquilaba un sucuchito arriba del mismo, el cual ya tenía muebles, cocina, heladera etc... con lo cual, me fue relativamente fácil irme de un día para el otro a gesell y quedarme un año. Caso contrario me tendría que haber desecho de mis cosas.  En ese sentido, estando con mi vieja, de más chico, nunca consideré como mías las cosas que tenía en la casa de ella. Por ahí por eso también me resultó más sencillo desprenderme de las pocas cosas que tenía a esa edad, pero me doy cuenta que fui una excepción, y que a muchos les hubiera pasado al revés.

También considero que me fué más fácil irme de mi casa a los 17 porque desde los 13-14 fui de ganarme mi propio dinero, con lo cual, siempre estuve acostumbrado a tener algo de guita encima. Lo mismo que tampoco me faltó trabajo desde esa edad (14-15), así que no me dió cagaso el quedarme sin el mismo, porque siempre fui de encontrar realmente RAPIDO, y en cualquier cosa. Ej:

- Ayudante de repartidor (camión de supermercados)
- Mozo
- Cafetero
- Vendedor de DirecTV
- Ayudante de instalador de DirecTV
- Gambucero (en gastronomía old school es el que tiene el despacho de bebidas y otros viveres)
- Preparaba/Cocinaba/Despachaba postres, agendados por semana
- Agencia de quieniela

y en el medio hice otro tantos trabajos","1398902836"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I wouldn't want to be on a motorcycle anywhere on I-10 in Louisiana. The cajuns have rightfully earned their insanely high insurance premiums. 

You'd probably be alright being an experienced rider, but in my opinion riding on the interstate isn't worth the risk.

Carry a pistol for personal protection because in Louisiana you can, and in New Orleans you should...assuming you're okay with firearms, I know they're not everyone's cup of tea. They have a pretty high violent crime rate, and the economy has made people desperate. You'll be very vulnerable on a bike. In Louisiana your vehicle is an extension of your home and property, and you can protect it and yourself with force if it comes to that. They're pretty laid back, a pistol can be concealed or out in plain view, loaded or unloaded, as long as it's not on your person and you let any officer pulling you over know immediately that you are armed. The sheriff in Baton Rouge told me I could hang the thing from my rear view mirror if I wanted to, as long as it's in the vehicle. Of course that probably wouldn't be a good idea.

I'm not positive what the rules are as far as carrying a firearm on a motorcycle, but I believe it has to be on the bike, NOT on your person, unless you have a concealed carry license.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","I've always had a naturally low desire to have kids since I'm a rather introverted and quiet person. Truth be told I had more thoughts about adopting a kid who needed a parent rather than adding to the overly high global population.

As I went through my teens I noticed more and more how some parents seemed to regret having kids and wondered why people just seemed to go for it like it was some inevitable event like death or bacon sandwich time. My desire continued to drop further, plus growing up around two divorces also had a profound effect too. It's hell for kids to witness. 

Then a while back on Reddit I happened to discover this subreddit by chance when reading some comments on a meme and breathed a sigh of relief and laid to rest all fears that something was 'wrong' with me for not wanting kids.

I've not really told anyone face to face I'm CF but this subreddit has helped me prepare against the bingos I might encounter.

Without even missing a beat, I shot back, ""No one asked about your childhood in the Catholic church, bud."" 

At the time he was jokingly annoyed, but a month later while drunk he  admitted that it was the best priest dig he'd ever heard. ","1398902843"

Should we reduce those things as much as possible? Yes, definitely. Should we all lose our shit because the bacteria are all impossible to kill? No, really, we got this. 

Making the change will be inconvenient but not impossible; the main barrier right now is that governmental organisations like the FDA in the USA insist that every phage species (of which there are thousands if not millions, each of which is specific to 1 particular bacteria species) be tested separately, rather than allowing testing of a ""phage cocktail"" as is used in Russia and Georgia (i.e. give someone a phage against every bacteria, since one of them is bound to work). Once people start dying from bacterial infections we used to be able to cure though, those barriers ought to go away pretty quickly.","1398902844"

The income had shifted upwards significantly, so the amount of money moving around is higher but it's moving around through a smaller group of people and companies.

 [**US Standard Light Rail Vehicle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%20Standard%20Light%20Rail%20Vehicle): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __US Standard Light Rail Vehicle__ was a [light rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail) vehicle (LRV) built by [Boeing Vertol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Helicopters) in the 1970s. The United States [Urban Mass Transportation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Transit_Administration) (UMTA) promoted it as a standardized vehicle for U.S. cities. Part of a series of defense conversion projects in the waning days of the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), the LRV was seen as both a replacement for older [PCC streetcars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCC_streetcar) in many cities and as a catalyst for new cities to construct light rail systems. The USSLRV was marketed as and is popularly known as the __Boeing LRV__ (not to be confused with their prior [lunar roving vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_rover) for [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA)) and is usually referred to as such.

"AskAnthropology","t5_2wl4u","I was reading Totem and Taboo by Freud today where he explains this through other sources. In every civilization there are taboos. Those taboos revolve around incest heavily. When looked at the indigenous people of Australia etc. they have found that the mother-in-law is even prohibited from getting together with the son-in-law after the marriage of her daughter and so on. So we could say, we as humans forming communities have developed certain sacred rules without known existence to protect the very notion of womanhood and the puberty era of men and the sex lives of married couples and so on. The taboo at first was taken as a solution on it's own, which means that the conscious of the person who broke the taboo, would feel so guilty it was enough of a punishment. Later on certain taboos like adultery would be punished by DEATH. The one who broke the taboo would be ostracized from the community all together, as to make an example out of that person. So you see, we are violent, plundering and raping creatures but when there is a community with totems and taboos, you can't just go around and drag women to caves and rape them. You would do that to the hostile community's women.","1398902857"

        def sing_me_a_song(self):

    happy_bday.sing_me_a_song()

which prints out each line separately like so:

I don't want to get sued


So I'll stop right there

[[""Happy birthday to you"", ""I don't want to get sued"", ""So I'll stop right there""]

The old Eotech I had on it is now on my loaner gun.

The scope I have on it now is a 1.5-5x adjustable, with ~6 brightness for red and green each, although I tend to have the illumination off while using it. Despite being adjustable, my play style is definitely one where 80% of the time I stay further back providing fairly accurate suppressive fire, so I tend to keep the scope at 5x, which in my opinion is a fantastic magnification for use in airsoft. From about 120-150 feet I can accurately hit a suppressor poking out of a brush pile with at least 1 round of a 3 round burst (I did this twice in a row at the last skirmish I was at.)

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It's not strange, it's very common. Many women find it a little offensive, and I can understand why. In the past, I was open to it. I dated a single mother for a long time. We even lived together, with her 3 year old son.

While it was OK to live with her son, there are two reasons I would be reluctant to do it again.

1. She was forever entwined with her ex, the child's father. He was a dipstick, and I hated dealing with him. Even more, I ended up really not liking the fact that he was *never* going to go away. He would *always* be a complicating factor.

2. It's not fair to the little kid, to have father figures coming and going. My actions also had an effect on the little guy. My being there or my leaving would, too. I am not just saying this from a potential suitor's perspective. I grew up with a single mother. While I don't begrudge her the chances she took on love, it was very confusing for me. She dated a guy for a long time and when they broke up, it felt like I lost a 2nd father. Then there were strings of random dudes that I wasn't sure about. Overall, as a child, your parent dating is very weird and scary. Now, as an adult, I just wouldn't want to be part of that unless I was super serious about blending a family with this hypothetical person.","1398902861"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; What about low-technology voters? The impoverished, the homeless, the elderly, etc, who are much less likely to be involved in social media?

Libraries are free and most social media allows people to make their pages public so that no one is required to have an account to view their information. Also, I did make it a point to not propose a ban on the media's ability to cover the information on these sites.

&gt; How would this account for non-participants? If I wanted to make a YouTube video promoting a candidate, or share a candidates Facebook status/retweet from their account, etc, this would be a violation of the terms you laid out.

Incorrect. It would be a violation if you took said video and then paid to force people to see it (made it an advertisement). YouTube is a form of social media and I'm not trying to infringe on someone's ability to express their opinion to anyone who has expressed the desire to hear it by visiting their page. Similarly, sharing a status or retweeting isn't advertising (as long as they aren't paying you to do it) because the people who watch your pages are doing so at will.

&gt; Do you realize that there were approximately 100 candidates with some level of ballot access for the 2012 Presidential election, ranging from Obama and Romney to Roseanne. Is it really essential that Roseanne or Vermin Supreme be present for each debate?

I did not realize there were that many candidates, and I've considered the problem that could arise if everyone knew that they were guaranteed some level of exposure. You'd undoubtedly have people who go for the presidency just to get the attention. Perhaps a single debate, especially these numbers, would not be a viable option. I'll have to re-think what the best approach to this would be, but it still doesn't change my view on the fact that all candidates should be on as level a playing field as possible. As I said in another comment getting different perspectives, regardless of how abstract they may be, simply gives us more to consider and think about.","1398902864"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback. I haven't done much writing in the past so It's more likely a flaw in my description than a flaw in what I tried to express. I guess also expected my readers to have a bit more context.

To start the definition of an object is exactly as it is in the OOP sense. So when I say domain object, it's just an ""object"" that has relevance to your ""domain"". Now if your building a CRUD system, you probably won't get any benefit from using DDD assuming you actually have a domain you can model. However, I would just say the complexity of such a system isn't in the code. Now it's just the users heads; that they have to know how the system works. They are the manager and your system is the database. 

Root is also an easy one to fix. It's the root of the hierarchy of objects. I'll see if I can make that clearer in the post.

Owned was a term used a bit loosely. What I meant here was that the object has a method and when you call, it changes it's own state. This is opposed to having a manager class that takes that object and transforms it's state. I was hinting that this was an example of the Single responsibility principle (which, yes, I hope I don't have to explain).

I too dislike being religious but there's still validly in referring to a proven pattern. Maybe I can add a better example here.

And yes, being ""physically"" located within the source code body of the class makes it much easier to reason about, at least for me. Tools could make this better and I've even explored doing this functionally without classes. I don't think putting them in the classes is working around deficiencies in the language. I think that's how to use the language as it was meant to be used. That's why the tooling currently works better that way as well.

In summary I have to say DDD doesn't exclude the other tools and techniques. It also only relates to working with the domain and context is extremely important. However, I would also argue that most of the behaviours are familiar (or easy) but not simple. Extra complexity also comes out because of how behaviours interact with each other and how the system can change over time.

I know a good example here would be useful, I'll see if I can find one. I didn't set out to be flawless but I hope my article can help people interested actually trying some of these ideas out in code. There are a lot of good DDD articles which may answer your questions far better.

(Note this is just a personal quirk of mine and it generally applies to every game I play so, you can disregard it for the most part)

I tried the ragnarock odyssey demo which, I didnt like, I bought the game, which I didn't like either. It felt like such a weeaboo fest, like I watch anime and crap but that games character interactions put me off so much, and the game has gross movement controls where your character moves way ahead of your analog stick.

That being said they both have demo's so try them out, I'd say soul sacrifice is the better of the two.

Theres also toukiden which I found to bland and easy, like ridiculously easy. It also had a demo so check that out.

Paired with a few fingers of Bulleit.
Beautiful box pressed torpedo with a slightly veiny wrapper.

First third is a bit more mild than I would have expected with some chocolate hints.  Not milk chocolate but more like the bittersweet baker's chocolate.  Still smoking.  MTF but pressing save before it gets removed for lack of content.

About an inch in and starting to get an ever so slight bit of pepper, but it still a very ""baking needs"" flavor.  Burning   even to this point and ash still hanging on.  Decent smoke output but nothing like an LP.  http://imgur.com/cKudHQr

Starting to mellow out a bit more--kind of strange for what I thought was supposed to be a full-bodied cigar, although this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Burn is starting to get a bit wonky but ash is still attached.  Woody, with still some cocoa and caramel hints.

Ash fell off after about 1.75"" in.  Needed a touch up.  Flavor is getting a bit more full and is burning a bit hotter but I would blame this on the nicotine build up and the ash falling off.

Well this is disappointing, went out an needed a re-light a bit over the halfway point.  It now has that ""re-lit"" cigar taste.  I hope it picks back up because I was quite enjoying it. :(

The friendliest fighter I've ever met was Tito Ortiz. I met him at the Boston Fan Expo at the actual UFC autograph signing. At these signings the fighters generally sit at a podium of sorts and sign autographs, you can take a quick snap with them and go. But Tito stood in front of the podium to be more hands on with the fans. He was hugging and shaking everyone's hands and taking as many pictures as they wanted with him. When it was my turn I didn't want a pic just for him to sign the UFC Hardcover book I was having all the fighters sign. He signed the from but then decided to go through the ENTIRE book and sign every picture that he was in. I didn't ask for this but very happy he did. He also spent about 2 extra hours at the booth to make sure everyone got an autograph that was in the line to see him.

The worst I met the same day was Forrest Griffin. I am a big fan of Forrest but when I met he as being very short with everybody and yelling next after he would sign an autograph. At one point he glanced at how long the line was and looked at his management and just sighed and said ""really?"" since there was a lot of people that wanted to meet him. This was like a week or 2 after the infamous Anderson Silva fight so I'm going to assume that had a lot to do with his attitude towards people but nonetheless he was easily the worst.

Es probable que el BCV reporte al CEPAL como escribí, porque ""oficialmente"" los números son exactos.

Coercion is possibly the murkiest in terms of definition and in terms of bringing things to prosecution - it's also probably the most societally contentious. Stranger rape is widely accepted as rape. Date rape gets wobbly around the edges. And coercion is the one that the public is generally least educated about. I think it's an area that we should approach with absolute clarity. Because I think you'll find it might be a common sentiment that parties that are coerced (particularly non-physical coercion) are still culpable for their actions.

Your whole comment is a big load of bullshit and I have no idea where you got your data from (open for sources though!). 47% of prison inmates are sociopaths, and they do have a shorter life expectancy due to a higher rate of suicide, being the victim of a homocide and fatal accidents than the general population (And drug abuse isn't all that healthy either). They also aren't that common, you'd have to know 30-40 people to know one.

Sources: [1](http://www.academia.edu/1185400/7._PERSONALITY_DISORDERS_WITH_SERIOUS_IMPLICATIONS_IN_PRISONS) [2](http://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/main/types-of-personality-disorders/) [3](http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe04.html) [4](http://www.health.am/psy/more/antisocial_personality_disorder_pro/)

The ""masking"" stuff is the biggest load of crap though. Not flying under the radar doesn't make one ""broken"", it's part of the disorder. If you have antisocial impulses and are able to control them you don't fit the criteria by definition. You can't say ""I have this or that disorder, but I don't let its symptoms affect me!""

Granted, I haven't had serious trouble with the law either (yet) and my friends and family wouldn't even believe me if I told them about the stuff I do, but that doesn't mean that I'm ""masking"". I just haven't been caught, and of course I'm not gonna go around telling everyone (Duh). But given that boredom, pathological sensation seeking and a failure to think about consequences is part of it, it's very likely that someone with this ""illness"" will end up in trouble sooner or later.

Or he just lives a fucking boring life not worth living, of course that's also a possibility. Even though I don't see how a sociopath could see any upside to that. Open for another perspective though.

I really don't get where everyone got the idea that sociopathy is simply an utter lack of empathy by the way. It's a *syndrome*, a *cluster* of symptoms where you can't pick and choose, either you have it or not.
And the lack of empathy isn't even the most defining symptom of this particular condition (as in, usually doesn't have the biggest impact on someone's life), so if you glorify it based on that, it's hard to believe that you know what it's like to actually have the syndrome.

I'd recommend the book ""Without Conscience"" by Robert Hare himself by the way, I think a lot of ""sociopaths"" from this sub would realize that they are just detached narcissistic assholes. ","1398902872"

Except, no, requiring a peripheral that the console can't natively use would confuse the shit out of newcomers, those who get it would still be forced to spend $50 on something they will never use on anything else, and it would require an adapter for every single remote.

"technology","t5_2qh16","No ISP has ever throttled Netflix. Not Comcast, not Verizon, none, ever. Netflix's CEO came out and said that directly in February when everyone was accusing Verizon of doing it because of some outsourced customer support agent saying they did to get a complaining customer to go away. The only reason their service was ever ""degraded"" was because Netflix was buying bargain-bin cheap bandwidth from Cogent, whose interconnect with Comcast didn't have enough bandwidth to carry 3/4 of all US traffic at peak hours. It was Cogent that was unable to provide what it actually sold, and Netflix pretty much knew that was why they're so darned cheap. They could've bought transit from other companies like everyone else and avoided the congestion... which is basically what they ended up doing by paying Comcast and Verizon to interconnect directly instead of paying Cogent. They're not paying twice or anything.

Edit: Really controversial post, huh? Swung from +10 to -4 and back. Which is silly, because all of this is easily Google-able at reputable news sources. For Comcast to have throttled Netflix, there'd have to be a conspiracy involving all 130K of Comcast's employees, the FCC and DOJ (since Comcast would have violated the terms the FCC imposed on its merger with NBC Universal), and Netflix. Why would Netflix lie about not being throttled?","1398902875"

Again, please stop spouting confirmation bias based lies. Here's some mythbusting for you, rooted in facts and science:


*     **Circumcision removes half the penile skin.**
    The amount of skin removed varies from little more than the constricted tip of the foreskin to an amount just slightly longer than the glans. The glans is rarely more than a quarter of the length of the entire infant penis (and proportionately much less in an adult). The lie comes from counting the foreskin length twice ""because it has an inner and outer layer"". This fact is really irrelevant because coverage is only provided once.
      

*     **Circumcision removes hundreds of miles of blood vessels.**
    'Hundreds of miles' is a gross exaggeration which most people can clearly see through but even so, the blood vessels in the foreskin serve only the foreskin itself and hence their removal with the foreskin is of no further consequence. 
      

*     **The foreskin contains specialized nerve endings.**
    All nerves are specialized. There is nothing more or less special about those in the foreskin compared with those elsewhere in the body. The glans also contains nerves which don't usually get fully stimulated when sex is experienced through the foreskin. 
      

*     **Circumcision removes 20,000 nerve endings.**

    This is an outright lie. The figure of 20,000 has been admitted to have been made up by an anti-circumcision activist to make it look as if really serious damage is done by circumcision. There is no scientific evidence that there are even that number of nerve endings in the entire penis.
    Whatever the number, however, the nerves in the foreskin are almost exclusively related to protecting the foreskinitself from harm, just like those elsewhere in the skin. When the foreskin is removed these nerves become irrelevant. 


And here is another well written article pointing out the lack of factual information: http://thecircumcisiondecision.com/20000-nerve-endings/.","1398902876"

That could be the case, but your linked data set is nowhere near that clear.

A bit further down the Wiki article: 

&gt; ""In 1992 offenders armed with handguns committed a record 931,000 violent crimes ... On average in 1987-92 about 83,000 crime victims per year used a firearm to defend themselves or their property. Three-fourths of the victims who used a firearm for defense did so during a violent crime; a fourth, during a theft, household burglary, or motor vehicle theft.""

"Games","t5_2qhwp","IMO, it'd be hard for a company used for Hollywood movie production to pull off. It could be done, but it would just take a different way to look at it and think about it, which is something that people working with big name titles don't like to do. They much prefer to just try and let the name get them a few bucks with minimum amount of work. 

For example, if you just have a game focus on Katniss, i'm not sure how it would translate to a game, however if you had the option to be part of any of the districts with choices on how you live through the games, and fight the center empire (forgot the name), then I could see this being interesting and having a possibility of working. 

It's just a shame, there is potential there, but all potential these people see is easy money on branding. ","1398902886"

I called to enquire about pricing and told them I'd call back if I was interested after learning their costs far exceeded comcast. I let it go since I had not given any billing info besides my name and address and figured I'd receive mailings if their prices went down etc...
Within a week I received a giant box and a bill for almost $300. I immediately called and told them I did not order this, nor would I be ordering their services, I also immediately sent the box back, got a tracking number for proof. 
For the next two weeks I got called every single day (sometimes two and three times a day) about the ""self install"" I had allegedly ordered. Even after telling them I had sent the box back and stating I had a tracking number from the box I sent back (and had never even ordered to begin with). 
I finally asked for a supervisor and threatened litigious action if they didn't stop harassing me, I had never ordered nor had I ever accepted any services from them, the supervisor told me he understood and took my info and told me everything was taken care of. 
Despite this they started charging me late fee's (with the total eventually exceeded $400). After calling my lawyer and having her contact the supervisor I had spoken to, I received a letter stating I no longer owed them money and that they in fact owed me $13 and if I ever needed their services they would credit my bill this amount. I never received an explanation nor an apology for the nearly three months of harassment. Yet they honestly thought I'd still order their services. 
I will never do business with AT&amp;T. Comcast may be evil, but AT&amp;T IMO is way worse. ","1398902889"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Agreed. Even at this end of this goofy article they list five enduring legacies of his work: 

""In summation, Westen says there are five broad areas in which the work of Sigmund Freud remains relevant to psychology: the existence of unconscious mental processes, the importance of conflict and ambivalence in behavior, the childhood origins of adult personality, mental representations as a mediator of social behavior, and stages of psychological development."" 

If those look like common place, obvious things which should not shock anyone, that is because Freud''s work has been so influential that concepts have become part of common knowledge about psychology. 

As for his method, he pioneered ""talk therapy."" I would say that is a fairly big achievement. 

Whether he got the 'details' of all of his theories right is beside the point. He spent his life adjusting the details of his theories. Why? Because he invented his theories practically out of whole cloth. There was *no one* around who he could compare notes with. But you know who did follow him and pick up on his theories? Erik Erikson, Donald Winnicott, Melanie Klein and other people.  

 At any rate: think how many times during the day you find yourself wondering about ""unconscious motivations."" That is Freud's signature idea, and it has become so accepted that it is hardly even recognized as an 'idea' at all anymore. People now take it *completely* for granted. Not to mention the fact that Freud more or less invented the idea of ""childhood"" sexuality- meaning, prior to Freud people (scientific people) did not think that children had sexual experiences/feelings/motivations, etc. ","1398902897"

The way to educate my son without meds?  Is to have an adult volunteer sit with him in class, and keep his attention on track so he can finish the work.  It's crippling for his self esteem and makes him dependent on others.  Not getting any education at all takes away a lot of opportunities in life that he would have enjoyed.

Also, it's not just a problem at school.  It's a problem at home, in his social interactions, even in recreational activities.

Doing a 10-15% water change weekly instead of what you're doing would reduce the stress on the fish, as well as on you if you're lugging 5 gallons of water around at a time. Upgrading the filter or adding a second one will help you keep the ammonia levels from creeping up too high between water changes.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","Lots of great advice here so I won't repeat it.  However, I don't see what I consider the most important thing: enthusiasm.  

I was much worse off than you, comparatively.  My overall GPA was 2.5 and my ME GPA was a dismal 2.2.  I had absolutely zero engineering experience, not even an internship.  Even worse, I went and lived abroad for a couple years doing a job completely unrelated to engineering so not only was I an applicant with no experience but I wasn't even a *recent* graduate (i.e. I'd likely forgotten a lot of what I'd learned).  

I set a goal to apply to five jobs per day, and I did.  Over the next few months, I applied for thousands of jobs online.  I went to cities big in aerospace, like Huntsville, and literally went door to door with my resume.  In that case, I hit up every aerospace company in Huntsville, in person, with zero results.  Oh, sure, a few were so impressed with my ""go-getter"" attitude and praised me for my efforts but nobody invited me for an interview.  

What *did* get me an interview was my enthusiasm for aerospace.  In particular, I love WWI aircraft and, when I applied to a job posting on LinkedIn for a position offered by a former manufacturer of certain WWI aircraft, I was sure to mention how fond I was of their WWI aircraft and how great it would be to some how be associated with a name of such historical significance.  

That got me an interview.  

My enthusiasm during the interview was obvious.  It wasn't faked: I really was like a kid in a candy store.  I was so interested in everything I saw and they liked that.  I met their minimum qualifications, I got on well with the people I met, and I got the job.

A little over a year later, they had lost a lot of money and had to remove ""non-production"" (e.g. engineering) positions.  Everyone else there had been there for 10-20 years and I was the new guy so out the door I went.  It wasn't so bad, I got to work a production position as a stop-gap, but I wanted to be an engineer so I went out looking for a new position.

The rat race began anew and after a few months I managed to snag another interview with another aerospace company.  This position was *very* ""cutting edge"".  Again, I wasn't particularly qualified and there were certainly scores of higher qualified candidates to choose from.  However, I let my enthusiasm show through.  It made such an impression, even the HR manager of the corporation had heard from the hiring manager how enthusiastic I was.  I spoke with the HR manager because she was offering me the job, you see. 

I give you these anecdotes because I think it's worth considering just how effective genuine enthusiasm can be.  It's not a one trick pony; it's part of an overall strategy of being personable.  A large part of that is having a desirable attitude and a large part of *that* is being enthusiastic.  

My advice (on top of the wonderful advice others have given) would be to search for jobs you are truly interested in, read [*How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People*](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&amp;oq=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4127j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8) (the audio book is also great), and work on your people skills.  That book, by the way, changed my life and I'm currently rereading it just because I think it's worth it.  At the end of the day, a human being is going to be the one that hires you.  Having he or she like you is a great way to increase your odds.  

It may require some large effort on your part because you may have to adjust your attitude.  You can't fake it; people can spot a fake a mile away.  With effort, however, you can certainly do it.  If I can,  you can.  I don't know anyone more introverted.  I could, happily, be completely alone for months.  I was also extremely (as the college psychologist put it, when reading my test results, ""off the charts"") shy.  You don't have to be the life of the party to learn (***learn***) people skills.

Take it from a people-avoiding, *severely* under-qualified introvert with no network that has somehow never failed to get a job offer after an interview: people skills are as important, if not more important, than what is on your resume.  ","1398902901"

I took out their water bowls and emptied them. Then I just put them in the backseat in a way that would keep them from moving and took them to the new house. 

In general, when I take my snakes out in public and stuff, I let them ride on me (like around my neck and in my jacket since I don't drive). When I sense them getting a bit tired of being out, I'll put them in something similar to your bag or my cloth satchel that zips up. Occasionally, I'll put them in individual deli cups that are commonly seen at reptile expos and I will usually cover them up or put the cup in a bag to make their surroundings dark.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","If I were you id approach guys when they are alone. They can be in a group but just approach them when they are alone for a minute or two. It is not really possible for a woman to be creepy unless you do something really odd. That is an advantage you have. You can approach guys anywhere and they probably will be open to it.

I think that you are taking things a little too personal. Guys just want sex. They see you as a means to an end its not about respect in my opinion. It is going to be difficult to get an honest thought out of this type of guys mouth because he will just tell you what you want to hear to get sex. Men in this age category see women as just sexual objects they haven't yet figured out that women are so much more and deserve to be treated like an actual human being. I think I'm in the minority as I found this out at an early age.

Have you ever thought about changing your expectations and just date guys and if it turns into more that's great? I feel like you may be putting off a clingy / needy vibe because you want a long term relationship from the git-go. Yes we can tell and yes this scares the hell out of guys.

Another thing you can do is ask them how long their average relationship is. If they've never had a relationship last longer than a few months to me thats a red flag they may just be in it for sex. You could argue that a guy who is only interested in sex will just lie to you about this as well. I think guys who just want sex are less likely to make this connection so they are more likely to give you an honest answer. 

This is a really complex subject / matter. Maybe try talking to your friends? or a sexologist or a relationship counselor / physiologist. People who know you can give you better advice than some dude on the internet.","1398902905"

He made the videos just for friends originally - he claims that he honestly found them to be funny, and that they were intended as comedy, and he never intended to creep people out originally - and people started putting them online.  he made more videos, started appearing in character occasionally around LA, and got featured in a few magazine stories for his weird videos.  Then, sometimes in the mid-2000s, the guy got cancer and died.  All this info is on the site you linked to.  I read all this a few years ago, this is just what i can recall.","1398902908"

As for contacting the athlete guy, I'd say go for it, but don't come off as too pushy - he's probably pretty fragile so you don't want to scare him off.

Just imo, I think the attitude of not wanting to talk to someone who's 'flamboyantly gay' is really unwise - they are generally the most well adjusted guys and it is those brave 'flamboyant gays' who ignore societal norms and fought for your civil liberties in the U.S. throughout the 20th century while people like you or I probably would have stayed deep in the closed.

If I had two candidates, both interviewing for the same position, and one was sharp, highly educated, and motivated but clearly had no intention of investing themselves in the position while the other appeared to be loyal and would be committed to the job if hired but had a little less experience, or education... ABSOLUTELY I would hire the second candidate. Why would I want to waste the resources or time on hiring, training, and integrating a person who I couldn't depend on for a position in my company? Loyalty IS a competency. An employer needs to trust than the person they hire is going to follow through. Someone who has no loyalty to the company they work for can not be counted on.

She moves out of the Master Bedroom into the guest, like someone else said in here she also buys new sheets and tosses the old. Talking to the other husband might be good as well, having someone going through the same thing is very helpful.

Then start talking, some subjects to bring up.

- Her Alcohol consumption, is/was it a problem?
- How did it happen
- Your sexlife 
- Talk about her friend
- etc...

If you two do stay together and want to improve your sex life, then do it. 1-2 times a week and blaming it on being too busy is silly. Take a lunch break from work and makeout in the car or sext and build up the tension for a fast romp when you both are at arms length at home. Sex doesn't have to be ONLY full on penetration, it can be a quick massage before bedtime where you each get eachother off or a shower together soaping eachother bodies. If kids present time problems, then get a sitter more often, if you can't afford a sitter, then find extra work on the weekends to afford one from time to time. Neighbor will maybe exchange an hour of sitting for doing his/her yardwork, w/e, just find it.","1398902910"

My disappointment is in other's trying to tell me how I feel... Understand your own feelings before telling me mine. Tell me how you feel not how I feel. 

You're whole theme is how gay's love differently than others... You're just flat out wrong. We are people trying to make it in life and find someone to connect to. More often than not we won't connect, but that isn't because we are gay and expecting instant gratification, it's because we are human and infinitely unique and similar all at the same time. 

I know the score, I know rejection, I know having to reject, and I know what I feel isn't necessarily what anyone else feels. If it wasn't meant to be, don't tell me it's because I didn't want it, that's pussy shit. Tell me it's because you don't want it and I'll tell you how I feel too.

What a great comparison. On one hand, we have a game where you can gift purely cosmetic skins to someone, and on the other hand we have a game where you want to trade the only measure of power in the game: items.

I was pretty good at the gymnastic and body weight movements (HSPU, pull ups, muscle-ups, burpees, running, etc.) and didn't think I was that strong given there were many other women at my gym who were squatting and lifting more than me. But they were also bigger than me. So I always competed to lift as much as them and pretty soon had some of the top strength numbers on the board for our gym. Then one of my coaches pointed out that I should try a mock weightlifting competition in the area, and apparently one of the judges at the competition was the president or head of the regional weightlifting club and said that my lifts were well enough to make the A session in the American Open.

You nailed it (that or what actually happend is a slimming friend asked a fatty to stop tempting/sabotaging them during their attempts at weight loss). If they could they would also use ""your fat body makes me feel bad about my thin body"" but that makes no sense. Surprised they don't have something about having curves or people envying their curves but then again that would be admitting that thin people have body image issues too.

Here's the story on one of those episodes:  http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/21ywxs/close_call_on_day_104_with_a_happy_ending/

The other time I was deleting my porn e-mail account, and looked at some of the e-mails.  Again, I realized that if I didn't stop, that I would start going down the wrong path.  I deactivated the account with yahoo and it is gone, gone, gone.  

Both times I did this at work where there was no porn blocker.

I use K-9 to block porn at home.  But right now, my determination to avoid porn (and frankly, my fear of its addictive nature) is really what's keeping it away (and perhaps most important, my wife's wonderful support).","1398902917"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","The Boltons have been in a single episode this season, and probably will only get a handful of appearances to give them an arc this season regarding the retaking of Moat Cailin and Ramsay's legitimization.

Yara appeared in a single scene of the finale in Season 3 and is still present in the viewers' mind. She probably won't get a lot of screentime this season either.

Arya and the Hound have little to do this season, so they've only been given a single long scene in every other episode.

The writers are masterfully juggling plotlines this season. My only worry is how they'll introduce the Dornish and Ironborn stories, not how they'll handle all the different plot threads. Meeting Team Aegon is easier because we're introduced to them through Tyrion, but the Greyjoy and Martell stories force us to identify with and sympathize with all new characters fairly late into the story.

I live here and the decision has been covered extensively.

It is the Judge's opinion - and a well known Leftist judge at that - that it is  unconstitutional.
The state has made plenty of allowances for people to get IDs - they are free - and there has not been ONE CASE where someone was unable to get one.

Besides you need an ID to go the bank, to DRIVE and let me tell you there are not 10% of the people of Wisconsin who are of age and do not have their driver's license.

In Milwaukee 10 years ago the police used to have an election investigative unit and in that election they found 5000 more people voted than were on the rolls. - THOUSANDS of bad addresses - vacant lots, office buildings, no such addresses, etc.

The judge is wrong and he will be over-turned on appeal.

Liberals are afraid of Voter ID because it will make it harder for them to steal elections.

And what to you have to say about North Carolina? 35 THOUSAND duplicate names and SSNs between them and other states.

Don't tell me that voter fraud isn't real.

However, once the redshift grows so big that the wavelength of the photon is larger than the size of the observable universe, there will no longer be any practical way to detect it, since you would need an antenna bigger than the observable universe to catch it!

"UKDota","t5_2uyoj","Thought i'd just wack a quick post here. It's super tough getting into casting and it's definitely something that if your intent on doing it then be prepared for an uphill fight. 

By all means this isn't too put you off. I personally am all for new people to help showcase the UKDota talent but it takes work to get to where you want to be. As some people have touched on before it's not just about Casting loads of games. Part of my (very minor) success involved alot of volunteer work and just being trustworthy.  

For example just a small selection of the volunteer roles that I do within the gaming industry:  
. epic.LAN host / video guy / event team / minion / radio - Have done this for going on 4 years now.  
. Admin for Dota2 at ESL.UK  
. Radio host at Hive365 (Gaming Radio)   

Plus various other roles and stuff.  

The next part is luck.  

For i50 durka mentioned he didn't have a co-caster for the event. So I offered my services and volunteered to do that. This was my big break for me. Managed to get a small following within the UK Dota community. 

So as a TLDR for this. Think about the bigger picture as well. It's not just casting loads of games (Though practice is very important) but also everything that goes with it.  

From that just a few tips which helped me along.  
* Don't be weird  
* Be available (You may have to make sacrifices sometimes)  
* Respect those who help you
* Be mutual on all UK Dota politics (Otherwise the Autism will take over your mind)  

That's it from me for now.  

Good luck! I will keep this in mind if anything comes up from my end.","1398902930"

"Borderlands2","t5_2spu9","I'm pretty excited for Destiny but I have to agree with the continued Borderlands comparison.

I think Destiny is going to be the Guild Wars 2 for the FPS RPG genre. Guild Wars 2 was both praised and hyped for having the public events and these are seen in Destiny as well. Guild Wars 2 was designed to be a casual game where you can just hop on for a few hours and feel as though you've made a sizable amount of progression. I have the feeling that Destiny might be a casual game with some of the design choices that are being made even though I don't want it to be. 

They're touting the Destiny as being a ""Shared World Shooter"" Action Game, whereas in Borderlands you have the option to join other people or let other people join you. I think the misconception surrounding the game is from people trying to call it an MMO, and I think the ""Open World"" is why people may think this. From what I can gather, the game will be open world, with other players running around in the same space as you, and you'll be able to choose whether or not you want to engage with other players. I'm beginning to think that Destiny may seem like GTA online mixed with Borderlands actually. 

I also feel that Bungie wants the deeper RPG elements in Destiny to be hidden from the player as well. Looking back at the E3 Destiny gameplay, the talent/progression tree for the exotic ThunderLord gun had buffs that could triggered based on certain conditions, but there weren't any numbers shown to show how much of a damage bonus these abilities gave to the player/gun. The new video released on Monday does shows that some of the passive abilities will be visually represented on screen but we haven't seen an updated inventory UI so the damage is still unknown... The weapons from the E3 demo didn't have stats on them too, only item levels whereas, in Borderlands there is obvious statistical representation for a gun. There is no visual representation of how much damage you're actually doing to your enemies even though there are critical hits and resistances in the game unlike in Borderlands (I'm ok with this if it's a toggled option though). Hopefully these things will be added when we get an in depth look during E3 2014 and for the Summer Beta. 

TL;DR - Destiny might be a casual friendly FPS RPG compared to Borderlands and the ""Open World"" interactivity portion of Destiny is its selling point, but it's also causing confusion amongst gamers as to what the the game is truly trying to be other than just a ""Great Action Game.""

The tutorial covers the importance and differences between displacement, normal, spec, and bump maps. All of these things do not change your geometry, but rather change the rendering outcome of your textures on objects. That video tutorial is a half hour long and available at [**Blender Guru**](http://www.blenderguru.com/videos/the-secrets-of-realistic-texturing/). 

The tutorial covers all you need to know about texturing in this sense and is about 30 minutes long. It comes with a video and text+images walk through. It also is accompanied by Creative Commons licensed materials for use in the tutorials. I would highly recommend you go watch it!

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","English is not my native language and I still do not understand what do you mean with your question. Or even the correct idea of ""virtue"". I am new to Stoicism, very new, but I have applied many of own (free)thoughts in practice which were always very similar to Stoicism.

The thing is, that morality, ethics are usually influenced by local society. I saw too many problems and flaws - people in despotic and controlled relationships were never happy and always needed to read some books on just how to be together [...]. People always did stupid things because of jealousy, claims, territory. We made relationships into a chore - a constant work where you need to read books written by lonely losers; need to control each other just to prove yourself that you are validated and to refuse yourself chemistry and biology just because you are afraid to lose validation of a partner.

So I did what Zarathustra told me - refused all concept of locally planted ideology, played with ideas, found what works for me and take responsibility of burden. Everything I believe in has more ""reason"" than ""passion"" which is considered to be virtue, right?

I simplified relationships and made them amazing. We have unconditional freedom which we can use at any time without hurting relationships, but we do not use it to have one night lust. That is not what we consider virtuous or reasonable thing to do. Our concept makes our relationships easier and happier. We have our own secrets. We are content with what we are sharing together. Yet we still have the freedom to invite other people into our happiness and share it, just like Buddha with candles (best example yet).

I think my ideas and actions are in accordance with what i consider a virtue. Simple, unconditional and genuine human interaction which breeds happiness. I would be glad to know your thoughts and maybe more precise 

Even simple Wikipedia defines virtue as:

&gt; Someone who lives a virtuous life is someone who leads a good moral life, doing things that society thinks are good.

""things [...] society thinks are good"" is against Stoic ideas and ""society"" can be very different, be it Jesusland, Saudi Arabia, Denmark, India. You can't please everybody, so it is up to you to find what YOU think is good for society. We are opening up slowly as a society, we are giving more freedom and there should be people who carry the flag in front rows. Just imagining society free and happy makes me go forward, think, read, toy with ideas and apply it in practice. So far everything works brilliantly.

I would love to hear from you more!","1398902935"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","You're making some massive assumptions there.  *My* wife, sure, people might think she's not a trustworthy news source.  But if, say, *Angelina Jolie* went public with recordings of Brad Pitt saying some ill-advised comments about race, even if that recording was made in confidence, the public would eat it up like crack cocaine smothered in chocolate, with only marginal discussion of the ethical implications.

Which is really the crux of the issue here, not so much that *someone's* privacy was violated, but that a very *famous* someone's privacy was violated when making some very inappropriate comments about the very thing *that he is most famous for*.  Rather than having a chilling effect on the average Joe, it's a warning to those who live in the public eye, that even their supposedly ""private"" conversations can have real market value.  

In this case, it's perfectly okay if Sterling is a known racist.  It's perfectly OK if he wants to own an NBA franchise.  What he *can't* be, though, is both.","1398902935"

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","&gt; As for the drivers guess I could try reintalling drivers again. Also I can't find any buffer settings. What is audio sync offset?

That is to sync audio with video in case its timing is off, similar to webcam and mic sync in OBS.

What is it you're trying to capture, iow, what is hooked up to the capture device (TV, xbox, ps) ? 

Are you using a **DirectShow Audio Source** in OBS? If so, have you tried sending the audio to a virtual audio device for instance and set that as the ""Desktop Audio Device"" in OBS (settings -&gt; Audio -&gt; Desktop Audio Device)? This would then rule out the DirectShow Audio source being the culprit.

FYI, that last image seems to be an animated gif that switches to something unrelated (well I'd like to think so, lol).

The technology of decentralization will allow us to become LESS dependent on the state. The state will be around for a long long time, just like the Catholic church is still around even though the printing press was invented giving everyone the opportunity to read the Bible for themselves. The Pope lost a lot of power to the press, but it didn't eliminate that power completely. But now there is a choice as to whether you want to consider him your leader.

With decentralization people will have more choices, which is good. For a long time to come I think they will pretty much stick to what we have now - but 200 years from now things will look a lot different because of decentralization even though we will still probably have a less powerful central authority structure. Maybe people will just pick the government that they prefer similar to how people pick religions now. The exiled Nepali people are already doing something like that.","1398902935"

"politics","t5_2cneq","No major differences?

**Healthcare:** Democrats want to expand it and have a proven record of doing so via government subsidies and expansion of government programs (Medicaid and Medicare). Republicans believe doing so is an affront to America.

**Foreign Relations:** Democrats increased sanctions on Iran to avoid war successfully. Republicans insist war should be on the table and aggravated tensions during the Bush years.

**Economics:** Democrats believe in investing in infrastructure to stimulate the economy. Republicans believe we need to ""starve the beast"" to reduce the debt, which will allegedly increase confidence in America as a place to do business and somehow magically improve everything (I wish I was making that up...)

**Climate Change:** Democrats believe it's real and caused by humans and think the EPA should regulate things like air pollution and carbon emissions. Republicans don't.

**Immigration:** Democrats want a pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented in the United States. Republicans don't and want to build a wall along the Mexican border. (Generalizing on this one, but this tended to be true across the board until Republicans lost the 2012 elections.

**Abortion:** Do I need to explain?

**Gay Rights:** Do I actually need to explain?

**Voting Rights:** Seriously, if I need to explain the difference between the two parties on this issue, that is just sad.

Bottom line: There *are* differences that *do* make a difference. While there are other issues where the differences between candidates are less about partisan politics and more about establishment vs. reformers (ie., the NSA, drones, drug laws, etc.) to say there is no difference between the two parties is to be entirely ignorant of what's going on in American politics.

Granted, I'm not happy with the Democrats on a good number of issues, and sure, there is a real argument that America is an oligarchy. But if you actually believe there are no real differences between the two parties, you're a fool being played like a fiddle.","1398902937"

You must see the difference between this suggestion and the 'ultimate UI' from yesterday. The latter is useful, well thought out and would benefit all users.  

You say it has happened to you once. And presumably now it won't happen again. So you don't need it. With the amount of features that we all would like the be added to the xb1 can we prioritize the important stuff before we stoop to these kind of knit picking suggestions.","1398902938"

I can think of one reason for you to keep living, though: You deserve something better than what you've been going through for the last 8 years. You may not feel worthy of that or think that it's possible - and to be honest, I don't know if there is some kind of magic cure-all for your situation - but you really do deserve that. I don't know how or when things will get better, but if you keep going, at least that gives you a chance to find something - anything - that might help. 

One problem might be that you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to get better, and that can make you start panicking when you don't feel like something is working. I read a book that helped me, it's called ""Brainswitch your way out of depression."" No positive thinking b.s., a different method. Might be worth looking into. 

I really, really hope you find something that works for you. We're always here.

Think of it from an interviewer's point of view:  ""Do you have the skills?""   ""Yes, but only if I don't have to take a drug test.""  This isn't gonna work out.

Unfortunately if you disclose when you don't have to, they'll simply find someone else to hire that didn't disclose things that are really not their business, and sound like less baggage.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","It's because most 'everyday' activities that give some sense of reward, give you a dopamine buzz that is proportional to the activity.  You work for something and feel great that you achieved it,  and get that rewarding dopamine release. With fapping,  though, you're getting a release of dopamine that is disproportionate to the activity performed. You get a huge burst of dopamine that your body was not expecting, for something that took very little effort. This huge release of dopamine also causes your receptors to become desensitised to the rewarding nature of dopamine, bc they are not normal, healthy levels. You find yourself having to do more and more, and take more risks, and view more extreme stuff (that you may have been disgusted by at first) to get the same level of satisfaction.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Generally speaking, in the US, no you don't have to disclose, any more than you don't have to disclose depression or something similar.  Insurance forms are different, but then that's only after you're hired or enrolled and only HR sees those.

Once you're enrolled in a college, then my recommendation is to go straight to student services and let them know you have ADHD.  They can do a lot to help you and NEVER disclose to a professor unless you're 100% sure they'll be awesome about it.  Student services should take care of talking to your professors for you.","1398902945"

The only issue I have with eating these is that they're mostly shell (smaller organisms have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which is a critical survival strategy for many plankton!). On the plus side, this gives them a delightful crunch, but you really have a put down a plateful to get much of that good, sweet meat out of them.

I *do* recommend cooking them. Remember when Tom Hanks broke open that raw crab in Cast Away? Gooey mess. Cooking will firm that meat right up. Boiling works fine, but if you want to get really creative, you can go the cajun boil route, or maybe try a very light batter and fry. ","1398902946"

"Lync","t5_2s425","We are on the latest firmware which is a flavor of 5.0.2.   Of course, the firmware is not actually Lync firmware but in fact Polycom software running a Lync profile.   I have a case open with Polycom but I cannot talk directly to the escalation engineer, I have to run everything through the tier 2 tech, which has been agonizingly slow.  To make matters worse, this ""escalation tech"" does not appear to be working in a tier 3 department that has experience or is familiar with Lync Edge architecture.   I've received such gems back as 

*They are asking if there’s a firewall blocking RTP because you are using a non-standard port reserved for HTTPS. Typically you would use 5061.*   

And let's not forget 

*The phone is not using encryption in the new pcap, but regardless that’s not the issue here. The phone as is, will always choose the best SDP per the RFC, which is always the last one. From what I can see in the pcap, we’re using gw-sdp, which makes sense since they are doing media bypass to the edge server.*

So, our little conundrum here is compounded by the fact that Polycom wasn't nice enough to escalate our ticket to somebody who knows how Lync Edge connectivity works.  Or somebody who knows how the ICE client is implemented and what expected NAT/TURN behavior would be or what RTP candidates are for that matter.  You'd think in theory that somebody at Polycom would know what they are talking about because they sell phones with Lync profiles.  Oh well.","1398902946"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

My dad taught me how to steal, hot wire a car, and fire a weapon by the time I was 13, sooooo yeah not that. 

It's the relationship between her and her Nana I'm trying to maintain.  Because if she finds out I'm atheist well, that's where the uneducated overly Christian mind comes in. She'll most likely demand that I stay away from her, which wouldn't really bother me. But because of being atheist,  she may not want me anywhere near our niece or break ties with my wife.

Just because you are ""pretty sure"" that someone will not shoot you, doesn't mean they won't.  At what point are you willing to risk your life?  Most of us aren't willing to risk our lives if there is even a small chance that the robber is going to kill us.  In high stress situations, someone that is already making a horrible choice is likely to make even worse choices.  

It honestly baffles me that you think you'd be safer with the robbers than with a trained citizen using a weapon to defend you.

A lot of casual and bad players just turn off their brain when they play because they want to do just that, casually play, from a hard days work at the office or something of the sort.

"archlinux","t5_2qrzu","These other answers are perfectly accurate, but I thought I might elaborate on why they are true.

A window manager (Awesome, Mutter (Gnome), KWin (KDE)) does *nothing* except provide control over the placement and appearance of windows. Applications run inside windows, so they are unaffected by the window manager, which only affects the windows themselves. Therefore any application can run on any window manager.

The only case I can think of in which this becomes false is when an application attempts to verify it is running in a valid graphical system, and this check fails because it does not recognize the window manager. In this case, the application will fail to start. This is true for some Java applications which refuse to run in tiling window managers. I use MATLAB and recently discovered this issue. A workaround is to lie to MATLAB and tell it you are using a different window manager; it runs perfectly after the fix.

For clarity, a window manager is different from a desktop environment in that a desktop environment contains a window manager but also controls a few other things besides windows: namely some sort of desktop shell, panels, docks, etc. Gnome and KDE are desktop environments which use the window managers Mutter and KWin respectively.","1398902957"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The computer program simply cannot know all 10^123 game outcomes in our universe.  For example, say it takes 10 bits (actual is much higher) to completely describe a possible chess game outcome.  And say, for simplicity, that its ""hard drive"" or ""memory"" would take 10 atoms to store each bit.  As the computer would learn chess and evolve, it would simply run out of atoms in the universe to record and keep that information, and only record 10^78 games out of the possible 10^123.

A computer program that knows all the moves--or a catalog--is what computer scientists call a [brute force algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search).  Basically, the program computes all the possible outcomes constructing a data structure called a [decision tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)), and then chooses the ""best"" one.  This works great for small problems, but are inherently impossible for things like chess.  A more ""intelligent"" way or algorithm would be utilizing a ""directed breadth-first search.""  Basically, you procedurally generate pathways of that tree on an as-needed basis.  For example, if you were playing chess against this computer and you made the first move (say, move one the middle pawn forward two places), the possible outcomes are now considerably decreased and the computer can ignore all those outcomes, e.g. it no longer has to consider outcomes where you played a knight first.

The takeaway is this: doing a brute-force algorithm is logically straight-forward, but ultimately impossible for chess.  The challenge is making an ""intelligent"" algorithm that is not only possible, but effective.  It's determining how ""deep"" into that tree you go, how to be most efficient and calculate quickly, how to build sections of that tree given hardware constraints, etc.","1398902958"

The entire crime of rape boils down to violating someone's bodily autonomy for sexual purposes.  Rape victims are generally not seriously harmed, physically speaking.  *Sometimes* they are, but that's battery and is a separate crime from rape.  Circumcision not only violates a person's bodily autonomy but also mutilates them.

A large man stepped out of the shadows in front if Matt. The man had a gun in his hand. Not pointed at anything in particular, but it was there.

""Hey man. Give me your wallet, ok?"" The man said.

Knowing that he was alone, far from help, and hopelessly outmatched if it came to violence, Matt said the only sane thing he could say: ""take it, man! Take my wallet, just don't hurt me!"" Matt pulled out his wallet, complete with the $200 in tips he earned that night at work, and tossed it to the large man, who ran off into the shadows.

Matt, shaken, scared, angry, frustrated, and sad, ran to the nearest police station for help. He told the whole story to Officer Sanders, who listened patiently until Matt explained giving up his wallet.

""Wait,"" Sanders interrupted. ""You told him he could have it?""

""Y...yeah. He was gonna shoot me!""

""You didn't mention that he said he was going to shoot you.""

""No, no. But it was implied!""

""Well, regardless, you said he could have it, so there's nothing we can do.""

You have movement points and one attack point. You can do other actions (peeking a door, hacking, opening a lock...) but you loose movement points. However, the game might be subject to changes. It's an alpha.

If I remember correctly, The Banner Saga use the same system as xcom. The game is gorgeous and the universe is fantastic.","1398902964"

"realmadrid","t5_2rr0e","This is better, but Modric has never been an anchor before, either.  Putting him in Xabi's position would limit him and take away some of his best qualities.  Though Modric is able to cover and hassle well, he is not nearly physical enough to play Xabi's role, and the rest of the midfield misses his mobility and playmaking skill. Remember that Atletico will probably try to play on the counter, and Isco will probably be caught too high, leaving our midfield exposed (yes, he defended well against Bayern, but he has never been great tracking back).  This midfield is vulnerable, not to mention a little lightweight physically.

In an ideal world, Khedira will be ready by then, adding some muscle and anchoring the center with the support of the similarly steel-lunged Modric and Di Maria. Most likely, Illarramendi will fill in with a straight switch, and that should be plenty.  He has done quite well apart from the Dortmund game, and remember why he cost so much in the first place.  I'd love to find a place for Isco, especially given how he played against Atletico in the last league game, but I don't think there's a starting spot for him (yet).  

Keep in mind that we will also need attacking fullbacks if the 2:2 taught us anything, so it's probably best to err on the safe side in midfield.","1398902965"

Don't forget that caravans and cargo ships can transport food from cities that have granaries, so you might set up convoys to the city you are trying to grow for that added boost. 

The Tradition policy tree obviously helps with growth, the Landed Elite policy is good for capital growth and finishing the tree will give you four free Aqueducts in your first cities.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","There would probably be active testers that have tested blizzard games dating back to Warcraft 3, so I think if you want to make a point about loyalty, testing Cataclysm and MoP means very little.

The most important selection factor is your hardware profile, probably followed by your history of submitting bug reports. 

Testers for StarCraft II are probably desirable, since it uses the same engine.

Another factor might be community participation (forum activity, twitch streamers, people who send out a lot of recruit-a-friends and guest passes, and so on). Like it or not, they want people who are most likely to promote the game to have early access. Free publicity. 

But I would say randomness is a big factor. You either got lucky or you didn't. 

People tend to forget that blizzard do these public betas to test a broad range of hardware compatability and to stress test the servers. Feedback on gameplay is secondary (although they do gauge public opinion). They have their own qualified QA department to give feedback on gameplay mechanics - these would be people with experience as professional MOBA players or video game reviewers. ","1398902967"

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt;except sex shouldn't fall under the same basic human need as food 

We can argue about the semantics of what kind of need it is, but there is no denying that it is a need. Yes Buddhist monks spend their lifetime without sex. But is possible to do that in a mainstream western society where we are surrounded by sexual imagery every waking minute and our heads are filled with propaganda that happiness of all forms ( mainly sexual) is the ultimate goal of life?

&gt; Are you going to hump the nearest sexually attractive woman? I don't get what you mean.

I certainly dont mean men should walk around humping whoever they please. Everyone( men and women) deserves basic human respect. I am merely pointing it out that access to sex is a real problem for men( atleast at the lower end of totem pole). 

&gt; I hate this whole gatekeeper of sex thing. 

I hate it too. I would like to be approached and offered sex too. 

But one sex is always the gatekeeper of sex. It true across all the species. It usually the sex that produces the egg and more generally  the sex that invests more in the offspring ( no its not always female sex, there are some famous role reversals in nature where male parent invests more than the female parent and gets to be the gatekeeper of sex, eg: seahorses ).

What is there is to not understand about this? 

What are the options for a man who can get sex? Prostitution is illegal.  Should prescribing and taking libido suppressants be socially acceptable ( and encouraged )? Should we invest in developing virtual reality sex machines? Does anyone even give a fuck about these men?","1398902972"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Similarly, superswimming in Wind Waker HD was demonstrated to a Nintendo employee before the game's release, leading to them fix storage (a prerequisite to superswimming) for the retail version.  WWHD was received similarly to OoT3D, since other bugs like ledge clipping were left unfixed (and most people liked superswimming).

I get the impression Nintendo would fix all the bugs in their rereleases, but they don't have enough of a finger on the speedrunning community to be aware of them all.

Unless you're in some god awful hellhole like the UK, you shouldn't ever have to do the ""real life experience"" bit. Over there, though, it seems to be standard to haze trans women by making them present female for a full year before they can have access to hormones.

They consider it a test to prove that you're really trans. Most trans women see it as intrusive, dangerous, and disrespectful.

This, 100% agreed. Lobbying mean simply talking to politicians. That should be legal no matter who speak. Sending your representative to talk is democracy, even if you don't agree with the fact that your employer or opponents can do it too.

What is ought to be cracked upon is bribery. That is, when they give money or gifts or various ""disinterested campaign contributions"", when former people in charge suddenly become a high level exec in a natural gaz company a few years later, and go (way) beyond talking and writing letters or email or sending representatives etc.

"science","t5_mouw","There are several problems with this argument. First of all, all drugs are expensive to develop and can take ten years or more from initial development to approval by the FDA, but antibiotic resistance can evolve literally overnight. Antibiotics are not an economically viable investment for drug R&amp;D companies, and many big players like Pfizer have left the industry for more profitable diabetes and heart disease medications.  
  
&gt; This is not an un-winnable fight  
  
Yes it is. Antibiotics have highly specific mechanisms of action. For example,  the antibiotic tetracycline binds to a specific part of the bacterial ribosome, which is responsible for building cell components. A single, seemingly insignificant mutation in the ribosome-associated DNA can render the drug completely useless. These mutations can be passed on to completely different bacterial species via horizontal transformation. Trying to fight bacteria with more and more antibiotics is fruitless because they can adapt much faster than we do.","1398902987"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;That seems to imply that marginalism was the prevailingly followed economic thought of the time. I'm not sure that's accurate. How could anyone say that the market was even ALLOWED to correct itself when you remember the significant efforts in both the US and across Europe that almost across the board devalued their currency, raised taxes, cut benefits, increased tariffs, tried to prop of prices and wages, etc. 

I don't agree with this characterization but I'm going to avoid this debate because I'm guessing it will likely end in us talking past one another via citing specific policies (or lack there-of) as being significant to our interpretations of events. 

&gt;But was the Great Depression a result of free market capitalism or of an out of control credit system directly encouraged by govt and the Federal Reserve (patently NOT free market components)? 

Both? I don't see why having a Federal Reserve somehow automatically makes the USA 'not a free-market capitalist economy'. It seems like a no-true-Scotsman which is fueled by an idealistic vision of what a ""free-market capitalist economy"" *should* look like. By your standards, has there ever *been* a free-market capitalist country?

&gt;However, many Marxists seem hostile toward the idea of discerning between such govt driven crony capitalism and actual free markets. They frequently just lump it all in together as ""capitalism"" and throw the baby out with the bathwater in denouncing all of it.

I don't think we're hostile to it. I think we see it as a distinction without a difference. Our characterization of the state is that it's an integral component of any class-based system of economic or social organization. Such 'systems' are historical in nature, and complaining that they don't live up to some ideal vision of what capitalism *should* be just isn't helpful to talk about. 

Marx and Marxists who've developed his theories since, are interested in the fundamentals of what made capitalism capitalism. His 'Law of Value' would apply to any market-based society where commodities are produced for exchange, rather than use. It could be Adam Smith's capitalism, the modern USA's capitalism, or the so-called Market Socialism advocated by some socialists seeking to maintain a market economy. Yes, the role of the state and how firms are organized *do* affect that analysis. Those variables aren't hand-waved away. But they don't change the fundamentals of what we're examining.

You are over looking the part in the good samaritan law (well I hope your state as it as well) that says you can not be held responsible for any injuries or wrong doing when helping the person. 

Example: You are helping me out of a burning car and break my leg in 2 spots, I am not breathing and you break 3 ribs giving me CPR. I live and I can not sue you because you where trying to help. 

If you shoot someone do not stand over them saying bitch you are going to die I hope it feels good. Like that dumb ass in MN just did because he is in jail for life now. Well that whole case is fucked up but lets say rather then curse at them he provided medical care and called the police right away. 

You should keep your certification, you should help some one after the threat is stopped. Why not it will only make you look better. Sure some one could say he new it was wrong and that is why he helped. 

Nope He did not want to shoot the person they made him do that and he started to help because he is a moral and just person and cares not for this person but for human life.   ","1398902992"

There's a big big difference between SRS-bait and personal attacks. Personal (meaning directed at an individual i.e. calling them a racist) attacks are intended to and universally seen as offensive. Their only saving grace is if they have a bona fide basis. 

For example, calling Donald Sterling a racist  is a personal attack, but its one with a strong basis in reality. 

&gt;&gt;Especially if it was completely baseless?

&gt;It isn't completely baseless, which is precisely why this anti-offended crap is only argued in relation to ideas of race, gender, sexuality, or religion.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","... Read my original post. There are many solutions to the dilemma of determinism. Read about compatibalism for example. Even besides that, there's no real proof that the world is actually how we perceive it. It's entirely possible that our perception of the world is fundamentally flawed for example the very idea of causality is flawed if you look at certain ""times"" or ""scales"" (both words are flawed descriptions but that reflects simply a flaw in language to accurately describe real world phenomena). Simply reducing things to either deterministic or random is also a really inaccurate way of viewing reality because there are many experiments in physics that show that neither really paints an accurate picture of the world we live in.

I have to ask you why you are so wedded to this idea that the dilemma of determinism is such a hard and fast notion that has never been questioned and could never be questioned. Have you ever taken any college level courses on this topic, and where exactly do you get your knowledge from? You seem really ideologically wedded to this idea, do you really not see that there is a possibility you could be wrong? Do you really not see there's space for your authority sources to be wrong? 

Also, why are you so belittling of people that don't just immediately agree with your assertions? Don't you think it's more intellectually honest to try to reason with people and listen to the points they make than just stating over and over again that they are idiots and they just need to read more of the people that you agree with?

Are you aware that this question has been debated literally since Greek times and many many different philosophers have many many different rebuttals to your assertions?

Post-zombie, came the reign of found footage.  The majority of these found footage movies relate to demons and otherworldly apparitions into the ""real world,"" just like the religious horror of the 70s.

Now interestingly, the found footage period seems to have merged the religious horror and ""real life"" phases together.  So following the trend, I'd expect a lot more witches and werewolves in the coming years.","1398902997"

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","Oh man, unfortunately there's no easy out to this. One thing to keep in mind is that being single does not mean anything is wrong with you. High school is a very vain place to be and teenagers in general are pretty selfish. I remember being a teen and thinking I was really socially aware. I often thought of the world at large, but it ultimately would always boil down to my place in the world. I guarantee all of your peers are more focused on their own lives, not focusing on your singledom. 

My advice to you would be to learn to be content when you are alone.  Sounds so cheesy and cliche, but finding a hobby, reading, exercising are all methods of being happy alone. It also opens doors to meet new people which in turn could lead to a relationship. 

Loneliness sucks, but your not alone. It is definitely something everyone experiences. Reach out to a friend or family member, sometimes it helps to be reassured that you are loved and people are there for you. ","1398902998"

If your shrimp are having trouble molting the usual suspects are calcium, magnesium issues. I live in a hard water area so that isn't an issue. A friend of mine who lives in a soft water environment used cuttlebone for bird cages to supplement his inverts. Just break off a small piece and offer it to the shrimp. It will add cal/mag to the water column. They can also pick at it for supplemental nutrition.  Another option is cal/mag for reef tanks. I don't really suggest that except for an advanced aquarist. The chances off changing the PH of the tank is high. Which would be disaster. Try the cuttlebone. You could also supplement their diet with enriched algae wafers. All inverts wear their bones on the outside (exoskeleton) and need dietary support to grow. Hope this helps.

This would allow me time to travel and have fun while I'm young while also still gaining the necessary experience to be taken seriously as a political candidate. However, this is subject to change (and often does) as my environment changes. 
I realize that it is possible that perhaps there is a better school than either of these for me, in fact, if I really had it my way I'd attend UCLA, however, the money just isn't there. At this point it really has to be one of these two schools.. If only for the sake of going to a school and just taking it seriously you know? I know that if I stay here in Boise for the next semester/ year I would likely fall in love with debate to the extent where I wouldn't want to leave..

Unfurtunately one of those categories was arrogance. To make a long story short, command of the army switched back and forth between the two consuls every other day. One particular day, one console decided that the glory of defeating the Barbarian horde would be his alone, and deploys his entire army. when the Armies met, the Romans large numbers made tactical moving impossible, add to this the command of the Roman army being destroyed by the Carthaginians attacking from the rear, and what you end up with is 80,000 men marching in an uncoordinated attack. With no orders being given, command breaks down, when command breaks down, the cohesive tactical deployments that the Romans were known for essentially evaporates, and this grand army ends up being slaughtered.

With no way of knowing when people were last logged in, and with the fact that guild stashes are either a free for all or you have to bug an officer, either guilds are left to slowly rot away in to inactivity, or remain a perpetually small group of close friends.

Edit: I looked up k spice and it looks like you are talking about vaping to get high, am I right? In all honesty people are going to do what they're going to do, and no amount of regulation will stop it.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.


My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).


I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.


Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.


I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.


I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.


I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.


I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.


I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.


The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.


That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","To add to the other replies you've gotten, rewatch the episode in season 2 where Arya is captured and taken to Harrenhal. 

Just before the fight she's captured during, she has a chat with Yoren (Nights Watch recruiter) about how to go on living when you're filled with so much hate. He tells her about a man that killed his brother. He said when he couldn't sleep, he would just say the killer's name over and over again to himself like a prayer. Then one day the killer came back, and Yoren sunk an axe in his head and fled to the Nights Watch so he wouldn't be tried for murder. 

This is where Arya gets the idea for her ""prayer"". So each night before she goes to sleep, she says the names of all the people she wants to kill. After parting with Jaqen, he tells her to memorize ""Valar Morgulis"". So, even though she doesn't know what it means, she adds it to the end of her prayer, almost like an ""Amen"". ","1398903016"

"mtgoxinsolvency","t5_30lhf","The Sunlot proposal isn't great and I would DEFINITELY prefer another company/plan but I do not want a liquidation in almost any circumstance.

1. Insiders not necessarily. I work in consulting and a lot of times floundering businesses call us to turn things around. It's possible Mark called these guys and they realized the potential of a takeover. Happens all the time in the business world, doesn't mean they were involved with the scam. Just means they saw the wreckage coming and tried to take advantage of a business opportunity.

2. I do agree Sunlot seem to be changing their numbers a lot and that makes me uncomfortable. I think they said 70% based on the signups on the savegox site, but you can't trust numbers users put in themselves so they had to revise that down. This is, in my opinion, my biggest reservation and why I prefer OKCoin to Sunlot (but either over liquidation).

3. Don't care if anybody has a stake in MtGox. I have 400 coins there, and whatever company takes over I would prefer to just be competent, don't care if they lost funds with me or not. If Microsoft or Apple or Google offered to buy out MtGox everybody here would be ALL OVER that -- doesn't matter if nobody from those companies lost funds at MtGox. The 1 bitcoin payment would be TO MARK KARPELES why on earth would you ever want them to pay more? It's symbolic.

4. My understanding is the distribution of the 202k bitcoins would be guaranteed minus the $10m in fiat to cover the audit. So really if they fail we lose $10m divided by all the creidtors. Seems like an acceptable risk to me as a creditor in the hopes that they might actually find some more coins or create a profitable exchange. I do agree that $10 m seems steep for an audit and is another reason I would prefer it not be Sunlot that takes over Gox, but I'd still take this offer over liquidation.","1398903016"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","That's a valid point, but those were laws introduced under entirely different circumstances. The Superhuman Registration Act is a law that is pushed through by an intolerance and hateful public, as evidenced by how loosely defined it is; ""superhumans"" includes humans born with their ability, those who acquired it, and may even include humans with no power whatsoever, but are merely powerful humans who associate with superhumans.^1 

Providing personal information about your address and name can potentially endanger you if that information is leaked. Many of the heroes who register have enemies who will gladly exploit that information. It endangers superhumans' lives when the government has detailed information about their personal lives considering the potential for corruption or leaks. 

If people don't want the government in their lives, they don't have to. You don't have to sign up for a driver's license if you don't want to, for example.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","No, not again.  It must be those stupid, careless college kids down the street.  Frank had stepped on yet another disgusting used condom that was lying next to the bus stop’s bench.  Shaking his head, Frank took a seat on the bench.  It was going to be a while.  It was another rainy, dreary, overcast day and  the buses in Littleton always ran a little late on rainy days.  

You see, Littleton is a bit of a misnomer.  Founded in the 1890s, it certainly was a small establishment, but especially grew after the war and there are at least a hundred thousand people here in the present day.  Although there may be a little less- some people up and packed their bags once the recession hit.  Some packed their bags mentally as well.   Will Mackles, a man who was in his sixties, attacked his daughter with a knife.  After the police had already taken him away and his daughter was in the hospital with a nasty gash in the side of her left cheek, she said that he looked possessed.  Perhaps it was the dementia that ran in Mackles family, or maybe the fact that his wife Mary passed away a few years prior.  Whatever it was, the losses from his careless spending did him in.  The daughter would spend the next few years wondering how she could have prevented this whole ordeal.

“Maybe all he needed was a cat,” she would often say.

The screeches of the braking bus startled Frank from this stupor and daydreaming.  He did not dare look at that disgusting wet and shriveled condom.  Stepping onto the bus, Frank realized he only had a five dollar bill.  Littleton bus drivers were never sympathetic- Frank had no choice but to pay five dollars for a three dollar fare.  Oh well.

Frank hoped his boss would not be mad again.  Surely he would understand that this bad weather would cause him to be a little late.  But he did say that today was an important day.  There was something about a book.  Frank went back to daydreaming.  His eyes glanced over the wet brick buildings and shops.  A power tripping F150 angered the bus driver.  There was the sound of a blaring horn, but this time, Frank’s stupor was not interrupted.  What was this book anyway?

Having said thank you to the bus driver and gotten a grunt in response, Frank stepped off the bus and walked along one block of wet pavement and then proceeded to enter a rather nondescript three story brick building.  He ascended all of the stairs and then knocked three times on his boss’ door.

“Come in.”

“Sorry I’m late, sir.”

“Don’t make a habit of it.  I don’t have much time.  I need you to get this book to McPherson’s office, pronto.”

“Yes sir.”

Frank took his queue and left.  His boss was always a difficult man to deal with.  He had such a stern face and a thick, almost intimidating moustache.  Frank held the book sealed in a manila package.
Descending the stairs, he heard the old wood creak.  He quickly glanced at a wall clock and then walked out.  That’s the last thing he remembered, other than the feeling of cold, clammy hands on his mouth.
- - -
“Throw another thing of water at him.”

Frank’s eyes suddenly bulged wide open as cold water enmeshed his face.  He quickly gasped for air and hacked up a wad of mucus.

“So where’s the money?”

“I don- CUH HUH, know, what, CUH HUH, you’re talking about!”

“Ya know, I’m pretty sick of playing this game.  It’s always the same.  I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  This man with slicked back black hair and a missing tooth made a faux grimace.  “Well, ya know what- we ALWAYS BREAK YOU DOWN!”  With that, he took the bucket of water and chucked it at the dirty white brick wall behind Frank.  A loud clang went off.

“No, please.  I don’t know what’s going on.  I was just delivering a book.”

“We, DO NOT speak of THE book!”

The other stern looking man suddenly chimed in.  “Say, this doesn’t look like that McPherson guy.”

“Shut up.”

“No really, look at this no name loser.  He’s not who we’re after.”

Frank had no clue what this money was for and what the hell kind of a book could get one tied up in a moist basement with two psychopaths that like to throw buckets full of water at walls.  But it was too late.  Frank saw the barrel and that was it.  Darkness.

"technology","t5_2qh16","But that's the thing, when will we be put into a situation of discomfort? How many people talk about gun control and Sandy Hook? If there ever was a time to drum up support that was as good as any imo. But the Parties apposed threw up their walls, laid think a campaign of smoke and mirrors, and even tried to turn it towards their favor (armed security in schools argument). 
Eventually other issues and stories came center stage, and not much has been done in terms of better regulatory methods concerning gun control, background screens, or help for those with mental illness. Meanwhile the gun lobbyists are still in Washington (and key state legislatures) chasing the long game.

The key in these events is to take advantage of wide spread public support and accomplish as much as possible while the issue is relevant. Big players, such as corporations, don't really need this as they can rely on constant and focused support (in the form of lobbyists, assimilation into the political structure, large sums of capital, lawyers in key cases to further the agenda). Personally I don't think Wheeler does have in mind what you think. I think allowing the current state of affairs fits his ideological framework, as well as his personal agenda (If he leaves the FCC, he would have a better chance of finding a cushy job with these big firms if he helped them out now). 
As for SOPA, they will keep trying as long as they can. Whether it's a clone of SOPA, hiding amendments in other bills, through legal process to establish jurisprudence, or w/e.

&gt;

&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performs vicarious baptisms for individuals regardless of their race, sex, creed, religion, or morality. Some members of the LDS Church have been baptized for both victims and perpetrators of the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust), including [Anne Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank) and [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler), contrary to Church policy.  Some [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew) Holocaust survivors and some Jewish organizations have objected to this practice.

&gt;The LDS Church has urged members to submit the names of only their own ancestors for ordinances, and to request permission of surviving family members of people who have died within the past 95 years.  Hundreds of thousands of improperly submitted names not adhering to this policy have been removed from the records of the church.  Latter-day Saint [apostle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints\)) [Boyd K. Packer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_K._Packer) has stated the LDS Church is clear that it uses public records for temple ordinance work. 

&gt;Despite the guidelines, some members of the church have submitted names without adequate permission. In December 2002, independent researcher Helen Radkey published a report showing that, following a 1995 promise from the church to remove Jewish Holocaust victims from its International Genealogical Index, the church's database included the names of about 19,000 who had a 40 to 50 percent chance ""to be Holocaust victims ... in Russia, Poland, France, and Austria.""   Genealogist Bernard Kouchel searched the International Genealogical Index, and discovered that many well known Jews had been vicariously baptized, including [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides), [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), and [Irving Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin), without family permission.

&gt;Comparing poverty levels among countries is difficult, because a variety of factors are at play.

&gt;the poverty level in the United States of 15% (46.2 million people in poverty, of a total of 308.5 million) is comparable to the one in France, where 14% of the population live with less than 880 euros per month.

Nowhere else are comparisons between countries mentioned. More to the point, it is simply false to say that US citizens are not some of the most prosperous in the world. GDP per capita ([9th place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita)), purchasing power parity ([1st place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage)), and the Human Development Index ([3rd place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDI_index#2013_report)) all place the US at or near the top among first world countries.

At that point the accounts of Bill Gates gets hit with an estate tax, and the remainder goes to heirs, at which point *their* value goes up. Bill Gates loses **all** of his value upon death. Realistically, his body would sell for orders of magnitude less than his current net worth. The only person that will pay billions of dollars for Bill Gates' blood is Bill Gates.

&gt;the cost of an ambulance or a hospital visit as a result of the bite will probably be much more than his cost of living for the next several years

We don't know Bill Gates' average cost of living so we can't calculate the difference. But I sincerely suspect that Bill Gates spends mid to high 5-digits on property taxes alone, before costs of living, so I doubt this is true either.","1398903025"

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","CQB/MOUT/door-kickin' is generally not advised with a long barrel, but there's no core mechanics for it.  The more distance between you and a target, the more likelihood of architectural, visibility, or other obstacles between the two of you.  The report of an anti-materiel or high-powered sniper/hunting rifle cartridge (even if suppressed) is likely way out of the ordinary in most sprawls, and KE/LS/CorpSec probably have advanced audio-triangulation systems set up to try to locate firearm discharges inside of the areas they care about; possibly realtime ballistics traceback of some sort.  

  There's specific rules for accuracy penalties to the Ranger Arms SM-5 for using it in a running battle or melee combat, I could see extending that to certain other precision platforms.  There's also the concealment factor to consider, as others have said.

  Fortunately, the same skill that governs sniper rifles covers shotguns, which are strong in many of the areas snipers lack.  Multi-target engagement, more burst-fire/auto options, short barrel length. Good stuff.","1398903029"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","&gt; So...I'm guessing any Spider but Peter or a Peter clone just isn't going to do it for you then?

Well, to be honest, I wouldn't have minded so much (as I said) had they not just completely done away with Peter.  There was a long stretch where it was just Doc Ock. I personally don't like Doc Ock. I don't know, maybe if they had picked a character who less douchey and pretentious, maybe I could've gotten behind it easier. Because that is the main reason I was cheering against him. He is a character that works in small doses as the villain. A lot of his dialogue just made me cringe.

But see, I do read Miles Morales's run. I enjoy him as Spider-Man. I have no problem with him replacing Ultimate Spider-Man, especially since (at the time) the mainstream Peter was still there.

I don't know...I'm okay with change so long as there is another version of the character. I know how that sounds, but you do get attached to characters.  You don't want them to die or leave or whatever, especially if that is part of the reason you read the comic to begin with.

That being said, I'm more than willing to read the new Spider-Man 2099 series and get to know a different person as Spider-Man.

Also, going back to the subject of clones. Honestly, Kaine Parker wasn't all that similar to Peter. He had SOME similarities, but his story was that of redemption. He was a villain who was trying to change his ways and in doing that, took up the mantle of the Scarlet Spider. I just felt more attached to him than Doc Ock because of his connection to Peter, even though he was rougher, not as funny, or nerdy as Peter. To be honest, I found some bits of Superior Spider-Man to be redundant due to Scarlet Spider. That was before the Spider Army, though.


Either way, I do want to emphasize that I do like Miles Morales and I did like the Superior Spider-Man series, regardless of whatever I said up there. I do like the direction in which they were going, but not at the sake of losing a character I'm attached to. Maybe (at least for Spider-Ock) if they had done it was a side story rather than the main story, I would've liked it better. I know the switch to Miles was easier having mainstream Peter still there.

And truth be told, I did like Dick Grayson as Batman. I wasn't as eager to get Bruce back I was Peter. I like Bruce Wayne, but Dick had a good run as Batman.","1398903033"

&gt; Sommers uses the terms ""equity feminism"" and ""gender feminism"" to differentiate what she sees as acceptable and non-acceptable forms of feminism. She describes equity feminism as the struggle based upon ""Enlightenment principles of individual justice"" for equal legal and civil rights and many of the original goals of the early feminists, as in the first wave of the women's movement. She describes ""gender feminism"" as having ""transcended the liberalism"" of early feminists. Instead of focusing on rights for all, gender feminists view society through the ""sex/gender prism"" and focus on recruiting women to join the ""struggle against patriarchy."" A reviewer of Who Stole Feminism characterized gender feminism as the action of accenting the differences of genders in order to create what Sommers believes is privilege for women in academia, government, industry, or the advancement of personal agendas.","1398903034"

Im wanting to add some different flavours to a fairly generic [Coopers](http://www.coopers.com.au/#/diy-beer/brew-cans/original-series/?p=draught) brand draught and wanted a bit of advice. I have successfully added natural raspberry licorice pieces to the secondary fermentation (instead of sugar) which gave the beer a nice pink hue and subtle flavour addition. My plan for the next one is to use a good quality jar of dark cherries in natural juice , dissolve the sugar needed for the secondary in a small amount of water and then when cooled add the jar of cherries mash/blend it and then use this mix for flavouring/carbonation. Im wondering about whether the acidity of the cherries will prevent (in bottle) carbonation. Any tips or insight would be greatly apprecieted.","1398903034"

#2 The Shinning.  I'm always trying to figure out if the ghosts are in his mind. Or if Jack Nicholson is a ghost himself. Or if its the family who is crazy and not him.

#3 The Jacket. Where the main character has to go back in time to solve his own murder.  It fascinates and confuses me in a good way.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Fernando Rodney is tied for the lowest ERA- ever recorded for a pitcher with 50+ IP over a season, and it's a 16. [source](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=pit&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=50&amp;type=1&amp;season=2014&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=1&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;sort=14,a) 

He's recorded as having a 641 ERA+ that year. [source](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodnefe01.shtml)

I think that ERA+ is what I think it is, and ERA- is what I think it is as well. Rodney's ERA- should surely go negative if every point of ERA- means it's 1% better or worse than league average. With ERA+ I'm not *as sure* that I'm correct, since I don't really use bbref all too often. ","1398903038"

That all being said, I can't believe how underrated Levy's 2013 was.  He really should have gone to the Pro Bowl; he led all players in INTs until the last few weeks of the season when Richard Sherman had a bunch of picks in the year's waning weeks, and he's a damn linebacker.  When's the last time a linebacker had 6 INTs and 15 PDs in a season?

But no, it's way more important to make sure that all the OLBs going to the Pro Bowl were pass rushers playing in a 3-4 scheme that had high sack counts.  Let's do that, despite that the Pro Bowl requires defenses to play a 4-3 and not blitz.

Still though, the Pro Bowl is irrelevant.  I'm okay with Levy going under the radar.  He's signed for two more years at a very, very cheap price, and unless last year was a total fluke, he's a very good linebacker.  Even if last year is the best year he'll ever have, he's still a good starter.","1398903038"

The probability of this occurring is incredibly low, so I don't predict this will be an issue anyone will have to face incredibly often, but if you have a labia and externally appear to be a women, it makes sense that you would go to the women's changing room. People can't see your internal gonads. Similarly, people can't see whether you identify as trans or not.

"bicycletouring","t5_2sdwm","I've done some of that route before (Toronto to Kingston/Cape Vincent), and Toronto - Owego. 

Depending on where you are leaving in Toronto there are several different routes to get through Scarlem. You can also take non-rush hour Go Trains to Oshawa to avoid most of the city. Likewise when returning you can pick up a GO train in Burlington to take back into Toronto. 

Baley/Victoria/Bloor St through Pickering/Ajax/Oshawa was busy with narrow shoulders in some areas. Once Bloor St crosses over the 401 at Harmony, stay on it as it goes into the country side nearly all the way to Bowmanville. 

From New Castle to Port Hope, take Lakeshore Rd instead of Highway 2. Lakeshore is very quiet traffic wise, though the trade off is the road has steeper hills and no stores until Port Hope. Its really a nice section to bike through.  

I've enjoyed taking HWY 33 from the outskirts of Brighton to Kingston. Stop at the bike shop in Bloomfield just because its pretty awesome. 

There used to be a Hostel in Kingston that was an old boat, but I cant find any information on it now. If you make it arcross the river into the USA and Cape Vincent, Tibbets Point Lighthouse is a nice hostel. You can also stay at Queens, or the camp ground that is nearly downtown. 

Between Oswego and Rochester there are a bunch of drumlin hills, one right after the other. 

Most of the way between Rochester and the Niagara Falls area you can take the Erie Canal trail. Its crushed gravel, and flat with some historic stops along the old canal. 

Check out www.warmshowers.org, its like couch surfing for cyclists. Also there are a few travel journals for cycling around Ontario on www.crazyguyonabike.com (Including a report of one of my trips to Kingston and back: https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?o=1&amp;doc_id=804&amp;v=1a and the same section during a trip across Canada in 2005: https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?o=1&amp;doc_id=788&amp;v=K3 .

 [**Teledildonics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Teledildonics__ (also known as ""cyberdildonics"") are electronic [sex toys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_toy) that can be controlled by a computer to enable the human user to reach [orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm).   Promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the ""next big thing"" in [cybersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersex) technology.  ""Teledildonics"" can also refer to the integration of [telepresence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence) with [sexual activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity) that these toys make possible — the term was [coined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism) in 1975 by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)  in his book *[Computer Lib / Dream Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib_/_Dream_Machines)*.

&gt;In its original conception, this technology was to have been used for remote sex (or, at least, remote [mutual masturbation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_masturbation)), where the physical sensations of [touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactition) could be transmitted over a data link between the participants. A report in the *[Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune)* in 1993 suggested that teledildonics was ""the virtual-reality technology that may one day allow people wearing special bodysuits, headgear and gloves to engage in tactile sexual relations from separate, remote locations via computers connected to phone lines."" 

&gt;Sex toys that can be manipulated remotely by another party are currently coming onto the market.  These toys sometimes come with movies to which the toys' actions are synchronized by means of a previously-written script. Other products being released fit a new category called bluedildonics, which allow a sex toy to be controlled remotely via a [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) connection. A report in 2008 suggested that teledildonics, along with text and email and webcams, can be used to ""wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day"" as a prelude to sex with a human during the evening hours.  New technologies can help people establish ""emotional connections"" via the web.  A book reviewer of [David Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levy_(chess_player\))'s *Love and Sex with Robots* in *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)* in 2008 suggested that teledildonics was ""but one stage in a technological and social revolution"" in which robots will play an increasingly important role, with artificial lifeforms that will ""attend to our needs with magic fingers""; Levy argued that by 2050 ""sex with robots will be commonplace.""  Some products have been shown at the [Museum of Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Sex) in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York,_New_York).

				cin &gt;&gt; moneyAmount;

However VS is telling me ""error function ""bankAccount::overDrawn"" is not a type name""

I've set up overdrawn() both in the header and cpp files, and all it does is return true

"VietNam","t5_2qkcr","I too am well aware of Giap’s “reluctance” of the Tet Offensive.
However as you have cited, 
CIA report: http://www.paperlessarchives.com/vw_tet_offensive.html ""The plan for the Tet Offensive originated in 1967, following the death of North Vietnamese General Nguyen Chi Thanh. The primary strategist was Thanh's successor, General Vo Nguyen Giap.""
You can’t just give half credit to this great man; it was still his battle from the beginning till the end.  He might have not liked it but he rather loses hundreds of thousands of men than to just ‘honorably’ decline to take part, then again there’s no honor in war, much less in keeping truce (the South and the American were fools in this account).

NY Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/opinion/sunday/what-we-dont-know-about-vietnam-can-still-hurt-us.html?pagewanted=all 
I’m not sure if this article is in favor of supporting the notion that Giap was a military genius.  Are you saying the Tet Offensive as success, a step to the ultimate victory?  Are you giving Giap the credit for that or was it Duan?  
A great general takes full responsibilities of the men who serve him.  

Another article from http://hnn.us/article/153624: "" Giap’s words of caution throughout Hanoi’s war might have still resulted in Hanoi’s victory but without the staggering costs.""
That’s a huge “what if”.  We don’t want to go down the rabbit hole.

“…choosing to refute your biased theories with facts and historical accounts”
How are my theories biased?  I merely stated the facts that he did strategized many battles and many if not most of his battles ended with him losing the most men.  

When it comes to the story of the ‘300’, we think of the Persian as idiots for losing so many men for a single battle.  But when it comes to Giap, he’s a military genius even though he pretty much deployed the same tactic.
 You’ve cited McCain, here’s my citation
http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304626104579119221395534220
“Giap was a master of logistics, but his reputation rests on more than that. His victories were achieved by a patient strategy that he and Ho Chi Minh were convinced would succeed—an unwavering resolve to suffer immense casualties and the near total destruction of their country to defeat any adversary, no matter how powerful. ""You will kill 10 of us, we will kill one of you,"" Ho told the French, ""but in the end, you will tire of it first.""”

What's yet more difficult is the fact that this is such a weak signal to detect. The transit lasts maybe a few hours and youre looking for those photons which passed through the exoplanetary atmosphere which will be few compared to those from the star. The length of the exposure is limited to the duration of the transit so you can't just take a longer exposure to gather more photons.","1398903048"

The special danger with global activism is that symbolism with broad resonant appeal can mobilize a large community of ignorant people (see: Invisible Children).

I'm not sure about your reading of *Tweddle v Atkinson*. From a quick glance at the wiki article, it looks like that was a case where two parties tried to turn their separate donative promises to give money to a third party into a contract. One party made the gift, but the other party died and his estate refused to honor the agreement. The third party beneficiary sued, and the court rejected this suit because he was not the party who had given consideration. 

Imagine that I am hosting an event at a rented venue, and I hire you to set up equipment at the venue in exchange for payment. This benefits me because I will be able to charge more for event tickets if I have all that equipment set up. You have performed a service for me, which is valuable to me, even though that value comes from other parties giving me money as a result of your service and not directly from you. Does that mean I don't have to pay you, because you performing the service I hired you to perform doesn't count as consideration? Of course not.","1398903051"

"Bad_Cop_No_Donut","t5_2qqdb","If you're honestly curious, maybe next time you should leave out the patronizing definitions.


&gt;Explain to me how telling an officer he can decree. lie through his teeth and simply ""declare"" that he did not see a seat belt and or he ""smelled weed"" even after finding none can be ""reasonable"" ??

Nobody is telling an officer he can lie.  

And if you want to stick to how you interpret the spirit of the Constitution...How exactly other than sight, sound, and smell do you imagine that the authors of the Constitution would determine if something is reasonable?  There was no video evidence, DNA, or crime scene analysts in those days.  ""Declarations"" were the entirety of evidence during the time that the document you feel is being misinterpreted was written.

Why would you imagine something with a potent scent like weed just does away once it is removed from an area?  Especially if it had recently been smoked.  That scent stays around for hours.  Go to a bar some time and see how long your clothes smell like smoke after you leave.  There are numerous times where finding no weed does not invalidate a search because it does not mean that it wasn't recently there.

&gt;My contention is reasonable equates to challengeable.

That would be your contention of evidence/testimony at a trial after it is already obtained.  This conversation is not about a trial, it is about if a search is ""unreasonable"" without a warrant.  

And on that topic, it is far more ""unreasonable"" to require that a vehicle be removed from the owners possession and towed to a police impound lot while an officer writes a warrant and then gets a judge to sign it all to search that vehicle and take that gun in your back seat than it is to allow the officer to search it and retrieve that gun when probable cause exists without the need for a warrant.  

&gt;Judge says don't matter as long as the officer was honest in his belief that he did not see it its probable cause.

That's why it's called ""probable cause"" and not ""absolute certainty"".  If you provided the evidence that you state in your example then the case would be dropped.  The stop would still not be illegal.

"shakespeare","t5_2rouy","I agree with /u/dute the point as I see it is that her death is ambiguous. Hamlet contemplates suicide throughout the play. He feigns maddness and appears mad. Some argue he is actually mad throughout the play. Ophelia actually does go mad, we see her madness in her songs. She dies 'off screen' so there is no way to know the answer to this question, and that is part of the beauty of play. As I see it, this play is about questions, about contemplating life and death, reason and insanity, morality and corruption, and Ophelia's character in her life and death, show us another example of all these themes. 

Edit: You asked about if Gertrude was a witness or not - and I think that's something else we can't answer. But going off ""did gertrude know?"" - another interesting passage in the final act is when Claudius tells her not to drink the cup with poison in it and she does anyway. 
""KING CLAUDIUS
Gertrude, do not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.""

Did she understand his warning and choose to ignore it? Or did she not know? This play is riddled with ambiguity, which is one of the reasons I find it so fun to watch. Actors can't play ambiguity, they have to choose, and each production is different for it.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","There are two kinds of codes that are submitted with any claim: CPT and ICD codes. CPT codes are for procedures/treatments. ICD codes are for the diagnosis. For example, if you get an X-ray because you have a broken arm, the CPT code would be for ""X-ray"" and the ICD code would be for ""broken arm"". 

Some plans have what are called ""exclusions"", where it is written into the plan what procedures and/or diagnoses are covered, and what aren't. It has nothing to do with medical necessity, it's just the plan. It is actually the *employer* who decides which plan you get, thus dictating the extent of your coverage. 

If the CPT or ICD code is just an exclusion of your plan, you are pretty much SOL. It could be that the PT submitted a combination that BCBS does not accept (""you can't do that treatment for that diagnosis"").

Exclusions are super frustrating and it's *really* tough to fight them, because there isn't a ""reason"" for it-- it's just the restrictions of the plan. It's also probably important to understand that this is not the *insurance company* creating the exclusion, it's the *plan your employer selected*. If you were on a different plan, BCBS would approve it.

I'm a speech therapist who submits to BCBS and run into this issue all the time. I've learned that you should NEVER assume that any particular treatment/diagnosis is covered without verifying your plan details first. Some of my BCBS patients are covered for stuttering, for example, and others are not. It all depends on what BCBS plan the employer selected.","1398903054"

a) sounds like you're trying to promote psychedelics, which I have no problem with, but depending on context makes the theory look like an excuse.

b) Could largely be due to cultural conditioning or other factors that don't pertain to the ancestor-species the theory is about.

Sure, it's not ""outlandish because of drugs"" but it's not at all clear that it's ""dismissed because of drugs"" either

Also, your rush to ""you're as close-minded as my religious relatives"" bit indicates you are much more fervent than you want to let on.  There is nothing to justify this fervor other than your personal attachment to psychedelics.

The rules don't state you have to use the glitch for profit. It says that if you find a bug, report it, or you will be punished. You can't be punished for accidentally using a bug.

I'm honestly confused, what exactly did you expect to happen you when you openly exploited a no-clip glitch on a *JMods stream*?

That's purely idiotic, the ban is well deserved. 

Edit: So according to OP, they've done this kind of thing before. If I remember correctly, didn't that cause a crap lot of chaos and they've now made it so if you get into that room you get auto-teleported out? 

Even more, they've done this MULTIPLE times and you're STILL confused as to why they've been banned?

Edit 2: Because they've done this multiple times, they've probably racked up black marks on their accounts. Once you hit a certain number of black marks, you're banned. So yeah, that's probably why they were banned. Not because they did it once, but because they are **know glitchers** and have been caught **multiple times**.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I didn't really read your post but I'll simply comment on social media and online dating and leave everything else out.

**Social media and online dating are like hyperized versions of real dating**. Average guys are even more invisible. Women get even more validation than usual. Women are far more selective. The top 10% of males get even more attention while the rest may as well not exist.

We see it with online dating all the time. Chubby and overweight chicks that are 5'2"" demanding that only 6'0 white guys with cars and apartments send messages. And the sad part is they're getting more than enough attention from males from their facebook and online dating profile and real life to be this selective. 

The average guy doesn't stand a chance in today's dating scene without excellent logistics if he chooses to do the night game route, or unless he simply approaches tens of women every week. Like 15+. Luckily in real life it's easier to get women into you because many guys don't approach women seriously without the safety of a computer screen.

Unfortunately (or fortunately for some) **you have to move fast in today's dating scene**. The days of courting a woman for several dates are gone. If you haven't smashed by the 2nd date she's probably got 4 other guys waiting to take her out. Even if you think a date went well and you even kissed her or made out with her, chances are she still will flake on you the following week if she thinks she has better options (which if she's attractive, she does). That girl you took out for dinner or coffee and ended the night with a tender kiss with, may have went inside her apartment, hopped on tinder, and got fucked by some alpha dick. Meanwhile you're confused when she flakes on you or tells you she just wants to be friends the next time you ask her out.

When we start getting virtual reality porn and sex robots, I don't think things will change. The only guys who will resort to them (since there will be social stigma) will be the bottom 20% who wouldn't be getting laid anyway. **The middle 60% will continue to fight for the scraps that the top 20% are enjoying**. 

Since the rise of the internet and 'hook up culture', dating has become more difficult for the average guy, impossible for the low tier guy, and amazing for the top tier guy. There is very little level ground anymore. You either play to win or you watch from the sidelines as higher value males, who were probably just born with better genetics than you, fuck all the girls who friendzoned you.

Some males will accept this and some will fight against it by spending months in the gym, working on their careers/businesses, tightening their wardrobe and personal style, improving their social freedom and ability to talk to women, and making an effort to stand out from the rest so they too can play the game to win instead of watching everyone else succeed.

Such is life.","1398903060"

My favorite gels are Aussie Instant Freeze(antihumectant- great for porous types that frizz easily), Kinky Curly Curling Custard(expensive but SOOOO worth it), and LA Looks Sport Gel(super cheap and works great!).   If you're wanting less poof, I think the LA Looks sport gel will help weigh your hair down a bit more.

We broken up for reasons that had nothing to do with her being single parent, and do this day I am still somewhat of a godfather to the daughter.

The takeaway I got from the experience is there are good people and there are bad people, parents or otherwise.  Bad people tend to have bad kids and that in a dating context would be awful.  But dating a bad person who is also childless sounds pretty awful too.  To pass up on a great woman who also happens to have a child is a mistake I will never make again.  Sure there are sacrifices, but you just sacrifice certain experiences for different ones, sometimes better ones.

I don't see people who won't date a single parent as monsters or bad people, but I do see them as people that are potentially missing out on something great because of some social stigma.","1398903068"

Hardcore mode makes the game more challenging in some parts, but if you liked immersion in Fallout 3, then Hardcore mode in New Vegas will be perfect for you.

Then he went on to reveal (in 2009's *Super Exciting Guide: Character Volume*) the character's real name:

&gt;**By the way, what’s Satan’s real name?**
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Satan is a ring name; his real name is different. Mr. Satan’s real name is “Mark”. (It’s an anagram of “akuma” [""demon""/""devil""].) In the area where Satan lives, names are not separated into surnames and given names, so his name is just Mark. His daughter Videl is not a ring name, but her real name. It’s an anagram of “devil”.

I have many black friends who do not find the term offensive, but others believe it points out a racial difference which we need to be rid of in order to obtain ""true equality"". One of my friends actually said he finds ""African American"" offensive. If Euro-Americans are referred to as white, Asian Americans as Asians, Indian Americans as Indians, then why can't he just be referred to as black, instead of putting such a detached label on his race?","1398903076"

Wow, you're coming off as a little bit of a button-pusher.

So the guy works his job or whatever, comes home, checks his voicemail in comfort after busting his balls all day to pay rent. He's sitting in his inner sanctum where no negativity could or should be able to reach him, or any man. 

Then boom, dead kid news, not even spoken but recorded and left...

If it's a conversation, at least you can offer support and an angle on things, and have a two way exchange and hear the emotions of the other person in their tone of voice. 

Instead you sent him a message out of the blue from an EX, telling him of a DEATH of a KID, that's going to bum anyone out.

No offence here, but it sounds like he wasn't a problem at all.

Sounds like the guy had depression and you left him a ticking downer-bomb.


""he didn't even ask about my sister"" - You didn't give him a chance to, you left a message instead of having a proper conversation.

Sounds like you're emotionally a little high strung and crave attention, but shy away from actual interaction with him for fear of ex-awkwardness.


To be honest, it's not even a bad story, he didn't wrong you at all, he just gave you a dispreferred reaction to what you had anticipated.

It was so bad, that it forced Apple to code Safari, since the only other browser was Netcape (that had recently migrated to the primitive Seamonkey code base) that was slow as molasses to both load and render. And there was also a Seamonkey offshoot called Camino, but it still lacked many features.

"networking","t5_2qkaf","Took me a while to understand what you meant by ""the laptop gets an address in that subnet when one of the ""WAN"" lines is moved to that port"", but I finally realized you meant when he would move one of the cables connecting router to switch, because the switch is spitting out all networks out of all ports (potentially.  It's a little funny to think that this setup wouldn't even really cause issues as each network only has 2 total devices in it, and everything is basically MAC1-&gt;MAC2 as far as the switch is concerned), including the address given to the NIC by the host OS.

With that said, OP could probably get rid of the switch and use IP address aliases on a single router interface (aka the interface listens and replies with different addresses on a single interface.  Aliases are also known as virtual interfaces), but I'm more familiar with standard Linux than PFsense, so I'm not sure if PFsense will allow aliases on interfaces.","1398903082"

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","I'm not saying it will prevent people in every or even most cases from driving drunk. What I am offering is a non-governmental way of attempting to curb drunk driving, through raising awareness, and withdrawing from associations from those who do drive drunk. More than likely, the actual method of transportation needs to change to some degree to be more safety-protective. Cars are built rather shittily today because it saves money and capitalists gonna capitalize. 

Ultimately, I'm more content with a chaotic freedom than an ordered government in *any* respect, and I see few other ways to deal with the ""drunk driving problem."" You have no obligation to be on the road, and while we all enjoy the road, it's naturally dangerous. People are dangerous. I'm not justifying drunk driving on the basis that just going out and driving is a risk, but I am saying it's a reality in any system that doesn't force the entire population to blow into a steering wheel breathalyzer. I also think that Capitalism may be a rather big cause of many drunk driving incidents. Most drunk driving incidents are caused by working class citizens who drink away their troubles (at least from what I've seen) and are too poor to arrange a cab for a drive home. This doesn't eliminate the entire problem, but it's fairly clear that by eliminating the state-capitalist system, we *will* eliminate at least *some* of the drunk driving that occurs.","1398903082"

So the same people who think big pharma is trying to kill them are telling you to buy products from an industry that doesn't really seem to care if the products work or if they are safe.

"UCSantaBarbara","t5_2shs9","Experiences with death pertaining to myself:

- Stood over an overpass for half an hour deciding whether or not to throw myself over. As someone that **was** severely depressed/suicidal for a while, every day is just a question of whether or not life is worth living. Life is a lot more meaningful since then.
- Accidentally got some concentrated potassium chloride into a cut during chem lab, while I was rinsing it out with water, was really contemplating what would happen if I died right then and there (potassium chloride stops your heart). I am obviously okay now.
- Had a really high, untreated fever when I was younger. I remember having an out of body experience where I could actually see myself. This was when I was 8 or so, and I remember hearing my parents talking about it one night privately (it was obviously something that concerned then). I didn't have any fever reducing medication because my parents were away and my grandfather didn't want to give me anything until my grandmother came back. 
- Spearfishing in high surf conditions. I didn't expect the waves to be so big, and I got pushed by the currents into a really shallow area that was full of coral and fucking infested with really sharp sea urchins. I was thrown around like a rag doll onto the coral and even worried that I would be thrown onto my pole spear. I'm not religious but I prayed to ""a god"" to help me get out of there, and that I would personally ensure that I got my ass out of there ASAP for my family and girlfriend. ""Do it for them""
- Experiences with heavy drinking. I drank rather heavily, and like mayn others, began vomiting. I probably wasn't anywhere near death, but I definitely felt horrible and, as an intrinsically paranoid person, worried I would die with my face in a pool of vomit in the sink. 
- Was trimming coconut trees with the grandfather. We didn't have super great equipment and thus we fashioned a pole-saw by literally attaching a chainsaw onto a long, metal rod. The thing was heavy and there weren't really any safety features. Grandfather fell off ladder because the thing was too heavy, and the chainsaw landed right....in the ground near him. You ever see something like a blade go right into the ground next to someone, like in the movies? Pretty sure my heart stopped momentarily.
- Another time during diving, the waves weren't too big but the current was a little tougher to swim in. My diving partner noticed that there was a tiger shark following us, so that combined with barely being able to move around made shit pretty scary pretty fast. We dropped our bag with tako/octopus and got out of there with our spears always pointed in its direction. 
- I was walking with a friend to his house and a guy came up to us with a knife. We were two relatively scrawny asian kids and this guy was a pretty ripped dude, with a knife. He ended up taking our valubles, and I held back my friend from trying anything. Yes, it was a 2v1 my friend, but he has a knife and we are scrawny asian kids. Just give him the stuff.
- I've had a few too many close encounters with cars. Haven't been hit yet, fortunately. 
- Was walking with some friends in middle school on a wall that had a ~30 ft drop down onto concrete. Was pretty paranoid about slipping. Friend nearly slipped, but everything turned out alright.
- Grandfather died from a multitude of things, slowly saw him progress into a more vegetative state. It was a long process and he suffered. 
- Other grandfather was in hospital due to some internal bleeding that he didn't get taken care of (+ he was on blood thinners). I was young at the time and was not at all comfortable with the idea of death. He was in pain and young me couldn't stand to see him in such a state. 

Death. It's something that's inevitable, and something that has been made a ""real, true possibility"" for me. I'm learning how to accept it, and hope to someday have the time to study Bushido (""Bushido, a modern term rather than a historical one, originates from the samurai moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor unto death""). As someone planning on going into the medical field, death will be a part of my every day life, and something that I will have to deal with very soon as my grandparents slowly lose their grasp on life. I cannot say that I am fully capable of accepting it now, but I do try to live each day gladly and as though it were my last. I've come to realize that life is a gift that many of us have taken for granted, and many others truly know what its like to have it taken from us.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","&gt; But is preaching the gospel like it's some message of terror and fear really going to help.

I think this video is preaching to Christians, encouraging them to look at their lives and relationship with God.  I don't think it's to the unbelievers/unsaved.  Somebody told me once to stop making salvation so complicated, and for awhile I passed that sentiment on to others.  Now I wish I could take it back because, while it might not be complicated, it is an awakening, it's enlightenment, it's repentance, it's regret, it's so much more than a simple prayer, *then* it's salvation by acceptance of Jesus Christ.

So while no, I wouldn't use this to share the gospel, I do think every Christian needs to see it.  *They*/*we* are the ones who already know that the fear of Hell isn't fire and brimstone, but the absence of God.

As far as ranting, I'm glad you did.  You make many valid points about not using this to spread the Gospel.

It's literally a repeat of TvC Giants. Everyone wanted to ban them. Even jwong.

No, I *could* afford a ""better"" apartment, but for that price, I could buy a house. Didn't see the point of paying some other dude's mortgage any longer. Landlord's property value doubled during the time I lived in my old spot-- and all I had to show for myself was a good reference.

&gt;If your credit isn't shit a security deposit usually isn't more than $500.

Not from what I've seen. Plenty of ads asking for an arm and a leg. We figured it would take at least $3k upfront to get us into a new apartment in a farther-out neighborhood that cost more per month. Fuck that.

&gt;To compare a pet deposit to something like a sewage or foundation issue is comparing apples to oranges. 

If the comparison is bad, so be it-- it's yours. Home inspectors, bro, heard of them? Is there risk in owning... anything? Sure. If I have to make a big repair out-of-pocket in the future, so be it. I'll survive somehow. That's adulthood, pal, nobody said it was going to be a piece of cake.

It's pretty unlikely, though. Even if Jake is on fire and the team is really winning by about the halfway point in the season, they're still going to want to see him play all 16 games before they even consider working out a second deal, given his history. Plus there's the fact that Whisenhunt is playing things pretty close to the chest with regards to his true feelings about Locker. He may really be interested in using this year as a trial run to test the viability of a long-tem deal, or he may not be interested in Locker being his long-term QB at all.

From my 8051 experience, to get a PC-AT type COM/serial port to play nice with a three-wire connection (TxD, RxD, GND) you need to short together the DE-9's pins 1, 4, 6 and 8. That connects together signals DCD, DTR, DSR and CTS (from my brief notes it's not stated which of those is the driving pin, but it's driven by the PC) so that the host PC drives its own ready-lines, enabling itself, when it's plugged into that DE-9 on that little board. Without that, the PC ignores anything happening on the TxD (its RxD) side.","1398903095"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I must honestly say that the friendships I forged in high school have become the most meaningless, useless relationships I've ever experienced and I have never been happier to lose touch with such a vapid and idiotic group of people.

When I run into these people at Costco or Target or get emailed their goings on from Facebook, I am so glad I care about exactly none of their lives. And the only person who did really grow and change as an individual from the time I knew him into someone who I think I would like and respect as a person, rather wisely deleted his Facebook account after it became ""a problem"" that cute teenage girls from the high school he taught at kept sending ""Cool Mr. Eric"" increasingly inappropriate private messages. 

Perhaps it would be different if I too grew into a small minded rural uniformed God-fearing Fox News viewer. But I just didn't. Hell, even the one very interesting activist lesbian I knew is now just another soccer mom with kids driving a Honda... albeit with a little rainbow strip above the license plate.

Let's face it - when you're out of the microcosm that is high school and you meet interesting and different people in college and at work and at your kid's school and at your gym and wherever, and you realize that you no longer have anything in common with them except for the fact that for four whole years you and like 30 (60, 100, whatever) people all stared in the same direction at the same time listening to the same droning bullshit for 7 hours a day, there's just no reason to keep in contact with these people.

Basically everything in Catholicism is just a carbon copy of Paganism, but with a Christian themed overlay. Paul made tents, Peter was a fisherman, everyone did the Christian thing alongside their normal jobs. That way there is no need to pay for the Pope's private Jet.

""Order! Order! The council meeting of this, the 22nd year on the 4th month and 23rd day will come to order!""

The other organs settled down, and the room became quiet.

""Now, let's keep this meeting short if possible,"" The Brain began ""The nervous system has already reported a severe headache, and the stomach has reported that the entire digestive tract is in an uproar.""

""I might be able to shed some light on that"" The Tongue interjected ""Last evening I did report a massive amount of beer, rum, and tequila passing through my jurisdiction.""

The Brain considered this ""Yes, I recall the decision by The Host to consume a copious amount of drink this past night. It seems it has caused some damage. Liver, how is the cleanup going?""

The Liver staggered as it stood up, it was obviously tired and worn out. ""Your Highness, cleanup and de-tox is a slow effort. I  cannot keep up with the demands of The Host any longer. My facilities are getting old, damaged, and rebuilding them seems nigh impossible.""

The Brain sighed. ""Yes, I am sorry about that. But after thirty years if looking after The Host's interests and repairing the damage caused by The Host's bad habits, our resources are growing thin. I fear we will not be able to cope for much longer...""

The last statement caused a small uproar, many organs cried out in dismay.
""You are The Brain!"" One of The Kidneys cried ""Make the Host take it easy on us, we cannot take this abuse for much longer!""

The Brain sighed in resignation. ""I...I have tried. "" it began. ""But The Host...The Host has needs that go beyond just thought. The Host is...angry. And this anger is pervasive, going beyond just me. Im sure you all have felt it at some point. It is spreading though us all, affecting us all, and it defies everything that we know.""

The stomach murmured in agreement ""I have not been able to process much food, all of my subordinates are just too...tired. We lack strength of late to do our normal jobs. It seems all we are able to process is alcohol of late""

The Brain was silent, while courtroom muttered irritably. 

""What will we do about this?"" demanded The Liver ""I cannot continue to handle alcohol influxes of this level without a transfer of strength.""

The Brain considered this for a long while, before eventually sighing in defeat. ""At this point, there is nothing we can do."" The Brain said ""The Host is making illogical choices, acting without consulting me beforehand. As long as this continues, all we can do is buckle down and weather the storm.""

The room erupted in a cacophony of protests. The Liver and both Kidneys were screaming their disapproval of The Brain's decision, and The Stomach the the rest of the Digestive area were muttering and planning for another night of severe alcohol consumption.

The Brain sighed wearily as it dismounted the podium.

1: The guy is really good and has a 70%+ winrate
2: People don't play as much, and do only a arena once every 2-3 days, and still get the quests.

While the 2nd objective is easily reachable, the 1st one also isn't impossible.

I have 1600 arena wins, and only ever paid for one because I wanted Gelbin :&gt;. You can watch streams of Trump/Hafu/Kripp and see how they play, and just try to make the same decisions as that they do. 

Assuming that, you should at least get a 60% winrate (because there are just a lot of casual players out there), and combined with your quests, it should be enough to play arena on a daily basis.

Less tax equals more money in peoples pockets which they will spend. This creates growth which increases employment and thus lowers the welfare bill. Tax is still recouped through VAT, fuel duty etc

"rage","t5_2qil2","I'm not sure where you're from but in the UK it started out in the 19th century with the suffragist movement wanting gender equality, specifically the vote for women, and the suffragettes were the radical feminists of their day. Feminisms early roots was fundamentally to be equal to men through the advancement of rights, not to advance women's rights without regard for gender equality. It was to have equal rights to men, ie. equality. Tumblr warrior are now just a slang term for radical feminists I think, but the point is that moderate normal feminists ought not let radicals swing the name of the movement into something easily derided as radical. Radical feminists by alienating the term feminism damage the goal of gender equality. I still think most people see feminism as gender equality, not as radical feminists. As I've said elsewhere in this thread, the majority of people I know are feminists and nobody is radical, or sees ""feminism"" as anything other than meaning gender equality.","1398903122"

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","Not only that, but they've been thematically similar, or as Lucas once put it, ""they rhyme.""

- The first title refers to a general feeling of the state of the galaxy.  ""The Phantom Menace"" - there's something evil out there. ""A New Hope"" - the tide of war may be turning.  

- The second describes a definite action: ""Attack Of The Clones"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" indicate a ramping up of the action.

- The third shows one of the factions triumphant.  In ""Revenge Of The Sith,"" Darth Sidious assumes power over the Galaxy, while in ""Return Of The Jedi"" he is vanquished by good.  Also, both start with ""re,"" which may or may not be significant.

So based on those (and if Abrams chooses to follow the pattern), it may be possible to divine *potential* titles.

Episode 7: You had danger, then hope, then what?  Victory?  Another turning point?  It'll be something short and punchy, setting up the tone of the story.  

Episode 8: Something indicating decisive action by the adversary.  Possibly something to do with war.

Episode 9: ""Re-something of the something.""  The old-school geek in me really wants it to be ""Revelation Of The [Whills](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Journal_of_the_Whills),"" but I doubt it. 

So, based on that pattern, any other guesses?","1398903122"

First, yes, you call some bribed politicans. Then you write letters. Then you sign petitions. Then you find all of that shit is ignored, and start to work on another angle or vector. In the workplaces, it could be calling for unionization or strikes, or in the consumer market - boycotts.

But I doubt boycotts would work well with these sorts of Internet Services. Even 1 day gas boycotts are pretty meaningless, so you'd have to think about a flat out disconnect-from-internet boycott (LOL, fat chance) or some sort of way to hit telecoms and politicans, through maybe some sort of mass DDOS attack (still, not likely) or some other creative way online of hitting them in the wallet.

For eg. all the Socialist and Communist parties in Ireland are Nationalist but it's not ethnically driven, it's the drive for a united 32-country Republic, but it is Nationalist nonetheless.

&gt; Terror and exultation - the passions of a child. ""The t-trees, Pragma,"" he stammered. ""They war for ... for *space*.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Indeed,"" Pragma Uän replied, his manner devoid of anything save confirmation. ""And this, children, is what I shall teach you. How to be a tree. How to war for space ...""
&gt; 
&gt; ""But trees don't move,"" another said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""They move,"" the Pragma replied, ""but they are slow. A tree's heart beats but once every spring, so it must war in all directions at once. It must branch and branch until it obscures the sky. But you, your hearts beat many, many times, you need only war in one direction at a time. This is how men seize space.""
&gt; 
&gt; As old as he was, the Pragma seemed to pop to his feet. He brandished a stick.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Come,"" he said, ""all of you. Try to touch my knees.""
&gt; 
&gt; And Kellhus rushed with the others trough the dappled sunlight. He squealed with frustration and delight each time the stick thwacked or poked him back. He watched in wonder as the old man danced and swirled, sent children flopping into their rumps or rolling like badgers through the leaves. Not one touched his legs. Not one so much as stepped into the circle described by his stick.
&gt; 
&gt; Pragma Uän had been a triumphant tree. The absolute owner of one space.
&gt; 
&gt; Wrapped in tattered brown cloth, bearing shields of lacquered camel hides, the Khirgwi beat their lurching camels forward, brandished their wild scimitars. The air screamed with their ululations. 
&gt; 
&gt; Kellhus raised his Dunyain steel.
&gt; 
&gt; They laughed and sneered. Desert dark faces, so certain...
&gt; 
&gt; They came galloping toward the circle described by his sword.

I'm pre HRT and she's over a year on hormones, so we had the opportunity to, basically, exchange most of the clothes of our closets. I gave her my old bikinies, she was really reluctant about trying it for the first time but I encouraged them, and she looked BEAUTIFUL.

You can see kind of a bulge, but it's little (HRT, specially antiandrogens, make your genitals shrink down) and even when she MAY looks suspicious to someone that doesn't know her, she still looks beautiful (and she isn't ashamed of being trans) and seemed WAY more confident while she looked at her body in the bikini every minute (We weren't in a pool, we where in my room, it's starting to be cold here in Argentina). It seemed like that helped her to be more confident.

A little practical advice! Make sure the bottom of the bikini is not thin, try to get some with a wider bottom, so her scotum doesn't get off the bikini while she's swimming.","1398903129"

I also understand that just because I SHOULD be able to go wherever I want, while presenting myself however I want, without fear of physical violence, doesn't mean that I CAN. If a trans person thinks it's a good idea to go to a honky tonk in the deep South, then they are stupid. If someone were to walk around Compton wearing a shirt that says ""I hate niggers"" they should not be surprised when they suddenly find it's a very difficult task to keep all of their blood inside of their bodies.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","&gt; Which is why we have standards we should meet. It takes all the other aspects you want to hang your hat on out of the picture. If a students meets standards they move on. If they don't, they need remediation.

Remediation doesn't have to mean failing the grade. In my district, students who fail the literacy or math standardized tests receive remediation instead of some of/all of (depending on the deficiency) elective courses and also are sometimes mandated to attend additional summer school. 

&gt; There are basic skills the states have decided every student needs to master. If you let every special snowflake decide - in 6th grade - to express themselves how they want, then we've reached the peak of American society. They all want to be video game testers.

I'm not suggesting we let them choose. I'm suggesting we treat formative and summative data from the classrooms as more valuable than a single standardized test. I don't think removing all resources the way standardized tests do serves us well in determining real skills. I also think standardized tests are more a money grab than a way to really determine mastery of standards. 

I also think there are many groups of students who deserve flexible time in attaining standards, outside of the regular school year, without fully failing the grade. An ESOL student, for instance, who recently moved here. Or a student who had a transient living situation and fell behind but tries to catch up. There are a lot of situations, many of them not easy to place into boxes. My job is to help kids, and holding a kid back a grade might be a way to help them, but not in every situation where the kid fails the state test (or most, frankly).

&gt; I want kids and teachers to meet standards. That's hostile?

No, your statement that middle school teaching is coloring and not thinking skills is hostile, and your tone towards your experience with students suggests you had a dislike of not only your CT but the students in your CT's class in several of the comments. Your tone is almost consistently hostile.

&gt; In rebuttal, you've tried to explain the subtle nuances in the amount of time required to color a poster, shifted the discussion of failure to meet standards to a more comfortable one of why testing is not an accurate measurement of all facets of student growth.

Yes, I tried to provide you with a variety of perspectives. It's clear you think you know everything, as a student teacher. Your CT and any teacher online who disagrees with you is simply an idiot, I guess. That's generally the mark of a successful new teacher, so good luck with that. At any rate, it's time for me to move on with my evening, so this will be my last reply to you. ","1398903130"

&gt;The __Shire horse__ is a breed of [draught horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_horse) ([BrE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English)) or [draft horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_horse) ([AmE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English)). The breed comes in many [colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_coat_color), including [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_(horse\)), [bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse\)) and [grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(horse\)). They are a tall breed, with [mares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare) standing 16 [hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_(length\)) (64 inches, 163 cm) and over and [stallions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion) standing 17 [hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_(length\)) (68 inches, 173 cm) and over. The breed has an enormous capacity for weight pulling, and Shires have held the world records for both largest overall horse and tallest horse at various times. Throughout its history, the breed has been popular for pulling [brewery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewery) wagons delivering [ale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale) to customers. This practice continues today, with the breed also being used for forestry, leisure and promotional pursuits.

This isnt my opinion. this is based off of the principals of neuropsychopharmacology.  Also, it depends of how you define 'potent'.  if you want to define potency as how much it effects the biochemistry in the brain, then MDMA is more potent.","1398903132"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Private music teacher. Could be better, could be worse. 

Better: It generally involves something I like (music), I'm good at it and I like the compliments about being good at it. It can be very enjoyable when you get a student you can talk and share the stuff you're interested in with. $50/hour is nothing to scoff at.

Worse: Teaching the basics to a 6yo for the nth time is tedious and tiring. You know that wonderful, fulfilling feeling teachers get form seeing their students progress and achieve? Yeah, I don't get that. It's lonely and you don't meet anyone your own age, including women (there was that one cute mother who was in the middle of a divorce and was interested but I didn't see it at the time...damn). You also get tired of being seen as a second-class person, teaching the kids of the upper class, you feel they see you more like their illegal gardiners than their peers.

Also, that $50/hour doesn't factor in travel time, expenses, taxes, health insurance, etc. And the money is not assured...90% of your students might decide to take the summer off, and some of those won't return your calls in the fall. Since the economy went bad, lack of students means I didn't crack 25k these past couple years, and out of necessity still live at home. 

And even if it gets better, what am I looking at at best? No future here, that's why I'm going back to school.","1398903133"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","Personally I'm far more excited for Sunset Overdrive. It sounds like the weapon customization and multiplayer combat is similar but Insomniac has made some of my favorite games of all time. 

I literally bought a PS3 just to play Ratchet and Clank Future. Resistance 2 had some amazing multiplayer (it was basically FUSE except not shit) and Resistance 3 had amazing weapons and bosses. 

Resistance 2's multiplayer had 3 classes, Soldier, medic and special ops. The soldier was the tank type, medic is self explanatory and specOps was the DPS. You fought hordes of enemies and bosses. So yeah, outside of the Diablo style loot system of Destiny, it was pretty much the same mechanisms. 

Plus from the limited information, they're talking about wallrunning, ziplines etc. which Insomniac has been pretty phenomenal at. Honestly it sounds like they're basically putting R&amp;C type craziness into Titanfall, if the game lives up to their previous benchmarks it's going to be amazing. ","1398903133"

Perhaps I should just chalk it up to never playing a game with a laddering system before.

I would really love to have these people who get disadvantaged by me having high lag instead of me becoming a free target one of these days. It'll make me want to rage against my ISP a bit less...

EDIT: Just got off a high lag match, everybody kept managing to kill me when it looked like when I was in the clear, managed to get a total of one kill I would say the other player was fucked over my lag.

The SNAP website (http://www.snap.org.nz) allows you to enter and maintain details of all of your important possessions or assets. You can then access this asset list from anywhere, anytime.

I really feel so, so so guilty! Even still! I wish I could apologize to everybody! But okay. Thanks for understanding. Thank you for your advice and your sympathy. This helps.

&gt;I did something similar when I felt guilty of something that I did and it helped me a lot. Just forgiving myself in my mind and heart let me drop 1000 kgs stone that I had in my soul. and I moved on.

How easy was it for you to relieve the guilt? Do you just not think of those you hurt?","1398903138"
"Judaism","t5_2qi67","&gt; The point I was trying to make though, in what I said in my original post, was that it's not especially logical for us, and it isn't in our best interests, to be racist.

I'm not sure I'd agree. When you're talking about systemic racism, people directly benefit from that, and Jews are no different in that regard. But that's only part of the picture. It's important to understand how Jews have benefited from white privilege in America. But it's also important to understand that this is only part of the picture. A lot of racism, especially racism that's subtler than Sterling's isn't a matter of choice, of navigating the politics of power. I'd suggest reading the tolerance.org page on [hidden bias](http://www.tolerance.org/activity/test-yourself-hidden-bias) and taking some of the Harvard implicit association tests.  

Also, remember, racism isn't just an issue of how the Jewish people relate to the outside world, it's an issue within the Jewish community. There are black Jews, and Jews do not have a great track record of being good to black Jews. Again, something you see blatantly stated in Sterling's remarks, but it's something that isn't really talked about in the Jewish community.

The way to not be racist is to become aware of your hidden biases, to become aware of systemic inequality and attack both. Check yourself and fight against that impulse and to raise your voice against an unfair system, even though it's not unfair to you. And that's something that you can incorporate into your religious practice. 

You said it yourself:

&gt;...the Jewish spirit of solidarity with those who suffer and behaving rightly even in the face of oppression. 

That spirit of solidarity, and the focus of facing oppression makes Judaism a religion in which it's very possible to incorporate activism and education about modern oppression into your religious practices. I mean, Passover is quite literally a holiday where you sit around a table and talk about oppression and the fight against it. Where you tell the story of an escape from slavery and oppression. You can easily incorporate stories of modern oppression well, or use examples of modern laws and stories to draw the parallels to today. It doesn't have to be a night only of stories of Jewish oppression. It is possible to within that frame to acknowledge the position of power and privilege that many Jews are in today, and the current evils in the world that still must be fought.  

There was an [excellent comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/228q6m/how_can_i_make_my_family_seder_more_inclusive_for/cgkx41h) a while back on the variety of ways you can adjust a Seder to be friendlier to women and LGBT, showing just how varied Seders can be. I actually read one of the haggadot on the list, the Velveteen Rabbi's haggadah, and I thought that it it's approach to some of these things was very cleverly done.  

You're already doing to first part, you're aware of the issue and actively looking to combat it. How you choose to confront it is up to you. I personally like to be well enough educated about systemic inequalities and racism that I feel comfortable challenging someone's racist assumptions. But you can also incorporate stories of modern oppression into religious practices, education and discussion. You can become more politically active. Politics and religion have a huge intersection, and you could push your synagogue to become more involved with and informed about issues affecting your neighbours. There are as many ways to confront and fight racism as there are long and nasty tentacles of racism. ","1398903138"

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","Third-degree assault AND second-degree kidnapping.

He didn't report himself -- there was a warrant out for his arrest, and he turned himself in that morning. Which, guilty or no, is the smart thing to do, especially as a prominent public figure. He's got plenty of money and can afford good lawyers, so it would be easier for him to face this head-on than try to run from it.

That being said, I'm not convinced that Varlamov is innocent. I know, I know, he's ""innocent until proven guilty,"" but that refers to the due process of the law. It doesn't mean that it's absurd to believe Evgenia's (the girlfriend) story that he did in fact physically and verbally assault her. There's no really logical reason for her to have made this up. You could try to argue that she was ""in it for the money,"" but if he WEREN'T abusing her, it would be stupid to make it up -- she'd ""have more money"" if she stayed with him. And more fame, too, seeing as Varlamov was one of the main goalies for team Russia heading into the Sochi Olympics and is one of the heroes of the Colorado Avalanche this season. 

It happens too often that people charged with domestic abuse are given the benefit of the doubt when the same courtesy is not shown to the victim. Charges were dropped, yes, but [this was due to additional interviews with the witness](http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/10173198/semyon-varlamov-colorado-avalanche-charges-dropped), which honestly, to me, sound like she was offered hush money. Either that, or there were translation errors. Or there simply WASN'T enough evidence, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Given the circumstances, I'm more inclined to believe Evgenia. The legal system isn't perfect -- O.J. Simpson was acquitted, but do any of us *really* believe that he was innocent?","1398903138"

&gt;When genetic modifications at conception become available and there are no 'ugly' people like there are today, and everyone is attractive.

Interesting.

&gt; do you think there will still be a stratification of SMV(in favor of women in their 20s and men in their &gt;30s)  


Yes. In your suggested reality women in their 20's will still be more desirable due to successful child birth being positively correlated with youth. As their youth fades, this still would based on your premise.

Never forget, beauty at its is merely a means to detect female reproductive potential.

In regards to men this depends on the economic system in place. Assuming it is still capitalism, yes. The odds of having several resources would still be skewed towards those who have spent longer accumulating those resources.

&gt;and Women will simply raise their alpha-standard to ridiculous extremes? Or will the SMV of men and women equal out?

Any ""alpha standard"" will not be fixed by genetic engineering. There will be competition. Those who have succeeded or are likely to succeed more than others in the competition for resources will still be ""alpha"".

The SMV of women and men cannot equal out by only changing a surface value(beauty) that is not the primary determinant of determinant of both sexes reproductive success.   

  

 


Assumed scenario: 

&gt;I ALSO wonder how realistic sex robots will impact relationships when neither gender needs the other for good sex. 

Even more interesting.

&gt; Will personality matter at that point? Or will the physical desires of the opposite sex become some weird caricature of what they are now?

The satisfaction of sex for men and women will lead to a decrease in female value. However, these robots based on your premise cannot reproductive, thus human to human sexual interaction will still be selected for. Therefore personality will still matter in making that pairing and their raising of offspring a success.

2) resolution - I would be satisfied with just big Windows desktop all around me. But we don't have resolution for that. And again it takes a long time or different VR principle then OR uses to make resolution at least 20"" monitor quality (it's equivalent to 8K OR display given current lenses).

3) limited use - while it sounds great in imaginations ask yourself. Would you just give up RL sight (inability to drink, respond to colleagues, family, writing notes on paper, etc.), put a gloves (worsen haptic, tightening hand) and limit yourself to specific position (no bed reading, no head lying head on table for a while, a bit clumsy when to put it all off when going to door/phone/restroom or eating) for just nothing really enhancing your real productivity? 

4) paper books are preferred not for the look, but the feel. If you don't need paper book (like me) you use e-ink. That's same relaxing and good for eyes.

Be that as it may...your sex life with him has no future. If you want to continue marching down this path, do so with full understanding and acceptance of this fact.

&gt; But I need to improve our sex life. ...What can I do...

No. The tragic truth is that there is nothing you can do. This is important enough that it bears repeating. There is nothing **you** can do. He would have to change - and the decision to do so would have to be his. He would have to make the conscious effort to do so. He would have to want to change. You can help him, support him, but the effort is his to make. Now consider this...

&gt; Since the beginning of our relationship I have always been willing and enjoying pleasuring him. I give him blowjobs, hand jobs, the whole works. ...Sex is always about him finishing

Think about it from his perspective. He's probably happy with 1x a week, and he has a girlfriend who bends over backwards to make sure he enjoys it. He's sitting pretty. In this state why would he ever want to change? This isn't a hypothetical question, I want you to sit down and really think about it. 

Change is possible...but highly unlikely. Again, there is nothing **you** can do to change him. You may not want to hear it, but if you ever want to have a fulfilling sex life, chances are it will not be with him.","1398903153"

7. You can redeem your points in the store only after earning 100 points. They expire after one year.
8. Its one of the only boxes that is all makeup. Generally the items are of drug store quality (sometimes mid thrown in - very rarely).

This example comes to mind because it happened to us, when she was 2, and there was a car coming fast down our street.  If I hadn't taught her the importance of obedience, she might have disregarded my instruction in the excitement of playing, and the worst might easily have happened that day.  I do give her reasons, in ways &amp; words she can understand, and through that we build *obedience on a foundation of trust.*  There are other things I can't (or won't) go into detail about with her, either.  For example, she knows she is the boss of her body, and that no one can touch her in private areas, but I'm not going to go into details about the dangers of child molesters (or even what that is).

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I don't think playing video games necessarily suggests immaturity, but I do consider playing video games *all the time* to be a sign of immaturity. Adults have lots of shit to do that limits their potential gaming time. You have to work and clean the house at a minimum, and I think it's also important to socialize. People who have partners and/or kids should be spending time with them, which can sometimes involve video games but shouldn't occur only through joint video-gaming sessions. But as long as you're living a balanced life, I don't think there's anything inherently immature about liking video games.

The fact that adults generally have busy lives and responsibilities makes it natural to sometimes lose interest in hobbies that require lots of time investment yet lack a real world pay-off. Some people want to spend their time doing enriching hobbies (I am in this camp and it sounds like you are too), while others prefer hobbies where they can turn off their brains or forget reality (I understand this feeling somewhat). Kids are almost all into instant gratification and usually have similar hobbies, while adults have a much wider range of preferences about how much instant versus delayed gratification they like and about what particular hobbies they're into. This creates the impression that some adults ""grow out of"" their childish hobbies while others don't, but I think it's more that the full range of people's preferences are revealed in adulthood. Some people change a lot and others don't.

Personally, I like games that can be played with others in a social setting (poker, Cards Against Humanity, water polo, etc). I agree with you that it feels like a waste of time to figure out a complicated video game, but I too enjoy books and films. I enjoy simple video games to kill a little bit of time every now and then (like Mario or Tetris or Bejeweled), and I think I would probably like the more complicated ones if I put in the time and effort, but there are other things I would like to use my time and effort for that are higher on my priority list. 

There's no reason why you should feel obligated to continue to like video games. Just because you liked them before doesn't mean you can't be like ""meh, too time-consuming"" about them now. Try some other hobbies and see if you get into them.

The one potential problem I see is if you can't get into *any* hobby or activity at all, and are losing interest in *all* of the things you used to enjoy. If that's happening, it could be related to your insomnia/depression/anxiety, or it could be a sign of an underlying problem that is often co-morbid with those problems like ADD or Cushing Syndrome. Before you go crazy on WebMD, note that IANAD and that you are probably just experiencing a natural evolution of interests as you become an adult. But I thought it was worth noting that if you are experiencing a severe, personally unnerving, or across-the-board change in your level of interest in previous hobbies without a corresponding interest in new things, it might be worth talking to a doc.","1398903154"

"keto","t5_2rske","So I've been fat 2 times in my life and I'm 31.  Once I was depressed because I hated my classmates (5th grade) and the second time eating a ton of processed, fried food my freshmen year of college (35 pounds in 3 months).  Both times I didn't diet (in the deprive yourself sense) to lose weight.

To lose the weight the first time, I switched schools, made friends, and started skipping lunch because I wasn't hungry.  The second time, I went home at the end of the year and ate food my mom cooked.  I lost 15 pounds in 2 months.  I lost the rest a few months back after eating healthier (and yes exercising).

So how did Freelee lose weight on high carb?

  1) She didn't have an underlying metabolic reason to be fat just like me.  She had some bad eating habits, fixed them, and lost weight.

  2) She bikes a LOT

Also, thinness isn't the goal.  Health is.  1.5 years ago, I ate high carb and was a 5'10"" 115 pound male and was eating 3500 calories per day and absorbing about 1/2 of that.  I had almost no body fat and little muscle.  Grass is always greener.  I got up to 150 pounds 6 months ago, but I stopped exercising so much, so I'm 140 again.","1398903154"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I'd look into the LDS [10th Article of Faith](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.10?lang=eng). (""We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory."") This scripture pretty much sums up Mormon Nationalism. They believe that they are establishing the Kingdom of God. Mormons event spend 2 years on a mission, where they build up the kingdom of God. When they come home, they build the Kingdom of God by having large families and by fulfilling church callings.

Also look into the political aspirations of Mormons. The [White Horse Prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Horse_Prophecy) states that ""the United States Constitution will one day 'hang like a thread' and will be saved 'by the efforts of the White Horse.'"" When Mitt Romney ran against President Obama, many conservative Mormons interpreted this prophecy as Obama's tearing up the constitution and Mitt Romney is the White Horse who will save the day. That's partially why Utah reacted so horribly when Mitt Romney lost.","1398903159"

"space","t5_2qh87","&gt; You don't need people to be happy on Mars. You need people to fight for their very lives. Many will die, but the lives of those few are insignificant when compared to our species' future as a spacefaring civilization.

People who colonised places on Earth in the past did so because they were escaping war, religious oppression, their own past, or they hoped to become fabulously wealthy on the back of a gold rush.  Basically, for most of them, they were coming from somewhere really shit and hoping that another land might be a bit better.  Sadly, for most of them in the early days, it just meant an early grave from starvation or disease.

Anyone with the money to go to Mars will have a life of unimaginable comfort and safety back home and absolutely no reason to leave that behind unless they're feeling suicidal.  There is no way that they could find a better life on another planet so you don't have a market of people who have a need or desire to go.

&gt; Mt Everest is Earth, but cold and boring and not helpful to our species at all.

""Cold, boring and not helpful to our species at all"" is just about the perfect way to describe Mars.  People aren't queuing up to live at the top of Everest or the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, or the Atacama desert but all these places are easier to get to, nicer to live in, and capable of supporting far more useful activities than anyone could ever do on Mars.

&gt;Large enough population would take quite a while to grow, but self sufficiency on Mars is possible due to local sources of water and oxygen. To claim otherwise is disingenuous.

Self-sufficiency means being able to produce everything a modern civilisation needs to survive.  That means petrochemicals for plastics and medicines, it means every type of metal, ceramics, computer chips, fuels, batteries, advanced composites, fertilisers, etc, etc.

Creating all those on Earth requires millions if not hundreds of millions of people and a vast array of industries.  A Mars colony couldn't hope to obtain all those things locally unless it had the population and resources of a decent sized country.

Colonising space is nothing like colonising places on Earth.","1398903159"

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","They're pretty niche titles, but they're generally well reviewed because they're just objectively solid games. Thematically they're pretty similar: they generally deal with friendship and relationships, and the mechanics revolve mostly around item collection and synthesis, time management, and light dungeon crawling. They're very... Enthusiastic games, I guess is a good word for it. There's a lot of pretty common tropes found in anime and lighter JRPGs, so if you're not a huge fan of moe girls, sort of creepy guys, and sexual innuendo, you might not like them. But again, objectively they're pretty well designed for what they are: they tend to be pretty beautiful games with good art design, well written characters, good pacing and fun gameplay etc.  At any rate, if you're into that specific brand of JRPGs, they're great games, and the Vita ports are excellent. Adventurer of Arland is a great starting point; Totori is one of the better protagonists in the series, and while there's some references to Rorona, you can jump in without any real knowledge. But really the appeal of the series boils down to personal preference. They're simply endearing games for a lot of reasons, but they seem to resonate with a specific brand of gamer.

The only reason I can think of running him with Siege is for him to sit back and protect Siege from any heavies that get through to him. However Ol' Rowdy does this job better as for just 1 point more you get Grudge, aggressive, and Counter-Charge.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","What data? You haven't presented any. I read plenty of psych books in college, not a single one of them stated that raising children with a healthy respect for authority was detrimental.

I'm not sure where you're getting this ""spineless"" nonsense.

Again, your inexperience is showing. I have raised my kids, taught them to read, paint, ride a bike. I know what they are capable of grasping at their age. Do I explain things if they comprehend it? Well duh, that's part of teaching a child. But a toddler who is still trying to figure out how to not shit themselves on a daily basis will have a pretty hard time understanding the scientific reasoning I have for not wanting them to stick forks in power sockets.

Am I suggesting instilling widespread blind obedience into kids is a good idea? No, it would be moronic to think that. But regarding obedience as a negative trait is equally moronic. This is the real world, with real consequences. And as important as it is for parents to teach their kids kindness, love, and compassion; It is equally important to teach kids that their actions have consequences. ""Because I said so"" is a precursor to ""it's the law."" I don't care if the law is moronic or unjust, your ass will still be locked up in jail. No news scandal, no civil protests on your behalf like so many of you would-be activists seem to dream of. It would you, in a cell, by yourself, thinking ""that law is stupid, but I am more stupid for breaking it.""

But in the end, the entire subject is subjective. People will raise their kids how they wish, and it's really nobody's business to tell them otherwise. If you ever reach the point in your life where somebody can stand your pompous ass long enough to reproduce, by all means, raise your little anarchists however you see fit. In the meantime, jot down a little personal suggestion from me to you:

Go fuck yourself

A while back we put together our new campaign with a three page list of the stuff we wanted to see, do and interact with; medieval society, centralized monotheism, mostly human, racial profiling due to isolationism, powerful but rare magic, and whole bunch of other stuff. Having defined the world, we defined the story: the Prince is betrothed, but to consummate the marriage (and the treaty of peace), he has to perform ten mighty deeds, with his retainers and advisers along for the ride. Then we put together characters based on the logical extrapolations of the world and story: the fighter prince, his rogue buddy, his arcane adviser and the priestess sent to witness and ensure his virtue. Pick up a Bard later to handle the saga-telling, a ranger for the woody running-around-in, and we're set. All because we wanted to tell a story that made sense and would be awesome. ","1398903172"

here's a few tips that have helped me
1. Get into to the mind of a cool Author by reading. The more you read the more you can meditate on what is being said and less you have to worry about thinking about what you need to do
2. Play an instrument with one tone and use your voice to connect with it ( like a gong or drum) just got a buffalo drum and it's sooo much fun to dance around and chant with it
3. (working on this) Basic repetitive physical activities that strengthen your motor skills. At work i throw a ball up in the air from hand to hand
4. Practice glossolalia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iQLfCALknA Try not to think in words but vibration and the present moment
5. Connect with the warmth of living things like people. It's healing and puts you in a meditative state 
6. Write your thoughts and draw!","1398903174"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You have to think of Feral Flare as a bit of a toss-up. Say you are a laner... if you have a Feral Flare jungler, such as a Yi or Nocturne, you will lack jungle pressure early, because both of their early game ganks are mediocre pre-6. However, if you can win lane with a Feral Flare jungler, once your jungler starts getting more involved with the game post-farming, your team is sitting pretty. 

However, if you have an early game jungler, such as a Lee Sin or Kha'zix, you get early jungle pressure, which supposedly should help you win vs. a Feral Flare jungler, IF you play it correctly. However, it's solo queue, and things pretty much never go 100% according to plan.  

I just like the fact that Feral Flare makes more junglers stronger. It's not that Yi or Nocturne (for example again) were unplayable before, it's just that Feral Flare makes them become true carry threats later game.

Like, if 2 lanes lose, 1 wins, and you have a Feral Flare jungler coming out of his jungle with a completed Feral Flare and BotRK, he's still going to be squishy when he dives in, and if the other team utilizes their CC correctly, they should win the fight (barring horrible positional mistakes).

I think the item is pretty balanced overall, it just feels OP when the rest of your team has been losing and you get ulted by Nocturne, your team dies instantly, and you get blown up.","1398903174"

For that to happen, IMO, they'd need to make their own currency separate from bitcoin which makes transactions hard to track through constantly changing hands and possibly also joined transactions, but peer to peer. The method they're using now relies on coinjoin servers, which can most certainly be targeted. Not only that but as others have mentioned, it isn't laundering.

To launder coins you'd need to setup dummy wallets, receive 'illicit' payments with those, then buy products from yourself on the public blockchain from a front you have established (selling stuffed toys or some such thing).

Coin joining just makes the details of a normal transaction uncertain, it isn't laundering.","1398903174"

Sterling was being criticized for a private conversation, which took place in his home, which may have been illegally recorded.  He's the owner.  He has no contractual obligation except in the vaguest sense.

If you say you hate Christians on a Facebook posting, or in a private conversation, and it gets back to your boss, are you saying you only face consequences if you are a spokesperson?  What if your contract specifically has language (and many do) that have morality or behaviour clauses?  What if we take your anti-Christian statement and post it to a Christian website, which then causes a backlash?  Can we fire you then?

What if your homeowner's association agreement has language that says you can be expelled if you violate the community standards of decency, and someone records you making an off-color joke in the privacy of your own home, then makes it public?  Would the HOA have causes to expel you?  You did enter their association voluntarily after all.

"bigdickproblems","t5_2sqd6","You're listening to old lies and taking it for fact. The fact is that the statement regarding the number of nerve endings lost is a lie, because they've never done the actual work. Also, there are tons of nerve endings there that have nothing to do with sexual arousal, so if they include those in the count it's simply false information to inflate a number. I just wish people would stop lying to make one side or the other look *wrong*.

Again, please stop spouting confirmation bias based lies. Here's some mythbusting for you, rooted in facts and science:


*     **Circumcision removes half the penile skin.**
    The amount of skin removed varies from little more than the constricted tip of the foreskin to an amount just slightly longer than the glans. The glans is rarely more than a quarter of the length of the entire infant penis (and proportionately much less in an adult). The lie comes from counting the foreskin length twice ""because it has an inner and outer layer"". This fact is really irrelevant because coverage is only provided once.
      

*     **Circumcision removes hundreds of miles of blood vessels.**
    'Hundreds of miles' is a gross exaggeration which most people can clearly see through but even so, the blood vessels in the foreskin serve only the foreskin itself and hence their removal with the foreskin is of no further consequence. 
      

*     **The foreskin contains specialized nerve endings.**
    All nerves are specialized. There is nothing more or less special about those in the foreskin compared with those elsewhere in the body. The glans also contains nerves which don't usually get fully stimulated when sex is experienced through the foreskin. 
      

*     **Circumcision removes 20,000 nerve endings.**

    This is an outright lie. The figure of 20,000 has been admitted to have been made up by an anti-circumcision activist to make it look as if really serious damage is done by circumcision. There is no scientific evidence that there are even that number of nerve endings in the entire penis.
    Whatever the number, however, the nerves in the foreskin are almost exclusively related to protecting the foreskinitself from harm, just like those elsewhere in the skin. When the foreskin is removed these nerves become irrelevant. 


And here is another well written article pointing out the lack of factual information: http://thecircumcisiondecision.com/20000-nerve-endings/.","1398903180"

If you had boyfriends then by definition men didn't ignore you. This is what OP was trying to say that women don't understand.

Come back and say he's wrong when for years you have NO man attracted to you, EVER. No matter how he looks or who he is. Not ""I had some men but they were jerks"", not ""I'm not a model- people don't hit on me at the grocery store"".

&gt;And, if I had conformed, and lived that ""pretty girl"" life that was right there, I would have ended up with one of my previous boyfriends, instead of my awesome husband who likes me as I am, and I would have been utterly miserable trying to keep up a charade.

If you were an unattractive man and just decided to ""be yourself"", not obsessing about your appearance, you would have nothing.

&gt;Be attractive in your own way.

What a lot of women don't get is that women are inherently attractive. Women have to go FAR out of their way to *not* be attractive in some way. Of course you'll never be attractive to everyone, but you'll be attractive to the right person.

Men are the opposite- either you pass that bar or you don't. If you fall short physically, no woman on earth will be attracted to you.","1398903180"

Don't you see that this is exactly how the 1%, or whatever you want to call our oligarchs, wants you to see things? Don't you see that the downfall of modern America, and the downfall of the west generally, coincides with the fall of the white middle class and the rise of inequality? America was a more equal nation when we had Jim Crow laws and racial segregation.

Just handed me a card for a local mental health clinic after talking to me for maybe 2 mins. He was about 60, and had me waiting for like 3 hours beyond my appt. It was a total joke. 

My GP was the one who actually ended up starting the first round of tests. But I had to push him to do it. He didn't take me seriously either. Like I said I had to be hospitalized before I got taken seriously. Even then? It still didn't help me with disability and that when I got disabled to the point where I needed it. I went from managing two stores, going to school p/t while working 80 plus hours a week to not being able to crawl out of bed in like six months. I was so go-go-go, it wasn't even funny. My Dad was like ""No, you don't understand this is so NOT her. She's very,very active to the point of being hyper. She would never want to be constantly in bed like this!"" and still they were all like ""Has your daughter ever been diagnosed with depression?"" 

I met the lady rheumy when I went to the hospital and later she became my regular doctor for quite a while. I'm not kidding when I say she saved my life. She did more for me in six months than the rest did in like 5 years. Finding a good doctor who listens, that's a minor miracle sometimes I think.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Disclaimer: the following explanation may provide an *adequate* understanding of how to work the gears on your bike, but it will not give an accurate portrayal of gearing or gear ratios.

Multiply the numbers on each shifter. That gives you a pretty clear idea that you're capable of 21 total gear combinations on this bike.

1 times 1, well, 1. This is likely the lowest gear possible. And, as in a car, this will produce a slow top speed, but an easy gear for going up steep hills.

3 times 7. Gear 21. This is the highest gear (sometimes called ""tallest""). This will be the hardest to pedal, but will produce the fastest top speed.

With this math approach, it's clear that there are a host of ways to get to numbers 10 through 16 (or so); we call that gear overlap. It's a little more advanced of an idea, but you should know that there are optimal combinations for each gearing. For example: to get gear 6, it's best to use 2 on the left and 3 on the right. Not 1 left, 6 right. (don't sweat this too much)

If I were you, I'd put the thing in 2 on the left hand, and use the right hand for all your shifting. That will get you 7 possible gears; likely enough to get you around town.","1398903183"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ok, that's completly fair.

Personally, I think that because the Unionist community held all the power and they were so venomously opposed to the idea of a civil rights movement (as they thought it was a front for the I.R.A., who weren't even active at the time) that peaceful options would have only worked in a long time frame. In the minds of Catholics they may have genuinely believed things were only going to get worse. 

I don't see how anyone could have convinced people that peaceful protest was the best option when it was met with such violence. Also, the British government only began to show an interest in the situation when the peaceful protests turned into full scale riots that the police couldn't handle.

&gt; I think you have also suggested that I am more intolerant of Catholics than Ian Paisley.

I didn't mean it that way, sorry. I just mentioned it to show that even the man was responsible for much of the violent attacks on the civil rights movement, now believes that this led to violence in return.

For the record, I don't support the I.R.A nor it's violent campaign for a United Ireland. 

I do however believe violence to achieve equality is acceptable when all peaceful, legal and political means have been cut off. (I understand this is where you differ).","1398903191"

In short, what you can leans from a 20-0 MGE is what you put your mind towards learning. Go in with an idea, and focus on it during your training session. You'll find that you'll get less annoyed at the losses and more excited about progressing.

For example, I spent an entire afternoon practicing airshots in MGE. I lost every single game, a lot of them rather badly. But getting an airshot more and more consistently as the day went on was what I was looking to improve on, and that's what I did. Mind you, never abandon core gameplay of the class and ignore everything else in it's entirety, but instead allow yourself the opportunity for the practice. Again, with airshots as the example, Play the game, when you see them prepping to jump, give them the opportunity to jump so that you get the practice in. If you miss it, go for a kill and move on. If you don't get a kill, it doesn't matter, you're just trying to get to the next chance at an airshot as quickly as you can.

You can practice a litany of things with MGE, but it isn't a substitute for pure dm practice. Go to pubs and get the muscle memory there. Work on evasion, bombing, strafing, airshots, direct hits etc. one at a time.

To be honest, nobody is going to think any less of you for losing an MGE. Nobody cares, they're all there to practice and further themselves. The only people that are really assholes are the ones that use elo as a meter stick for their penis.

TL;DR: Measure success by progress, not by winning or losing.","1398903193"

Could be in any number of ways; employment, criminal history, yadda yadda... 

What are your thoughts on the fact that any homeless/drug-addicted/mentally unstable (etc, etc...) individual is free to have as many children as they want, with absolutely ZERO thought of any consequences for the children?

I think the part looks terrible. It looks fine looking at it from the top, but thats not a perspective most people (if anyone) will have. 

In my opinion, you should talk to your barber about placing the part on a more flattering part of your head. Somewhere that complements your hairline (you've got a pretty good hairline). 

Another opinion, try playing around with combing in different directions. The direction you are combing it in now gives it an ""almost"" pompadour. If you experiment you might just find that perfect look.

And while history may alter things, the basis remains the same. One God. Just as there is one mathematics, even if Euclid and Gauss differed.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","No, it may not always be honorable to tell the truth, so long as you are not directly lying to them. You should always be careful about what truths you share, but that does not make lying okay. Its that old adage, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything. The truth can hurt. For example, if you know a something terrible about someone's past, it is not always honorable to reveal this as it could do more harm then good.

I had no idea what you were talking about with the first sitting/standing comment. I use that phrase so much it went right over my head since I don't associate it with the action. Let me explain what I meant by that. Often, in my experience, when people have attempted use a hypothetical, it was meant to elicit a certain response. If I give a contradictory response then rather then discuss the response and why like sensible people(you are here), they instead continue trying different situations in a attempt to force me to agree. Thus ""proving"" they are right because I agree with them(not you).

I really appreciate your nuanced and to point responses. You are trying to discuss, not shut down, which is admirable. I think showing you can hear what others say and consider it should be rewarded. Also the siting/standing thing was kinda awesome since you accidentally hit on an in joke that I have with some friends of mine","1398903202"

"zen","t5_2qhmf","I love the thing about 關. I never heard or even contemplated an East Berlin metaphor. Well done indeed. 

As for the first part, I just wanted to ask about a couple things. I don't know this concept of 通, but how is it unique to China and applicable generally over its long history? I mean how is that different from having an understanding of the coherent structure of any text? As for interpretation, that's totally true. But interpretations (prefaces, commentaries, adaptations, dedications) are central to any written tradition in China, especially for Chan which as we all know is always prone to reconstruction and re-purposing. I'm not an expert in Chan but trying to isolate the ur-text for any of the lineage masters is doubtful anyway. So like we don't know for sure what Huangpo said because his student is supposed to have written down the teachings that got published in the Transmission of the Lamp. I'm expecting a correction on that but my point is that anything we have has gone through a number of filters regardless and shouldn't be taken on faith. 

I guess the main thing I would say is that while this is a Zen forum, it's not necessarily a forum for Zen believers and should be open to looking at the whole package of Zen. A lot of the time when I see arguments here I imagine believers in ""true"" zen or the core teachings of the masters, but I see them as part of a textual continuum that should always be looked at realistically. This is obviously the more boring way to look at them but it's a necessary way. With that in mind, the whole point was to discuss learning Chinese through Chan texts, of which added commentaries and intros are a core component in the tradition. I have a feeling that some people didn't get involved because of the Buddha-heavy first sentence. ","1398903205"

I like the noob heli pliots who pick on my tank as an easy kill. I'll switch to guns and shoot them down, it's a close game, you can't miss (or very little) and down they go. (TV's being the exception).
    
You can easily tell the ones caught off guard; that this tank take might very well take them down.
    
Or the jets who treat my scout as not being a threat, swinging the scout as they fly past is an easy kill and generates a bit more respect :}

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pet food. My SO and I are in a bad way right now trying to afford everything. We moved to a new house so we'll be paying cheaper rent, got a roommate, and so we'll spend about 290 less per month. But we're still under lease in our old place until they find a new tenant...so until then we're stuck paying double rent. 


My SO has been unemployed for 3 months and I'm the only person in our house working full time. One roommate works 30-35 hours per week. I work full time, SO is unemployed, other roommate is on disability so he is on a fixed income. 


But no matter how much we struggle, no matter how much we have to go without food, etc., I will ALWAYS find the funds to make sure our pets can eat. Their well-being is more important than my own, and it's not their fault that we can't afford everything right now. So pet food is always the first thing I buy with my paycheck. ","1398903210"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Once again, lift stats are based upon training habits not an innate athletic ability. I suppose I'm to believe that some random guy at the gym who can bench more than Messi is a better athlete than him? C'mon, it's laughable.

&gt;Walcott is faster than Ronaldo. Walcott is not as fast as many people who have played in the NFL.

Once again, you have nothing to back up this assertion. I'm not going to take your word for it.

&gt;How many soccer players can jump 66 inches?

I'm sure there are plenty out there who can. [Here's a MLS player messing around doing a 54"" jump](http://instagram.com/p/a_kMgrKakK/). He doesn't even play in the top league in the world, he isn't particularly well known but it's a testament that even average professional soccer players are great athletes.

&gt;Show me one soccer player who can run a 10.01 100 meter dash like Jacoby Ford.

Ok, [here's Adam Gemili](http://youtu.be/SMjO-s-C_ss?t=2m18s), pro soccer player turned sprinter…

Another example. Here's a 14 year old Alex Kiwomya breaking the UK 100m record for u15's. He runs a 100m in 10.98 seconds as a 14 year old! Almost unheard of to see kids this age breaking the 11 second mark. There are plenty of athletes like this in the soccer world.

&gt;Yes soccer players have more endurance but that is the only area where they win out and they don't win out by enough to make up for huge deficits in other areas.

More baseless assertions. You're wasting people's time here. You've made your decision before even considering an alternate opinion.","1398903210"

IIRC, he inspects the arrows and appears to convince himself that they couldn't be the arrows he was using personally. Despite this, its left ambiguous as to who dealt the killing blow. Thats the point, Jon feels responsible because the Night Watch killed someone he had come to love.

"conlangs","t5_2red7","Shonkasika verbs are basically agglutinative. Verbs conjugate for five aspects (simple/aorist, habitual, progressive, perfect, prospective), three tenses (present, past, future), four moods (indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative), three voices (active, middle, passive) and person and number.  
  
The template for verb conjugation is as follows:  
[stem]-[aspect]-[tense+mood]-[person+number]-[voice]  
  
All verb stems end in a simple vowel. Verb conjugation classes are grouped based on how they form the non-simple/aorist aspects. Class I, simply adds the standard aspect suffixes (particular consonants). Class II diphthongizes the previous vowel (with /i/) before adding those same suffixes. Class III adds a nasal suffix (/m/ or /n/) before adding the aspect suffixes. Subclass b of any class reduplicates the first syllable of the stem in addition to adding suffixes.  
  
Each verb also has a collection of infinitives and participles based on the different aspects and voices.","1398903216"

Java has a tendency for hogging up the main CPU core (as it mostly runs single-threaded), this prevents DXtory from trying to use those same resources for live encoding. You might see an improvement for it.

Other than that, the only suggestions I have is to make sure that you launch Minecraft with 64-bit java and dedicate enough memory for it. There are tons of guides on how to do this available with a quick google search.

Edit: An additional thought: Are your game files on the same harddrive that you are recording to? Old fashioned HDDs can only really do one thing at a time, so if you are both trying to write a lot of data AND read a big Minecraft world at the same time, one or both of those tasks will fail miserably.

Not really, no. Dogs have never done anything to collectively ruin life/society/the planet/wage war/kill innocent animals, other than what's necessary for survival and the occasional dog-bites-human story.

Humans are guilty of a lot of shit. Animals? Hell no.

No animal deserves to be fucking abused. And anyone who abuses an animal should be abused, themselves. It takes a sick fucking person to abuse an innocent animal, whether it be through physical abuse, malnourishment, or other. Fuck people who abuse animals, there's a special place in hell for them.

That's not to discredit humans, of course. I don't believe any ""good"" human should ever be abused. Hearing about human trafficking makes me sick. The story of abducting young teenage girls/boys, getting them addicted to drugs, and then forcing them to do whatever so that they can get their next fix is cruel, inhumane, and frankly it's fucking disgusting.

There is a good chance things will get messy and unpleasant. You have to decide if you have the ability and the willingness to deal with that if/when it happens.
Maybe the best plan is to tell her how you feel, and say you do not know what you should do. If they can explain how they feel in relation to how you feel (if that makes sense), you will atleast have more information and will have set things straight. 

Simply saying ""take the risk"" would be easy, but YOU have to decide if it's worth it. What its value is, along with the costs.

Like if it was a wizard it would at least make sense.  Also amnesia often leaves people with most of their skills intact, like they can still ride a bike or play tennis or whatever.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Besides recommending judges for appointment, a Prime Minister can do very little to influence the judiciary branch. However, with a majority government, the incumbent virtually controls both the executive and legislative branch giving him/her an extraordinary amount of power. 

The Senate has not questioned the Prime Minister in over two decades and currently acts as a “rubber stamp”, effectively guaranteeing the Prime Minister support from the upper house.

**The difference between a Prime Minister with a majority and a minority is found in the House of Commons.**

A majority government is one that has won more than half of the seats in the House of Commons. In the event of no party winning more than half of the seats, the one that obtained the most becomes the party in power, but as a minority government. With the current culture of party discipline in Canada, seldom do Members of Parliament vote against their party which is why obtaining a majority in the House of Commons is so important to parties.

As the head of his/her party, the Prime Minister commands a great deal of respect as he/she has the ability to extrude disloyal party members. Therefore, Members of Parliament are subtly coerced to vote in favor of the Prime Ministers’ agenda or else they risk the possibility of losing an opportunity to serve on cabinet. Obtaining a majority of the seats in the House of Commons – contingent on the bill being ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada – ensures the Prime Minister that his/her legislation will be passed.


----------

The current electoral system used in Canada, known as first-past-the-post, has a distinct impact on the type of government formed and it is criticized for not adequately representing the majority of Canadians. Canada’s electoral system divides the nation into districts known as ridings or constituencies. Constituencies are distributed amongst the provinces in proportion to population, each electing one Member of Parliament. 

If a party wins over half of the ridings, they become a majority government, meaning that more than half of the members of the House of Commons belong to the same party as the Prime Minister.  Although the Prime Minister is not directly elected, he/she is the leader of the party that wins the most ridings and become the de facto senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government. A party can manipulate their electoral strategy to focus on winning a majority of the ridings instead of votes. A majority government could be formed with less than half of the popular vote, as manifested by the 2011 elections where Stephen Harper’s Conservative’s won roughly 40% of the popular vote but 60% of the popular vote  .

Euro/UK-to-US can tend to be more consistent at times, and conversion charts differ by brand/style. I fit better in a 41 euro in Birkenstocks, but a 42/43 in Born, and consistent UK 8 in Doc Martens. In the US, most shoes that use Euro/UK sizing tend to be comfort shoes which tend to be designed to be less constricting and have more stable bases, so it tends to create an impression that Euro/UK sizing is more consistent.

In general, for any conversion chart you find, try +/- one size in the target scale for best results. So in other words, US 11 women's converts to a Eu 42/43, so I try everything from a 41 to a 43, depending on the style.

Also, don't forget that women's shoes have vastly different styling. Open vamps, straps, heel styles and heights, etc. This causes different fits than men's shoes, which tend to be not much more than large containers into which you put your feet.","1398903229"

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Forget the Chinos unless they are colored, tan ones and a OCBD and you will look like you just came from the office for happyhour and stayed out for the night. I recommend slacks, or colored Chinos, a fitted shirt(ocbd works), and a skinny tie. If you don't have a fitted shirt you can pick one off the rack that fits in she shoulders and take it to a tailor. He should be able, for $20, to make it look like you buy bespoke. If you have a sport coat this can be dressed up a bit and work for lots of stuff. 

By all means if you have a suit you look a million bucks in wear it, always opt for a touch dressyier that you think you need rather than the other way around. You want to have women other than your GF checking you out, but you must not acknowledge it ever. Make it appear that the only person in the room besides you is her. Your dressing for HER, but other women checking you out will make her radiant knowing you are hers, not theirs.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I've recently began trying to do it ""the right way"" (there is no right way but some ways work consistently better). Seems somewhat of a consensus that to get an exact style, you do these steps:

* Wet hair completely - not just a quick spray but good and wet all the way to the scalp.
* Towel dry
* Apply gel or mousse all the way to or near the base of the hair. Use hands or comb as needed.
* Blow dry. After applying gel/mousse. This gives volume and makes the hair workable. THIS STEP IS A MUST. Blow drying with a little gel is the foundation of making a workable style. It may even be all you need to do for a desired style.
* Apply forming paste or other styling product. This will sculpt the hair to the desired shape. Hand form, comb, twist around your fingers, etc for different textures. You can form a part even if it goes opposite of your natural hair direction. Don't overwork! You've got maybe a minute or two and then the product will start to set up. Worst case you wash everything out and start over. 
* (optional) Apply hair spray to lock in the sculpted/formed style. 

I've also found that for shorter or male hair styles, blow drying upside-down with your head toward the floor does amazing things. 

A good hair stylist will cut your hair in such a way as to add texture, make the hair lighter and more formable, and will cut in such a way that it will keep looking good while it grows out - even so much as to not need haircuts as frequently as you may be accustomed (and also justifying spending a bit more).

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I've been working on this since the prompt was posted. I wrote it down during a class at university (boring stuff) and completed later on when I returned at home but only now I found the time to type it. Here it goes:  
  
On a small secluded planet without a name, located in NGC 101, which can be found near the Magellanic Cloud – the purple one – that belongs to the Phoenix Superclaster, a pioneer scientist is conducting his own experiments.  
  
His name is Phanes and has a Ph.D. is in nanotechnology. He is the Father of nanobots and is famous from the Galactic Empire's Capital to the furthest edges of the universe that are still expanding. A genius to say the least. During the third millennium when everyone else was focused on nanomaterials and discovering the best combinations and uses, he was coding small living organisms from the comfort of his garage using custom made equipment. He was 12 years old.  
  
At some point he concluded that if the government got wind of his work it would be used to convert humans to robots that would abide their will and carry out their commands unquestionably. Phanes was a genuine scientist; his work had been sparked by curiosity and the will of acquiring and further expanding his knowledge – also for pleasure – however it wasn't just for the sake of it. In contrast to many respectable scientists, humanity was his first priority.  
  
It wasn't hard to keep it a secret. He lived in a small suburban village and the only person that ever enter the garage was himself. Friends, he didn't have any. It wasn't easy having classmates 6 years older especially when they were walking dick-first. They weren't really far from deifying sex. “More time for myself”, he would often say except he didn't believe. Either way, there was little he could do so he spent a good portion of his time participating in competitions; some International Science Olympiads here, a coding competition like Code Jam or ACM-ICPC there, losing some and winning others. Several top-notch universities invited Phanes to enrol with a full scholarship, tuition , accommodation and everything paid. He chose MIT, leader of technology research at the time and equipped with the most advanced facilities.  
  
People were friendlier there. They were intrigued by his peculiar thought process, his straightforwardness combined with innocence and generally his interesting approach – different from the standard – at everything he worked on, be that an assigned project or a casual conversation. His straight As-knowledge contribution during class and projects was also a welcome break from the usual monotony.

He might had quit bio-coding but his passion remained coding intelligent systems and micro-management so Phanes chose the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science course. It only took him a year to catch up to the current studies in nanotechnology and the following year he worked on fusing that knowledge with his bio-coding experience and combining them harmoniously.  
  
The results were marvellous; Tiny little robots scaling only a few nanometres which he named nanobots with uses in every field, as later proven practically. The first prototypes were simple builders that combined together as the building blocks to form various already existing technology equipment, smaller in size, thus adding more accuracy and minimizing space and energy consumption.  
  
Phanes patented nanobot technology and founded a company to protected it from the government's greedy hands which soon came in the form of funding. Instead, he turned to the general population and started his own kickstarter campaign which soon sky-rocketed. With this, Phanes hired promising and intelligent students from every university to work on nanobots and evolve them. No grown-ups were hired; he needed revolutionary minds that weren't corrupted.  
  
In the following years, prototypes for worker and repairman nanobot were created. Repairmans were the basis for every type of repair bot needed while the workers handled everything else that wasn't related to building or fixing.  
  
Every breakthrough onwards was related to or accomplished with the help of nanobots. From constructing green buildings and quantum computers to light-speed travelling and immortality. The last one was a personal accomplishment of his, although the process was never revealed – a fusion of nanobots with biocoding. The biobots, as he liked to call them, are nanobots coded with DNA. Upon insertion to the target they travel to the designated area and fix the damaged cell – that could be actual damage, cancer cells or prolongation if the cells' life.  
  
Phane rarely has visitors. The planet in reality is an enormous terraformed computer provided with artificial intelligence. Healthy, stable ecosystems are spread throughout the planet and sustained by the AI. Whenever Phanes needs something, a robot is assigned to bring it, travelling to a nearby or solar system if necessary. Since Phane doesn't have human contact he has long neglected time. He follows a schedule planned by the AI that includes, other than time to work, a healthy diet, plenty of sleep, an exercise session that varies each day and some much needed breaks. They help him cool his brain off and keep him sharp.  
  
-NOW-  
  
Phanes looked at the small red orb he was holding which was 3 pieces a moment ago and had just been fixed. He swore. It was futile. Maybe entropy couldn't be reversed after all and the past 2 millenniums had been in vain. Phanes contemplated giving up.  
  
A tone echoed through the room, signalling his 45 minutes of break. After carefully placing the orb in its case, he entered the teleporter.  
  
“Garden, please”.  
  
The cabin started vibrating. Phanes closed is eyes and focused on the Back that was playing in the background. When a minute passed the doors opened and a sweet smell tingled Phane's nostrils. He walked to the swinging bench without opening his eyes - he knew the place by heart – and lied down. With his mind, he slid on the bench's smooth surface and passed from every tree and flower in the garden, feeling their stumps and stems and leaves, so different yet so alike. Each smell was unique and intriguing. Together, they smelled like euphoria to Phanes as he drifted to sleep.  
  
Phane's dreams were tangled with his experiments. He wandered for  awhile in each one, arranging a mental list with the approaches and methods he had used, wondering for the first time what would happen if he succeeded. He had spent so much time alone and was so focused in finding an answer that he had forgotten man's irritating habit to twist and bend everything beneficial for one's own ill ambitions. It was too huge a risk to take, a machine that could reverse entropy in the hands of a man. He had to erase all the data he had accumulated, vanish all the evidence. He had to obliterate the planet along with everything on it.  
  
Phane's paused, leaving his trail of thoughts, realizing he was in an unknown room. It was an experiment room for sure, however he had no memory of this machinery layout. He went by in front of every piece of equipment saying its name and describing its usage to no one. The layout was pretty simple – he had built other of greater magnitude and complexity – but also was strangely... revolutionary. In its simplicity, it could actually work.  
  
Before he had finished his thoughts, a red orb identical to the one he used in his experiments dropped in the plate where it would be broken and afterwards fixed. Like always a blue color filled the room making the orb look black. A pulse laser suddenly struck it, breaking it into 3 separate pieces. A few moments passed while the anti-matter canons warmed up. A weird thumping sound was pounding on Phane's ears. H remembered to take a deep breath, only now realizing his boiling anticipation and racing heart. Three sequential beeps at 18 Khz meant that the cannons were ready. Another moment for the cannons and lasers to confirm the target was locked. The cannons fired. The silence was deafening as the pieces of the orb were bombarded and hell came loss at a sub-atomic level.  
  
It felt to Phanes he had waited until the end of time when the air vibrations from the cannons finally subdued and the orb was visible, even though it had been less than a second. Phanes slowly approached the orb and lifted it carefully as if it was made of ashes that could be attracted by his finger's menial gravitational field.  
  
To the inexperienced eye it looked like every other orb after one of Phane's experiments, however it was clear to him as if comparing white and black. It wasn't fixed, it was unbroken.","1398903233"

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I don't think Mel Gibson or Cosmo Kramer were branded for life. 

Unfortunately for Kramer - he was an ok-ish comedian who was coasting on Seinfeld and that collapsed when he went on his nigger rant. 

It was stupid, and I think it ought to have been treated differently because he is a comedian. 

I don't think it wasn't that people were unwilling to give him a chance - it was that he wasn't funny enough to get back. 

Saying you hate blondes, fat people or short people won't give you the same reactions because they weren't persecuted as a group. 

However - since there seemed to be a lot of fat people persecution going on, there has been a concerted social effort to combat it, and American Apparel (I think) got into serious trouble when their CEO made those comments about fat people. 

Racism has a bloody history, and even apart from social attitudes - the law treated them differently. 

Even today - many would argue (and to an extent - I agree) that the law tends to favour certain groups over others (even if not in terms of the wording, but the enforcement). I am unsure if you can argue the same for Scottish people. 

You should also think about how many people feel slighted. 

You could start NAASP, but I don't know if you'd have much support for it.

Plus - none of the repercussions (AFAIK) for Sterling were *legal* in nature. 

Keep in mind that the fine was also seen as appropriate because it was commensurate with how much money Sterling had, and the damage to the brand as well. 

This isn't simply a social good issue. 

I do think that Sterling was racist, but I hate the fact criticism of Israel is often called antisemitism.","1398903234"

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I remember the first time I was screwed and it hurt really bad.  There was a small up and coming coffee accessory company (Ekobrew).  Check their 6,000+ reviews on Amazon.  I had very little start up cash and spent about 25,000 on a single SKU with them.  I was just selling away on Amazon selling these cups at 11.99.  The sales guy would always call me and tell me he was upset because other sellers were breaking MAP on Amazon and he could not find out who they were.  I nicely held the MAP price at 11.99 and I found out who was breaking MAP for him.  About 2 weeks later I told him that I wanted an exclusive cup with them and would order 10,000 units.  I told him it would be a pink cup and I would donate 10% to breast cancer.  About a month later I see other sellers selling pink cups that donate to breast cancer so I call him up and ask him as politely as possible something like ""What the FUCK is going on?!"" and he told me that ""It just wasn't working out with me because I am not exclusively in the coffee industry"".  Really pissed me off that I was pushing their product when they were small and as soon as they got in Wal Mart and some other places, they basically left me hanging.  I only had 1 other employee at this time and these cups were a ridiculously big part of my business.

Do you even understand the difference between a regressive tax and no tax? I don't think you do.

The poor pay the same as before, but now the wealthy must pay as well.  Under the system you're cheerleading, only the people who can't afford brand new cars pay the tax.  Under my system, the wealthy pay as well.  Are you sure you're not a shill for the Koche brothers?

Actually, you did.

&gt; Toning does require muscle growth if you're scrawny.

&gt; you don't have anything to cut/trim the fat from.

I have no idea why you would argue that you can't be cut/toned without bulking first when *you* yourself were toned before you started growing. Hell, you're even proof that most people DO have muscle mass at least the size of Bruce Lee. Maybe you just don't recall how small the guy was?

And don't forget to take into account the fact that a camera adds 10lbs to how a person actually looks due to aspect ratio and lack of stereo imaging. The guy was small, that's all there is to it in size.

"news","t5_2qh3l","This is why the American left should take note - you need to arm yourselves.

The idea of weapon prohibition and gun control was never a fundamental *left* position. It became the position of left-centrists and right-centrists in Europe and the United States. If we look at serious *left* wing movements and leaders, they have almost always endorsed being armed: the Black Panthers, Malcolm X, or Che Guevara. Even Gandhi said that if individuals can't bear nonviolence, violence was superior to inaction.

Karl Marx - ""There are no circumstances imaginable, not even victory, under which the proletariat should give up its possession of arms.""

Tomorrow, May 1, is the historic celebration of the Haymarket Bombing where workers were invited to ""come armed and in full force"" and square off with police. Being armed has always been a part of the actual left wing. It is not even a Second Amendment issue. It's a revolutionary issue. American progressives have rejected this left tradition while shifting to a pro-state and pro-authority ideology.","1398903247"

The worst part about this is that it wasn't even an opinion which he was publicly proclaiming but rather an illegally recorded part of a private discussion he was having with another individual about what behavior he felt was acceptable for her to engage in with resources he was providing her (significant resources by anyone's measure).

But 

&gt; Freedom of speech 

doesn't really factor into the consumer side of things. One of the key principles is an audience's willingness to receive the imparted ideas. Telling people what they do not want to hear may not result in imprisonment or re-education through labor or anything like that, but it can certainly result in people no longer wishing to provide you with their money. Especially if they believe that doing so will allow the recipient to continue to spread opinions which they disagree with. 

Look at the Chik-fil-A fiasco which flairs up every time someone newly discovers they're closed on Sundays because they're a faith-based company... or what Subway's facing right now because of their decision to remove ham (a meat no one bothered to order when they had it anyway... suddenly everyone's upset that it's gone).

For you, a little guy, this may have a chilling effect on what you feel free to engage in during your private time. Employer snooping into your private life is its own thing, though, and it is affected more strongly by privacy protections than by a multimillionaire being forced out of his business.

The thing is, I'm extremely skeptical of the modern doctrine of Over The Horizon landings. I think it's a perfect doctrine for raids and the like, but it'd be impossible to land a full MEU using OTH doctrine while facing even a half competent adversary. Over the beach landings require heavy firepower and good protection. They do not require speed, and I think the Corps' retaining of the requirement for speed in their totally-not-the-EFV that they are researching is a mistake.

A replacement for the good but aged AAV-P7 is all that's needed. Make it slightly shorter, maybe a little lighter and better protected for fighting inland and that's all you really need. Once the beach is secure and a port is taken LCACs and ships can offload the rest. ","1398903253"

One guy claimed that despite his three accidents (scraped BOTH sides of his car parking in a garage), he was still the better driver -- because apparently ""being safe and knowing the boundaries of my car"" is NOT a component of ""good driving"". In his eyes, driving super close to bumpers and weaving lanes dangerously was good driving. The general attitude seems to be:


Man driving at 100mph = racecar driver, so skilled and manly

Woman driving at 100mph = incompetent, obviously doesn't have control of the vehicle


Also, due to the cultural/societal connotations of cars (car=extension of manhood), men are often incapable of admitting that they don't drive well. In contrast, women typically have no problem admitting that they're bad drivers, even when they aren't. It's another case of stereotypes shaping reality.

"CODGhosts","t5_2wp1x","I am guessing that would be me!

I had the most success going for the patch by playing Drop Zone with a special Riot Shield class I went to whenever I got a Vulture. Vulture care package drops are not terribly uncommon there, action is centralized, and hiding behind a Riot Shield with your back to a wall gives the Vulture time to pick people off (although it does *not* last long when going against explosive-happy teams). I also ran 2 concussion grenades (a stunned enemy was an easy Vulture Kill), ICU, Blast Shield, and Tac Resist. The longer I stayed alive, the less the Vulture had to travel across the map after I respawned. Also, I saved myself some trouble on the Vulture Killer patches by carrying a spare C4 to destroy my Vultures when they were about to expire on their own. The ""Thanks Buddy!"" patch was a matter of luck. I got it myself after picking up a Maniac suit, standing still, and letting a distracted player get taken down by my Vulture at the end of a match while I was shot to death.","1398903254"

For me I was full the first week, started getting really hungry again on the second week going into the third, and the past week or so gone back to full all the time. I've changed to eating bacon and eggs for breakfast, no shell tacos for lunch (from the 6 day meal plan) and eating nothing or just a cheese stick and/or almonds for dinner and I feel satisfied--I do get cravings for cheat foods though so I just have to ignore those or eat low carb alternatives.

"personaltraining","t5_2u17x","Everybody gets bad clients from time to time. It sucks on so many levels, and I'm sorry you're having to experience this. You can't out-train a bad diet, denial, or lies. 

To me it sounds like these clients have underlying psychological issues that are sabotaging their exercise efforts (food addiction/depression). Common and unfortunate, but it also seems like they're unwilling to be honest with themselves and with you. Cut ties and move on. If they're unwilling to hold up their end of the deal or even try or admit when they've deviated from the plan, cut them loose. People bad-mouthing you because they refuse to address their own shortcomings is bad for business. Your time is valuable, and you don't have time for people who aren't serious about training.

It sounds like you try very hard to ""be there"" for your clients, or be a friend AND a trainer. You can be friendly without being a friend. These are your clients, not your friends. This is a profession and you are the professional. Demand the same respect you give other professionals (like your doctor or a nutritionist or foreman). If your clients aren't willing to play by your rules, they can seek services elsewhere. To me, it's better to be an asshole and turn someone down occasionally than to hear ""he's a terrible trainer because I didn't lose any weight"" driving away business. It's not nice, but the market can be tough and you live and die on your reputation.

Obviously you're a good trainer and you care about your clients a lot. Just make sure they understand they'll only see success if they're committed, consistent, and honest with themselves and with you. If they're not willing to be/do all of those things, we know they won't actualize their goals. I don't think you need to address your rates or join a box, but maybe take a look at how your clients perceive you and that they really understand THEY have to do the work (you can't make them lose weight; you're not their chef or metabolism; effort, honesty, and consistency are the keys to success).

I hope this helped a little. I think you're in an unfortunate situation with some vindictive people who blame all their problems on other people rather than owning them and taking charge of them. *You* tried, *they* failed. Can't help those who don't help themselves in this industry. You provided valuable services above and beyond what's required of you and they didn't care enough to actually try. I don't have tons of experience myself here and will likely defer if someone with more experience tells me I'm dumb.

TL;DR Americans are lazy and blame their problems on others instead of trying to fix things (generalizations, yay!). You're fine, but look back on this and see if you missed red flags (that 8lb gain would be grounds for termination with me, especially with a history of halfassing) and could have prevented it from going this far. This is a learning opportunity. Don't let a few bad apples spoil the bunch!","1398903261"

Oh and posts about AA. Those are kind of annoying but we all have to deal with it and AA can be defeated through persistence and perpsective.

Then there are posts like yours that appear and say things like ""Seddit is full of scumbags"" and ""This place is for losers"" when obviously you have been on Seddit for 1, maybe 2 days and were frustrated.

This is a community about developing social skills and learning to overcome one's personal fears in order to gain a new level of appreciation for finding partners, love, fun, or just a good and fun fuck.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Oh man, I wrote a paper on this back in undergrad for one of those required English classes!  I found a great source from 1868 by William Rounseville Alger called *The Friendships of Women.*  You can read the whole thing [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=a6k-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MI5hU5qUGK_FsAS0kYDwCg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

I can't say how things were before or after this work was written, but it should give a nice slice of what the situation was like in the late 19th century.

First of all, it's awfully telling that the first chapter of his book is entitled ""Have Women No Friendships?""  He explains that the common belief, among men as well as the women themselves, was that ""feminine hearts are so complex, changeable, elusive"" that friendship with them is impossible.  He refutes this viewpoint immediately, but the fact that he has to devote a whole chapter of his book to refuting it should tell you a bit about how his audience felt about the matter.

He discusses various familial friendships (mother and son, father and daughter, brother and sister, husband and wife) before moving onto true ""platonic love.""  He decries the notion, apparently prevalent at the time, that a woman and a man could not be friends without getting sexually involved.  He quotes Sydney Smith as saying, ""It is a great happiness to form a sincere friendship with a woman; but a friendship among persons of different sexes rarely or never takes place in this country.""  Alger laments the fact that, when seeing a platonic cross-sex friendship, the public's ""readiness to cast coarse insinuations on them is more discreditable to our hearts than it is creditable to our morals. It implies the belief that they cannot be attached as spirits without becoming entangled as animals.  It is absurd to pretend that the multiplication of virtuous friendships
between the sexes would foster licentiousness. Their flourishes best in their absence. Their life element, esteem, is death to licentiousness.""

He goes on to tell famous stories about women and men being friends, but you get the picture:  By the 19th century, cross-sex friendships were not common by any means, though they certainly had some proponents.","1398903270"

If your team isn't strong enough to win that kind of fight, then you don't have any real right to complain about being unable to close a game. As for picks, having that one moron who always throws by getting caught out sucks, but if you take it upon yourself to ward, you'll find that happens less simply because most people do watch the map, even if they're to lazy/stubborn to ward for themselves.

It depends on how much information the plane was giving off before crashing. If the pilot is messaging radio control and they know where the plane is, they may know where to look, increasing your odds. However if all plane communication fails then the search area is huge (like the current Maylasia jet crash) and chances are slim for being found. When planes crashed over the ocean in World War II they would stop looking after a couple days because it just was not worth it. If you could find something to float on to get yourself out of the water, you would increase your chances but other than that, it is sadly a very small chance of ever being found because the ocean is so large.","1398903273"

Larger packs cost more, obviously, but you shouldn't need to pay much more than that just to have emergency juice.

Carry one on you along with the correct USB adapter for your device (most packs come with at least a USB-to-micro cord, just so it can be charged itself -- which covers most Androids, so you'll need another cord to charge an iPhone), and you should have enough to recharge your phone once, maybe twice before returning home.  

For what it's worth, I also use a Pebble watch, which vibrates when I get notifications for texts and phone calls, which improves my response time dramatically (although it does cause a bit of a power hit on the phone because bluetooth, but I think not having to turn on the screen to check texts / chats cancels this out).

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","Dude, don't even get me started, even the original warning/mute was total bullshit. Even in their own TOS it clearly states that you won't get muted until after being warned twice for the same thing. I didn't get a single warning. Even though I violated the TOS, the mods don't even follow it, so what's the fucking point?

""Enforcement when convenient"" is the policy GH mods follow.

I'm a college kid meng, getting muted for a week with no appropriate warning, when I'm supplementing my income with my keyboard services I'm offering super cheap to the community really pisses me off.

Sure I was attacking members of the community, but personally I don't want a community full of assholes who take advantage of other members for their own personal gain, or the ones who bitch about nothing, then get pissy when you tell them to just shut the fuck up.

THEN THE FUCKING ENTITLEMENT HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE ENTITLEMENT. I swear, every time I see someone say ""I didn't get in the clack sale, but I bet some noob asshole did"" pisses me off to no fucking end... Hardly any of the prominent members treat anyone with any sort of respect, acting like their shit doesn't stink, completely forgetting they were noobs at once. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of great people there that make the community worthwhile and enjoyable, just those vocal assholes who think the forum should fucking revolve around them. Then when you call them all out, you're the one who gets in trouble, because the poor fucking babies can't handle it, only dish it.

I really want to say that I'm just done with GH, but I can't, I've met too many good people there, and even though the people making 50% of the posts are annoying little shits who should be forced to post in their own little forum away from the adults, it's easy enough to just ignore them.","1398903279"

I'm guessing the Irish guys handle the piercings and they speak great Chinese so they helped translate between us and the artist.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","There's no way they'l skip out on Aegon. He's set to be absolutely huge in the next few books, not just because of the evidence from ADWD/TWOW chapters of him getting shit done in Westeros, but because there have been countless prophecies and comments by GRRM hinting at an eventual Targaryen throwdown. He's hinted that there will be another Dance Of The Dragons a couple of times, and I think after seeing Bloodraven in The Mystery Knight and then him showing up in ADWD we can assume that Martin picks and chooses the history he reveals carefully as it all links back into the main story - and we've just had a big novella about The Dance. (edit - it's also possible that ADWD was called ADWD because that was the book he originally planned to have this happen in. Then as the timelines got pushed back he decided just to keep the title for whatever reason. I realise it's unlikely but it's something to think about).

Furthermore, I think having Aegon on the Throne is going to be incredibly, incredibly important for how Dany's return to Westeros (and thus her character development) goes. If the Lannisters (or someone else who has taken part in these 3 years of destruction) are still in power when she lands, people will flock to her banners as predicted. But, if Aegon beats her to the post and takes King's Landing first - they'l be happy with who they've got. Even if he's not a true Targaryen, most people either won't know or won't care. They'l just be glad to be rid of the insane nutjobs who have been ruining the country for years. 

But then, Dany shows up, full of prophecies of Mummer's Dragons and Slaying of Lies and she destroys Aegon, naming him to be an impostor (regardless of if he is or not), and she will be reviled by the kingdom she thought would love her like a mother. Not to mention that turning up with a possible combination of Ironborn, ex-slaves, unsullied, and brutal Dothraki, accompanied by the vile monkey demon who slayed his own nephew at his wedding and a man exiled for selling slaves himself isn't going to go very well in the eyes of, well, all of Westeros. 

Sorry if that was a long post, that's one of the theories I feel most confident will happen ! Obviously, Martin is going to prove me wrong and have Dany and Aegon marry before Tommen rips out Jorah's throat with his teeth and ignites the remaining wildfire to carry out the legacy of his true grandfather. 



EDIT - Realised that my point was to do with how it affects Dany's character development and the show has been pretty awful with the finer points of character development. So yes, you were right, it's frighteningly possible. ","1398903281"

I cheese grated 10 feet or so and the cam held. Honestly, it scared the hell out of me. It made me realize how complacent I had gotten. This had been my first season ice climbing on lead, and when I transitioned back to rock, I realized that I had a lot more confidence on lead.

You should also know that with a pixie, means styling every day. It's not as much hair to style, but you can't just pull it back into a pony. So get some good products, like KMS hair play paste. I swear my life by that stuff.

"japan","t5_2qh2u","OK, I can't help you much, but this much I can tell you.  The owner of these item was born in either 1919 or 1920, OR his birth month was either July or August.  So depends on the year he should have been either 25 or 26 by 1945.  I can tell you this because I am a practicing Buddhist who has a strong interest in Shingon School. The ""booklet"" with the images of a Buddha is a very special kind of ""good luck charm"" he got from Narita-san, a major Shingon temple.  I deduced the year of his birth based on the specific Buddha featured in this booklet - it's [大日如来](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairocana) or Dainichi Nyorai (Mahāvairocana Buddha).  It is a primordial Buddha that's the central to the teachings of [Shingon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon) [Vajrayana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana).  

The reason he got this particular one was that there's a belief system which you are assigned a Buddhist protection deity based on they year and month of your birth called [御守本尊](http://www5.synapse.ne.jp/~todoroki/siryou/et-honzon.htm) which only exists in Japan (and still exist).  According to [this page](http://www5.synapse.ne.jp/~todoroki/siryou/et-honzon.htm), Those who were born in the Year of the Sheep (未羊) or Monkey (申猴), or those who are born in July or August are assigned the Dainichi Nyorai as their protector deity, who acts as a source of protection and blessing.  These years most likely translate to 1919 or 1920, given that he was a sailor in the Imperial Navy and was probably married with kids.  There's also the Dainichi Nyorai Mantra printed inside the booklet - the reason it looked like that is that it's actually a portable shrine which you can make it stand up.  He probably spend some time each day holding up this tiny shrine and chanted the mantra as a practice.  

I must say I am very moved and impressed by this, and I hope you return these items to his family soon.  There's a good chance those kids are still alive since by the looks of the kimono and the fact that he had so many photographs, the family was pretty well-off. Most likely the kids survived the post-war era.  Good luck to you.

Most of coal mines on xUSSR area are unsafe and unprofitable. That's not a myth, that's a sad reality. 

&gt; The point is that Yatsenyuk and Kerry are bigger thieves than Yanukovych

OMG, how don't you understand that people weren't fighting **for** Yatsenyuk ot Turchinov, people fought against authoritarian Yanukovich. And, if we're talking about facts, Yatsenyuk hasn't already stolen billions of dollars since he wasn't the leader of country for 4 years and the posts he worked on simply didn't allow him to steal **that** much. But again, fuck Yatsenyuk, that's not even the agenda today.

Personally I think the market's overvalued right now, the fact that you're asking suggests you think so too. If you're feeling bearish you could try and lay a few short positions although this would not be low a low maintenance strategy.

You think that these functions complete each other because they emphasize differing amounts of the same things. I don't believe that this is what makes a relationship successful. I think people should value things in the same proportions, but in different orders. If you have two people who both value independence and dependence (which we all do, just in differing amounts) and put them together, someone who needs to be independent a good deal of the time shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who needs to be dependent most of the time. These people would have to expend more energy to meet their partners needs. Which is why ENFJ and ESTP work so well, but INFJ and ESTP seem to not work at all.

Idea is you would swap over to the app, find your emote, tap to add it to the clipboard then swap back to your message.

It would also keep track of a sqlite database that has the tags, date modified, name, and subreddit so they are searchable. It would download the server's sqlite database, compare every entry, and see which emotes it needs to update. Then download them.

That way you can search everything and have all of the emotes.

I also want to add a feature that would allow your to ""share"" the emote picture in Hangouts per say so you can bug your friends there. Should be easy to add that way.

I've got the database all figured out and the algorithm that compares the two done and running efficiently. I need to add the FileIO and downloading as well as the searching. Should be a couple of days to add that, but end of school moving shit around is getting in the way.

Now you have to fight not just for the survival of your sister and yourself, but the very world that you know and hold dear. It's the first Zelda game where you doom Hyrule, and do not save it. Instead you fight for your ocean and your islands that are your home. It's just interesting to see how this old tale and ""curse"" affects these people who have moved on with their lives and are arguably more happy because of it.

You would need a different phage for each species and in most cases specific strains.  That makes empirical treatment a nightmare.  We would only be able to treat after sequencing or culture which wastes valuable time.  Also there is the strong possibility that our immune systems will recognize the phages and mount a response.  Essentially this would limit each phage to efficacy only on the first use.  Lastly, bacteria can still evolve resistance to phages.  Most of the current research is based on attempting to find ways to weaken bacteria in ways they either can't evolve around quickly, or harm them in ways which don't select for those that are resistant.

When someone is born -- not right after being birthed, but very soon after -- that newborn has a tiny amount of blood drawn, and fingerprints are taken (which are updated every ten years). You can steal someone's social security number, even alter your facial features to impersonate someone else, but fingerprints and genetic markers cannot be forged (at least not yet).

All US citizens should have government-issued ID cards, for free, and they should be regularly renewed. If you have absolutely no documentation, no money and no way else to prove your identity, you should be able to go into a federal building, take a fingerprint and have an ID card printed immediately (and it's not like the technology doesn't exist for something like this). And if there are any concerns about the fingerprint, then there's the blood sample as backup.

Let's remember that we leave our fingerprints and DNA literally everywhere; frankly, if there was any possibility any of it could be used without my permission, I'd much prefer that there was a secure storage of that info that could conclusively prove that it's mine and not some clever con artists'. It's not just a voting rights issue, but a security issue. ","1398903302"

If Your mac is still functional, and has an intel cpu, you might want to ask a computer savvy friend to try the linux distribution ""caine"" on your laptop. Caine does not write to the harddrive so you could a tleast look if the disk is still working in the computer. It would show up in the mount list. Then i would be extra careful about connecting the disk to another mac before it has booted. As far as i remember, OSx scans the disk for errors during bootup and maybe even when connecting usb disks, so it could make changes to the disk contents. Maybe try to create an image of the disk to an external harddisk with caine and try to rescue the data from the image. You might be able to mount the image you could create in disk tools on another mac. With this procedure you might preserve the data on the old disk more reliably.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Art is quite a slippery slope. While being not very practical, it can be very inspiring, uplifting and even practical, if it serves some meaning - warning signs, monuments of great achievements and people. Paris wouldn't be such a tourist bang without Eiffel tower. I find socialist art, the art from the people to the people to serve much more practical purpose than Mona Lisa above the table in tea drinking room.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","One argument that I've read had to do with the relative position of Arabia in relation to the trade routes - namely, not that important. Prior to the completion of the Suez canal, the trade routes were either through Palestine/Mesopotamia, or entirely by sea around Africa. 

With the creation of the canal, the trade route started to skirt the Arabian coast, making it a valuable diplomatic territory. Add on the conversion to steam power, and you now have a nation like Britain being very concerned with the route through the Red Sea, and with a sudden need for coaling stations. Yemen, if I recall correctly, is the result of British India colonizing Aden and setting up a coaling station. India was also instrumental in setting up the British treaty system with the Gulf States to ensure that no foreign power would gain a foothold near the Empire's vital sea route. 

Prior to this, the Ottoman Empire's interest was simply in controlling Mecca in support of the Caliphate. To that end they built a railroad in Hejaz to control the pilgrimage to the holy city, but largely ignored the territory otherwise. Nedj, where the Saudis got their start, was so barren as to be useless to empire. Nedj was largely a feudal oasis society that used Bedouins as mercenaries until Ibn Saud popularized Wahhabism and turned the mercenaries into religious warriors. 

If it wasn't for WWI, Saudi Arabia might have been unified earlier. The British paid Ibn Saud to remain neutral, while they courted the authorities of Hejaz to rebel against Ottoman rule. The Indians had suggested that Saud was the better horse to back, but the authorities in Egypt were more familiar with Hejaz and thus history is written. And, of course, by that point the oil potential of the future mandate territories was known, so the British made sure that their allies from Hejaz inherited the thrones of Jordan and Iraq. 

But even then, when the British were the masters of the Middle East, they didn't bother with Arabia proper. They essentially created a fence around Ibn Saud, and allowed him to unify the portions of the peninsula that they deemed unimportant (including Hejaz). It was only later after they laughed at the Americans for drilling for oil in Arabia that they realized that there might have been serious strategic value in courting Ibn Saud. ","1398903307"

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I agree that Attack of the Clones is the weakest of the three, but I would argue Revenge of the Sith is the strongest: the plot is the easiest to follow, there's a clear central protagonist with a pronounced character arc, it hits hardest emotionally, and ultimately ties everything together. The biggest problem with Revenge of the Sith is just that the dialogue is some of the weakest of the saga. Much though I enjoyed Phantom Menace, its plot wanders a lot (though I wouldn't call it incoherent like Plinkett does), and it's difficult to put a finger on exactly who the protagonist is. The movie also tells when it really should show: a lot of information is delivered via infodump exposition dialogue rather than setting up scenes to clearly illustrate the matter (the suffering of the Naboo during the occupation, for instance) and some important points aren't explained clearly enough (what exactly ARE the new tax laws? Surely a quick ""in a nutshell"" explanation could have been squeezed in there somewhere. I know it's in the books, but if it's not actually in the movie, the movie suffers for it. Chinatown made water politics interesting and easy enough to understand; a couple of lines between Gunray and Amidala in the vid conversation near the start could have laid it all out).

Attack of the Clones had something really solid with Obi-Wan's investigation plotline, but shackled it to a bad romance and a sprawling, confused finale, bringing it in under everything else.","1398903309"

do guys complain about them? yup. but TRP doesn't care. TRP only deals with the reality of the fitness-test and how it might be to a particular man's best advantage to handle them in certain ways (rather than give in to them or humor them which is what blue-pill society teaches boys their entire lives... and women wonder where all the ""real men"" went...)

as for the correlation between RPW and TRP it is very telling that there is such a difference. and that very telling reason is that men and women are different right down to the way our brains work. and if it seems a bit submissive to you, try chewing on this thought a bit: all women wish to be submissive... to a man worthy of their deference. and that again, leads us back to the pursuit of, and the focus upon what is a worthy, alpha man. hence: TRP.

Get a block of Cambozola cheese. It's lactose free and sold at Trader Joe's and most fancy grocery stores. TJ's has it for about half the price. 

Cut the block into chunks so it melts well in a frying pan. While you're at it, pick up a small jar of minced garlic and add in a small spoonful, it goes so well with the cheese. Add a little bit of soy or almond milk to the pan and even a small handful of flour for consistency. It makes a delicious sauce that's completely lactose free!

In general, we don't think the 3K screens are worth it if you're going to do heavy gaming. Remember, the more pixels on the screen, the more the GPU has to work to process all the images. If you want better gaming performance, it's best to stick to a 1920x1080 resolution. The Razer is really expensive, and we don't think there's a significant reason to buy the Blade over the [MSI GS60 Ghost Pro](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKCHT1C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JKCHT1C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=cyberjecom-20&amp;linkId=YLZWO4GZGMZZEC3A). If you bring the charger with you, you'll be able to charge the laptop in the classroom/library/cafe, etc. 8GB is usually quite sufficient, but the GS60 has 12GB, which is certainly enough.

**Halo**- My favorite series of all time. Of course, I read the books and learned about the entire universe, so that helped me care more about what was happening in the game. Nevertheless, it is still, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told in video gaming. 

**Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite**- Amazing, original story that comes togehther perfectly at the end of Burial at Sea. Levine combined the two games in a prefect way, making both seem like one huge game. Emotional in a differnt way. Not because you were necessarily interested in the characters, but more so how they interacted with the created world and changed the story.

**Dead Space**- A lesson in world building and atmosphere, with great characterization and well executed story. I normally don't like horror stories, because the actual narrative normally sucks, but Dead Space did its story in such a great way, that picking up text logs and audio logs wasn't necessary, but still had me looking for me anyway.

I believe in Romans 9 but one day when I read it again the first four verses struck me that the tension of desiring to do something (by the grace of God of course) to reach the loss and unreached people group while trusting in God's Sovereignty is Biblical: ""I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, 2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. 3 For I could [a]wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, 4 who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, 5 whose are the fathers, and from whom is [b]the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed [c]forever.

He, or they, went to wait at the house because that's just the precaution they had to take... just in case... but they knew (or thought) Butch wouldn't come. Haven't you ever done something similar? A ""just in case"" thing that you half-assed because you knew there was no point in doing it? It's pretty normal behavior to me.

That's why an Uzi was left on the counter, that's why Vincent went to take a shit, that's why Marcellus (if we assume he was there with Vincent) went out on a stroll to get some lunch. Because they were half assing it. Whether Vincent was alone on the job or with Marcellus doesn't make a difference. In both scenarios they were half assing it.","1398903332"

He had every reason to scare him away. Look at the mess Peggy has turned in to...it isnt because of Don...its because of Ted.

And how has taken credit for everything good in her life? The Glo coat commercial? As Don said, that was a kernel...he embelished on what Peggy gave him, which is his job, and it won him the award.

Don may have been a dick to her a couple of times, but her reaction last episode was unwarranted. She is trying to make Don the big bad monster, guilty of everything wrong with her life, when 90% of the shit she is going through right now is all her doing.","1398903335"

I don't mean to hijack your post. But...

**Why does everyone seem to have so much problem with motivation???**

And I'll throw procrastination in as a related issue.  
Is there nothing you want?  Do you not see a relationship between effort and results?  Is the entire world in a state of depression? Is there a pervasive sense of helplessness that I'm missing? Are we led to expect extraordinary benefits arising from mediocre input? 

It just seems to me that life throws enough challenges at each of us to keep us busy dealing with them.  How can you not want to deal with them?  I love the Joe Jackson quote ""You can't get what you want...""  one of my favorite albums. But seriously aren't there enough really basic wants to go around?  

Maybe in today's society Maslow's hierarchy is just so easy at it's lower levels that we never gain the skills to tackle the higher levels.  I just don't know.  I want to know, so I'm taking a very minor action to achieve that goal. Any thoughts?  And thanks OP for provoking some thought.","1398903335"

The NBA can't have jackass owners pissing off the customers. Too much of that and people don't stop watching the Clippers, they stop watching basketball. Same reason the NBA can throw you out for gambling, an activity otherwise legal.

Business, nothing personal. If it was ideological they would have thrown him out after that housing discrimination suit.

If it had stayed private no one would have said anything. It's all over TV, all over this site, all over the papers. He wasn't the one who made it public, but it's public nonetheless.

""Echmer Ambassador?"" Monsieur Weard, it would be much like you to fall for the standard Imperial propaganda, would it not? A laughable failure, if there ever was.

It has been known for some years now that the Septim-era Imperial Commission of Foreign Affairs was a corrupt, fraudulent entity. The addition of ""Echmer"" to those listed among their guests was no doubt one of the many schemes of Nobilitas Nero, head of the Commission from 3E390-4E1. Investigations have proven that the Nobilitas (now deceased) falsified records for almost ninety ambassadors and dignitaries from foreign lands, securing Imperial stipends for them which he would invariably pocket. Surely, you don't believe the Imperial City was also host to the Underking of Lyg, the Mnemullah of Nahd and the Clan Mother of Lunar Lleswer?

But there is a sketch of this bat-elf ambassador, you say? Why, it just so happens that His Majesty's daughter, little Princess Magdalena, has just presented me with a wonderful finger-painted illustration of what she calls, ""the great big gobbling dragonling."" By your logic, such a creature must exist, hmm? Perhaps the Princess has seen him, gobbling down something up in the skies.

Yhrnaa-ech-Dael can easily be found in Septimus Aethellium's *Guide to the Religions and Folk Gods of Rivennum.* I would have suggested you research him directly, via the Library at Galen, but it seems you've made few friends there.

Ever watchful, with as much love as ever, Noulese Provilaise, Court-Courtesan of Castle Daggerfall and Magister-Maleficarum of House Arouet.

*P.S. At the young Princess's request, I have enclosed her painting of the, ahem, ""great big gobbling dragonling"" for your study and enjoyment. I believe her exact words were something along the lines of ""Auntie Nouel- uhh, Madame Provilaise, could you maybe I don't know maybe send your skull-er (scholar?) friend my drawing and maybe see if he can tell me about the dragonling?"" If you let this child down, I will have you charged with treason.*","1398903339"

&gt; His college states are inflated because of the system. Sumlin ran the same scheme with Keenum. But, Manziel did this against very strong defenses for two years. People hate on the SEC all they want, but they produce NFL defensive starters. So, while the stats are inflated, it is against better college defenses.

Personally I don't put any weight into college stats. They to me are like all stats just a point to look for context more when you watch the tape. It's cool that he played in the SEC but he was surrounded by SEC talent too. Bortles played with ACC talent and was pitted against him. Bridgewater, Carr, etc. Especially at the QB position where your goal is to give the ball to someone else.

&gt; The kid plays extremely instinctively. You wanna talk about unteachable traits? Look at how Manziel rallies or how he keeps a play alive. You can't just teach that. Teddy may be able to diagnose a play before a snap, but Manziel is much better at reading a broken-down play. (Understandably, I can see how people would rather want a person who can control the play early rather than later, but I believe Manziel can be coached to read defenses more properly.)

I mean you hit the nail on the head with your first part in the parenthesis lol. But as to your second part where you believe he can be coached to read defenses better. Why? What has he shown that he can? I mean we can say this about every quarterback. They all have the ability to be coached up in terms of this, but there is no way of knowing if they will be able too, especially in his scheme in college. Yes he knows some pro concepts with Sherman as he showed in that video, but on tape there really isn't much that shows he can diagnose that shit and read and make all the calls. As for Bridgewater (Who I like but, am no means infatuated with) he has shown that he can basically run the offense. He was the guy everything went through, and it was essentially his offense. That is most likely what is going to happen as BOB has repeatedly said, as to our offense. 

&gt; Tenacity, man. While he'll have to tone it down it the pros a little, Manziel plays headstrong every down. He'll take a hit, play through injury, whatever he needs to do to win the game. Check out his bowl game against Duke.  He was the heart of that team and brought them back. You want leadership? Manziel will be a leader - no doubt about it.

No doubt he is a leader, but how much of that shit really translates over? If it always did Keenum would be awesome. No one looked happier to play some football than that motherfucker, always smilin' and shit, fucking even after he was buried in the ground. It's a great quality to have, but can't really be measured in any way. How do we know how it affects people? I personally don't believe in the concept of clutch either.  

Also he is too small to be delivering hits, and not sliding. Even bigger QBs get lit up taking off. He is going to need to work on it. Coachable yes, but in the heat of battle, what will he do? RG3 was tough and played through injury, and that fucked him up. It's great to be tough, but I don't think it again, puts someone up too high.

&gt; He might not be a good fit for BOB's system. We don't know, because we don't anything about BOB's system as a head coach in the NFL. Christian Hackenberg, BOB's chosen QB at Penn State, is a 6'4"", 220 lbs pocket passer, that we do know. But if BOB is going to stress adjusting and working around the players available, I think he can find a way to make Manziel work well.

No one knows what his offense will look like, the best we can do is take an educated guess. I wrote down bottom what I think his offense will look like. Nothing really states otherwise. And again, we don't really as head coach, but everywhere else he has been, that's what his offenses looked like. In no way does a Bill O'Brien offense seem like anything that would play to Manziel's strengths. You even say he can find a way to make Manziel work. That's exactly my point. He has our pieces and wants to be adaptable, but he now gets to build the team he wants and what he looks for. Why would he find a way to make someone work, when he feels a more traditional passer who has read defenses can actually make it work. It would be foolish to think an offensive coordinator or head coach wouldn't tailor some things in towards a QBs strengths, but Manziel hasn't really shown anything in that regard in my opinion. 

&gt; Knocks against his game are coachable. Manziel is a very capable pocket passer. In a game against Mississippi State,  he was forced to throw most of the game in the pocket due to a small injury. From there, you can see his footwork is only really wonky when he's extending plays. And, yeah, he'll throw off his backfoot sometimes and his doesn't always make the 3rd read, but those are things a rookie is supposed to learn. Those are things that every rookie (minus Bridgewater...maybe) will have to learn. His mistakes are correctable.

All he does is operate in the Shotgun. Even the 2007 Patriots had a lot of dropbacks. That just doesn't fly. Even his pro day, his drop back looked wonky, and that was against air. He doesn't climb the pocket. He needs courage in the pocket. He has it on the outside, but very rarely does he step up and throw. His footwork is wonky anytime he has to move laterally. He throws 3/4 except on his deep ball, and when you aren't in the shotgun and asked to make 3 and 5 step drops, you have to find the lanes. He throws over the O-Line and I don't think in the NFL it will work. He has to adjust a la Drew Brees. Whenever there is pressure he looks to run outside the pocket. He has good speed, but not some super fast speed that's going to work as much at the next level. His pro day, was not the way he plays on the field. If he does, good for him, but when live action comes, that's not him. 

&gt; I think he's going to be the next Brett Farve. I really do. They both have that southern, gunslinger, win-at-all-costs mentality. And that works in the NFL when you have the talent around the gunslinger. Our offense is talented. And will be talented enough to help Johnny learn the ropes.

I get what you are trying to say, but Brett Favre? That's crazy. He had an absolute laser. Manziel's arm is good, but in no way shape or form is it Favre like. NASA made Favre's arm. Even off his backfoot those things were lethal to anything within 15 feet of his release. Favre also had an over the top release too. 

He had a great career in college but his game doesn't nearly translate as well as any of the prospects. As for Bridgewater, Manziel has the stronger arm when he sets his feet and is faster, so his physical potential is there, but Bridgewaters mental game is light years ahead of Manziels right now. Too many guys with Physical attributes have sucked before. Smart ones don't always win, but I feel like there is more of a correlation to football smarts than to throwing and running fast. This doesn't mean Bridgewater doesn't have questions, he short arms the ball and I don't like that shit. Everything is mostly coachable for both of these, but there are way less with Bridgewater. Not like he has a noodle arm either, he can throw some bombs and some ropes when he works on his footwork and doesn't spin the ball with his arm. 

Now this doesn't even get into value. If you are looking at the prospects in this draft and how well their game translates into the pros? All of these QBs are outside the top 20 to me. All have questions, and the ones with the physical tools have more questions about running pro offenses. The talent in this draft is insane. The only way the QBs are close is because they are QBs and people value them higher.

This brings us to Clowney. Now I won't give my opinion on him. I will say that he is the most valuable commodity in this by far. Even if you don't want the guy, don't like him, think he is lazy, etc... Everyone is salivating over this guy. By either taking him or drafting him to me is maximizing our value. To select a QB at one is such a reach, especially since these guys aren't like your Luck and RG3, even Stafford or Ryans. They all have legit questions and I feel even with the value of a QB, we don't need to force this issue especially when we have a QB coach who knows what he wants. 

Hell we trade down to 5? 6? 8? we can pick up some real nice picks, and most likely still get one of these guys (Though I think its too high). For everyone of these prospects that work, there are so many more reaches that fail. 

I don't wanna be like the Jags and Browns and Vikings. I wanna put a QB in the best chance to win by placing all the pieces around him. I also don't mind developing a guy, again and not forcing the issue","1398903341"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I said strength is relevant.  You guys keep drawing up strawman arguments.  I never claimed that strength alone makes someone a better athlete.

I did post proof of the assertion.  Walcott runs a 10.2, Jacoby Ford runs a 10.01.  There are a number of NFL players who can run faster than a 10.2

54 inches isn't even close to 66.  And I don't even know if Adrian Wilson is the best.  So you fail again.

You are just proving my point.  Adam Gemili QUIT SOCCER to focus on sprinting full time and he STILL isn't as fast as Jacoby Ford.  Now imagine if Jacoby Ford dropped 20 pounds and focused on sprinting.  Jacoby Ford recorded that time as a junior in college while playing football. 

I am 100% open minded but every piece of objective data points in my favor.  NFL players faster, stronger, and better jumpers.  The closest you came was saying here is a former soccer player who is almost but not quite as fast as an NFL player who also sprints on the side.  You also showed me a soccer player who jumps a full foot less.

An NFL player ran a 10.06 100 meter dash time back in 1964!  So an NFL player from the 1960s could run faster than any player in professional soccer today.

But look at it this way: sure, you can name an NFL player that is faster than a soccer player, and another that can jump higher than a basketball player, etc. But take one of those guys, and compare him against all the criteria you listed. Adrian Wilson can jump high, but how does he stack up when we look at his speed, strength, and endurance? Then do the same for every one of the ""skill position"" players in the NFL. At least then you would be able to qualify your original statement somewhat.

The HDMI 1.3 spec is designed to support higher resolutions with the higher bandwidth, rather than higher refresh rates. Getting a TV to support a higher refresh rate input is a fudge at best (that a typical console player wouldn't have the wherewithal to know even where to start)  - they might advertise 120Hz rates, but it's only internal interpolation.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're talking about the function of a republic, which practices jurisprudence in part to mitigate the affects of 'tyranny of the majority' (which is an actual, legal term, not neo-con bs). 

Democratization is the process by which the standard with which people are treated is equal, thus their rights to free press, free speech, and self determination. 

Majority rule doesn't always work, which is why for instance you have the oppression of minority groups (be they sexual, ethnic or religious) worldwide. This is why we are called a Democratic Republic, so that jurisprudence is combined with democratization.

The problem with Oligarchy, which the U.S. actually is, is that it creates a process known as proletarianization. This is when the value of people's labor is extracted from them, and transferred into profits that executives can pocket. It is basically a dictatorship of the work place: people are treated as wage slaves, are exploited, and stolen from. 

The concept of democracy, or democratization of the work place is to prevent executives from becoming rich off of the labor of the vulnerable. This is why slavery and child labor were outlawed. ","1398903347"

However, you shut them down the same way you shut Nasus down: either apply pressure or win early. (I know that sounds way too simplistic, because it is, but I'm trying to make a point here.)

When a team picks a FF jungler, they are basically saying, ""We willingly risk losing our lanes in order to have one high powered teammate in late game"". Force them to regret that decision by picking laners that push but are safe (Caitlyn springs to mind bot lane, maybe Morgana mid, Garen top? idk, think of something). What then happens is (assuming you do really well in your lane, which you since since their jungler isn't ganking) the jungler is forced to make a decision: keep farming his FF in the hope that his extra 3 damage per stack will help him carry the game solo, or stop farming and start ganking, which slows him down tremendously. 

I realize this strategy effectively boils down to ""win quickly"", but that's really what it takes to stop a FF jungler. ","1398903347"

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","The thing about plywood is its incredibly rough. If you're making a chalkboard you'll want it to be as smooth as possible so the chalk will go down nicely. I've made a few these past couple months and believe me, it makes a difference.I used this oak plywood-like board that's about 1/4"" thick and comes in 2'x2' and 2'x4' surfaces. Bear in mind that these can be a little warped. If your local hardware store has it, look for peg board minus the holes. A coat of primer and go from there. My lowes didn't have any, so I went with the aforementioned material.You said 8'x29""? You'll be looking at a lot of waste if you do that. If I may suggest something, I'd cut it off at 2' and add a few inches of what ever you choose to hang it on. For that, some nice chain and a couple of those heavier bolts with the hoop sunk into support beans in the ceiling. If you go with what I did, it'll be ~5lbs, so you'll have a lot of leeway with anchors. Might even be able to use drywall anchors if you can't find a beam.If you go with paint, put it on with a sponge or roller to minimize rough texture, LOTS of coats, and generous sanding. After that it'll be perfect.Slap on trim of your choice and you're golden.","1398903349"

- Tense the muscle in your right leg
- Raise it up 
- Lean forward
- Lower it
- Tense the muscle in your left leg
- Raise it up
- Lean forward
- Lower it
- Extend your left hand 40 centimetres to the left
- When you're above the leash, lower your hand
- Close your hand on it
- Lift the leash into the air
- ... and so on and so on

When we explain tasks to computers in this level of excruciating step-by-step muscle-by-muscle detail, it's called ""low level"" programming. You're a robot, you don't understand abstract concepts like 'walk' or 'dog' or 'pick up leash'. You only know what body parts you've got and I can only tell you how to move them. Certain languages, like Assembly, are extremely low level like this: they tell the computer exactly what to do, step by step, in the form of instructions about the only things computers really understand, numbers and simple logic.

But imagine if someone wrote a bunch of code combining all of that stuff into the process ""walk"". Then taught you, in that extremely detailed code, the ideas ""look"", ""dog"", ""street"", ""car"", ""pick up poop"", ""minutes"", etc. Once all that hard work was done, I could then tell you to walk my dog by saying

- Walk my dog around the neighbourhood for 30 minutes and then come home.

This would be called ""high level"" programming. It's further away from the nitty gritty of numbers and circuits and logic gates that the computer understands, and closer to my natural human speech.

Well, there are lots of programming languages for interacting with computers. Low-level ones are really exhausting and painful to write in -- but they get the best performance, because the computer/robot is being told exactly what to do each step of the way. High-level ones tend to be easier to write and maintain, but get worse performance, because the computer/robot is constantly translating ""walk"" into ""move"" into ""raise leg"" into ""tense muscle"" etc until it gets down the chain of understanding to what it actually knows about. When you write a program, you make a choice about how high/low level you want to go. 

Assembly is a super low-level language. Writing something as long and complex as a 3D videogame in it would be like trying to organise the Battle of Stalingrad by ordering each individual soldier to move individual muscles at precise moments, totally exhausting. Writing a game in something high-level, like Python (which Reddit is written in) or Ruby would be much easier and faster, but it would run slowly. Usually videogames are written in languages called C or Java, which are somewhere in between the two.

2. You can opt out. By going to a different country. But if you want to live here, work here, make money here, then you're benefitting from our country and you should pay some of that back to keep our country working well, even if a part of that isn't something that directly benefits you.

3. Have ""things stolen""? No, that's not a good analogy. In fact, the entire analogy falls apart because it's not a case of employees and a manager. The wealthy person refusing to pay taxes isn't employing the poor people who benefit from government services he doesn't want to pay for. Rather, they are all citizens of a government that has rules that they all abide by, and those rules include a safety net that's there to help *everyone* when they fall on hard times, and just because the wealthy person isn't using it right now doesn't mean he has any less responsibility to pay for it, just like he can't say ""well, my house didn't catch fire this year, so I refuse to pay taxes used for fire fighters"".

I've never heard anyone describe exactly what I went through so accurately.  In fact, until now I never knew that this was a pattern which happened to anyone but myself.

That's exactly how it happened.  I had friends going into elementary school, but a group ended up accepting them, and I was too shy to be bold and invite myself into the group, so I just held back.  I didn't like large groups anyway.  People saw me standing outside by myself (I wanted to go inside during recess SOO badly) so they thought something must be wrong with me.  I'd spend most of recesses in the back of the school, trying to avoid the patrolling teachers who would tell me to go back to the front whenever they saw me.  I was teased for everything that I did.  Other kids thought it was funny that I was so self-conscious, so they'd start exaggeratingly mocking me whenever they saw me exhibit some mannerism out of the ordinary.  Stuff would happen like I'd walk into the classroom and my desk would be at the back of the class, a group of kids snickering not far away.  They did it because they wanted to see how confused and stupid I looked.  I remember buying a trendy sweater once (when that ROXY thing was a fad).  I felt so good about it at first, but then people made fun of me for ""trying to be cool.""  Other girls would come up to me and randomly stare at me just to see what my reaction would be.  They loved making me uncomfortable.  

And I wasn't even an ugly kid.  I was a skinny, pretty girl.  My hair was kind of messy, frizzy, and they'd make fun of me for that.  I think it was mostly my mannerisms and my shyness.  I was socially inept, I didn't know the social rules and didn't fit in with any clique.

Then when I got older, about 12, I started playing video games a lot, spent a lot of time in my room.  My mom knew I was being bullied and had no friends and would ask me about it, but I always tried to lie to her, because she took it very personally.  She was picked on when she was a kid, so she felt sorry for me to a point of misery.  I remember once she walked through the door crying, and told me that a group of girls who regularly bullied me had yelled to her ""[my name]'s mom is stupid!"" and she was reminded of when she was bullied and couldn't stand that it was happening to me.  So ironically I felt guilty for making her feel so bad, and felt I had to put up a front.  I kept more and more to myself, spent an increasing amount of time in my room.  I had precisely 0 friends to hang out with from the time I was 13 onwards.  I made friends online.   My parents took me to a psychologist and for some reason I ended up on Adderall, which just made everything worse.  I developed a love for computer programming and at that point even stopped talking to my friends online.

I remember I felt for years so uncomfortable whenever I left my room.  My room was my only safe place.  To go downstairs to sit at the table with my family was hell.  I'd sit down, stare at my food in silence, barely able to stand the annoying sounds everyone made while eating (one of the feelings Adderall enhanced), and dread my mom having one of her outbursts in which she'd start crying and demanding that I tell her how I feel and why I'm ""doing this to her.""  The guilt was perpetual.  I cannot even describe it to anyone who hasn't endured that specific type of guilt for so long.  And she still has no idea she made/makes me feel that way.

I'm 24.  I still live with my parents, I'm in school and I'm terrified to get a job for the summer.  I say all this like it's in the past, but truthfully it's still happening.  I still have 0 friends in person.  I still feel like my mom thinks I'm a loser and is upset by the fact that I don't talk to her like a normal mother and daughter would.  I've gotten a lot better but it still seems like there's something... wrong with me.  I'm not sure how to battle my social fears and apply for jobs.  I'm still terrified whenever I cross paths with my mom that she's going to have an outburst, even though they've become rare.   But I've delved way off topic.

The only thing I can advise with regard to the topic is to be extremely careful while visiting psychologists.  Therapy can be amazing but they're known to prescribe medications which really an't needed.  When I went, I almost entirely put up a front, and the psychologist prescribed me medication based on that front.  That, and don't make her think that your happiness is at all dependent on her fitting in.  I suspect that issue was specific to my own mom, but it's worth mentioning.","1398903354"

In my state however this barely phases me and I just pray shes far enough up range to avoid the cloud of shame. So I move on and take off her panties and the same stench rolls up my nostrils burning my insides. So even in my stuper I know this one wasnt me since I had been clenching like I had a penny in my cheeks ever since the first one. At this point im mildly concerned that whatever this odor was...it was going to be an issue but like anyone in my shoes I pushed on. So I finally get to the good part and I am working my way down her legs and all of a sudden its like I get demolished in the face by Ali himself and I quickly realize that this entire time it was her crotch that smelled so terrible. Well needless to say I was  seriously confused why this had happened and as I sat there contemplating how to get out of the situation nicely- nature took care of it for me. Between the heavy drinking and the fresh hell that was that smell there was no avoiding the impending vomit that had already started its way up. I tried like hell to get out out of ear shot so she wouldnt be offended but I barely got out of her legs. Felt really bad about that one.","1398903358"

To me the stand out tracks would be Alien Days, Cool Song No. 2, A Good Sadness, and An Orphan of Fortune. Introspection, Plenty of Girls in the Sea, and I Love You Too Death are pretty good too. 

As I said in the review, I thought it was obvious that they would become more and more experimental so I wasn't particularly surprised when that's how the self titled was. As I also said, that experimentation did fall flat in some regards, most notably on Astro-mancy. You said you only gave it one listen, I highly recommend you give it another listen. Like Congratulations, it's in no way an immediate album. I did not care for the latter half at all when it was released. But up on several listens, there are things there that are very detailed, and certainly worthwhile. 

I don't know if I'd say Your Life is a Lie is the worst thing they've ever done, it doesn't rank highly but it's better than some things they've done previously. I can see what they were trying to do with it though. To me it seems like they were trying to make a song that was directly contrary to Congratulations. On Congrats they were trying to get away from the catchy hooks and repetive structure of OS, especially songs like Kids. Your Life is a Lie is the complete opposite, it seems as though they were trying to make the most repetitive, hook based song they could. It's not my favourite but it also isn't awful. It's not meant to be taken entirely seriously.

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","I may not have been clear in my post. I absolutely do not expect everyone on the street to find me attractive or treat me exactly like other more conventional-looking people.

When I was younger I did feel bad about people not liking me based primarily on the way I look. But what you said is actually part of my point. People who think being a ""nice guy"" should qualify them as attractive and datable is silly. If you want to be attractive, you need to *make yourself attractive* to the kind of people you want to have be attracted to you. 

In doing my experiment it's obvious that if I were to look that way (girly) I would definitely attract *more* people and many of them wouldn't be the kind of people I would like. They would be the kind of people who are attracted to a person who looks girly, which is not at all the person I am. 

Anyone attracted to me now, with my short hair, boots, piercings and tattoos is far more likely to be someone I also like and have things in common with. That goes for friends and romantic relationships. I feel I have a very realistic view of how people see me and I'm totally fine with it. That's their thing and doesn't reflect on me or my self-image. 

Like I said, it's when people actually talk with me that their opinion changes which is how it should be. Eventually people like me will be less shocking in appearance and having people change the way they see me now, *after* meeting me, is an important step in doing that.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","The sad thing is my Dad had all of these things locked away in a safe, but she ransacked his house and managed to find the key. It was awful. She took his Georgia Tech ring, a diamond ring, his wedding band from his marriage to my mom, his masonic ring; all worth roughly $6000 and 2 very valuable handguns worth around $2000. 

It really hurt him bad as he is a very trusting person and just felt so broken up by the fact that he can't feel like his belongings are safe in his own home. He probably is never going to see the rings as she likely sold them and she would be an idiot to try and sell the guns. Plus, his home owner's insurance doesn't cover jewelry or guns :( 

And even if they were covered, the jewelry is irreplaceable as it was mostly sentimental and the guns are no longer on the market (He bought them in the '80s)

I just wish there was something he could do. He took her to court but she did not show so there is a warrant out for her arrest. But in the end, unless they can find the stolen items on her, it becomes a matter of his word against hers. It's such a sad situation.

Please, if anyone is considering letting a significant other move in with you, know what the tenancy laws are in your state. In my opinion, it is outrageous that one is considered a tenant simply by living in your home for more than 30 days. These laws are truly archaic and need to be revised.

Each time you apply to volunteer you will have to do a gardai clearance form- takes about 6weeks to clear.

If you arent working join jobseekers. 
After 3 months you can apply for jobbridge/jobs. jobbridge has seen a few psychological work placements offered if you have a psych degree. 
You cant apply for jobbridge without being unemployed for 3 months. 


Obviously plan ahead with your volunteer work.
If you have to go alone with an individual (service user) to do an activity then you will have to wait till you get cleared.
If your volunteer work is done in a center then you can start straight away but still have to do the garda form.

Get work at a nusing home of sorts and if you say (and actually do it) you will stick around for 6+ months they may offer to send you for a manually handling course... its great on your cv. 

Obviously use the national volunteer site.

"running","t5_2qlit","Ways to ""save"" money:

Register early. The sooner you register, the cheaper the fees, and occasionally an additional discount for ""first 50 registrations"" or whatever number.

If you are going more ""dedicated"". Most (if not all) smart phones have access to apps that utilize the GPS and will work as well if not better than some GPS watches.

Check thrift stores or ask friends for old ""tech"" shirts (i.e. not cotton) to avoid buying overpriced running shirts.

Shorts are a little tougher to find since I prefer the ones with the built-in liner. Check discount stores (Ross, Marshalls, dd's, etc) for running shorts.


During races something very common is to use trashbags as windbreakers to keep warm until its time to go if you want to avoid late gear check and standing in the cold. Also saves on having to use arm/leg warmers gloves, until certain temperatures.


Training plans- Free anywhere and everywhere. /r/c25k, ask here, ask anyone, google, ask, bing, etc... takes a few minutes to find a decent looking plan, as long as you follow some common sense and the 10% per week rule of thumb, you shouldn't have to pay anyone to coach you. 


Check your local running stores (road runner sports, REI, etc) for their clearance sections. A lot of times they will also have extreme deals on shoes (after you already have established what you need) and gear.

Check with free local running groups (meetup, or something similar) for events you can volunteer at or join at a discount or free for members. 

Join whatever email list you can to be updated about events, raffles, etc. Some events will raffle race entries by simply liking a facebook page.

With summer coming, if you are going to be consuming stuff-ade drinks, consider buying the bulk powder form. That way you can dilute it to your liking, and will be a fraction of the cost.

Common sense- Don't overtrain, rest/sleep well, eat well, if you feel bad, take a break, run safe, doctors are expensive. Being injured and missing out on a race is money down the drain.

Don't skimp: safety. If you are running at night or before the sun rises, invest in reflective clothing and flashing lights. Skimping on batteries isn't worth risking your life.

Shoes, never skimp on the ""first pair"". If/when you find a shoe that works, check zappos or 6pm for the same model as you have (which, by the time you kill it, should be ""last year's model"") for a fraction of the cost.","1398903375"

Yeah, BS. Again, show me any bit of documentation that says you don't have to put aileron inputs in the flare, cos the slide you showed me said only to refrain from rudder inputs unless you're de-crabbing. 

of course you need to use aileron in the flare. You think the a/c will just follow the LOC with the AP out? Or do you think that you have to position the a/c perfectly before flare mode and then just hope the a/c stays on the c/l? If you actually flew the a/c you'd realise the absurdity of what you're saying.

Again, Airbus FBW will maintain a bank angle below 30 deg that you give it with the stick. If you want your angle to change, you need to make an input (unless you're overspeeding, then the FBW will roll back to wings level for you if you let the stick go). 

I would really like to believe that you're not a pilot, and you're one of the sad, sad people pretending to fly for an airline. If you're for real, then jesus christ, I hope I'm never on your aircraft, or even your airline. 

In fact, you realise that the bit of the manual you sent me actually says:

As for your first paragraph you have to keep in mind that as society changes some of these institutions that do change with it are forced to break off from their original foundations, even recanting their beginnings as flawed in an effort to heal those wounds. Going back to science; we can talk about chemistry's beginnings in alchemy, which was heavily steeped in occult theology, but that chemistry reached a point where it needed to transcend that thus becoming an apostate to that origin. Though there are still self-described alchemists practicing today, they are just an vestigial component of society (IMO engaged in fantasy) for serious practitioners of Ars Philosophiæ have long since moved on. As to an ""institute"" that has never moved on... I doubt we will ever see a kinder and more tolerant KKK manifest itself, instead dying out as racism fades is its fated position in society. This is all because some groups can't betray their beginnings and survive the outcome while others can. Thus for most people the religion they practice today is nothing like the religion in the time of its creation, its similarities are but mere superficialities at this stage.

As to your second paragraph I feel it uncontroversial to state that religious periods, like the time of the Holy Inquisition (where in fact society was brought under the boot of Catholicism to serve it) and such, didn't serve society's interests at all. My analysis on that is primarily Marxist in that: instead it is the usual theme of a few special interests serving their own desire of power, and leveraging the dominant social system against the masses to meet such ends. Your supposition that society, as analogy for ""the people"", are in control is betrayed by an opened-eye reading of history. You may have well said ""Government always serves the needs of the society, not the other way around"", for it is equally as false on the face of it.","1398903381"

There is actually an interesting story on the word, فرنگی, it does come from the medieval pronunciation of the Franks, and was later used to denominate the French and other Christian kingdoms. Later, through trade with Portugal and Britain, words like گوجه فرنگی and توت فرنگی, which refer to fruits that are non-native to Iran (tomato being not-native to Europe as well), were introduced to the Persian language. Using the logic for the use of فرنگی as a suffix in these words, فرنگی can be extended to mean anything foreign. However, I do realize your point and I'll put a little asterisk next to the word.

&gt;* Beijing authorities are banning popular outdoor grills amid fears of rising pollution, it is reported.

&gt;* In February 2014, particulate readings in Beijing soared to 15 times the recommended safe limits - reaching ""orange"" levels, the second-highest possible.

&gt;* In fact, local authorities have said they will also ban ""food preparation, or the sale of other foods"" - threatening the popular food stalls that line Beijing's streets in warmer months.

So, I would suggest that you discuss a time line.  I don't think it's reasonable for her to ask you to wait for some indeterminate time.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","PS1 was my favorite game of all time, I continued telling people this all throughout WoW vanilla and beyond. That said I do prefer to play PS2 now. I liked the old cert system and inventory, but I also like the class system and not having to rightclick to swap items in and out. It always felt clumsy to me. I like that they got rid of 3rd person corner camping. I largely prefer the PS2 vehicles with all their different weapons and slots (with the exception of the Lib which should have remained a bomber not a gunship, too late for a do-over?)  

I like how there are many many more guns in PS2, even if they do similar roles I find it fun to try them out and customize. All the camos and cosmetics stuff if really nice. Also the way medics and ammo packs work is nice. I also prefer infiltrators now, I really couldn't stand to play one for a whole session in PS1, but despite all the moaners I think they are fun and well balanced now.  

New UI is good, I like being able to redeploy or insert from the warpgate. All the exp ticks from doing tasks maybe the best thing about PS2 though. I remember repairing my tanks in PS1, it took ages and got no exp.                   

I also like the variation in bases. I spent too much time in towers in PS1.
