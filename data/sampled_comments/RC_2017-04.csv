"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Yeah but I have a problem with remaking a game so soon after there was already one. OoT3D released, when, 2011? 2012? and the original was... late 90's? That's a good 10+ year gap, which I'd say is a good timeframe for a remake. But then when you suggest a remake of an already-remade game 5 years later, that's when things get silly to me.

MM3D was my first real experience with the n64 Zeldas, and I loved it (OoT3D I had played a few years before... I was young and sucked and dropped it at Gohma so). The advantage of remakes is bringing the game to a new generation that might've missed it the first time and didn't notice digital ports. But people born 5 years ago... aren't gonna be missing OoT3D. 3DSes are still plentiful and being sold, and remaking a game that's still selling on a rather recent console is just *dumb,* no matter what improvements could be made.

There's also the point that remakes are really only *necessary* if you can't just port/emulate the game first, save some money, make some money-- not to say remakes don't make money, but it's more up to the dev. if they *want* to do a remake. The 3DS wouldn't have been able to emulate an n64 game, but Nintendo knew OoT in 3D, on a handheld, was novel and would sell well. But what can the Switch bring to OoT beyond graphics and some little issue fixes that wouldn't completely change the game? Because I sure don't know.

Point is (tl;dr): asking for another OoT remake is silly because it doesn't offer anything beyond graphics and maybe fixing some issues as far as I could see, and would be coming off the heels of OoT3D for the 3DS which is still sold in stores, whereas OoT3D bought 3D Zelda to handhelds with stereoscopic 3D and gyroscope controls, among other things.",1491004800

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I read it. And there's a lot of gaps in your / Marxist logic. I don't feel like refuting everything so let's just pick a few. 

&gt; Some of you may have heard the term “I think; therefore, I am,” that would be an idealist worldview. A materialist would say “I am; therefore, I think,”.

It's not a world view. It is a fundamental epistemological statement and an irrefutable conclusion of a priori rational thought. Essentially one of the only things we can actually be certain of. If you consider this a view, and you think Marx's statement is on equal footing with the radical truth Descartes exposed then you haven't a clue what you're talking about. And that is essentially 1 paragraph in. 

Now these other claims that communism is the most elevated system of humanity... Doesn't even sound like it makes sense. In fact it sounds cult like. What empirical or rational evidence exist that shows capitalism -&gt; socialism -&gt; communism is the natural order of economic evolution? I'd say none and he pulled that shit out of his ass to prey on the fee fees. ""Oh you oppressed, weak, victimized souls! The world belongs to you! You're uneducated, low IQ, lack ambition, self awareness, drive, but the world is owed to you!"" Sound familiar? It's BluePill reasoning packaged 100 years ago. ""You're a special snowflake that deserves the world. You're good because you exist!"" It's a bunch of feel good bullshit with no basis in reality. 

Now. Let's look at what capitalism is. Capitalism is based upon the free market of exchange. You are free to participate or not participate in a business transaction. That freedom drives the cost of goods. Does this sound familiar to you? Yes. It had direct connection to the SMV. Next, a man owns his labor. A business venture is an extension of mans willpower. It is an extension of himself. 

Now under communist/socialist faggotry they say you are your brothers keeper. News flash. I don't owe you jack shit. 

Turn to the natural world. If I am a better hunter I thrive. You being a shit hunter will starve. I am under no obligation to support your loser ass. This is the basis of communism. Thievery while attempting to convince the producers that being a leeching parasite is somehow virtuous. 

Fuck off. Leftist thought already has the highest body count of all ideologies. Over 100 million murdered in the pursuit of this totalitarian ideology. Even today on this very platform Reddit we fight for freedom of expression, while leftists still want to censor, lie, and silence dissent. This is because leftist thought cannot survive when it is scrutinized. This leftists always rely on censorship, secret police, gulags and the eventual genocide of dissenters.

Update: there are flaws in capitalism. The concentration of wealth. Monopolies. Corporate cronyism. Moral hazard. Etc. however I will take those flaws over being a slave. I own my work (capitalism). You do not own my work (communism). Even communist countries are surprisingly capitalist. Read China. The USSR collapsed and is now...... Capitalist.

I had never seen that study before. My one complaint is that they did not react the material they found as Dr. Harrit did. The red grey chips were shown to be more energetic than known nano-composite incendiaries in his study. Just because something is consistent with paint and epoxy doesn't mean it can't also be an incendiary. There is also no explanation as to the origin of the iron spherules they found which are a product of thermitic reactions.

In addition atmospheric abnormalities were detected in the aftermath indicative of large scale thermitic reactions.

Not to mention that while we didn't know what was going on at the time, Trump did, and acted accordingly. If you ever have had to actually prioritize things in your life you would realize how stupid you sound. Debating Bernie would have done nothing for him, even if he won. 

Honestly. That debate would have been a slaughter. The only reason Trump didn't spend time nicknaming and destroying Sanders is because he knew it wasn't going to be him. He knew from day one that Sanders was a waste of time and always focused on Hillary, because he's not a moron like Bernie. The fact that Sanders is that stupid to not have known he was getting boned when every Trump supporter saw it coming a mile away tells a lot about how dishonest you libtards are with yourselves.

Once in Andromeda, the colonists aboard the Nexus were supposed to wake up and build the rest of it into a Citadel-sized station. When you first arrive at the Nexus at the beginning of the game you can see a lot of the superstructure is partially completed. Presumably they used robotics and mined asteroidal material, but they were also planning on receiving resources from the Golden Worlds, which is why construction has stalled.

Reckless driving is often defined as a mental state in which the driver displays a wanton disregard for the rules of the road; the driver misjudges common driving procedures, often causing accidents and other damages. Reckless ... [[View More](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Reckless_Driving)]

Potential flashpoints like Gibraltar have been made much easier to deal with by the existence of the EU. There are plenty of similar such potential points of conflict all over Europe but suggest that the EU has helped bring peace and the mob are all guffawing and baying ""World War Three""!

I *am* old enough to remember border closures and European warships firing over the bows of other European fishing fleets, etc.

I only used 11 counter jabs in my 1st round 1st fight and shattered the guys nose in the 2nd on my 1st punch an overhand left, followed by a 12 punch combo that stopped the fight in a TKO.

I didn't know that some episodes (depending on the show, in this case The Flash) cost money. Went to download season 2 of The Flash and noticed each episode would cost me money. Called customer service to see if I really did still have to pay $1.99 or $2.99 (can't remember which) per episode, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't being ripped off. The lady tells me that I do indeed need to pay per episode, no big deal. I'll shell out the money. Somehow she took that as me asking her to delete my account. So I call back and say my accounts been deleted, can they do anything? The guy tells me he reactivated everything. Go to buy season 2, says my account isn't active. Call back and speak to a lady who tells me my account was frozen 14 minutes ago. Wtf? Explain my other calls and that there must be some miscommunication. She tells me I shouldn't insult the other people, assuming I meant the fact that they spoke pretty bad English (they didn't speak great English but enough to where I understood them and thought they understood me) which is not what I meant at all. I get offended and gently let the call end. Call again and this lady was an OG. Gets my account in order. I tell her what I wanted to do.

"news","t5_2qh3l","It's not a fantasy, it's an overly simplified summary of the official reason the buildings came down.  Think ""Stage 1"" and ""Stage 2"" as you linked to in another comment.  Inside out is a short (and not particularly accurate in terms of details, I'll admit--though pretty close at a high level) way of referring to that.

Seriously why do you think you can determine the cause of a building's collapse by looking at a debris pile?  Or even by looking at it falling?  Why would you think you have this skill?

I've seen the video.  Yes, the video is consistent with an intentional demolition.  Yes, it's also consistent (so far as I can tell) with catastrophic structural damage from fire and falling debris.  How large steel buildings fall is super non-obvious and claiming to know cause from a short grainy youtube video is very optimistic.

Do you have comparison videos of steel buildings of a similar size falling for similar reasons?  If you can't make this comparison, how can you rule this out?  Maybe you think it's obvious how these buildings fall but I don't think it really is.",1491004810

It wasn't a *disappointing* experience per se, but it was definitely a very depressing one. I wouldn't change it of course; the entire narrative falls apart without humanity losing in the end.

Sorry to bust you like this. Just doing my job. There's absolutely zero, nil evidence for the bunko wanderings you've stated above. The fact that Sam Harris is a neuroscientist is not a debate. The only reason it is questioned is because there are people, as the op article shows, religious zealots and academic naysayers, who would love to take Harris down a peg in any way possible. 

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007272

Last time we spoke was on a more ethereal, immeasurable, but equally outrageous claim; Whether or not Harris is a racist. Another common baseless detracting smear. All you have boils down to essentially, ""I don't think Sam Harris is a neuroscientist, even though he *is* technically a neuroscientist, because I dedicate a big part of my time defaming Sam Harris, so I'd really feel better if he wasn't credible. I'm wired to politely shitpost about the guy.""

Other notable 6 star units I have are: Lightning, Elza, Ling, Chizuru, Firion, CoD, Butts, Cecil, Refia, Minfilia, Yshtola, Ariana, Warrior of Light (future 6*?)

I only have 1 dual wield atm, but I have enough copies of other characters to give everyone double hand, excaliburs, sakurafubuki, and blade mastery.

Also is there a character I should try to aim for now or in the future that would really complete my potential team (besides Ramza and more dual wields)?

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","&gt;but the majority of OTPs wont play like shit in those situations

Yes they would. Even the best pharah players switch after being hardcountered by people of equal skill level on two counters.

&gt;You named all hitscan characters when torb is a projectile hero. Torb's gun is totally different than S76 and McCree, and the skills do not translate well. You want someone who can't play Reaper or Soldier well to play those heroes instead of someone they can perform well on.

Sure, but they play quite similarly, it's not like you can't play hitscan heroes if you know how to use Torb's gun. 

&gt;Attack torbjorn is inefficient but it can work. The key here is that it is inefficient

Nobody is saying it can't work, we're saying if it doesn't and you're clearly performing badly, you should switch.

You're either a retarded OTP main yourself, or you don't understand the game enough that swapping characters when being countered is a worthwhile strategy if you're behind.

You're trying too hard to say good OTP's can make their hero shine in every situation, which might be true for very few circumstances, but often you're going to get shit on no matter how good you are because hard counters exist.

You can believe in magical OTP's that can perform incredibly well in games they're shut out from, and thats cool. The rest of us are realistic and know for a fact it doesn't work in 99.9% off circumstances, or unless there's a massive skill disparity - Which often in ranked there isn't, you're playing people as good as you are.

"scion","t5_2qnhk","i had a '12 xB in Alberta. 

here's my take on the car. enormous interior space,  at the cost of trunk space. was a joy hauling around a wife and two kids.  but thats it. we struggled on camping trips and Costco runs. nothing too invasive,  but we made it work. with the backseat down, its F'n huge.

Great in the winter, I had Blizzaks and a 5speed manual. great fun to Ebrake drift around small turns. i test drove the 4speed auto, and it was gutless. the manual lets me get off the line really strong at lights, and even screech the tires if i wanted.

Highway driving is very quiet and comfortable. but here's the thing,  very short fuel range. like 450km to a tank on the highway. and the wind will push you around a bit.

the guages are in the center so that may take some getting used to. i remember when i signaled left, the light started blinking to my right, and it felt really weird. like i was signaling the wrong way. but its really no big deal. 

all in all, i miss my xB. great car. spacious, but still really easy to park. i would still have it if it werent that i needed a truck for work. driving around in my Tacoma, xBs still make me do a double take. and reminds me of when my kids were babies.",1491004827

If anything however, most full-stack programmers have their own specializations and preferences. I personally like back-end the most and detest front-end. Meaning that while technically I can make a working website on a remote server from scratch it won't beat a product made by a dedicated group of programmers. It might be fine as long as the logic of it is involved but it will likely have gaping holes in user interface and will not be maintained nearly as well as a professional dealing with dev ops/server administration could (for instance - I can't set up a fully working email server. Sending them is one thing but RECEIVING is a very complex task that escapes my grasp so I have to use existing solutions as I can't yet properly set up my own that would work well).",1491004830

As for the disappointing part...I honestly didn't even know there was supposed to be an announcement. I was browsing my frontpage today when i saw this post fairly high on it.

So yeah, i pop on today and see that the next TW game is TW:W 2 and that the historical TW isn't coming out anytime soon. So yeah, I'm actually kinda disappointed.

But this would be a very ambitious and might not even get finished just given how long it would take if the creator were to theoretically recreate each region from scratch and create all these mechanics from scratch.

Pharma stims are fun, but be careful with them(I abused them when I was your age, and still have some heart trouble from time to time)

All of this is kinda coming from a hypocrite though, at 15 I was making DMT in my basement, smoking weed on the daily, and doing a whole bunch of pharma (opiates, benzos, stims). At 16 I got addicted to hydro for a bit and thats scared me off of them now(as I get very ill if I even take a small or light opiate)

Saying that, the only way we can feasibly go is more pro-company/employer. The imported European legal concepts and standards are generally more stringent than ours.

3) indoctrination once I was in the church
4) shame and guilt for having normal thoughts about life and death
5) fear of hell. The southern baptists preach that to no end
6) fear of being excluded from my community and family and friends 
7) easy access to a close-knit community

Best Case Scenario

SG James Blackmon

SF Colin Hartman/OG Anunoby

PF Juwan Morgan/De'ron Davis

C Thomas Bryant


We also got solid minutes last year out of two freshmen guards, Devonte Green and Curtis Jones, so pretty good depth overall.


That's a pretty loaded team. Two burger boys, outside shooting, size inside, and OG is one of the rawest talents in the country. It's also experienced - all of those starters are juniors or seniors except Davis, who played really well his first year.


However, it's likely that out of Blackmon, Bryant, and OG, two will try to go pro. Still, I'm pretty optimistic about what CAM is walking into with respect to talent. We'll see if he can get them to play defense and value the basketball, though.

Its pretty much guaranteed to have some sort of drama going on, his mother (my aunt) became a realtor, just so she could get a desk (which she mentioned nonstop to everyone for months) normally she either never has a job, or does something that isn't salaried, like cleaning houses, or babysitting. 'Convinced' her husband (nice enough guy, just doesnt excerpt his opinion or try to sway her that much, so very submissive from what I can tell) into buying a new house pretty much every year, until they couldn't afford it, so now they live in a not great, basically trailer park neighborhood.

I may very well have a story to post here tomorrow. Good thing I have a party with alcohol lined up after that, with no one that I'm related to going to it.",1491004842

For OP, I've taken 210 and honestly it's not that bad. So long as you're ok at math and actually do the homework, you'll be fine. By homework I don't just mean the assignments that count for grades though, there's like only 3 of those, but the actually homework problems assigned every week.

You did the best you could, though you unwittingly averted suspicion from the DGs with your actions. A 9FF/10MM definitely makes it look like a MM is lying, so the town decided to check those claims first. This allowed the special role claims to just go unchecked until the end of the game. What's more, I only realised both Dawn and Raven might be innocent when you died and it was revealed that you weren't a parent. Had there been fewer parent claims, I think there's a chance 22poun would have made the same calculation I made yesterday after your role reveal - if both of the parent claims were false, there wouldn't have been enough parents to cover all the children. It might have nudged town to look at the other claims, instead of wasting time killing all the MM and wondering which of them was the odd one out.",1491004847

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","The Sliske set might look promising, since you'd only have to juggle one set for slayer, but when you factor in the increased cost of the set itself as well as the fact it has no damage bonuses at all and a pretty major defense penalty, it's not really worth it. The T70 power sets would be the better option.

If you have the money to blow, consider taking the route I took, and augment T80 power sets for slayer. The extra defense comes in handy when fighting higher-level mobs, like killing Airuts en masse or the level 96 elite mobs. 

As far as perks go, it really comes down to what you kill using what attack style 

Here's just what I use:

**Melee Set (Torva)**

1.) Biting 2 + Genocidal (used 3 Direct + 1 Powerful + 1 Undead)

2.) Demon Slayer + Mobile (just 5 Dextrous)

3.) Crackling 3 + Undead Slayer (4 Explosive + 1 Undead)

4.) Scavenging 2 + Looting (5 Precious. Hope to get rank 3, someday)

**Range Set (Anima Core of Zamorak)**

1.) Biting 2 + Genocidal

2.) Crackling 3 + Ultimatum 2 (Ultimatum came with Crackling :/).

3.) Dragon Slayer + Mobile (3 Dextrous + 2 Enhancing).

4.) Scavenging 2 + Looting

**Magic Set (Virtus)**

1.) Biting 2 + Genocidal

2.) Demon Slayer + Mobile

3.) Crackling 3

4.) Scavenging 2 + Looting

Realistically, if you're going for the absolute best in dps, Scavenging should be replaced with Impatient. I personally just cbf to get more Zammy components, atm. Also, I just feel that Impatient will screw with my rhythm while slaying, so I just stuck with Scavenging.

*The adult in question was an older man, with grey hair and a somewhat portly build. He was in comfortable clothes, sweatpants and a tee with a blue bathrobe over it. A retiree if there ever was one. He looked up at the mounting for the dish and saw that the equipment itself was missing before finding it fallen to the ground on the side of the house. The man looked at it dumbfounded for a moment before turning to look at Deckard across the street.*

""Hey kid!"" *He called out.* ""Did you see what happened?""

*Deck quickly shook his head, the kind of motion a child makes when they do indeed remember something but don't want to say it.*

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I am one of those people.  I was an opiate/heroin addict, been in recovery for the last 5 years.  Worked my ass off at community college, transferred to a state school (Appalachian State), worked my ass of again and now i will be graduating with honors with a double major in CIS and Supply Chain Management (huge accomplishment for me).  Marijuana (oil) is the only substance that I use, i dont drink (messes with my stomach) or do anything else;  its so nice to come home and take a dab after a long busy day and i sincerely believe that marijuana helped me get sober.  Since i am graduating in May, in order to get a job i will have to stop and this is something i am really anxious about.  Everyday i think about how much things are going to suck without being able to take that dab now and then, im not saying Marijuana is my life but it does improve the quality of my life substantially.  To be frank i really dont have much going on in my life except school, i have a few friends locally but most have moved to different states/area.  I dont have a girlfriend either so i find myself bored/lonely alot of the time (pretty common for older transfer students).  Pot really helps to deal with that, without it i feel like i would be so depressed about how shit my social life has become also ive noticed its made me prioritize things especially when it comes to buying material goods. Just a disclaimer, I am not one of those people who thinks marijuana is totally fine, its taken me years to learn how to deal with being a marijuana user as well as a productive member of society at the same time (just like alcohol, when kids first try it they go way too hard and have to learn responsible drinking over the years;  I had to do the same thing).   I really wish it was legal, honestly it becoming legal or even decriminalized would literally mean the world to me.  Ive thought about moving to a legal state, but companies there still drug test for marijuana and I don't want to leave the little family I have left in the N.C. Really sucks.  Can anyone in a legal/recreational/medical state give some insight to how drug tests work (i would like to move to either CO or CA)?  Anyone have any suggestions or tips for me?  Has anyone else been in similar situation?  How did you deal with it?",1491004850

* Use RocketLeagueTrainer and put the car's beginning point in the same exact location.
* A macro should should start recording and stop recording ""X"" amount of time before and after.
* The recording method should be identical. Using the same encoders, same overlay display locations, bitrate, resolution, etc etc.
* Input macros that should manipulate a current device, i.e. the controller.
* Once recorded, put videos sidebyside in a master video.
* Sync up the videos via displayed input (the numerical ones, which have the most accuracy it seems)
* And if there is a deviation, have the ""sluggish"" game be on top of my responsive and normal game, but partially transparent. So you will see a 'ghost"" and if it lags behind. It'll easily be seen.",1491004852

Focusing on insane dungeons is great because it gains you a large inflow of shards and EXP -&gt; great for leveling heroes you need for other game modes.

This is the order I would focus on for skills:

1) PD to 7/10 (PD first because you have 5 revite on him)

2) Cupid to 7/10

3) PD to 9/10 (this is a break point for PD buffing his teammates)

4) Cupid to 9/10

5) Mino to 7/10

6) SM to 7/10

7) DD to 7/10

Note: Please put some kind of revite on Cupid (either crest or talent) he needs it and doesn't need that bulwark.

For evolutions: The main focus is on your damage dealers (Mino, SM), tank (DD) and buffer (PD - because he gains blitz)

1) Evo PD (160e)

2) Evo Mino (160e)

3) Evo DD (160e)

4) Evo SM (this isn't essential for a 4-10 100%, just easier if you have a little trouble with drops)

I cleared insane 1 to insane 4 in a day with this lineup so I'm sure you can do it too!

Youd eventually know your friends religions, but it was never something youd ask a stranger or acquatance about outright.

Then I got to college and there was a mix of people from all over the country- every state.

You can flash the software through Odin. That will reinstall everything, including /system and /boot.

Then put your phone into download mode (turn it off, then press and hold power + volume down, when the warning comes confirm it) and plug it into the PC and wait for drivers to install (if it fails, google and download/install them manually). Then, in Odin, click on PDA and choose the downloaded firmware and start flashing it.

Then you can see if this is something the team can handle or not. 

Another important thing: What intel does the fixer have, how did he get that, and why? Is there an inside man wanting a cut? Could his presence be a challenge for the group? (He/she could possible blame the runners to avoid suspicion)

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.",1491004859

As you probably noticed, as your boxes hit a certain level, it can become quite a bit more difficult to identify your own mistakes. One approach that can help to do this is to extend the lines of a completed box back towards their implied vanishing points. If you remember, a box consists of three sets of four parallel lines, each set having its own vanishing point. If you extend those lines back two to three times their original length, you'll likely see some of the lines of a given set converging together more quickly than other members of the same set. By definition, if the box is correct, all of those lines will converge towards the same point at the same rate.

I have gotten what I would call a dry, scratchy throat before, But never a full on sore throat like you are describing. It usually clears up in a day, maybe two and that was after heavy usage. 

First, you need to stop doing poppers right now if you haven't already and take a little break. It is very possible that, like you said, your popper had some adulterant in it that is making this problem worse. Can you answer a few questions? -

 What brand are you using? Where did you get it? Was it recently opened fresh? How much/how often are you using?

Also, do you think it could be a coincidence? Perhaps you have a cold unrelated to your use?",1491004860

Perhaps the worst I ever saw the canyon drive between the Springs and the Pikes Peak turnoff--there was about 1/2"" of snow on the road, underlaid by an ice glaze.  It took over 2 1/2 hours to drive from Manitou to Florissant, instead of the usual 30-40 minutes.

My issue is that I am a very friendly person and attract a variety and large number of people who want to be my friend (for some reason I still don't understand). I have absolutely no desire and zero social energy to add a bunch of ""friends"" to my teeny tiny circle that I already have a hard time keeping up with. I don't want any new friends. I am happy with what I have. Making new ones scares the shit out me. But I am blessed (and cursed) with the ability to socialize with people well and am very friendly. I grew up with an incredibly social family that owned restaurants and had to learn to talk and deal with people. I became good at it although I hate it and need to spend what feels like years recovering my energy. 

The problem is, you can't tell. People think I'm extroverted and outgoing. I'm not. They see that because it makes people more comfortable to show them that and thus makes me more comfortable interacting with people in settings where I need to. College, work, etc... But as soon as I turn around and walk away, I am done with them and have no interest in continuing. But I overcommit to things, people, and situations in person because it's way harder to lay out my true feelings in person and its much easier and I feel better making THEM happy even though I am miserable and internally screaming inside. What I end up doing is just avoiding them after I've committed and then people get disappointed when I don't actually go out with them or don't answer the phone, etc. I have a much easier time laying it out online but I never found a clear and concise way to explain without putting too much of myself out there. The way you explained it was a great and simple way to say it without truly putting all my baggage and weirdness out front. ",1491004863

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","I wouldn't use PT lumber for the actual fencing but it is recommended where wood comes in contact with the ground, meaning fence posts.

That said, PT lumber can, and does, warp and twist, sometimes radically so. I've had posts bow and twist, sometimes as much as 30 degrees. Often, though, if the fence is constructed it will hold much of that movement in check.

There was a time where the earlier PT wood had some pretty toxic chemicals, primarily the bluish-green stuff. Most of the chemicals used now are fairly inert. ",1491004864

"anime","t5_2qh22","Most modern ballistic weapons are gas operated. 

A modern cartridge is made out of two parts: the bullet and the propellant. The propellant's job is to explode into a cloud of rapidly expanding gas, which then throws the bullet into bad guys. 

For automatic weapons and semi automatic weapons, the force of the gas of the propellant is also used to load the next cartridge into the barrel. 

Why do guns have multiple barrels? Well, a gun gets hot when fired. So, multiple barrels are used. One is loaded and the bullet fired out, and then the next, and then the next. If a multi-barrel Gatling gun has six barrels, each barrel is only firing one-sixth of the time and is far less likely to melt. 

You need to spin a ballistic Gatling gun to bring each barrel to the ammo belt. However, a laser usually doesn't use ammo. 

If you want spinning automatic lasers, though, there are excuses. You can have a lasing medium (the bit that actually produces the light) that gets consumed with every shot. So, maybe there's a tank of lasing medium up top that refills the laser with each shot. Kinda silly, and I don't really know why the lasing medium would be consumed with each shot, but whatever. 

I guess the ""advantage"" of a spinning laser weapon is that the laser would keep firing from one spot? ",1491004866

There's also the B-Wing episode where the B-Wing is described as being very fast and maneuverable and that's coming from a character who's going to be using A-Wings as the standard to be comparing it to.

The canon wipe sure seems to have included getting rid of the old specs and development stories of all the rebel fighters, you should probably just forget everything you think you know about them (which is really frustrating as a player of the X-Wing miniature game).",1491004867

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","* You aren't consistently taking or doing 1,000 dmg per second, much less ""per hit"".  A hero can output that level of damage for a second or two when they use all their damage cool downs, but then they are incapable of doing that much damage again until the cool down ends.   Multiple players on the enemy team using all their cooldowns at exactly the same time on you certainly increases the chance you will die if you aren't a tank, but by the time this is really punishing you generally have some defensive options.  Good positioning, peeling from you tank and healing from your support also make this a challenge for the other team.  There has to be some way to kill the opponent though.  
* If 2 gankers and the person in lane attack you and you aren't playing safely why shouldn't you die?  And wasn't the two gankers coming proactive play that was rewarded?  
* Team fights boiling down to ""pressing two buttons and either their whole team dies in a second or your whole team does"" isn't the way my games go or the way they go at high levels in general.  
* Death timers are long at the end of the game so that the game will end.  It's part of what keeps the average game time at 20 minutes or less.

It's fine for you to not like the game, but I don't expect these aspects to change.  If you just like the fighting and none of the laning, rotations, objectives, camps, ect then maybe [Battlerite](https://www.battlerite.com/) would be more to your tastes as an arena brawler.

Constant negative press has had an effect on celebrities and sportspeople in the past with ugly consequences, no matter how rich they were nor how adored. You may well say that 'it comes with it', or even that it works both ways; some celebrities milk the media's thirst for content and manipulate it to their own ends. This may well be true, but footballers are usually only in the press because they have a talent that has taken them to the top of their industry, an industry that happens to be the most popular sport in the world. This type of treatment is disgusting and frankly shameful and in no way justifiable, simply because it lacks basic human decency. The English press are especially guilty and are indefensible in my opinion. The most depressing thing is that said press is in many ways a mirror of society, and they only print what is demanded by the readership. ",1491004869

Under the law, I can go to New Jersey and carry every gun I own if I want to.

Of course, if I do that, I will be arrested, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned.  But I haven't broken the law... ok, I've broken NJ law, BUT that law runs contradictory to a higher law (2A) and if a higher law exists, that's the only one that matters.

Ultimately it should come down to SCOTUS ruling, in essence, do whatever you want- shall not be infringed.  

In the meantime, I view things like constitutional carry and reciprocity laws (national or otherwise) not as ""restoring rights"" or ""granting rights we already had"", but rather as laws to prohibit the state from infringing on those rights. 

Therefore, the best Constitutional Carry bill is not the one that says ""People can carry guns"" because that would be granting and already extant right.  Instead, a proper bill would read something like ""Be it enacted... ORC 2923.12 is hereby repealed"" (using OH statutes as an example- 2923.12 is the section that prohibits concealed weapons).

Laws do not permit, laws prohibit.  A proper Constitutional Carry law should not permit carry, but should prohibit restrictions on carry (by the state).",1491004870

* Urbanites: Live in the cities. 
* Outlanders: Live in the countryside. 
* Mariners: Live out in the ocean on ships. 

**The Low Born:** Furries. Conquered by the High Born and assimilated into High Born society. Short lived with lifespans less than forty years. Separated into many races;

* Canids: Dog people. First race conquered by the High Born. Fanatically loyal to the High Born. Usually the first pick when a High Born wants a wife.
* Felinids: Cat people. Prior to their conquest they were the most technologically advanced Low Born race with bronze weapons (not that it helped against High Born guns and tanks).
* Cetaceans: Whale people. Used exclusively by the Mariners for breeding. Huge (eight feet tall on average). They dislike anything related to the land.
* Rosids: Rose people. Hermaphrodites. They produce a pheromone that suppresses aggression in Low Born. They sleep standing up.
* Corvids: Crow people. Very smart. 
* Cervids: Reindeer people. Traditionally practice scrimshaw (bone carving) on their antlers. 
* Equids: Horse people. Traditionally practice self-flagellation. Tall (about a head taller than a High Born)
* Bovids: Cattle people. A traditional pastime among them involves running at another Bovid at full speed and trying to knock them unconscious with a headbutt. Tall (about a head taller than a High Born). 
* Caprids: Goat people. They worship a different God from the rest of Lovely Sweet Delight.
* Ovids: Sheep people. They produce wool.
* Helianthids: Sunflower people. Hermaphrodites. The smell of meat sends them into a feeding frenzy. They sleep standing up.
* Porcids: Pig people. Used as labour slaves.
* Vulpids: Fox people. Have a reputation for promiscuity.
* Murids: Rat people. Have a reputation of spreading disease. Short (half as tall as a High Born).
* Lagomorphs: Rabbit people. Used as breeding slaves (gives birth to up to eight children at a time). Short (half as tall as a High Born). Stupid. Docile. Weak. Small life spans (about eighteen years).",1491004874

Dozens of abortion clinics have closed and numerous reports have come out about women past 20 weeks being forced to carry pregnancies that weren't healthy or go to other states to terminate. 

The Republican controlled legislature destroyed the Texas Women's Heath program and lost 90% of it's funding which was paid by the federal government. The result was less women served with a list of ""providers"" that wouldn't provide reproductive healthcare services. 

We now have a surge in women going to Mexico to obtain abortions, self aborting, and have the highest maternal mortality rate in the 1st world. The Republican leadership has absolutely destroyed women's healthcare programs in this state over the past 6 years, and they're not done. There are current bills in session that will ban abortions past 20 weeks in cases of fetal anomalies and birth defects and allow doctors to lie to women about birth defects in order to prevent abortions.

Just a quick numbers example if effie had 20 hp 5 defense and 5 resistance in a +def case and she would be attacked once by a physical user (sword,lance,axe) for 10 damage it would be 

*20hp +5def+3(+def nature)-10damage=18hp after physical attack*

(I know the actual values consider triangle etc. but it's just to state the general point) if she were attacked by a magic user (tomes/staffs) for 10 damage 

*20hp+5res-10damage=15hp after magical attack*

now consider the case +hp

*20hp+3(+hp nature)+5def-10damage=18hp after physical attack*

Since basketball is effectively an entertainment venture though I wonder if that shouldn't be an element as well. MJ is basically responsible for the NBA boom, he was the face of it, and was effectively the most recognizable athlete worldwide for a while. IDK if anyone else on the list is at that level.

&gt; As many as 400,000 illegal immigrants arrive each year, though they are balanced by about the same number of illegal immigrants either returning home, dying or gaining some form of legal status, so their number remains static at slightly more than 11.1 million this decade.

This says the bulk of immigrants are already here, according to this [article](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/21/mass-immigration-costs-govt-296-billion-year-natio/?google_editors_picks=true) 

&gt;The fact is we don't know how many people cross the southern border. The whole ""undocumented"" thing and all. 

If you don't know how many people are crossing on foot, why are you for this wall? Since you didn't want to do the research, I did some light digging and found these stats from this [article](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-21)
&gt;The number of apprehensions of people attempting to cross illegally peaked in 2000, when America′s Border Patrol made more than 1.6m arrests, over 98% of which were of Mexicans. Over the course of George W. Bush′s administration, this number dropped to around 1m annually. During Barack Obama′s presidency, the rate fell even more precipitously, averaging just 400,000 a year. 

This article also gets the same number of 400,000 illegal immigrants coming over on foot every year. Which, stated by the last article averages out with the amount who die, return home, or get legal status. 
So why are we building a wall for foot traffic that doesn't even matter? ",1491004885

A couple ships would then go and find them, cap the ends (so they would float) and tow them back to shore. However, the refurbishing that had to be done to the orbiter and the SRMs for reuse was extensive and expensive, not to mention the cost of a new external tank.  This is where SpaceX shines (I'm assuming since I don't know their costs). They have a much nicer landing that doesn't expose the first stage to impact and salt water.

I'm not sure how much I can help you on pricing because I'm an extremely price sensitive buyer.  I do think you're on the right track to think that you shouldn't be trying to compete with the likes of Hamilton on price.  They are selling in enough quantity to really spread out their prototyping and other fixed costs.  

One strategy I admire is selling the basic watch at close to the marginal cost and trying to make up the sunk costs through add-ons -- PVD coating, a few perfectly matched straps, a watch roll, spring bar tool, wood box, ??? -- that are marked up a bit.  

That strategy brings in the price sensitive buyers who are willing to live with the base model and do the few small upgrades they care about on their own.  And, those who are less price sensitive can buy a ""luxury"" package that isn't all that price competitive.  Those buyers don't mind because they're getting the absolute best version of the thing.

Is is true that Arctis 5 has a better microphone because it can pick higher frequencies that Arctis 7 though?
If I could get your opinion, right now I'm between two rigs.

#1:
Arctis 7

Rival 300
#2:
Arctis 5

Rival 700

In your personal opinion, which rig would you pick and why? I'm a FPS player, just FYI.
Thank you again!",1491004886

You may be interested in discussing at /r/pornfree.

Anyways, since you are in a relationship, you may consider trying having sex without the orgasm part.

You may have an easier time if you make this rule: To not look at pictures of women to look at women. 

* Look at a presentation you are interested in with a woman presenter: Ok. 

* Looking up pictures of that presenter afterwards: Not Ok. 

* Looking at a photograph about something where there is women: Ok.

* Looking at pictures of women because they are women: Not ok.

You will probably be best served if you learn to tame your mind, which becomes easier when you do not fill it with images that only serves to signal: Look at these women because of their female form and the simulated eye contract they give me.

When you only want to avoid P, you may want to initiate sex with your partner, and if they passes on it, then go and masturbate - or at least suggest that to your partner and see if they think it is an good idea. Imagine your partner always coming to you for sex before choosing to masturbate if you said no, I think that would be preferred to the alternative.

Anyways, good luck.",1491004887

I think a guy like Roman could get there. He's got the looks, the hype, but hasn't gotten the outside of WWE exposure yet.

I'm a big Bayley fan, more so than /r/Sc on average. But you can't put her next to a bunch of marines or in front of a bunch of moms on some god forsaken terrible TV show and get that draw.

You need James Bond cool (Sean, not the others).

No. More. Animation!!! Well, I have some more to share in this regard from the week's progress, but I'm done with it all, so that's a relief. A few snippets of animation from what I've been working on:

* [Mapgen visualizer](http://i.imgur.com/GzmI8pG.gif)
* [""Tracking""](http://i.imgur.com/HToLhGt.gif)
* [A closing-type animation I won't be using, but recorded anyway](http://i.imgur.com/2xEL7vn.gif)

Broken animations are fun, too :P

* [""Does this mapgen seem off to you?""](http://i.imgur.com/nghBGN9.gif)
* [""Yeah that's not quite right, either...""](http://i.imgur.com/A7Gka73.gif)
* [""Still?""](http://i.imgur.com/yHPwJsS.gif)

So now I'm on to designing the very last batch of missing story content, among other things.

I've always been somewhat annoyed at the long string of numbers that make up a random seed, and yesterday I came up with a fun to way replace them. Taking a cue from gfycat, Cogmind's random seeds are now actual words, or more specifically a combination of three words, two adjectives followed by a noun. The result of each is a fake item name, because the individual words are all sourced from the game's item list itself! It's pretty fun :)

* [Sample list of random seeds](http://i.imgur.com/OfmT1yw.png)

There are plenty of combinations possible so there is effectively no loss of randomness. It's just a better, more human, way to handle seeds. Plus I'm sure they'll be cause for the occasional laugh!

**REXPaint**

I added a quick patch for a feature requested by /u/dagondev, showing the ID/value for the currently selected glyph:

* [Glyph ID demo](http://i.imgur.com/iGtm1fx.gif)

If you want this get it [here](http://www.gridsagegames.com/forums/index.php?topic=767.msg5979#msg5979). (Like many of the individual feature request patches over recent months, this will be included in the next proper release.)

In semi-dev-related news (partially because it caused me to pause my work for a bit :P), literally right at the moment I finished all my animation work and was about to switch gears to start doing other things, mother nature animated a boulder on the mountain right outside our building and sent it down the slope to smash through the neighbor's roof :/

I was of course a bit suspicious at the loud boom and my shaking chair, but couldn't see anything outside to indicate what had happened so sat back down until the firetruck in the distance made me think twice and, yep, it was headed right here.

* [Um, yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/hhpMEMe.jpg)

Luckily no one was *in there*!

"Military","t5_2qh8y","&gt; it is closer to a system of merit because it allows for all to make an attempt and that makes us stronger

I'd take issue with that concept, because the pretense there is that everyone has a right to make an attempt. That isnt a viable way forward because affording everyone an attempt diverts resources away from where they are needed. In this way, we can either have an ""all volunteer"" force, in which anyone is free to volunteer to do anything, or an ""all recruited"" force, in which individuals are recruited for and placed into roles in which they will provide the greatest benefit to the service. We have medical criteria that will disqualify an individual, even though a small percentage of individuals with that condition would likely succeed. We have test score criteria that keeps lower performing (academically) or lower educated individuals out of highly technical jobs, even though some of them would likely learn and adapt just fine. Where are the rights of those individuals to make an attempt?

&gt; People thought the service was going in the shitter with integration. This is no different.

It's a bit different. It's racist to say that a white man with an 8th grade education and a black man with an 8th grade education will perform differently in combat, or that the white man is smarter by nature of his genetics. Is it sexist to say that men and women perform within a different set of physical standards, as demonstrated and reinforced by Collegiate and Professional sports? If not, then is it fiscally responsible to divert resources in order to train those few women who perform within male norms? If yes, or if the taxpayers demand it, should we make an effort to attract women to these roles? If yes, why?",1491004891

2) Build order is a little off, if you do it perfectly you should have 900 gas the moment your spire finishes. 

3) Honestly, there's not very much to say past the 7:30 mark. At that point, the terran had won the game. Since this wasn't a particularly high level game, he wasn't able to finish the game for another 10 minutes, but yeah. The fact he won here can go back to point 1, where you had no idea he had pushed out and caught you completely unaware. However, he shouldn't of been able to do nearly as much damage as he did had you microed your mutas properly. It seems to me you're not aware of muta stacking. 

Here's a liquipedia page on muta: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Mutalisk_Harassment
and a quick tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqQYJzq7o0&amp;feature=channel_page

4) You did play correctlyish from here, you went straight into lurkers. Nevertheless, you didn't immediately research lurker aspect nor immediately morph your hydras. Had you done those in time, you probably would've had your lurkers in time to hold the second push. Also, the moment that you can morph hydras, you should have two of them at your third base so you can put them on the ramp.

5) You researched hydra speed, unless they're going mech do not research hydra speed. 

You were building too many hydras. Hydras have little value vs. bio, and really should only be built for morph into lurkers. Spend your extra minerals on zerglings.",1491004891

* There will be something with her job big, but wouln't be a real issue, but more responsability, don't worry (She worked at a gas station, first thing she knew is it was sold. She got a promotion, same salary... same task, just officialised the position.)

* Grandmother have a fatal illness (kidney failure, terminal stade) since a few years (2), but it will be ok (3.5 now, still kicking, survived influenza, went over a pneumonia, few medications that had an high chance of finishing her kidney... she's kinda immortal)

* and more details that I forgot.

That medium went straight to the points, so it wasn't some fact extraction... 

In the other past stuff, she talked about my aunt's death and grand father's one, and their general way they died... I think she said like: aunt: something about the brain and headache, she died of a brain aneuvrist. her last words: ""I need to hang up, I have a massive headache"", she lost conciousness less than 30 seconds later.
For grand father, she said he was in a bad shape... trouble breathing, intestine... fear... pain... He died from a mix of pneumonia, rectum cancer, general weakness. He also was constipated. They gave him some morphine due to the pain, he was on oxygen for the pneumonia... his system gave up then, 5 hours later his hospital admission he died.
She also talked about my mother that took care of my 2 cousins.

So, she somehow got the past, present and future.


So far, the only thing that still isn't completed is my youngest cousin that can't have baby and will adopt. She is in the process of doing it and she expect to get a call in april (they confirmed that there is not many persons on the waiting list, and it should be this april due to the lack of adoptive parents.

But strategically in Koah Rong she dominated by convincing people to turn on their allies, getting to the final 2 despite having her allies medevaced, etc.  This season she is just playing a very UTR game and got blindsided at the last tribal, but Malcolm and JT (maybe Tony?) have both stated that they're rooting for her to do well, so her social game might be getting better, too.",1491004895

-Spikeridged steed

-blazecaller and the discover elemental

-grievous bite

-vilespine slayer is the new assassinate for the new untargetables

-spiritslinger umbra is the new brann

-gluttonous ooze replaces acidic swamp 

-tar creeper

-stonehill defender

-Radiant elemental

-arcanologist as a freeze mage tutor

-elemental cost reduction chap

-shaman call in the Finishers quest

-mage whole variety of different otks quest

-Warrior quest

-priest quest and nzoth

-4 mana 7/7 +1 (although it's not necessarily stronger than fel reaver in all cases)


Edit, looks like I'm about 12/15, only thing I'm totally head over heels wrong about is spikeridged which I thought would literally save paladin


okay card predictions

-most of hunter's haul from this set looks fine or better, expect good use of the new nerubian egg

-honestly I'm expecting good things from the priest legendary, its spells are low cost so you usually chain out three of them in a row without dropping card advantage. A load of them draw cards too, and if your opponent leaves it be then the're kinda screwed. It's a really, really good gadgetzan auctioneer for a class that would ordinarily never run it.

-Druid legendary is very, very hard to get rid of, even on turn 10. could be really troublesome if druid can hold out til then. Its issue is that it wastes a turn achieving fuck all if your opponent is looking to go face

-paladin difficult to activate sixteen damage quest

-Hunter turn 5 8/8 quest

-Warlock run out of cards and then try to outvalue and stall the 
game with a discard deck which mostly just contains aggressive cards quest
EDIT: what I meant to say was warlock deathwing quest

-Druid quest is probably fine, could be too slow to bother with but there's a 3 drop from wotog that goes well into this deck and possible high rolls on adapt

Edit: I actually ranked all but the rogue and shaman quest pretty successfully, these lot are looking to be the bottom four quest decks. No clue where lyra and tyrantus will fit in, think lyra might just sneak into nzoth quest priest. hunter's haul is indeed going almost directly into all hunter decks. new nerubian might live on in new zoo considering the amount of boardclear going round, even if it is less suited to the aggro style of zoo I think will be best in this meta, and lacks PO as an activator.


only in fun decks
-ozruk

-secret finder murloc is total garbo

-rogue banter quest

-druid timmy quest combined with hemet to mill yourself 

Edit: to be fair i forgot that returning cards to your hand would work, and can honestly say I had rogue quest down as about 3 stars and was complaining it was being undervalued when I was watching trump's reviews, pretty proud of my predictions, but didn't see rogue quest coming before turn 5, just assumed it'd be hitting on t8 at best without checking. By the end of the runup to release I had the quest deck rankings down as something like warrior/shaman/mage &gt; priest &gt; Rogue &gt; Hunter/pally &gt; druid/warlock. Right now I think warrior &gt; shaman/rogue &gt; priest &gt; mage &gt; hunter &gt; warlock &gt; druid &gt;&gt; paladin

Edit: holy dicks shaman quest is worse than i was expecting
Also worth noting that the secret murloc is seeing play everywhere and deathrattle hunter is awful compared to what I was implying, and the elemental cost reduction chap is a freakin 1/1 do nothing and sees no play anywhere. But the majority of these are pretty fair, feelsgoodman",1491004895

I was going to reference this post, but then I decided I should just reply to it directly. 

You said that insurance is a stupid hurdle that could delay a project for 5 years. If you ask Elon Musk whether he feels as if insurance is a stupid hurdle, he'd call you an idiot. If you went to Musk and asked him to write a life insurance policy covering an event in which you planned to base jump from the eifel tower naked with no parachute, do you think he'd just be like yeah thats fine give me 10,000 and I'll pay your family $1 mil if you die. The answer is.... Wait for it.... No. He'd want a shit ton of information so that he could figure out how likely he'd have to pay out that $1 mil and charge you premiums that are in line with the risk.

It sounds like you think some executive was sitting up in his office and was like fuck it, I'll bet on Musk, let's do this shit. What really happened was that a bunch of fucking underwriting gurus (probably from London) analyzed a shit ton of data (and the rocket itself) and determined exactly how much more likely a loss was to occur. They determined that it wasn't much more likely and adjusted the premiums accordingly. 

I hope by reading this you learned something about not only insurance, but about the fact that you're really not nearly as intelligent as you think you are. ",1491004898

[Staffordshire oatcakes](http://www.staffordshireoatcakes.com) are like a savoury pancake but made with oatmeal instead of flour. I believe this was due to oats growing better/easier in the region rather than wheat. Best filled with sausage, bacon and cheese in my opinion. ",1491004899

Valve?

i also didn't say that they were the worst company. I said that they were the worst when it comes to providing an actual QUALITY service. 

And you are no longer worth talking to because you just don't understand the issue at hand. You're just defending Valve for no real purpose it seems even when facts are laid out in front of you. I am not reponsible for providing a business model, in fact that contributes nothing at all to what the problem is. If I were to the manager there, I'd be churning out new things that are actually quality, and paying attention to small details as they have used to.

I also laid it out for you already. Warframe even has releases weekly for things. This isn't to say that Valve needs to be that productive, its just that they seriously have a lot to work on to measure up in any way, shape, or form.",1491004899

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Its not sexist, its reality. It is human nature. I guarantee you that among your social circle, every single guy has thought about every single woman in their group. The important distinction is that most decent people who have some social skills have trained themselves to not let that bubble up to the surface - but those thoughts are still lurking there and to some degree influences their behavior. 

That carries over into gamer culture such that you'll find more men in gamer culture who lack social skills and therefore don't know how to suppress their thoughts. They end up wearing their emotions/thoughts on their sleeves which makes everyone uncomfortable. 

Can men and women be friends? I said most can't, and I think its true. Some can if they train themselves well enough. But even then, even if they'd never admit to it openly - they've had non platonic thoughts. Even your upstanding morally righteous citizens aren't immune. The difference is its socially polite to just keep it a thought and not make a pass. For some, that just requires too much effort in what is supposed to be recreational time when people just want to relax and not worry about offending anyone.

As far as I can tell, most women don't behave like men in that respect. They can have a perfectly platonic relationship with a man and never have a non platonic thought. But that isn't true when it comes to most men, they've thought about it. 

I'm not condoning it. I'm just saying it happens.  You give that ""friend"" an opening, and he'll drive hard to the basket so fast you'd think he was LeBron James. ",1491004900

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; If you left a child alone in nature, and this child survived to adulthood without human contact, you propose they would have a religion?

Maybe not in their lifetime, but give it a couple of generations and I could definitely see this.

&gt;Theism is a cultural mechanism, designed to grant mystics power over the masses.

It can take this form, but human beings are ""meaning-making machines."" It's what gives us an edge: we are always looking for connections, and ways to exploit those connections. We are naturally analytical problem solvers.

The trick is that this innate instinct works well for killing and skinning buffalo but isn't so good for determining where lightning comes from, or explaining the moon and the sun, or puzzling out whether the universe has meaning to it. It has taken us a couple of hundred thousand years to get to the point where we can figure those things out. Meanwhile, other ways of forcing the world to make sense came into being.

It's telling that so many gods have human traits an emotions: we're just projecting ourselves onto things we don't understand and assigning them characteristics that we *can* understand.

&gt;The human brain has evolved to be deeply curious about nature, not necessarily to see a magical agent at work, only to wonder at it.

The human brain has evolved to make connections between things. Sometimes it makes connections where it has no reason to. That often takes the form of a magical agent.

Just think about how many people are superstitious and have a lucky charm, or a certain way of doing something that brings them luck. Same thing.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Fair progression is exactly the problem.

Because level 11 onwards is the same xp per level. The only disadvantage that old accounts have is the lost progression for 1-10.

So if they changed the 70 chest thing to just be all the rewards from 1-10 (if their char is 1-10 of course) and no bonus for levels after 11, then there's no progression disadvantage.

Because levels don't matter, another solution is to simply reset the xp for the next 10 levels that are earned on each char after the patch. not resetting the levels, just the xp per level for the next 10 per char.

Currently there's no reason to play any character that is under 10. If an account level is already 500 then they're only getting 5 epic chests for the extra 500 levels to hit the 100 cap. There's no reason for them to play any character and lose so much easy progression and loot boxes. If they play the char now from 1-10 they get literally nothing moving into the new system. If they wait, they get 10 loot boxes instead of 5 for the same amount of work.. if there's a couple of characters they get bonus gems as well (and still get nothing moving because they need at least 100 levels).

The current system is encouraging people to not even play the game fully until 2.0, that's not a good system.",1491004902

The logical assumption, based on the scientific evidence is that there is no such creature and people are just misidentifying other known animals. So you somehow think it is logical to approach an unknown animal that you are unable to identify simply because you have heard stories that ""Bigfoot"" is not aggressive, and you can't identify this animal so it must be a bigfoot... yes.. very logical

"DBZDokkanBattle","t5_384a7","I just picked up the game last week. It's very fun but I am a little lost. I've read a number of beginners guides, but they don't seem to cover my questions. I apologize in advance for being so clueless.

I have 7 SSR characters (most are max lvl) and a bunch of SRs. I'm working through the story and trying to do some of the weeklies. With my best team the very hard strike missions are impossible and I'm even struggling with some of the hards. What should I be doing at this point? Gathering more gems and just doing multisummons?

Should I only be z awakening SSR characters since you can only z awaken once? Are SR characters completely pointless?

I get how to feed 5 N characters into each other to make a z awakening N for maximum exp boost in training, but what's the point of training? Xp for my characters (like zene) really isn't an scarce reasource.

Is there no way to make a max level SSR stronger other than miraculously getting a duplicate for training to up their special attack power?  

Thanks in advance. I'm really just wondering how I should be playing the game and spending my time/items are this point.",1491004904

I think it is. I have the idea, that i probably share with quite a few people, that there is a globalist agenda.

But, I see no mention of unemployment here. It varies state by state, but in California you still get unemployment if you quit a job if you feel you were ""pushed out"" of the job. 

When I worked in HR, a guy quit and two weeks later I get a notice that he filed for unemployment. I tried to fight the unemployment because he quit on his own. The unemployment office called and said he felt pushed out by management. I said he had good reviews from management and never filed a complaint ever. They said ""oh well, he says he was pushed out so we're giving him unemployment."" Shit, one time we fired someone for STEALING and they still gave him unemployment. Practically anyone can get unemployment. If she hates her job so much that it's effecting her life, quitting and surviving on employment until she finds a new job isn't that crazy of a thing to do. But it puts a lot of pressure on you and there's a lot of risk.

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","Little bit of an odd question, but I was told by a few friends to consider buying used/refurbished/second-hand Keyboards off of /r/mechmarket, since my budget is only like ~$50-75 USD maximum, and I want a pretty decent keyboard (prefer TKL) with Brown Switches. The often-tossed around suggested Keyboard is the QFR, which new is around $100, but used apparently can go down to $50-60 sometimes?!? 

Could anyone walk me through some of the Pros and Cons of buying a keyboard from someone on /r/mechmarket, ignoring (for now) the obvious ""Con"" that there is potential for scamming? For instance, how can I ""ensure"" the quality of my keyboard if I buy it off of /r/mechmarket? I would rather pass on a keyboard or buy a new keyboard off of Amazon than risk spending $50 and having it break or run into issues--at least if it runs into issues and I buy it from a retailer, then I can always (usually) send it in for a refund/replacement, so I have that ""peace of mind"".

------------------

And if buying second-hand isn't a bad idea from /r/mechmarket, does anyone have any suggestions of keyboards that might be normally out of my price range, but buying second-hand, could be within my price range of ~$50-75? (Prefer cheaper if possible, of course). 

Ideal Keyboard is TKL; Full-Size is okay, nothing smaller than TKL though. Prefer Brown Switches, definitely no Blues. Reds I'm on the fence about. Prefer some simple backlighting, RGB is a bonus but completely unecessary, but backlighting is not a must if the rest of the keyboard is very good (a la QFR). Prefer non-floating key style to minimize noise and for travelling safety if possible. 

Thanks!",1491004911

"NarutoFanfiction","t5_2yhj6","Ino spat on the grave. It was surprisingly satisfying, but she quickly looked around to make sure no-one had seen it. Luckily, she was still alone as she watched the trail of spittle slowly roll down the portrait of Danzo embedded in the gravestone.

It wasn't the first time, and she bleakly realised it wouldn't be the last. Sai always struggled a little, but occasionally it got too much for him and she'd have to give him some space. Ino always came here. Sometimes she just defaced the grave a little, sometimes she ranted at it, and sometimes she cried.

Right now she wanted to do all three. He'd brainwashed *children*, and those that were still alive were effectively crippled during peacetime. Some of the other ex-ROOT members were incredibly paranoid, or had massive amounts of anxiety, or were simply acutely depressed. Two had killed themselves in the last year alone.

She would do *anything* to help Sai recover, but she still felt helpless.

And then she heard him, off in the distance. He was shouting with joy. Ino turned around, trying to spot him, but he wasn't there. *Up,* she thought, and she saw half a dozen huge painted birds soar and whirl against the ocean-blue sky. Whenever they flew upside down, she could barely make out the riders. Sai led them, clearly the most skilled, and following his intricate dance were the other ex-ROOT members.

It was a breathtaking scene. Ino found herself unconsciously playing with her hair, falling back into the old habit of fiddling with something - anything - when she was nervous. She knew her husband was skilled, but even for him this was something beyond the norm.

At last Sai came hurtling down, twisting and turning in an incredible aerobatic display. ""Would you like a ride?"" he asked, flashing her a rare grin as he neatly perched his mount next to her. Ino kissed him as she strapped herself into the harness behind him, tying her hair back out of her eyes with an elastic band. She didn't want to miss a single moment.

And they flew off into the blue.

&gt; In an earlier discussion, I mentioned that I think Handsome John is Michael's uncle Jack that died in the war.

Your Handsome John/Jack prediction sounds solid, the breadcrumbs you've noticed definitely seem to be leading there.  (Plus, now that I think about it (and forgive me if you mentioned this in earlier discussion), but I believe the name Jack can be a nickname for John.)

If this is the case, I wonder why John is keeping that from Michael.  But based on this chapter it doesn't seem like John is 100% sure why either haha.

&gt; I suspect that Kaff is Marla Roberta Stiles.

Wow, that never occurred to me but the way you've laid it out makes total sense!  I was thinking she might possibly be Henry's granddaughter/great-granddaughter or something.  But, yeah, the way you put it really adds up (and that would be quite an inspiring character arch).

As far as Freddy Allen possibly helping her survive the attack, that's extra trippy because he had previously thought about attacking her himself!

&gt; Saint Ragener, mentioned on page 634, was also referenced in ""November Saints"" in Moore's previous novel Voice of the Fire.

Man, I really need to read Voice of the Fire.  That's cool that there are overlapping characters.  I know it also takes place in Northampton and features a variety of eras.  I wonder if the reality of the two books could technically exist concurrently.

Background: An ancient prophecy tells that a great destroyer would one day come to destroy the world from his prison deep beneath the earth, the gods and existence itself. It has been said that this morning would come after a night when no wind blew and the seas were flat. Spelling the end to this existence and beginning a new one. Almost no one knows that this day happened exactly 700 years ago. 

The Eternal Aegis is a small and secretive order of powerful mages, druids, clerics (etc.) that stretches across racial, religious and political borders, has been working to combat that prophecy. They have been by and large successful. The world has remained four centuries longer than it was supposed to. 

But the Destroyer has not sat idly by. His efforts to break into this world put constant strain on the wards formed by the Aegis, requiring their constant upkeep and occasional pressure release. While the Aegis at first thought they had succeeded completely, it was 50 years later that the order had to reconvene in full. Their barriers were failing and they could not maintain the wards. So a risky plan, to allow a small momentary gap to relieve pressure was attempted. They accepted the risk; a city collapsed. This pattern has continued ever since.

Lushen can be used in all 3. I use one to clear the crystals quickly and he just dies at the boss

Xiao lin can work in all 3, providing very good damage in necro, and not as much but still good damage in gb10/db10 (the first and second skills hit hard enough, and occasionally a 3rd skill hit will hit as well)

A lot of water units can work in gb10+db10, and multihit wind units can work in gb10+nb10

Nat5s that work well in all 3 include: Beth, Teshar, Praha, Seara

I've done something similar to use as few monsters as possible for pve~

NB10: Lushen, Zaiross, Hwahee, Astar, Water Lich

DB10: Lumi, Lushen, Zaiross, Astar, Stella

GB10: Lushen, Stella, Hwa, Chasun, Bernard

I use 10 different monsters for the 3 dungeons, with Chasun, Bernard, Lushen, Zaiross also used in AO/GWO; Hwa, Stella, Hwahee, Astar also used in r5/elemental raids. Only lumi and water lich are used in only one place (db10 and nb10 respectively), so I feel pretty good about it~",1491004919

I live in small town and we have no official movie theater here. So we were all quite surprised to hear that they are going show new Star Wars movie in our town at the date of release! Actually TWO days before the movie hits in the US! The fact that we got to see it two days before the US was really crazy and everyone who were there really appreciated it.

There were cheers for millennium falcon, Chewie and Han, laughs for funny jokes and gasps for other scenes (and maybe some sobs too).  And when the movie ended everyone started clapping. THAT was really awesome moment and that is my best movie theater experience so far. It's think that's pretty hard to top off.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","&gt; So cosmetic items are not game content by your argument. What a world we live in!

they do not affect the gameplay of dota. what runescape and warframe sells is inherently different from what dota sells.  
  
also runescape providing fantastic quality? are you shitting me? it's a game marketed at middle school children. it's literally a prime example of a grindfest. the whole game revolves around reading guides on how to do an action most efficiently, and then repeating that action hundreds of thousands of time.  
  
i don't call a game that automated bots can beat quality, not at all.  
  
&gt; And game content also consists of community oriented material which Valve once used to provide, hence holiday events.  
  
you mean like dark moon?  
  
&gt; And game content also consists of community oriented material which Valve once used to provide, hence holiday events.  
  
no... not at all... except runescape is subscription based and warframe has a game economy revolving around premium currency only attainable with real money.  
  
i'm wondering now... are you dumb, or just trying to be obnoxious because you can't admit that your statements that  

* valve is greedier than any other company  
* valve produces bad content  
  
are easily proven to be false?  
  
if they're so greedy, why is DotA2 a free game with monthly updates? then why isn't valve even a publicly traded company? why don't they sell stock?  
  
if dota is so shit and low quality, then why has it been consistently rated the best game in its genre?",1491004921

Eu me exponho a muita gente, tenho muitos hobbies e acabo conhecendo pessoas, não sou o tipo de cara que é amigo de todo mundo, mas um ou dois bons amigos de cada grupo já somam um bom número.

Eu acho que parte disso vem do estereótipo com que pareço o ""gordinho gente boa"", as pessoas acham que porque eu sou gordo e baixinho eu não tenho a opção de ser babaca, sou um coitadinho etc, em geral se aproximam e percebem que não tenho nada haver com o estereótipo, não é raro eu ouvir um ""quem te vê não tem ideia de quem você é"".

Não sei se o lance de hobbies em grupo vai ser eficaz pra você, eu pessoalmente acho(baseado em porra nenhuma) que amizade feminina é mais complicada, mas se você se expor a mais gente vai encontrar alguém legal e essa pessoa pode te apresentar aos círculos dela e por ai vai.

The difference between DDR3 and 4 in regards to real-world performance wasn't terribly significant, though it might be a different story with DDR5. Whether or not it makes much of a difference to the average user is still to be seen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thats it for me. Reply devs or dont...im not creating anymore threads. 

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;I will personally hold you to this :O

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;On the topic of Widow. Does she need buffs? No. Could she use some minor tweaks? Perhaps. Widow's balance sits on a knife's edge. Trust me when I say you don't want widow meta. That was a thing way back in the beginning days, when a full charge body shot on Zen would kill him instantly.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Yes you truely can. Im a man of my word. Ill never ask for a widow change or new thread for it after this one. Im done. Promise you. 

&gt;

&gt;No buffs. Minor tweaks i would say. I trust you have a good mind when it comes to the meta so i believe you but i love playing as her too much and hate how her kit is now...

Here is how it would be tracked: ISP keeps track of connections, InterPol can get warrants in many countries to access them. To start a botnet attack it requires someone to connect to them to start the attack. Now it's just the case of following the string of IPs, if there is correlation between multiple bots to the same original address then you have found your attacker. This becomes harder with VPNs but not impossible when you have access to the Tier 1 ISP network logs.

however, yet again you have posted no evidence to prove this was a DDoS attack. On top of that you claim me to be ignorant of a topic yet you sound more ignorant on the topic. Especially when you think a botnet is hosted on a single beach in Somalia. Do you even understand what the distributed part of DDoS stands for?

You can still be rosecuted for what you did.  If Flynn testifies and gets immunity he becomes essentially impossible to prosecute.

Even further, prosecutors are typically sneaky and don't want media.  If Flynn was serious, and had serious information he would've asked for immunity quietly.  Since he did it very publicly,  which would anger prosecutors, it means he isn't about to reveal anything that would help the prosecutor.  Immunity for real testimony is almost always approached very discretely.

"GlobalOffensiveTrade","t5_2y6r4","We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

Data is a little old, but you can see that incorrect stereotype of Asians being overly successful/the model minority depends heavily on a very specific population of Asian-Americans, who generally emigrate from developed countries and have higher education.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Don't fret! The more you have to lose, the more dramatic your weight loss will be at first, and the first week (or two) of eating healthier is always a lot of water weight. If you're eating healthier you're probably consuming less sodium, and eating low-carb you're consuming far less sugar. Both excess salt and sugar bloat and cause water weight, which could account for several pounds of the ten you lost.

An often accepted rule in the medical community is to lose no more than 1% of your body weight per week. So, a little over 2lbs per week for you currently, and then more slowly as your weight decreases. I'd encourage you to start tracking calories and learn how to cook to set yourself for success later in life. If only someone had taught me to cook and calorie count from my teenhood, I could have avoided this whole mess!

The best advice I can give, though, is this: right now, only concern yourself with the process. When I was younger, I would always tell myself, 'I just want to be X lbs by some date...some vacation, seeing an old friend, a new semester, a new season.' It's great to have goals--keep making them. However, 190 by June may be fairly aggressive. Being too aggressive with my own weight loss rules and goals nearly always lead me to more binging. If you burn out, you will be discouraged. Instead, keep going and remember that slow progress is better than no progress.",1491004936

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Congress also lacks the essential expert knowledge that those in the Fed possess

Then use them for their expert opinion, but move the power to enact changes to Congress. Our current representatives don't have expert knowledge in most of the policies they deal with, so I don't think they would necessarily need detailed financial knowledge to decide whether their experts proposals are in line with their constituents' best interests.

&gt; Not to mention that the interest rates being talked about are between banks and the Fed; moving this part out of the Fed or out of the government necessarily removes the interest rate which is being trying to be regulated.

And we should stop regulating them. I don't see why the government needs to be involved in interest rates unless they become predatory, and that's not really what the Fed does anyway.

&gt; If you want 5 to be an emergency power of the President or Congress, you would need to hold each to far higher standards of financial knowledge

Why? We give the President control of the military and the nuclear launch codes, and Congress has the power to declare war. I doubt either branch is especially prepared to deal with war strategy themselves, so they have resident experts to help them decide what they should do. I'm mostly talking about changing the Fed to an advisory role instead of their current, quite powerful role.

&gt; if you expect any actions to actually be taken

And that's part of it. I prefer for actions to be taken very rarely so the market can work itself out.

&gt; 6.1 and 6.2 are handled by injecting money (aka printing more) into the area. There is no way a government can leave this to a private institution.

Not the printing money part, but loaning and transferring money between parties. 6.1 (transactions between parties) is especially ripe for privatization, especially since credit card payments are already handled privately. I don't think the government should be in the business of handing out loans to private businesses; it should restrict itself to borrowing money from the populace (bonds) and lending money to foreign governments (only after congressional approval).

&gt; 7 most certainly is not well defined, but I would also argue that no private institution would have the ability to entertain thoughts of such a goal

I agree, but I don't know enough about what that bullet point means to say whether there's anything there to actually discuss. It's vague, so I opt for no comment here.

&gt; Out of all the institutions of the government, I believe the Fed is the worst one you could have chosen

There are plenty of people in the libertarian camp who want to end the Fed entirely, so I presented it as a middle-ground opinion where the role of the Fed could be transformed. Neither Democrats or Republicans talk much about it beyond audits.

I mostly chose it because it's symbolic of arbitrary government regulations (why does the government more-or-less control interest rates?).

&gt; the Fed, in my opinion, is one of the best run arms of the government.

And I disagree. I feel like they completely mishandled the 2008 crisis and everything leading up to it. Since they weren't able to prevent the crisis, I wonder what real value they bring for all of their involvement in the market.

Yes, without the Fed, we wouldn't have our steady inflation, but is that really a bad thing?

&gt; Personally, I would have chosen the FDA as such an institution that could, in theory, entertain thoughts of privatization

I honestly don't know enough about the FDA to make an intelligent argument (beyond drug testing, which has been very mishandled IMO in the past). I was looking for something that could be partially privatized without losing too much of the benefit that they actually provide.

&gt; Some functions of government I do not see any sort of service or product to monetize.

And that's why I picked the Fed since you can monetize money transfers between banks (e.g. ACH), which already works with credit and debit cards. Also, loans are already well defined, so without the Fed banks would just have to figure that out between themselves (which they already do, the Fed is just there to make liquidity easier), which would hopefully result in less risk taking.",1491004939

It also doesn't matter how you score a run, or win a game, or get to the post-season, and none of that informs a batter in the box how to approach that AB.  I've argued about this a ton on r/astros and r/baseball...

I disagree with this, but I do understand the frustration with dealing with a large group of people that buy into sabermetrics. I don't know if you care about the StatCast metrics, but these kind of data analytics should help bridge the gap between traditional and new-age fans. These really tell more how a player is playing presently versus Sabermetrics more oriented towards evaluating past performance. 

&gt; I hate the way other countries and cultures act at a ballgame. I'm not saying I hate other countries and cultures, I just can't stand the fucking bongos and trumpets and vuvuzelas and whatever else they bring, and the fucking CEASELESS noise they create. Watching a ballgame in Japan sounds like a pretty terrible experience to me because of this. I don't get it. Baseball isn't soccer. Leave your drums at home, and give me a chance to soak in the atmosphere of the park! From what I understand, though, that's probably the most unpopular baseball opinion of all time.

Yeah, I 100% disagree with this. Baseball may have been ""imported"" into the countries by Americans, but the growth and development of baseball in these areas was mostly thanks to the indigenous people of their respective countries. I don't think we as Americans have the right to tell other countries how their fan experience should be.

Also, watching and listening to the crowd noise for NPB games is a great viewing experiece... especially since I don't know a lick of Japanese and can't understand the commentary. 

And, quite frankly, the dull and artifically-induced fan atmosphere of MLB games sickens me more. What appeal do people have with quiet afternoons in the middle of the summer heat, just lounging around and not having any emotional investment in the game? People consider 1:00 games in the dogs days of summer the pinnacle of watching baseball live. Fuck that! I love late-night games in the fall where the seats are packed, the fans are drunk and rowdy, and the stadium erupts like an earthquake each time a home team runner scores. For baseball leagues like the NPB, that's the fan experience EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. Not just Opening Week, not just amid the playoff hunt in late-August to September, not just during the playoffs. That's how the atmosphere is every night.

What I do carry is 6 weeks of food.  Foil packet tuna (costs more, but soooo much less mess it's worth it), instant rice, cases of sams branded water, instant mashed potatoes, ramen cups, canned olives and fruit, ect.  My only cooking utensil is one of those cheap ass roadpro hotpots.  Does about 20oz of water up pretty easily, slower than snail shit but whatever.  I can pour the hot water on the rice and boom, food.  Hot water in ramen, quick snack for a 30.  And I use my bunk heater to warm up the tuna.  Ghetto but it works!

I spend about 50/week on food and that includes random snacks from fuel stops.  Sometimes I just gotta have me my gummy bears, ya know?  My home restocking, that 6 weeks of food, is under 150 bucks.  Most useful things I've got is seasonings.  You can make a LOT of meals with rice and some seasonings, change it up and not get bored.

My one big missing one is dairy.  I've got instant pudding cups (hey, they sell it hot, you can store it hot, get creative with your drawers!), but those aren't much dairy, so I sometimes go nuts on the cheese when I get near the mothership.",1491004943

"beermoney","t5_2s5or","The most popular and most common types of online earning sites are either survey sites, watching videos, doing offers, or doing microtask type jobs.



There are a limited amount of survey routers and offer walls available for sites to host. So the majority of PTC and gpt sites are always going to have very similar and possibly identical ways to earn available.



But sites are different in other ways. The differences are usually in the rate of pay per task, the methods of payment, the cash out processing times and minimums, account verification requirements, and customer support.


These are the things that make sites that seem identical on the surface very very different.



I always try to stress to new people that when dealing with gpt\ptc sites once you have tried a few of the most popular ones that you will have basically saw what is available as far as earning methods for these kind of sites.


For example once you've tried instagc, Swagbucks, clixsense, and grindabuck then you will have saw pretty much every available offer wall and survey router you are going to find on a gpt site.



All these survey routers and offer walls are going to work exactly the same on all the sites. The site hosting the walls and routers has absolutely nothing to do with the inner workings of the offers or surveys, so pretty much if you can't make offers credit on instagc's peanut labs then you can't do them any easier on grindabuck.



But as far as legit, honest, and reliable methods of online earning sites that require zero investment the choices are very limited",1491004943

I won't really hold that against him in comparison to another player who's been mostly injury-free throughout his career or has a game that ages well.

"algotrading","t5_2ubg3","Here's a short rundown of some of the more popular strategies:

* **TWAP:** This is the simplest schedule based strategy. Given a start and end time, the strategy will attempt to trade the order volume at the same rate as the execution time so far consumed. In short when it's 75% through its running time it will have executed 75% of its volume (or roughly that much).

* **VWAP:** Will execute the order in such a way so as to meet or beat the VWAP benchmark (taking into account only eligible volume based on strategy's limit price parameter). Again similar to TWAP this is a schedule oriented strategy. The strategy may employ historical trends eg: ADV of the current bucket, to determine how much to trade in each bucket.


* **Volume Inline:** This is a passive participation, market driven strategy. Simply put the client denotes a percentage as one of the parameters say 10%, the strategy will attempt to complete the order over the time period, and to also always be within the given percentage of the total eligible volume traded. As an example if in the current bucket 100 shares were traded, then of those 10 shares +/-1 should have been traded by the strategy. There's allowances for slippage etc, which can be made up for in the remaining buckets.


* **Price Inline:** Is generally a market driven strategy. A benchmark price is provided: such as close-price etc. The strategy will trade as closely as possible around that price. If the current market price is in favour of the benchmark price, the strategy will typically trade more aggressively, otherwise it will pull back more. There's no guarantee the strategy will finish the allotted volume - in short it's a price sensitive best effort approach to working as much of the parent order as is possible.


* **Float:** This is a really simple passive mode strategy. The objective is to have the order at the top of the book. If the price changes, the strategy will simply follow the top, by either repricing up or down. This strategy will never cross the spread, it executes volume by placing resting orders and waiting on trades from the opposing side to cross the spread and execute.


* **Hidden/Sniper:** The strategy will cross the spread and as such will never place any resting orders on the book - revealing potential available volume. When the price of the opposing side hits a particular value/point, the strategy will send a spread crossing order (market or limit). Variations include, not immediately sending out, not entirely taking out the price level etc, and some randomisations so as to make any analysis of potential price points or even the existence of the strategy on the ticker as difficult as possible. Some call this the poor man's FOK.

What makes an experienced t4 seal clubber better than a t4 novice in CV? not positioning... not awareness.. not aa knowledge... its the manual strafe and manual attack... WG obviously think the difference is just manual.. because that was the only thing they did...

My solutions are not as damaging as what WG did... 

Having tutorials and then have the old t4-5 to practice is better than what WG did... right now you learn nothing a cv player learns in t4-5... and then you are going to be ignorant about it in t6... and if someone tells you about the manual mechanics, you get to practice against some of the most potent AA in the game: NCs, Atlantas, and Cleveland. 

IF WG's goal is to improve CV play and make it more enticing, this is not it.. you make ppl suffer through the t4-5... and then throw you at ships who can annihilate your planes at t6 and make you learn... How is that going to be beneficial?",1491004946

"politics","t5_2cneq","The ""Resistance"" movement is essentially a mirror of the ""Make Obama a one-term president"" thing that McConnell wanted to do in 2008.

There's Gorsuch. Suddenly, now that the Democrats have lost the Merrick Garland battle (which was unfair), there is no longer any sense of urgency on the left to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court.

There are the cabinet nominees. Most of them are going to be confirmed anyway, because the Republicans have the votes to do it, but the Democrats are using every procedural method available to them to slow down the process. The Republicans did exactly the same thing early in Obama's first term, and back then Democrats insisted that it was completely unfair.

Of course, it works both ways. Republicans thought they were justified in slow-balling Merrick Garland, but now they are unable to tolerate any similar delay for Neil Gorsuch. They thought they were justified and right and correct in blocking Obama's cabinet nominees, but they're now insisting that Democrats are just slowing things down out of spite.

In 2016, the Republicans called the argument against appointing a Supreme Court Justice in the final year of a President's term the 'Biden Rule,' because Joe Biden had made a similar case for delaying Supreme Court picks in 1992, when George Bush Sr. was an outgoing president... but, back in 1992, the Democrats called that argument the 'Thurmond Rule,' because Republican Senator Strom Thurmond had made a similar case in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson was an outgoing president. And, to cap it all off, it isn't even a real rule. It's a case made by both sides, whenever it is politically expedient, and the historical president cited is always the last time the other party used it to their advantage. We can expect the Democrats to call it the 'McConnell Rule' next time they need to use it.",1491004949

"survivor","t5_2qhu3","In Pearl Islands it's clear she was good, but she wasn't the best winner of the first 19 seasons. Parvati in Micronesia, Todd in China, Tom in Palau, or Yul from Cook Islands are just a few examples of arguably better winners who played better games socially, which has always been Sandra's way (she's not exactly a physical threat). In Heroes vs. Villains I think it was more her tenacity. That season she rotated between positioning herself as a goat and staying carefully under the radar while trying to make a case for herself. It was a season of players heavily on the offense, and Sandra played a solid defensive game, but that means it's hard to really point out any single big play or plays she made, it was more just about sustaining - and I think that's in part because no one took her seriously in that season, much like in Pearl Islands. 

Cirie was able to make progress in Panama and then in Micronesia because everyone was looking at her as weak the first time around, and the second time around she was perceived as someone who got lucky the first time but is still weak. The third time around is when it's undeniable that she was dangerous and got an early boot. With Sandra it's similar that she's an undeniable threat, and JT even tried to do to her what he did to Cirie. If she makes it to the finals she will 100% deserve the win for making it through a third season with a giant target on her back. ",1491004950

"EnterTheGungeon","t5_37d0t","The way the Master Rounds mechanic work makes more sense if you think of EtG as a bullet hell.

For example, Touhou bosses use ""Spell Cards"" that give you a boatload of points if you can beat them without dying or bombing during the attack. The points (which can give you a life once you reach a certain score) are the reward for not getting hit by that attack, which is basically the same way MR works.

Also, I disagree on your comparison to Minecraft: Imho, Etg is not about survival, it's about killing your own past. To do so, you have to learn how the Gungeon works, learn the enemies' attacks and how to dodge them, learn how each gun works and so on. In the end, the Gungeon's difficulties make almost every past's boss look like a joke.

MR are the proof that a boss doesn't give you trouble anymore.

That said, I've learned a lot about my preferred style during the last year and those things aren't going away even if I can't maintain an Instagram-worthy 'do. I've also learned a lot about styling my hair which will definitely help if I go back to longer, natural coloured hair.

Fiery Embrace is your Friend, probably would run 3 right now to cuck Bahamuts. Petrification is also good to deal with Ouroboros to prevent them from constantly dealing 3dmg ETB and healing.  
  
Enchanted Library or Lou are good additions to DShift. Enchanted Library can pull Insights or Snipes; allowing you to boost without targets. Lou can pull Flame Destroyer or Fiery Embrace, both of which are welcome additions to your hand if you can boost freely.  
  
I also run Blade Mage, most opponent's have full HP or close to it now a days so you might need the burst potential from Blade Mage unless you have the nuts.  
  
The only problem with teching DShift to smash dragon is that you become incredibly weak to Zoo Shadow but you can't tech against everything.",1491004952

"ExIsmailis","t5_3iggi","&gt; if only one of the millions of interpretations of thousands of religions was true, someone would probably have been born into that ""true"" religion

Sadly, this isn't true. There were millions of interpretations for how the world was created and how humans came into being. The present religions all presented the stories/theories, and every single one of them turned out to be wrong. Science showed us how the world was created, and how humans came into being.

Similar concept here, religious people will always make some reason up for things they don't understand. A simple case of the Didit fallacy.

Why does the Nile Flood?
Goddidit

Why does it rain?

Who created the universe?

""Does it mean, if you don’t understand something, and the community of physicists don’t understand it, that means God did it? Is that how you want to play this game?... If that’s how you want to invoke your evidence for God, then God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance that’s getting smaller and smaller and smaller as time moves on - so just be ready for that to happen, if that’s how you want to come at the problem.""

Unfortunately no matter how many times you provide evidence to people following the Abrahamic faiths that their religion has glaring and open inaccuracies, lies, flaws, etc. they continue to believe in it.

You were born into a heretical cult that you have been propagated with since birth. You arrived to a conclusion with no rationality or reason, and now you're just throwing together pieces to display that your conclusion is the accurate one. It's childish. You would be a Hindu if you had been born into that. The only reason you follow your religious group is because you were born into it. Never forget that. It's not some ultra-special elite group.",1491004957

Acho que elas tem uma ação muito mais includente do excludente no paronama brasileiro atual.(não vou repetir os motivos porque como disse, já expliquei em uma resposta que dei logo acima)

Sim, somos iguais, mas possuímos equidade? Porque os negros são claramente uma minoria social. Eu simplesmente não consigo ver como não existe uma razão histórica e cultural que resulte em um contexto para eles formarem 54% da população brasileira, serem apenas 17% dos mais ricos e 9,8% dentro das federais ( em 2003 eram 5,9%). Pessoalmente nunca vi as cotas como uma solução permanente, e sim como algo necessário para o momento. É claro que grandes investimentos na educação a longo prazo, diminuição da criminalidade, iriam resolver a longo prazo, mas vamos ser sinceros, isso está longe de acontecer. E isso se dá por uma série de fatores, entraves políticos, conflito de interesses, etc ( é um sistema bem fdp, mas até hoje eu não vi um melhor, já que acreditou que o problema do Brasil é moral, mas aí já é outra discussão..)

Eu já alfirmei logo a cima que em relação as cotas raciais explicitamente eu ainda não tenho uma opinião formada, mas acho discussões como essa que estamos tendo muito boas pra tornarmos conclusões(mesmo que sejam divergentes, por isso vivemos em uma democracia)e termos uma clareza melhor de ideias.

3) The ancient human settlements on the east coast of US.  If they arrived in what's today Alaska, how (and why) they traveled on frozen land thousands of miles east? 
4) Why would they adventure thousands of miles south towards today's Chile. (The travel conditions were harsh and the land empty). The distances are almost impossible even today. If anything they could settle in better conditions and climate in the region of California. 
Part of the settlement of America probably took place from the Bering  corridor, but there must be more to the story.  ",1491004958

Fuck only knows why but it's just the way it is, so when you're deciding whether to use present tense you might wanna be mindful about whether it helps give your prose a distinctive voice or not. 

Oh and one thing to keep in mind is that present tense limits what you can do. You're describing the events as they happen *right now* rather than looking back on them, so neither you nor your characters can reference knowledge that isn't known yet or events that haven't happened yet. This makes present tense handy if you want to withhold clever twists from your reader, but it can be an absolute cunt if you need to get some exposition across.",1491004966
"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Flurry isn't the source of the backwards compatibility problem. Even if it changed mechanically, it's still backward compatible. 

&gt; The UnMonk is exactly what monk needed, but it had to be more standard and flexible- now it's possible to just write a few ki powers that kind of go together to give the class more choices rather than writing 2 new archetypes for the class that trade out a bunch of cruft features.

There's literally no reason they couldn't have just changed the Monk's abilities so that, at the levels where it gets certain abilities, you could pick from a list. Or something similar. They could have made it backwards compatible if they'd *put the effort in.* 

As I frequently find though. In most things Paizo does not feel the need to put the effort into these things. They're pretty notorious now for how poorly they playtest things. And their new rulesets are constantly chaffing against old rulesets.

Look. I'm just saying, if you wanted to play a Rogue archetype, you don't have to pick between flavor and power with the Unchained expansion. You get both. If you want to play a monk archetype though, you DO have to pick between power and flavor.",1491004966

On the other hand I'm fine watching animal rescue YouTube-videos. The injuries can be horrendous, but the animals get treated and you see them completely healed by the end.

Otherwise, if I have an empty stomach and the, uh, ""correct mindset"", I can look at most pictures. But I try to avoid anything with mutilated genitals/eyes/nails, vomiting, sexual violence, some diseases, larvae and dead children. Videos, though. They are so much worse. After 3 Guys 1 Hammer I swore I'd never watch a torture video again and I stand by it. This Mexican face cutting others have mentioned earlier makes my blood curdle from the description alone.

Where did you get this 75,000$ number from.. I mean it says it's 65,000$ right in the email... And your exaggeration argument is reaching pretty far dude.

So you admit that the waitresses thing could only be things sexual things... But it's impossible for it to be children? Huh. Also I never specifically said it was more likely for the Waitresses to be children than prostitutes or something else, Your putting words in my mouth.

&gt;Well, you concede that you cannot provide any evidence for your various claims like identifying victims or the FBI knowing specific code words.

I never made any claims about identifying victims. You are the one who brought that up in the first place... (Even though a testimony isn't solid evidence anyways...)

I really want to love Mixed Feelings because it's well written, and I will forgive a lot of sins if a work has good writing.  The prose is as good as published novels I've read, give or take a few inconsistent apostrophes and British slang words.

If you don't mind, I have some questions. Do you think I should use Robinhood? I've heard some sketch things about them. Also, I personally feel like AMD's cap is around $15 but I obviously love them cause I saw them shoot up. Do you think my $15 cap is crazy? How much potential do they have?

&gt;/r/News says 13.4M -- ads.reddit says 8.3m

&gt;/r/conspiracy says 442,000 -- ads.reddit says 1.7m

&gt;/r/Liberal says 33,000 -- ads.reddit says 240,000

&gt;So either 

&gt;A. Reddit changed the subscription count of every single subreddit just to fuck with The_Donald. Giving false numbers on every single sub to obfuscate their devious plan to suppress one sub.

&gt;Or 

&gt;B. The tool is buggy, was mislabeled, and T_D has a massive victim complex and hate boner for Reddit.

&gt;Edit: 

&gt;For people thinking this is T_D specific, it's not. /r/EnoughTrumpSpam has a higher discrepancy than T_D. They are not uniquely singled out at all. That's just the narrative they are spinning. It's not a political conspiracy.

&gt;It's just that shitposting ""Get this to /r/all"" troll subs have more views on /r/all and therefore the largest difference between their views and their subscription numbers. It's not that difficult to understand, the numbers completely speak for themselves.

&gt;https://ads.reddit.com/

&gt;Go see for yourself. This isn't about T_D. They are just using this as an opportunity to play the victim.

"NYGiants","t5_2ruqw","I'm not sure how people are concluding that 2016 NYG offense had ""a plethora of weapons.""  Beckham is Beckham, sure.  Shepard looked solid for a rookie, but he was still a rookie WR from the Non-OBJ Division.  Cruz is done; the other WRs are nobodies.  The TEs &amp; RBs were all JAGs.  (Vereen is more than that when healthy, but he wasn't; Perkins may be more than that soon, but also wasn't for most of the year.)  I count 1 amazing weapon, and a plethora of ""meh.""

As to the question more generally, a sub-premium-draftee becoming a legitimate franchise QB is rare enough that you can make a good case for ignoring the position until you have to, and pouring all available resources into maximizing your championship chances while you still have Your Guy.  That said, the percentages are an abstract factor, and if you trust your scouts to see better than the League generally has in the past, this is definitely the point where you want them writing double-length profiles on any QB who they think could have that potential.  Looking doesn't cost anything at this point, so you look.  And if that looking convinces you that there's a glint of diamond in the rough, you grab it.  But if not, there are plenty of cheap veterans around to be your #2.  ",1491004981

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","I think you might not have read my whole post because I have answered some of this already. I would say at least two mlm full squadmates. This is something straight men have had throughout the entirety of Mass Effect. They can easily be bisexual or pansexual too. 

Intent is a thing but it is not magic. Whether or not they intended to leave out that part of their demographic is really rather irrelevant. They did leave it out, regardless, and that is still harmful. Being discriminatory isn't just about what people intentionally do. Discrimination and its mechanisms are often difficult to perceive, they are so woven in to the fabric of our existence.

Again I don't actually find everyone in DA2 being bisexual to be that unrealistic. Just about everyone I know personally is some variation on not straight, and this is pretty common for queer folks across the board. Also, you could EASILY say that Anders in particular was straight if you romanced him with a lady, since he doesn't even mention his previous male lover when he does. And honestly this warped idea of realism, when adhered to so strongly with romances but to little else, is suspect. It's a universe with aliens and spaceships and such but as soon as someone is like hey more gays please, suddenly it's REALISM REALISM REALISM all over the place. 

And you are right. In the past, Bioware has been supportive. Which is another reason this blatant exclusion very much sucks. I trusted them to do better, and they failed. 

No one is saying feelings = reality. I don't know why you have already consigned the notion that more MLM options would be a better idea in to this nebulous feelings realm that you then disparage. Reality is, there are tons more queer folks than are actually represented in media. It is the media that is inaccurate. ",1491004983

If you search eBay for ""SCART to HDMI"" you'll find [plenty of cheap converters that look like this](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_128497_4.jpg) and they work pretty well; I don't currently have any recorded footage from my PlayStation through one but [here's a sample from my Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu48VgdFPKc). The only downside I've encountered is that they don't truly support 240p/288p (they treat it as 480i/576i) which can lead to occasional de-interlacing artefacts, but this is far better than some other devices I've used that completely break when fed 240p/288p content.

Make sure if you do buy one that the logo matches; there's a similar product with a blue logo that you'd have thought would be the same (to the extent that the manual is identical) but the insides are completely different and they don't work properly (strong vertical bars in output, strong de-interlacing artefacts, locked at 60Hz, 576i/288p content is cropped to 480i/240p so the top and bottom of the image is missing).",1491004984

Yes, that's very much the point.

Feudalism simply was a highly inefficient system, especially when contrasted with the highly centralized, bureaucratic government of the medieval Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) in the east.

It is also worth noting that this applies everywhere else in the world. China especially experienced this several times throughout history. The semi-feudal system of the ancient Zhou Dynasty, for example, led to the increasing loss of authority of the Zhou kings over their vassal lords. These vassal domains then proceed to become de facto independent from the Zhou, until it reached a point when these vassal domains declared de jure independence by proclaiming themselves king (up until that point, the title of king was restricted to the Zhou monarch alone). Another example would be the end of the Han Dynasty, when the regional governors gained increasing autonomy and authority, leading into a full blown civil war in which the country became divided between the regional  governors (who at this point became regional warlords).

Ultimately, external (referring to Europe being split into numerous kingdoms of various sizes) and internal (referring to dilution of central control within a country due to feudalism) decentralization hampered full exploitation of resources and manpower for the average medieval sovereign state in Europe.",1491004985

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Some trans people are influenced by societal expectations to get certain gender confirming procedures. For example some trans women may not experience any genital dysphoria but still want to get vaginoplasty because being a woman with a penis is frankly hard in today's society. These people would not undergo the procedures in the society you describe, in my opinion.

However some trans people *need* certain body parts. I think it's likely the way this need is expressed and felt would be different in this hypothetical society but the need would still exist. ",1491004989

^ A cool interactive PP that breaks down the different sections ^.
After learning whats what on the PP's is when differing opinions and strategies come to play. Some focus on the Speed Figures (the bold #'s you were mentioning), others swear by pace (small annotated #'s in running line) some breeding, Jockeys, Trainers, etc etc. There are a huge number of variables to consider and to focus on one without considering the others is usually a losing strategy.
I'm fairly new to handicapping as well so when I go to the track I have been experimenting with different bets (at minimum $ amounts) and I make sure to keep records of how I bet and what the outcomes were.
If your just looking for a good day and not planning on frequenting the track or handicapping seriously just learning to read the PP's will help you have a good time though. Hope this helps!",1491004991

"whatsthisbug","t5_2s3bw","If I can trouble you some more, not all venomous spiders will have a venomous bite. In many spiders, when they bite out of defense such as being squeeze, or harassed like one of the mods here likes to do with spiders while filming it (:D), it will be what is called a, ""dry"" bite.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_bite

&gt;Dry bites from spiders such as tarantulas and large Sparassidae are common and, where correctly identified, can simply be ignored or, if appropriate, treated using mild antiseptics.[5] On the other hand, some reports clearly suggest that some of their bites cause marked neurotoxic effects. For example, in South Africa the common ""Rain Spider"" Palystes castaneus and similar species, is usually described as negligibly venomous, and certainly it is at the least difficult to find documented cases of serious effects.
&gt;
&gt;A case in Cape Town is typical of evidence of the dangers of generalizing. In her garden with her bare arm in bushes, a woman felt a stinging sensation and withdrew hurriedly. Seeing nothing, she thrust her arm in again and felt a worse sting; inspection revealed a Palystes nest-cocoon, with the female on guard. There was local redness at the site of the bites, but no other ill effects. Later that evening, however, there was dizziness and nausea, and her arm became swollen and painful, with local discoloration at the sites of the bites. The pain and swelling took several days to subside.[6]
&gt;
&gt;Given that the typical Palystes bite is less traumatic than a bee sting,[7] it is altogether plausible that many are dry bites, but as in this case, when there were two bites, possibly less dry than usual, the putative effects make it altogether reasonable to suspect that the venom as such is non-negligible. It is not possible to carry out controlled studies on humans, and the effects on non-human subjects cannot be trusted because there are major unpredictable differences between species in such matters.
&gt;
&gt;In the event of a dry bite, anti-venom should not be taken, as it has unneeded side effects.",1491004991

I know the unrelated partisan issues are important to both sides but this is where leadership comes into play. The President has to sign the bill. When he instructs Congress to write it, he must make this position clear, or no deal for him. Now, maybe this piece goes away if the politcal sides come to an agreement that does not kill the bill. Also, the President does not have to get into the details of Health Care (not that he did anyway) because this is just and expansion of an exiting law. I don't know if the numbers work, that's for them to figure out. Right now though, there is talk of a bipartisan approach to fixing Obamacare. (even though Ryan does not want to work with the Dems) I think all Trump needs is for someone to convince him he can steal the Health Care legacy away from Obama if this can be done. And that would be true.",1491004993

It's good, but I've never gone as far as to register to the site to post something.

The good thing I like about Reddit is that you can post your mixed set as an imgur-image as well and it's there for you to see. In GameFAQ you need to copy.paste links to open them I think and overall images don't feel as common in there.

I like images I guess. Alot more than numbers and words and all that non-sense.

"XWingTMG","t5_2vsga","For Whisper especially, you want to make sure that you always have a shot to take. Getting caught out in an arc or two without having both a cloak and at least a focus token is a quick way to lose your Phantom. Speaking **very** generally, assuming you're the highest PS in the situation, I would say it's usually all right to be sitting in one arc if it means you're shooting as well (and therefore cloaking, likely getting a focus, and also acquiring a TL with FCS). Your four greens with a focus usually tip the cost-benefit equation far enough that the danger is worthwhile. Being in multiple arcs is less desirable.

Whisper (and Echo)'s cost means she's a big chunk of any list, so those red dice need to roll as often as possible to make that up. That said, discretion can be the better part of valour, and she's even less useful to your list when she's been blown up, so be ready to disengage when you feel uncomfortable with your Phantom's situation.

I find that often, if I'm not using the decloak to block (which can be risky), I'm frequently dialling one of the Hard 1 turns. This can make you predictable, but that's not the worst thing on turns where you have more than one viable decloak option, at which point your opponent has a lot to consider anyway. Be more prepared to move unexpectedly when you have only one legal/realistic decloak vector, and don't be afraid to stay cloaked, grab an evade, and set up for a following turn.

If you are decloaking to block, make sure that whatever you're dialling isn't in turn going to lead to you being blocked. A bumped uncloaked Phantom is probably the most doomed ship in the game.

Mostly, though, this ship (Echo especially) just needs practice, practice, practice. You absolutely want to get a sense for where a 2-straight decloak is going to place you, as if you don't have an eye for it, you're going to find yourself dial committed to some really crappy maneuvers because your intended decloak didn't work.",1491004994

If they're offering a product you're not satisfied with, stop supporting it/buying it. It makes no sense to me. Everyone is just complaining how much they're unhappy with it because another version (brand for reference sakes) is offering a better product. Either switch brands or just don't support it anymore. Time and time again, global has 'proved' themselves to be good: coliseum 100% drop from the getgo for example. But the second they fail to deliver anything, they're crap. It's unnecessary. Even their curve balls they throw at us for giving us 'harder and more impossible raids' have proved to be doable, etc., etc. And if heaven forbid the ambushes are all time limited, they will manage to find a way to make it work. The fact that we got him so early in the first place means something. He could, for all we know, normalize into an actual normal ambush after 4 months.

"astrology","t5_2qi4c","&gt;Moving the north node (i.e. position of destiny, fate, etc.) to the Aries point indicates a purpose based on following one's own impulses and desires and being dedicated to expressing onself

That isn't what's happening, though and I disagree that that is what the NN is (but that's beside the point).  What's happening is that the degree of the North Node *becomes* 0° Aries and all the degrees of the other planets change in relation to that.

0° Aries is already a point with its own definition and astronomical indicator.  It isn't something that can be shuffled around.  It lacks logical consistency and creates weird areas where sign designations are now meaningless since they can be taken apart and reproduced on a whim from any position.

I acquire shares only after selling puts which end up in the money at expiry. Then I sell calls on the shares, and usually try to stick with blue chips or midcaps that pay a decent dividend, just in case I end up having to hold the shares for a while before the price recovers to where i can sell the calls, so I'll earn at least the dividend.  I also sell options on some shares in the Precious metals sector because of the higher premiums. Over the years with my mix of stock I averaged 20%+.

That money provides the *only* publicly funded women's healthcare (contraceptives, screenings, etc) to over 2.5 million women. 

It shouldn't fall onto private donors to meet a healthcare burden like this, and realistically this is not sustainable as a private institution in the long run for the same reason our healthcare shouldn't be privatized. Other private clinics can't step in to shoulder the burden because of the state laws I mentioned, like laws that dictate where doctors in clinics must have admitting privileges or what procedures must be performed in ambulatory surgery centers, along with the kind of laws Mike Pence loves like forcing women to get sonograms and listen to the heartbeats of their fetus before the abortion or legally requiring funeral services be held for aborted tissue.

The first is what u/dolphinesque wrote. I think thats a very kind interpretation. No religion is clear cut about really anything. People choose what bits from the book to choose to follow. Sometimes this is searching for what you want to find, ""Death to gay people!"" instead of all of the other information that exists in the book ""blessed are the meek"", ""turn the other cheek"". Sometimes people align themselves with religious organisations that focus on the aspects of the book that best fit their preconceived ideas about the world and that changes the understanding of the teachings of the book. 

I think for your MIL maybe its that she likes drama (its not boding well that there is so much drama with DIL), and she looks for the things in the book that fit those ends. Maybe she goes to a conservative service and this has impacted her beliefs. Honestly, it doesn't matter. She has choice to believe in haram or to believe in the other aspects of the book which says its ok. She choose to focus on haram and that's her choice. I wouldn't count on her calming down.

- Pedals are I believe the same, the sport are alloy with a resin cage, but if not they should be equivalent in quality/type, i.e. basic commuter pedals

- Front derailleur is better on the 2016, but front derailleur is probably the least important part of the drivetrain for shifting performance, shifters are most important.

- Pretty sure shifters are M310 on both models, that's the model name of the Altus shifters, they just wrote it more specifically for 2017. 

With the tires it does seem like they lost puncture protection for 2017, however I'd say you might not need an extra puncture protection tire depending on what your local conditions are like (they do have drawbacks) and any tires on bikes are this kind of price are cheap OEM tires and not really worth choosing a bike for, upgrading down the line to nicer tires can make a big difference in both performance and puncture resistance (even from the puncture resistant version of an OEM tire) for not huge money - [these](http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/schwalbe-marathon-touring-tyre-greenguard/rp-prod69133) in the 700x35 size for example would be a great choice.

So for me the 2017 is the better buy comparing their MSRPs, but the 2016 if available should be being sold at a discount as it's last year's model and cost the same or less than the 2017. If they aren't offering a discount I'd ask for one.

The benefit (according to me) of being a Diamond of mid or high tier is that you usually face the same people over and over again. I use these moments to practice my reading as I find it more effective than trying to read someone you never fought. 

Usually, the cancerous players won't even make it to Diamond, and even if they do, they will very seldom be able to make it through top 50 as most top tier players know how to handle all kinds of playstyles.

I think what I really love about Spirit is that everything feels carefully arranged; nothing is there by accident.

What we're looking at (Samson Meteor) is a condenser microphone. These generally need some kind of pre-amps.

The high pitched noise comes from the microphone preamp. Since the microphone is so compact, they basically had to make drawbacks in quality at some point, which then produces sounds like a noise interference.

You can test that by running a USB extension line next to a coax cable  over longer distances which both end in an audio interface. It will intersperse the ""unclean"" USB DC signal which is not filtered enough to be ""real"" direct current, which makes a similar noise to what is produced by the meteor's pre-amp.",1491005007

&gt;Cause you are, alt-right is a cop out

I've not once denied that the AR is far-right. We are proud reactionaries and conservatives. Problem?

&gt;Yep, do you not understand the irony of your group? That's what alt-right base of.

Except for the most part we're college educated and black nationalists think Melanin converts cosmic radiation to wisdom.

&gt;Childish riots? Police brutality is not childish, we didn't choose to be in the position we're in. You force us in the ghettos, expect crime. Now you're paying for it, hopefully with blood.

Waaahhhh white boi won't give me money despite spending trillions of dollars on me so I could do something with my life. You didn't choose the position you were in, but you can choose how you act, and honestly if you do the research violence and childish behavior isn't much of a surprise.

&gt;America is no white land, it belongs to us. We were here before you and we'll be here after you. Europe is all yours, I don't care. As for African and Arab countries, you still exploit us. Why is the bases and CIA interfere in our countries? Why do you use our slave labor for our materials to you to steal? 

And who is ""We""? Blacks? You must be joking, you've had one of the most resource rich continents on Earth and you haven't done shit. Half your population could be classified as mentally impaired, if you seriously think you'd stand a chance against Whites if they chose to lift a finger, you're delusional.

I'm a noninterventionist, I don't want to have bases in the ME or Africa, I don't White nations should support it dominate Arab or Black countries, so in that respect we agree.

&gt;I'm speaking the language of trump, except I'm consider an Einstein in terms of grammar compare to the peckerwoods in the south.(When will these people die?)

My favorite Breck areas are the Baker's tank area. Its like riding through a Colorado mining museum hidden in the forest there. I also like the Soda Creek area. One cool route is to catch the Colorado Trail near Tiger road and ride it to Gold Hill. 

Check out the area on MTB project. Download and use the trail forks app to guide you on the trail. BTW, aside from the Trestle Bike Park I think Breck riding is way better then Winter Park/Fraser. Winter Park/Fraser is really over rated to me.

Add. These folks should be able to give you more precise info on when the trails melt.

1 can crushed tomatoes
1 yellow onion
Whole cumin seeds (~2 tsp)
Garam masala (~1 tbsp)
Grated ginger (or ginger powder. Meh)
Ground coriander
Turmeric 
Salt 
Cooking oil
Baking soda

Toast cumin seeds in oil until brown and fragrant, then start sautéing onion (~5 min). Add other seasonings, stir, cook ~2 min, add tomatoes and chickpeas. Lightly salt. Cook for ~20 minutes on medium ""until the chickpeas stop tasting like chickpeas."" If the mixture is still acidic tasting, add a tiny bit of baking soda until it goes away and is delicious.

But then when I offered to hang out she accepted... she comes over to my hotel and we start watching a movie. I kiss her, we start cuddling, but she has to go because work in the morning. No biggie, she's gonna come over the next night and spend the night but before she does, she texts me she doesn't want to have sex but we can cuddle and make out. 

Early in the night we talk about it and I could totally guilt her into it but it's obvious and I don't want to be a dick so I say no matter what, I won't. Well things get hot and bothered and she wants to fuck but I say no. She turns away and then starts crying and says nobody ever made her feel that way rejecting her. At this point I'm freaking out so I try to console her and tell her I'm a dumb virgin and I have no clue what I'm doing. This leaves her dumbfounded and she's having some trouble grasping the concept. ""So like I'm the first girl you've laid in bed with?"" ""Hahaha, you're the first girl I did anything with! First kiss, first boobs, ect."" So she's stopped crying and is asking questions, but she's looking at me like I killed her dog. At this point she won't fuck me and insists that my first time should be special and with another virgin...we cuddled that night and I hug her and kiss her goodbye in the morning.

Fast forward to the next time we meet up, I go in for a kiss and she rejects me. Doesn't want to send mixed feelings because she refuses to take my virginity. When I asked why she came over she said she'd rather be with me than home alone.

TLDR: I take a girl back to a hotel to cuddle two nights in a row, refuse to have sex with her. I tell her I'm a virgin and then she won't touch me anymore but still wants to hang out.",1491005011

Nu er det jo ""mange"" år siden, vi byggede fiskebaren... Det var (tror jeg) inden Kødbyen blev hawt...

Så han kender sin vin og han ved præcis hvad han vil og kan servere til fisken. 

Men igen. Jeg er så biased at du kan be' mig lukke røven, fordi uanset hvad du siger, så vil jeg erklære Fiskebaren for KBHs bedste fiskerestaurent pga. faglig stolthed og nostalgisk arbejdslyst.

The thing with Kravitz definitely ruled out the possibility that it was just Merle losing faith. Something that really, desperately intrigues me is that in the Eleventh Hour the Chalice hinted that all of these relics were originally not just one whole thing, but one *entity*, one semi-or-perhaps-not-semi sentient being. 

I'm not sure about the relics being combined stopping the hunger, because if recombining the relics was the solution to the problem these fantasy NASA employees are facing, why split them into relics at all? Why not just use the one thing that the relics combined into immediately, and stop the Hunger without all these shenanigans?",1491005013

1. [All Quiet on the Western Front - Erich Maria Remarque](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355697.All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front?ac=1&amp;from_search=true) The classic WWI novel from the German side. The fact it was one f the first books burned by the Nazis is quite the endorsement of it.

2. [And No Birds Sang - Farley Mowat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/329554.And_No_Birds_Sang?from_search=true) A story (possibly embellished) of a Canadian infantry officer in WWII, he is exposed to the horrors of war and barely hangs on at points, though it includes the black humour of the times.

3. [Shake Hands With the Devil; The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda  - Romeo Dallaire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215758.Shake_Hands_with_the_Devil?ac=1&amp;from_search=true) - This a damn hard book to read about the genocide in Rwanda written by Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commanding the UN peacekeeping forces in the country. He is a remarkable man.

4. [Vimy - Pierre Berton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/190293.Vimy) My personal favourite among Berton's many high quality books. Tells the story of the Canadian army in the first world war and what it was about them and the Canadian character that allowed them to take Vimy Ridge where the French and British had failed.

5. [Riel: A Life of Revolution - Maggie Siggins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2243181.Riel?from_search=true) The controversial life story of Louis Riel one of the Canadian fathers of confederation, who was hanged for treason.

6. [The Forever War - Joe Haldeman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War) Science fiction about soldiers who spend time at relativistic speeds and become more and more different from the society they are fighting for.

7. [Old Man's War - John Scalzi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51964.Old_Man_s_War?ac=1&amp;from_search=true) an excellent companion book to The Forever War

8. [The Neanderthal Parallax - Robert J Sawyer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/264946.Hominids) A trilogy composed of Hominids, Humans and Hybrids. Deals with what it means to be human.

9. [Who Killed the Canadian Military - J L Granastein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1569347.Who_Killed_The_Canadian_Military_) Spoiler, it was us.

10. [Final Blackout - L Ron Hubbard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262966.Final_Blackout) Actually a well written story, published in the 30's, well before his drift into the deep end.

11. [Shelf Monkey - Corey Redekop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1640630.Shelf_Monkey) An excellent Canadian author who isn't as well known as as he should be.

12. [Blink:The Power of Thinking Without Thinking - Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink) How people really make decisions and the effect it has on everyday life

13. [Rats: Observations on the History &amp; Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants - Robert Sullivan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9824.Rats?from_search=true) Much like reddit one of those things you didn't know that you wanted to know.

14. [ Life in a Medieval Village - Frances Gies, Joseph Gies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/600625.Life_in_a_Medieval_Village?from_search=true) A very human face on the past, reads like a conversation

15.  [The Settlement of the Americas: A New Prehistory - Tom D. Dillehay](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1080925.The_Settlement_of_the_Americas?from_search=true) Was quite controversial when it was published, though much less so now in light of more recent discoveries in South America.

When she fails a test how does it make her feel? What is her attitude towards tests.

Does she understand that she isn't doing well? Does that make her feel bad? Embarrassed? Doesn't care? All are valid and I would start there. Extreme feelings (depression, anxiety) need professional help but it would probably help you if you had an emotional compass to go by. Clearly she's intelligent so getting that intelligence reflected in the report card is the key.

At that age I didn't understand that I needed to perform and show my talents and I didn't understand that I was being evaluated so I didn't care (I thought everybody was still playing!) Once clued in I had to figure out how to do well (and it was hard work!) and 'normal school life' started there for me.

* Equinox can kill the whole map, no matters the enemy level, with just pressing 4 two times, after getting some kills with a Dagger+Covert Lethality (literally you can kill everything with this combo, no matters if the enemy level is 9999).
As you said, you didn't even need to kill anything if there is anyone else to do this job for you.

* Ember's WoF hits 5 enemies dealing a nice damage even against armor in ""low-mid"" levels (let's say 0-60 or so), then you just start using accelerant for a 500% dmb boost and woala, you're killing high level enemies with ease. I'm not going further with combos like Growing Power + Energy Conversion or so.

* Mag's Magnetize attracts enemies, literally not letting them move, and this can be used to block small entrances then killing everything that is comming for you.

* Saryn Spores can spread the whole tileset with viral procs halving everything's hp (who needs slash dmg?)

* Octavia's *Mallet* absorbs enemy damage and amplifies it, in a radious of 50m+. You don't even need to move or hide, as it attract enemy fire.

There are tons of things players can do that the AI cannot, that is just as unfair as extra settlers or production bonuses.

We're arguing over whether Americans should be challenged to think beyond the ""jealous of our freedoms"" line when trying to understand the events of 9/11.  Maaaaybe just maaaaybe there are some shades of gray involved.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Think about invasive species.  Take the Rabbit's introduction to Australia for example: when they were first introduced, they weren't a big problem.  They were cute, fluffy, and probably a half-decent food source if we're being honest.  

But those suckers multiply like crazy, and they multiplied A LOT in Australia.  They began to be a nuisance, something farmers had to watch out for due to the holes they burrow in fields and their consumption of crops.  Eventually, the rabbits population started to get completely out of control and began to cause soil erosion.  They also began to push other species out of their niche and that can fuck with the ecology of the area in large scale.  They became a legitimate threat to the viability of the soil and environment of Australia if left unchecked.

Now imagine the cute bunnies are cancer, and Australia is your body.  That's pretty much what happens: the cells just keep replicating, and replicating, and replicating forming tumors.  Eventually some cells will break off and travel somewhere else, and start the process over again.   And one way or another, your body dies due to the cancer basically preventing your body from functioning normally due to all the constantly growing masses going places they shouldn't be(like, say, your lungs).",1491005028

Many will find that joke ""distasteful and disgusting"". To be fair, it's a lousy joke... but anyway.

How many animals died as a part of making that joke? How many died in the telling of that joke? How many died as a result of you reading that joke?

Yeah. 0. None. Zero.

So no, it's clearly not exactly the same as killing animals for sport.

Now there are people out there who thinks that telling a joke that is offensive to their god is *worse* than killing animals for sport. There are also people who think it's the same level of offensiveness. Then there are people like you and me (who, I'm pretty certain, are in the majority), who think that it's much less offensive than killing animals for sport.

The reality is that everyone has their own measure and standards for offensiveness - it's very personal and subjective. Someone who says they are exactly the same is either a) incapable of nuance, b) sees the world in digital yes/no, right/wrong, good/evil dichotomies, c) is lying, or d) some combination of the above.

"dotnet","t5_2qh3h","Some fair points. Sure, we all use frameworks. Where to stop using them and start writing your own code is a gray area and my opinion might not be the same as the next guys'. At a minimum, where I tend to draw my lines is with frameworks that are cross cutting concerns. For example, Entity Framework (which I don't particularly care for, but you suggested as an example) deals primarily with data access, ASP.NET MVC with UI, etc. In a product like the one you've created there is not clear separation of concerns. It has an opinion about everything from the top to the bottom of the stack. My experience has taught me to keep those things separate.

To your point about all the changing technologies not making things easier, I couldn't agree more. It feels like there is a new hot framework release every week and none of them seem to really make things easier by a substantial margin -- and given the frequency the industry wants to chase these new frameworks, in practice it probably makes things harder because we're constantly expected to learn and use these new techniques.

Like I said, I think there is a market for something like you have. This subreddit is as good as any to look for dev managers I guess.

P.S. - Perhaps I might be more warm to your goals if you had separate products that dealt with separate concerns, i.e. UI, data, rules, search, reporting, etc...

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Actually, we have much the same in the U.S.., including BS schemes where folks can off-set their taxable income with passive income losses and ""hobby losses"".  Older folks who are more likely to have large capital gains in investment income pay a lower tax on that income than those of us working for our money.  Older folks are able to stuff their money into retirement accounts,  income tax free, then turn around and withdraw it and pay a lower tax rate.  When they finally sell their home, they are able to take their lifetime capital gains exclusion and pay no income tax on the profit.  In the meantime, families in certain areas of the country have 1200 square foot homes that cost more than 12,000 sq ft homes in other areas.  When these families with modest homes deduct their mortgage interest to reduce taxable income, the government presumes that they are living too high on the hog and not paying enough income tax, so slap them with an additional alternative minimum tax.  Retired folks living on retirement  accounts, rental income and other passive income or captital gains do not need the mortgage deduction for their first and vacation homes because they have no ordinary income and are taxed a much lower rate on their passive income.  When I was 20 years old, the government made a deal to lower the tax rate and raid the Social Security Trust Fund, promising that they would return the stolen funds in the early 2000s by raising tax rates. At the same time, they raised the age for my husband and I to collect Social Security to age 67.  When the early 2000s came around, the government reneged on the deal, further lowered taxes for the ""rich"", capped the Social Security contributions rate, and then started screaming that Social Security is unsustainable and was an ""entitlement"" that we can no longer afford, then propose ""grandfathering"" all those retirees whom had contributed next to nothing for 30 years, and whom had enjoyed the lower tax rates made possible by stealing the assets from the Social Security Trust Fund.  So, I do understand your position, but frankly, I cannot worry about it.  I lost my 16 year old daughter several years ago and perhaps that gave me a different perspective, so I should show more patience with whining, particularly when I agree with the facts.  But I  just choose to live each day to be happy and cannot blame older folks for my financial plight, it is not their fault either.  
I did think to ask you a few days ago if you are experiencing a lot of foreign investment in your city.  Our more desirable cities such as yours have been suffering under the same type of real estate market.  Foreign investors from Russia and China are snapping up real estate to park their money in  a more stable economy, keeping prices inflated and freezing out local residents.  The real estate sits *empty*, and the housing stock is depleted, causing prices to skyrocket.  I read last month that Sidney was a haven for foreign real estate investors. Neither of our respective governments apparently  seem to think that this excessive foreign investment is a national security risk nor care that our young people are completely priced out of a college education and have no affordable housing choices.  I do believe that the source of your market issues may in fact be more attributable to the foreign investment than than your old boomers :)  I apparently am in the minority as the people that want to change the status quo never win an election:)  So here I am at 55 years old, still working hard, likely with no health insurance, and plowing my money into my children's education.  But my retired parents that worked hard for more than 60 years until their old bodies ""broke"" :) really have it no better, and actually help their grandchildren go to college whenever they have some pocket change.  Before they reached 65, their health insurance premiums were $12,000 A MONTH, pretty much depleting their retirement savings. But the alternative  was risking the loss of their home if they had one lousy hospitalization as happens here on the regular.  Now our President proposes taking away our new found government sponsored affordable  health insurance, so this last of the baby boomers will be working until she is 67, god willing, to get Medicare for old folks if they dont have their way and get rid of that too as they are now proposing.

"bestoflegaladvice","t5_34iym","&gt;So to be clear, even if he was more than 18, he would still be liable for the damages? (That seems obvious) Except that would be because of the contrat? 

Yes. As it stands, his parents are liable for them. There isn't a situation wherein he could say ""nope I'm a kid eff off"" because he was unjustly enriched by his act.

A tort is a civil wrong; something I've done to you that makes you less than you were before I found you, even if that act doesn't necessarily make me more than I was. They're entirely distinct from crimes (many acts are both, like battery and theft) and they're solved in civil court where a judge stands between you and me and listens to us argue about whose feelings hurt more before he gets tired and tells us to shut up and just flips a coin.

Unjust enrichment is a legal concept that describes a circumstance where you pull some dick move that makes you more than you were before, at my expense. ""Dick move"" is defined pretty broadly and can include crimes or torts.",1491005033

Pregnancy and having a baby is hard but your life is far from over. You just have to put a plan together and re-arrange.  Will your BF stay with You if you get an abortion? Will you regret that choice forever or  will you regret keeping it? There is a lot of support through schools and family that would be able to help you. I just urge you to do some research so whatever decision you make is an educated one. If you keep it, BF has some serious  growing up to do pretty fast and he has to realize how what he does affects you. He also needs to really learn about what you're going through and how it affects your life.

In my opinion, it gives a great view of evolution-the gene centred view of evolution-which I find most convincing and doesn't fall to the common criticisms of evolution such as 'how can evolution explain altruism'. 

It's available as an audio book, read by Dawkins, for free on YouTube. That's how I read/listened to it.

While it presents relatively complex ideas, it's certainly seems to me to be written without assuming prior knowledge, and explains the ideas really well. 

Edit : forgot to mention, which is covered in other comments, Dawkins is definitely very opinionated (right or wrong-and I tend to agree with him), and very provocative when discussing religion and science. I don't think this detracts from The Selfish Gene, but maybe that's just because I agree with him.",1491005037

I myself often discuss this ""water"" topic with other friends and NMS fans and I sometimes refer to what we see as ""water"" too, although I know I shouldn't. From what I've read pre-launch, the team had to balance between realism and gameplay. For gravity they decided to bet on gameplay cause they felt it was too weird for the player to run at different speeds on different planets. Hence that ""your suit compensates for it"". Hence the close distance between stars and moons in the system. Yet I think there is some level of realism that our brains feel kinda healthy - that's why the dark space mod is so popular for example. My whole point is, in some instances it's quite okay for a sci-fi game to emulate real world experience, and I really hope sandy beaches, ice-covered lakes and lava streams are coming to this game",1491005037

Hair length is rooted in genetics, it goes in cycles, and when it reaches its ""maximum"" length, the rate of growth is offset by the rate of breakage/shedding of hair.

Im sure some people out there have the ability to grow really long hair, but for an average person, it would require constant maintenance, and might even not be possible.

There is plenty of material on hair genetics on google. Im not educated in the science, but im sure others out there can give far more info.


edit: looked around on wikipedia.

""The maximum terminal hair length depends on the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and follows by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen.[20] The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.[21]""",1491005039

"d3hardcore","t5_2swfl","Really, whatever type you like to play will play the same in HC. You just have to be sure not to die. To me that means running at a difficulty where if you get caught in tough spot, you won't insta die. I focus more on survivability and defense than I would if dying wasn't such a big deal. 

I like the Crusader for HC. Plenty of armor then stack resistances. the gameplay of sader is fun for me. I like wizard play but I usually end up dying at some point. Sader has plenty of toughness to be forgiving when in a pinch.  The season set Akkhans is not one of the more popular sets but I think the bonus is pretty damn righteous. Never actually ran it though. Using the thorns based build looks like it would be pretty easy to gear for  early on as fresh 70 and work very similar to the standard Invoker which I have played a ton. My issue with Invoker - it is one badass and very fun to play set imho - but it took me a while to kill single target bosses (and even longer to kill a goblin since they don't attack you so they don't draw thorns). With the Akkhans thorns build, you get that sweet 600% damage increase and constant uptime with the Akarat's Champion skill - plus take 15% LESS damage, Akarat's was beast without this boost but with it... 

Well now I might have talked myself into doing Sader for the 5th season in a row instead of WD like I was planning for this one. Another thing I like about Sader is that there are some nice drops I tend to always get that make for very nice speed builds. You tank up- ride your horsey on instant CD until elites, kill elite, repeat. I was doing T13 in 3-4 min. Not able to push GRs past 69 without fear of possibly dying or just not meeting the timer, but I did not go the new Hammer spec and that one is now beastly and also the gear is not difficult to get. Lots of fun and functional options with the trusty Sader. ",1491005040

If water's a 10x better greenhouse gas than CO2 (technically true, molecule-per-molecule, until it condenses into clouds) then any effects from CO2 should wash out in the massive water vapor effect.

Since we can't affect the amount of water evaporating from the surface of the ocean, that's something that's supposedly beyond human control. The key piece that brings the responsibility back to human activities is the knowledge that trees and plants are essential for the condensation of ambient water vapor into clouds.

IMHO, if there is tracking showing it is in transit, a waiting period would be appropriate to see if the seller is able to resolve the delay. Instead eBay simply does a refund.

I have heard mixed reviews of remote contracting in really early stages bc of new devs coming on. But perhaps with a small investment I could get a a few screens presentable. That with a landing page video could work.
Option 3 is what they tell you in business school but outside of a non tech hub city(closest to me is Raleigh NC) equity doesn't have much pull. I feel that I would need some kind of outside investment to legitimize it to the point where I could bring in real talent. Any thoughts on legitimizing a product for early investors?

Aiming to go web app first and go from there.

I have not gotten to hiring processes or interviewing programmers yet but that is definitely a key to finding compatible team members, hopefully will have assistance WHEN I get there. 

Your thought on the hackathon/coding challenges is excellent. That and trying to get involved in community entrepreneurship orgs will be on my get shit done list.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","I have been a volunteer researcher for almost two years now and I have no problem giving up my free time to learn more as it relates to science. I don't mind paying for the cost of gas it takes to make it to the lab, the average 15 hours I work a week, or the fact that none of it is paid. During summer internships especially, I love being active in the lab for 12+ hours during the weekdays. Not to sound cliché, but I love medical science. If I use my free time for something, I feel that there has to be an intellectual gain if not a monetary one. I haven't seen any opportunities where I can volunteer, help people (directly), and stay active in science. 

I guess my point is that if I am asked why I am trying to enter medical school, my honest answer would be, ""I love medical science, and if I can help someone while pursuing that passion, then that's great."" ",1491005049

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Great question. In China, there are zero animal protection laws. Not only that, there are superstitions that cause people to believe the more pain/suffering a dog endures, the greater the medicinal benefits (i.e., virility) its flesh provides. The combination of these two factors results in prolonged, deliberate torture (hanging for hours, disembowelment, blowtorching, dismemberment -- paws cut off and eaten as delicacies while the animal continues to live). Also, the dog meat trade is highly unregulated and there are no large-scale dog meat farms in China (like there are in South Korea). Many of the dogs are stolen pets, often seen wearing collars while awaiting slaughter. 

I also think the ways animals are treated in the US is all kinds of awful; I personally don't support any of it. But I do think intentional, prolonged punishment of animals is particularly cruel. The US and H.Res.30 can obviously only do so much about China, but it can urge China to enact anti-cruelty laws and express condemnation of any celebration of torture. 

(If you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend checking out Marc Ching, the founder of The Animal Hope and Wellness Foundation, on Facebook. Nami Kim is also doing great work in South Korea. And then there's also this very graphic 25-second [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_p71BjjCP8) of Marc Ching's undercover footage of the dog meat trade shown at the H.Res.752 briefing on Capitol Hill last session.)",1491005050

"literature","t5_2qhps","&gt; In other words, your sense of the Raja corpus seems to basically be the Wolf corpus.

I have other Wolf translators in that corpus: Maria Teresa Mandalari and a collaboration between Maria Grazia Cocconi and Jan-Michael Sobottka. You can see a listing here: https://github.com/stefantalpalaru/stylometry/blob/master/Elena%20Ferrante/JGAAP-6.0.0/batch-translations.txt

That first experiment shows that Raja's translation is stylometrically identifiable and distinct from other translators.

One interesting measurement is the rarest 5 words which shows that a Kafka translation by Raja is closer to a Wolf translation by her than a translation of the same Kafka book by another translator.

You're complaining that all I have from Raja is translations. How is that my fault if that's all she published?

&gt; Do you have a control group using your exact method and a similar situation that produces accurate results?

Do you know of any similar situation? I verified the working of these methods with [other Italian authors and translators](https://github.com/stefantalpalaru/stylometry/blob/master/Elena%20Ferrante/JGAAP-6.0.0/batch-known-author.txt) and Starnone's style is pretty consistent, as you can see in the second table.

&gt; Why couldn't Raja have been responsible for Starnone's books?

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","I've been here since 2000. I'd recommend it for teaching yeah, but you'll need to lay some groundwork before you come, for example get your diplomas and transcripts ""notarized"" at the Taiwan TECO in the US in your area. Absolutely a must. 

Here in Taiwan (I have no interest in going to Thailand except for a short vacation maybe, and the PRC is too anti-American for my taste; I’d never even set foot there, not even Hong Kong), having a license or a certificate such as the CELTA certificate by Cambridge University, which has training programs in the US, is good. You’ll have to Google it and follow up on their offerings. I'd say that's all you need since you have a MS. Because you speak English as your native language, they'd let you teach English here. You can also do private tutoring and charge something like 800-1, 000 NT per hour. Right now I have one student I teach at home for 800 NT per hour but in the past I’ve had up to 4 and a full-time job. The money pours in then.

As for being red pill here, the Taiwanese are very respectful of individual personal private decisions and preferences that people make on their own. If you're a family member here, they'd probably be a little more pushy. I'm speaking of one Taiwanese family member to another Taiwanese family member. If it’s parent to child, for example, “Why aren’t you married by now? Don’t you have a girlfriend? Are you gay?”
If you're a foreigner as I am, they'd be more conscious of boundaries and wouldn’t ask nosey questions. They would stop at the, “Are you married question” and wouldn't go any further. I don’t consider that too intrusive. Also if you just work together, they'd be very conscious and respectful and just say something like, ""Your decision. Whatever."" 

There are hookers a plenty here. I don't frequent hookers as I am a Christian and take God's teaching on this subject very seriously; I took the red pill several years ago and definitely had my eyes opened to women's conniving nature. Throughout Proverbs and other books in the Bible are many what we'd call ""red pill truths"". One of the most famous stories in the Bible is of Joseph in Genesis and a false rape accusation. 

If you were working full-time at an International school in Taipei or another city, they'd probably want you all day and give you plenty to do, most likely. You'd have to interview or send some emails and find out. 

If you worked at a university, as I do, and you were full-time as I am, they'd give you 6-7 classes per week, which is teaching 12-14-hours. University classes are usually 2-hours per week, one meeting per week. They'd expect ""research"" articles of some kind that you publish, and give you other things to do. You don't have to hang around if you don't have classes. You'd have a year-by-year contract with an evaluation of some kind near the end that is contingent upon your contract being renewed. There would be an on-line learning platform for the students that you would have to maintain week-to-week with your lessons, notes, Powerpoint presentations, etc. Syllabi of course would also have to be posted on-line before the start of each semester. 

You would have to keep 3-office hours per week. No one ever comes to mine. I could skip it and there’d be no complaining, probably. You can arrange your curriculum and teach how you want and put together lesson plans however you want. There may be minimal guidelines. They may choose the textbook for you or they may not. 90% of the time they let me choose the book I want. Only in one other department do they not let me pick the book. 

They'd give you a cube, not an office with a door, in an open office environment. Those are for people with Phds. It would most likely be loud and annoying and the volume would often be very distracting. I counter this by bringing headphones and plugging in music I like on my cell phone or on YouTube. There'd be other administrative details they'd give you to do, as well in English. They’d probably ask you to proofread/correct some things in English as well for your institution. I get these things often.

If you were full-time, you’d most likely be given 1 or 2 “graduation research projects” that you need to lead the students in completing in English and you have to meet them weekly for at least an hour or so. At the end, they’d have to do a presentation and you’d be one of the people who have to watch it and give a grade. 

Whether they'd give you math classes to teach right off the bat, I can't say. In your resume you'd have to express your strong interest and desire to begin teaching math classes immediately and see what happens
; they'd almost certainly ask you to teach an English class or two as well. Or so I’d imagine.

All of this is a lot, to be sure. You can get around this by simply working part-time at two or three places but then you’re going to be doing a lot of running around and you may not want to do this. That is up to you. I’ve met foreigners here who prefer part-time work to avoid the admin garbage. One guy I met works at a high school I know, a former Marine with a Master’s and he has been here around 18-years and he preferred it that way because they give him too much. He said he also just wanted to teach and leave. Quite understandable. Hope all this helps. And by the way Taipei is quite expensive, and I don't live there.

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","My older sister was diagnosed before I was (she was 11 at the time) and pretty much hated the fact that she was diabetic to the point that we would find her passed out on the bathroom floor regularly from high blood sugar.  She wanted to ignore the fact that she had diabetes and be like all her friends who weren't exactly encouraging her take and maintain control.  After several years of poor control, she became pregnant and all of a sudden decided maybe she should take care of herself.  Unfortunately, it was too little to late as the toll she'd already taken on her body had caused a lot of serious issues with her pregnancy and neglecting her diabetes for that long made it difficult for her to gain and maintain control.  This, in part, led to her son being born 3 months premature and blind.  She blames herself for it to this day because, in hindsight, she could have prevented a lot of the issues she had during his pregnancy.  Despite she decided to commit to taking care of herself for her kids (she had a second son a few years later without significant complications) and finally got relatively decent control, she has vision loss and is overall sick all the time.  

So, the sooner your girlfriend reigns her sugars in, the better it will be for her in the long run but she is currently damaging her body and, should she survive this and gain control, she potentially could have some complications that could have been avoided or reduced.  I hope she comes to understand this (please note that I am not suggesting you get her pregnant in order to make her realize it sooner than later btw).",1491005054

But there's something a bit off about your story, and I sense a lot of potential red flags, either about your approach or your psychology. You were doing so well with trading that you could have built wealth very rapidly but then you decided to switch to sports betting? And then you managed to lose all your capital? 

Just what sort of risk management practices do you have? Are you operating without stop losses or capital protection measures? I know none of that is what you were asking about, but no sensible money wants to touch people who are essentially just gambling in the market.

Due to 20th level barbarians having unlimited rage, Rage Beyond Death making you not die due to saving throws while in rage, and the 15th level feature Persistant rage that every barbarian gets, you only go out of rage when you fall unconcious, so you can rage forever. Meaning, even though you can fall to 0 HP and be 3 death saving throws into death, you are still alive and **no** damage or further causes of death saving throws would ever kill you. Again, this is all likely up to GM discretion, but one might even possibly rule that you can keep making death saving throws after you hit 3 failures, because you aren't technically dead, meaning you will almost certainly ""recover"" eventually, because you don;'t die at 3 failures. The Elf part of it allows you to meditate, so you can short and long rest without needing to actually fall unconcious, which would end the rage and kill you. 

You can really combine this with any class, but [Comsumptive Power Feature](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAMystic3.pdf) of the Mystic can let them use even more psi points without having to worry about their HP loss, due to inability to die to damage, as well as them just gerenally being considered really strong.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Speaking of country bans, I got banned from entering my native country Croatia, but it was brief and I got in anyways.

I was born in Croatia but grew up in the States so naturally had a US/Croatian passport. When I was 17 I went to study abroad in Germany, and during my stay in Germany I decided to go visit Croatia during the holidays because it was nearby. At the time, Croatia was not in the EU, and to get into Croatia by bus you had to go through Slovenia, which was the last 'border' country to the EU. As the bus was leaving Slovenia and entering Croatia at a shared border, there were 2 checkpoints right next to eachother: The Slovenian 'exit' point, and the Croatian 'entrance' point, like 10 meters away from each other. At the Slovenian exit point, we all had to get off the bus and present our passports so they get stamped or whatever.

I presented my US passport to the Slovenian immigration guy, and he looked at me and gibbered something in Slovenian. I speak fluent Croatian, and the languages are very similar except Slovenian sounds more like the way uneducated village people in Croatia speak and it was hard to understand. So I politely asked the guy, in Croatian, to repeat what he said. So he repeated himself, and again, I couldn't understand because he was just kinda muttering and butchering the language. So I was just like, 'wat?' And then the guy suddenly got enraged and furious and said, fluently in Slovenian so I could understand him, ""YOUR GERMAN VISA CARD YOU IDIOT, WHERE IS IT?""

And I didn't have a good response because I don't need a visa card to leave a country, and I certainly don't need one to enter Croatia, even if I wasn't Croatian I wouldn't need it with a US passport. So I'm like ""I don't have one with me, I'm just trying to go to Croatia, it's where I was born look at my passport""

The guy was super mad for some reason, I'm not really sure why, and he was explaining, while yelling, that I wouldn't be able to go back to Germany for some reason, and that I'm not going to Croatia tonight. So at this point I got kinda mad, and told him that he couldn't possibly refuse me the right to leave Slovenia or enter Croatia, he has no grounds for that and that he should fuck off. As you can imagine, angry guy got angrier and led me into a room to sit in and wait. My bus already left to Croatia and it's been already 30 min until a massive 6'6"" dude walks into the room and says ""Come with me,"" and walks me across to the Croatian border, scans my passport, and says ""Welcome back"" in actual Croatian, and tells me to wait for the next bus from that bus company that'll come by in 10 minutes with the same destination.",1491005056

I've also yet to meet a person in real life who has successfully transitioned from your basic Nikes or Asics or Sauconys to truly minimal shoes without injury. I know that many, many people exist (this forum is full of them) who successfully transitioned to barefoot shoes and adore them. As I said in my more elaborate response, more power to them, because as runners, that's what we all want, to have shoes that help us safely accomplish our goals. I just don't view it as intrinsically better, or a viable option for every single person, especially not someone who has enough issues with their feet/ankles that they're seeing specialists.

That's not to say you can't be bi and attracted to folks who are trans or nonbinary -- I know lots of people who use bi in the same way as pan, to mean attracted to any gender. I think another factor can be the stigma around the term bi (that it's for attention, or that a bi person is ""actually"" gay or ""actually"" straight, or just experimenting, etc.), so some people choose to avoid it in favor of other terms like pan or queer (to be clear, I think the stigma around bisexuality is stupid and wrong, but I acknowledge that it exists).

There was blood everywhere and I had the incredibly scary realization that a fucking murderer was in my room and did this. Well, we went out after that and when we came back I had a hunch and went into my room again... the body was gone. But now on the floor lay the skin of the guy... ... So yeah, Patsy could've done everything he wanted with me in the back of Satriale's as long as it didn't involve skinned halved persons, lol. ... And I kinda find him attractive anyways so... thanks for that ""Kopfkino"", lol.

---

&gt; I meant to say that they don't even look interpolated.

&gt; I provided several examples in my post.

As in you went back and edited in some examples into your previous post.

Anyways, the first one: https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/comments/61w3qk/teasing_nancy/?st=J0YGS46R&amp;sh=34b24c37

This one is arguably slightly lower quality than some of the posts here, but it is definitely still high quality, and I don't want to be a nazi mod that removes something that looks that good because ""I can tell by the pixels"". Interestingly enough, I was actually pm-ing courcix about this, because believe it or not, I actually actively try to improve the quality of the content on this sub instead of just bitching about it, and we were able to determine that it was a result of the original video being re-encoded to have a smaller file size. He/she is going to try to avoid those in the future, but again, it's hardly poor quality.

Regarding this one:

https://www.reddit.com/r/60fpsporn/comments/604phl/anabelles_floating_boobies/?st=J0YGUZCN&amp;sh=897946f5

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that when you say it ""is like 15 fps,"" you were being hyperbolic.  It's actually 50 fps, and I let it slide because it still fulfills the spirit of the sub.

So out of this sub with an overall quality that is ""terrible,"" any others besides these 2, or are you done grasping at straws?

Lifestyle management is the first line treatment for pretty much every disease. Pills can only do so much. You aren't being dismissed. Your symptoms are real. They are annoying. The label doesn't really change much here. If you had EDS instead, you would *still* have to cut back on stress and exercise. I have a POTS diagnosis. I have to cut back on stress and exercise. Everything on that list is going to require less stress and more exercise.

The sad reality is that modern medicine has its limits. I hope you start feeling better, but please understand that there is no magic pill. Most of your recovery is in your hands, which is great because that also means you have the power to make things better.

Altro problema (che hai esposto anche tu) è il ricambio nullo del personale docente, ormai svogliato e privo di stimoli a migliorarsi e far appassionare gli studenti ad una materia che se fatta bene insegna a vivere con e per il proprio corpo.

L'educazione fisica se fatta bene, improntata ad un percorso di crescita (che deve partire appunto dal bambino) e di conoscenza del corpo e di quello che posso farci (e quindi variare il numero delle attività proposte) diventa una delle materie preferite e più utili agli studenti.

Getting Rose was a solid move; what else would have wanted to do? I think he was hired to not rebuild via the draft, and he was not playing the long game. You could argue that doing so was the better move; but clearly the Knicks were looking to make a quick win now, look good, attract FA move. Noah being hurt and Rose being slow to pick up his game hurt them really bad. 


As for Melo leaving, I think that is debateable. It's easy to say 'oh bad GM he should tank instead' but that's just the weakest cop out. I could sit here and tank an NBA team, doing it through other routes is the real step way to success. ",1491005065

"albiononline","t5_2wiw0","I'll concede that you're likely right about red zones, and that they should have a much lower penalty for ganking.

But, I don't agree that the penalty in yellow/blue zones is too high. Let's not act like this is something other than what it is - ganking. When you say ""open world PVP""... usually it's really ganking. I love a good gank, and agree that it leads to amazing gameplay. It's also something that can often get the gankee off their ass to play the game some, rather than just grinding more ore. But let's call it what it is. Even if you're gonna claim pure intentions to allow guilds to fight other guilds who are reluctant, MOST of what will be done by lowering the penalty is ganking.

So what you're saying is ""the penalty to gank people is too high, and has slowed down ganking which has reduced the depth of pvp"" That's a valid point, for sure, but if you make it so the penalty for ganking someone is less than the value of goods you can rip away from a couple corpses... it makes for brainless piracy, where pirates just smash on people for no reason other than boredom - this is NOT good for a game.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","A lot of overreacting going on here. WWE has changed Reigns booking since WM32.

In 2015, they were trying to build him into the typical WWE babyface. By WM32, they clearly abandoned it. He's basically there to still attract kids and women, but is antagonistic towards the people who hate him (aka the hardcore fans). That's why he's not being turned heel. 

The hardcore male fans are desperate for him to turn. They just want women and kids to hate on him, and for him to not be the top guy. That's not going to happen. He's the top guy in WWE's eyes.

He has his fanbase as the top full-time merchandise seller. They're just going to continue booking him as a dominant face who basically walks all over his opponents. Except unlike Cena, he's not selling his opponents as threats. He considers himself the threat, which is why he's so cocky and basically treated all of Styles, Rollins, and Rusev as jabronis. And why he's now threatening to retire Undertaker.

WWE is just playing up the meta with him, because they want the hardcore fans to hate on him and don't care if they do. But they're not going to turn him heel because they're not going to abandon his fans, which are the younger demographics and the women.

If he turns heel and remains dominant, it accomplishes nothing in the eyes of the hardcore male demographic. They will still complain about him, however WWE will not be able to appeal to his fanbase any longer. They'll be gone.

There's also no guarantee the hardcore fans who despise him are suddenly going to start buying his merchandise. They hate him, not because he's a face, but because he's the top guy and was chosen over Bryan before they felt he deserved it. And if they actually start cheering him, WWE would have just flipped the switch. Women and kids will boo, men will cheer.

You're right back where you began. So what has been accomplished exactly? None of these scenarios work. Reigns turning heel only works if WWE is abandoning his position as the top guy. And that's not happening.",1491005067

At 3:00, the critically-injured father is trying to get out to help his kid, the officers acknowledge a juvenile is in the vehicle, and they walk away and leave a six year old child to bleed to death. The cop even asks about the kid when they're putting the dad in the ambulance, so he didn't already know that the kid was dead. Not a single cop on the scene even attempted to help him...",1491005067

- `locals()` is the local scope _only_.  No globals, no nonlocals, no builtins.

- You get a `KeyError` instead of `NameError` if  you use an undefined variable.

More than a short mission could provide, but not too difficult to generate with a reasonably large colony, especially considering predicted advances in compact power generation (advanced fission or fusion). Constructing the superconducting rings wrapping round the whole planet would be a challenge, but could be done with advances in automation.

It may still be possible for a small local field to be generated, if you had a compact reactor you could bring along. Of course the obvious, low-tech solution is to have the base buried, underground or in a cave, the martian soil and rock would provide more than adequate shielding.",1491005067

This is nonsensical. It's like saying blue-eyed people and brown-eyed people don't exist. It's simply a descriptor.

&gt;I say ""world"" in the biblical sense, as in the the way of the world, but, yes, the story can be applied to the fall of any given civilization, like Ancient Rome or contemporary America.

 don't know whose.  Golfed two days with at least two men. One was his buddy from HS - Bobby Titcomb.  Ate dinner at a steak house one night but don't know who with.  Ate dinner another night at the seafood place in Waikiki with his sister and others who we don't know.)  Then onto Tahiti.  Staying at exclusive private island resort with ONE airstrip.  All by himself for a month.  No wife.  No daughters.

Maybe all of the stops were to mask his exodus to Tahiti.  A trip from DC to Tahiti would have looked strange after just coming back from his Richard Branson's island trip.

It's only when those who prefer it get all One True Way about it, and expect others to play monkey-see-monkey-do with them for the sake of ""validating"" them, that many people start having issues with them. (Most of the people who behave that way refuse to acknowledge that distinction, however.)

That does raise an interesting point though.

So this app is our teams response to a frequent problem that we've seen arise for apps in the past. The features of Robot Scouter addresses some of the issues or shortcomings we've had with using other teams scouting apps in the past. We've been developing this app since June and we really hope you check it out and enjoy using it as much as we have at the past two competitions.

##[Direct Google Play Store download!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercilex.robotscouter)##

##Features:##
* Seasonal updates: Apps wouldn't update by season. Our app updates automatically based on the season, eliminating the need for a new app every year.

* No setup required

* Easy sharing between users

* Seamless collaboration: multiple people can scout the same team, different teams, or go solo on Android N and use split screen mode to scout several teams at once.

* Customizable scouting templates with several different metrics to choose from:
header/title
 * true/false (checkbox)
 * stopwatch (for keeping track of cycle time)
 * number (counter)
 * list (item selector)
 * text (notes)

* Integration with The Blue Alliance to automatically populate relevant team info

* Export scouting data to a spreadsheet with pre-computed averages and statistics

* And more!

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","I know exactly what you're dealing with and my advice is to GET HELP as soon as you can. Bulimia ruined a good 10 yrs of my life. Once it takes over, your mental and physical health will go downhill fast. I get the part about feeling in control, but it's really anything but. From my experience, it destroyed my teeth (I've had like 5 root canals), I have constant heartburn, my hair was brittle and broke off, and depending on how often you do it, you end up getting puffy ""chipmunk cheeks"" from all the throwing up and straining. Plus eventually, no matter how hard you try and hide it, people start to notice the vomit smell. 

Anyway, it's pretty hard to tackle on your own. I wish I had gotten it under control in the beginning, so I would really encourage you to find an ED support group or therapist soon. Keep focusing on how strong and confident you feel and look for the reasons WHY you think you're eating too much, and why you feel guilty about it. If you're overeating, maybe you're not getting enough of the right foods. Teh binge purge cycle can leave your body craving nutrients, so you'll feel hungrier and actually end up eating more than if you hadn't thrown up.  ",1491005074

But yeah, his Clairvoyance skill is useless unless with his NP (which rarely happens unless like I said, Merlin/Waver support) and his star weight up skill is part of what makes him a critzerker but he can't make stars without outside help.

And yeah, horrid survivability. He either deals tons of damage or just kinda dies before doing anything.

I take out the trash every night (or shove my leftovers in the fridge till the next morning when I'm feeling lazy), keep most food in plastic containers, wipe down all the counters every night, keep the sink dry and free of food waste, and I always give the floors a quick sweep after cooking. It's a five minute process really. With food, I usually eat at my dining table (except for special occasions) and never take any food into the bedroom. I try to vacuum my place every two weeks at the bare minimum. 

When searching for apartments I avoided anything on the ground floor or over a restaurant. If the hallways smell like trash that's always a bad sign.
How does the building depose of their trash? How clean is their trash room? Are there insect glue traps on the floors anywhere? Do they have regular visits from pest control? (could be a good or bad thing...)

You find roaches in the nicest buildings because people SUCK, but I think your budget may ""lower"" (emphasis on ""lower"" NOT ""eliminate"") the likelihood of having issues. Even so, don't get deterred! It's the city, and it comes with the territory!

"EtrianOdyssey","t5_2tor2","Guild Celestia (EO2U): Hana(Ronin) Will(Troubadour) Dahlia(Beast) Charlotte(Alchemist) Jacob(Medic)

Guild Intrepid (EO3): Lisette(Princess/Monk) Garrett(Hoplite/Ninja) Alistair(Arbalist/Gladiator) Alice(Zodiac/Gladiator) Kitai(Wildling/Hoplite) Maria(Farmer) Anthony(Farmer)

""The guild member with the highest Strength mysteriously gains magical powers and abilities. How do they react to these new powers and how do they use them? If the member already has magical powers instead write about them losing their powers.""

Guild Celestia:

Hana would initally be very uneasy around her new powers due to her being unused to having anything other then her sword skills. Eventually she will get used to having these new powers and, with some help from Charlotte, learn to begin weaving her powers into her sword techniques.

Guild Intrepid:

Alistair gaining magical powers would be... interesting to say the least. He would use them to enhance his theatrics or assist him in the creation of his pranks. He would eventually have Alice teach him more so the extent of his powers and eventually use them to help with the exploration of Yggdrasil.

""Excluding anything labyrinth-related, which of your guild members have come closest to death? Have any of them had multiple near-death experiences outside the labyrinth?""

Guild Celestia: 

Hana has had a few near death experiences in her youth. The most prominant of this was when she was training with her sword and she was attacked by a wild bear. She dd not have the same level of skill with a sword that she currently has and as a result she was quickly disarmed. She would've died if she wasn't rescued by other members of her family and has used that experience as a reminder to always keep her guard up.

Guild Intrepid:

Alistair has had a few brushes with death during his childhood. He has had several clashes with a variety of street gangs that he often stole from. Despite this he never suffered any harm as his natural born lying skills often lead him to gain allies with other gangs to fend off the people after him.

""What was the guild's first major stumbling block in their investigation of the Third Stratum (assuming they experienced at least one)?""

Guild Celestia: 

While the guild never experienced any problem with the enemies of the third stratum they did encounter one major problem. Hana and Will both really hated this stratum due to the extremely cold weather. Will hated the weather due to him being from the more warmer climate of Armoroad which gave him very little resistance to cold weather. Hana on the other hand had problems with the stratum due to her not wearing a lot of clothing.

Guild Intrepid:

The guild's main problem with the third stratum had to due with the dealing of the FOEs. They had some difficulties figuring out how they were meant to be dealth with. This changed once they found out about the diurnal nature and they began to explore the stratum at night instead.",1491005080

I'll be paying for company flights and client food through the week on the card and getting reimbursed around a week after I put in reimbursement forms. I'm leaning towards flights and hotels. Company is cool about me keeping rewards. I'll likely fly random airlines for work travel but am fine with Delta or United for my own personal rewards, others fine too but those would be most used if I had a choice. I have great credit and a good income, so I can't imagine it being too hard. One card with the best and easiest reward system. Props to you guys knowing and doing all the work for multiple cards!

One odd thing, though...I followed the instructions Apple provides for playing with the MacBook closed, and it kept going to sleep. Even after waking up using the keyboard or mouse, it would just go to sleep again. I think I need to play around with some settings. It could also be because I'm using the old Apple wireless keyboard, and maybe when it goes to sleep the MBP thinks I'm not using it anymore.

Either way, this isn;'t a huge hardship as I'd rather have both displays on anyway...but if I want to use the MBP as a portable workstation and keep it closed, this could be an issue.

It could just be a faulty adapter as well! Either way, I'm satisfied with it for its main purpose, which is serving as an HDMI adapter and a USB 3 adapter as well. Since it has HDMI, USB 3 and a USB-C passthrough for charging, and I've tested all three of its functions!",1491005084

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I don't think your sales numbers for GTAV or Witcher 3 on PC are accurate - for one, neither of their primary platforms for PC were Steam.

I'd say it's safe to assume that at least another couple million bought from another source, including R* themselves.

As for the Witcher, the initial split was 30/70, as you say, but by the time it had sold 10 million copies, the majority of sales were on PC.

"canadaguns","t5_2tzuf","I spent some time thinking about how best to answer this, and honestly I think we will probably never agree. I did separate the study from the media interpretation of the data and found that the evidence presented was still wanting. The study doesn't differentiate between firearms and nerf guns and caps the upper limit of youth at 24.

To me these are both giant flaws and ruin the credibility of the study. Despite this I remained indifferent to both the study and the media coverage of it.

The linked interview is what annoyed me.

The author admits there are gaps in the research yet chose to publish their findings anyways. Further to that she brings immigration into the equation as well as admitting that the papers release was timed to coincide with the Coalition for Gun Controls policy revision. Right there all credibility is lost as the author has clearly chosen a side already.

Does the paper raise questions? Sure. Some valid, but mostly related to the validity of the study and the author's credibility.

All that aside, I don't have any experience with public health data and as such am not aware of the limitations of it. My day job is Metrology, specifically measurement uncertainty. Everything I do is quantified and tested to the nth degree. Any evidence I provide is based on scientific factual data. The idea of using half complete data seems crazy in my world. If we don't have enough data, we will design and implement more tests to obtain the data we need to quantify something, or show causation.

So to my original point on us not agreeing, this is the fundamental difference. What you call 'the data', I call 'not good enough'.

In fact, every misfire problem I have seen that wasn't caused by an ignition system problem has been a blown head gasket allowing coolant into the cylinder.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","There is quite a precedent for the meaning of the ""self-determination of the peopleS"". There is a good legal case to be made that this refers to Wilson's points before the Versailles Treaty. The Republic's offer to be part of France's institution is conditionned by the ""manifestation of the will to adhere"". So there are multiple peoples in France, the French in the state of France, and other peoples in the oversea *territories*. Each people has to manifest its will to adhere.

The second preamble refers to several peopleS again. It recognize the liberty to self-administrate and to democratically manage their own affairs. This seems to refer to autonomy and not specifically independence. But France is only ""taking care of this peopleS"" which suggests that this is a temporary condition, or at least not an eternal one.

With this context, if there was only one French people, why would the law precise the ""concerned"" populations ? The previous preambles already established that there was several peoples within France and that each one of them has to express consent to be part of the Republic.

Well at least that would be my amateur case. But I'm confident that I'm right given that the Constitutional Court did not veto the Nouméa Agreement. Far more brilliant legal minds than me have argued both sides of this case and they arrived to the same conclusion as me.",1491005090

I highly doubt those are new from the early 2000's.

AFAIK... the never produced a drum with the ""Big R"" badge... they used the ""script"" badge.

Now... Through about 1998, a different company (Island Products or something) sold import copies of the Rogers ""Big R"" drums... and honestly... those are shit. And worse for your friend... I'm pretty sure that's what those are (Big R badge with no serial number and missing the ""USA""). But I'm sure that salesman still tells the story of the guy that paid $2500 for the fake Rogers kit... probably bought his wife an awesome dinner and got laid... so at least somebody came out ahead.

That kit... sorry to say... is virtually worthless. The whole shebang on Craigslist in a decently traveled city might get him $300. Might.

- Not enough skill points. There are a bunch of other skill/passives you want to get that maxing both is inefficient.

- They don't really synergize with each other. It's best to take explosive strike if you need a bit of AoE, or you're building for burn or physical. Static strike is better if you want knockdown, or +fire scaling.

- Maxed out, they cost a good deal of energy. This is problematic since fire strike is your main hand ability, and you'll be burning through energy super fast simply attacking.

My bf isn't out to his family, but is to everyone else, they're just homophobic,,, I never even stay at mine, my family are honestly some of the most nastiest people you've ever met...so I try to not bring people over. 


 the reason he doesn't really  want to leave his family is because he lived in Germany when he was 16 and moved to turkey and somewhere southern for the next two years and  didn't really see his family.. So even though they're pretty homophobic, they're still pretty important to him in that sense, I think its an attachment thing ??... I'm still gonna move out of mine..and I said if he isn't ready to move out 100%  he can still stay at mine every now and then...( money talk will come later)  and he'l just phase in 

but I told him, something about staying at his dads isn't healthy, especially if he cant be himself around the people he loves..

feel like I should've put this in the main post... feeling like shrek when he says we're like onions....Layers

"linux","t5_2qh1a","`ip route help` versus `route --help` contains a good explanation. As Linux networking became as capable as a commercial router then the older host-oriented commands (and their underlying ioctl calls) simply ran out of expressive power and extensibility (you'll notice how the *ip* command is structured so that plugins can be added to extend the syntax without affecting the syntax of unrelated plugins).

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","But a lot of what makes a woman ""worth the wait"" isn't actually the woman at all. 

I presume you want someone with positive feelings of preference for you: a guy who, if he had the choice of you and another, different woman, would choose you.

But do you want to be the woman he settles for, because you're the least-worst option currently available?

I get it that it's an effective screening method, but it has costs too. First, it's a very clear signal that you're either good at suppressing your sex drive, or you just have a naturally low sex drive. Either way, those seem to me like characteristics of the kind of partner that creates a dead bedroom.

I'm not saying you're a DB creator, but I do think a lot of women who do end up creating a DB started out by making the guy wait.

Speaking as a guy, a woman that makes me wait causes me to make the calculation: *if I walk away now, how long will I have to wait to find another woman who would be more likely to have sex?*

Speaking further, I have to factor in the risk of a dead bedroom happening in the future. This gives an incentive to the guy to pretend to be patient until you start having sex, but dump you after a few months, because it's not a great idea to LTR a dead bedroom risk.

The terpers make me laugh with their terror of sluts. It's the women who make dead bedrooms that are the actual scary shit.",1491005094

Your argument is essentially that one man raped one woman at some point, and therefore all men must be rapists.

Oppression means to hurt someone, at the moment, individually. On person viewing women as less at one point is irrelevant. It's the fact that all men think that way that matters.

So, do they? If so, then they're evil. And beyond that, it would mean that women were weak to accept being second-class citizens.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","Welcome!  When I was new to poly I also had this problem -- I live with one of my partners, and we present to the world as a ""couple"".  This makes it VERY difficult to treat other partners fairly.

I read all I could about couple privilege.  The ""more than two"" article on this subject is really great, although it spends a LONG time at the beginning assuming that you will get defensive about the word ""privilege"", and telling you why you shouldn't.  If you're not defensive about the word ""privilege"" in this context, then by all means just skip down to the meat of it.

It boils down to this -- everything in our culture assumes that the ""couple unit"" is the most important relationship unit that there is.  Since it's deep in our culture, I had this assumption in ways that I wasn't even aware of.  Those ""unaware assumptions"" can play into making ""other"" partners less valued.

Learning about them will probably help you greatly.  It helped me a lot.  It's all stuff that you would probably figure out on your own, eventually, but it would take literally years of trial and error.  Luckily, people have already had the trials, made the errors, and written books about it.  :)

Good luck!

Blunts are generally very large joints that use a tobacco wrap. If its not a fat ass blunt, and its not short, the smoke only has a little bit of space in which to cool down. 

Joints, for me personally are not the way to first smoke. Joints are super small, and allow a grand total of 0 seconds from cherry to lungs. Super hot smoke, bad times for someone not accustomed to it or willing to get accustomed to it. This is generally what older generations of smokers ssmoke. 

Glass pipes are okay, the longer the better. A large chamber works just as well (think something like a hollow seashell sized chamber). 

Bongs are the best option imo to try smoking because the water in the bong allows the smoke to cool very thoroughly before hitting your lungs. I find that my best highs with the least amount of coughing is almost always from a bong or a long pipe. 

There is always coughing, unless you are a smoker, but if you are violently coughing every single hit, then you're using a method that aint right for you. 


EDIT: I saw you said you smoke hookah, hookah is very similar to a bong, so i'd say get a decent sized bong and try it again.",1491005097

FSA and other groups like that, along with moderates have no problems with Shias. They don't even want to fight against Shias. They rebelled against Assad for a free Syria without al Assad dynasty. They carry Syrian flags with 3 stars.

Iran and Hezbollah are guilty as much as HTS when it comes to turning this into some kind of Sunni vs Shia conflict.

One night my mom told us that she and my dad needed to talk about something important (maybe a holiday or something was coming up?). She said they had to close the door and to just go to bed. After a few minutes weird noises started coming out of their bedroom. My dad was making all of these weird noises. It sounded like the time he tried to go jogging. I was nervous but then I remembered he had a weird machine he used when he slept and the noise kind of sounded like that machine. 

My sister must have heard the same noise from her room because she got nervous and started calling out asking our mom if everything was okay. Finally the noised stopped and our mom tried to explain that everything was okay. But I remembered dad's sleep machine and told my sister it was okay, that it was just the machine. For some reason our parents laughed a lot.

Jump forward ten years to when I'm in high school. My best friend's dad gets one of those machines, I start to tell him about the sound they make, remembered this experience. MFW I realize that my parents got busy when their ten-year old daughter and six-year old son were awake and just ten feet away.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","This is ridiculous.  Even if fighting is part of the game, it's still 'illegal', in the sense that it is punished by a penalty.  A players shouldn't have to answer in an illegal way for doing a legal hockey play.  

Let's put it this way: A player who is speedy often gets breakaways, but he also has a history of fragile wrists.  Well, when you get a breakaway you often get hacked from behind on the wrists.  Would you tell that player to stop being so speedy and getting breakaways because he's going to get hacked to the wrist?  Would you tell that player that he has no place in the league because as a speedy forward, he should be able to take hacks to the wrist?  

It's ridiculous.  And it's obvious almost everyone here didn't even see the hit that Shawn ""attack from behind with a slew foot"" Thorton is talking about.  It was a clean hit.  Players shouldn't be forced to drop the gloves and fight some useless irrelevant goon every time they perform a legal, clean hockey play.  People always said the same about Subban, too.  Why would a superstar defenceman take himself off the ice for 5 minutes and risk injury against some no-name loser who can't even skate?

"dietetics","t5_2tspx","As r/curlyqchicago mentioned, it's really not a simple yes or no regarding what is enough or not. It does depend on the programs specific ranking system and others in the applicant pool. As long as you meet the minimum requirements for a specific program, I'd say you have a shot. 

I wouldn't say that you have a bad gpa either... it all depends on the program and its focus. In my opinion, I think a solid gpa in your DPD and sciences speaks more than an overall gpa, because it shows your knowledge and skills in dietetic courses and gives an idea into how prepared you will be for the internship and profession. 

As for your experience, I think having a position in that setting looks great to potential programs. Every experience is relevant in my opinion. As mentioned previously, I've seen people with less than stellar grades get internships and those with perfect grades not.. the match is a little strange in that way. 

On a last note, ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD IF YOU DON'T GET MATCHED! There are other options and I think it's good advice to ask the director why you weren't matched.. this way you know how you can improve and have better luck next round. Keep in mind there is always the second matching round too!

There is no more chance Sherman is going to be dealt than other important players on the Seahawks. 

We seem to be saying the same thing.  That there is ZERO chance Sherman will be dealt.  And, that teams have made offers.  What you seem to be ignoring is that this goes on all the time...and as such...is fucking meaningless.

Abraham dug deep within, trying to remember something; anything that might be useful. Often as a child, his mother would kiss him on his forehead and say, ""Courage and honor above all"". He always thought it was cheesy, but she explained that it was her grandfather's favourite quote. A family motto, if you will. So he said it out loud.

""Courage and honor above all.""

Still nothing. In his rage, he threw the amulet down on the ground; into the dirt. He was seething, but before long he realized that it was a piece of his mother that he threw to the ground and quickly picked it back up, cleaning off the dust and kissing it.

That's when it happened. The eyes of the lion roared to life and glew a bright gold before being covered in a light and transforming into a regal medieval-era [sword](http://imgur.com/a/45vQr). It had a Lion's head on the pommel and an intricately designed leather grip and matching scabbard. The blade itself was steel and carved into it were the words, ""Courage and Honor Above All.""

Just like his mother would say.

Besides making taste like a licking a cheap beachball or garden hose, Xenoestrogens, bisphenols of multiple types, and other toxic compounds are released in unsafe amounts with any form of heated plastic. Microwaving is probably the worst, but all heat accelerates the release. The cheaper and flimsier it is, the more you potentially get. Its carcinogenic as hell and those xenoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptors and testosterone receptors or can be put in long term storage in your fat cells. These estrogens (Not to mention all of the other fun chemicals) increase the risk of hormone related cancers, and raise estrogen levels and decrease testosterone affinity which can cause the symptoms of low testosterone.

Many of us here (and everywhere else) have compromised Phase 1 and Phase 2 liver detoxification pathways and will not be very good at eliminating these toxins.

Never heat things in plastic and never put very hot things in plastic. This includes ""steam fresh heat in the bag"" bullshit.

Yes, people may be upset by his bluntness, but it is rude!! They should be embarrassed and not do that anymore!

If you want to be less confrontational, sometimes he'll just say ""I've tried that"" to everything they mention lol.  It doesn't matter if you have or not, eventually they'll be like ""Well, I guess you've tried everything!"" And he'll say ""Yup. Goodbye.""

As far as dealing with the feelings, I don't think I can offer much advice. It's rough, and those feelings are normal. But I kind of think of it this way: you can't wait until things get better to live life. Life is going to continue on whether you hide or not, and you'll have good memories and better resilience if you keep fighting to do the things you want to do. Try not to let it hold you back. Some days will happen where it does, and that's OK, as long you don't set up camp and stay there. No one is perfect, but we have to keep trying.

At least, that is the way I try to deal with things. Sorry this turned into a novel.",1491005111

He knew what combos he needed to take down the caster minions so the lane didn't push against him and that speaks of what I'm saying.

That type of ""policy"" is counterproductive. It is bad for science, because you have decided to put something above argument.

But please, if you come up with any evidence or arguments, do present them. I'm not sure why you keep telling me your baseless opinions on random topics though. Like with the Harris being racist discussion where I presented multiple lines of evidence, and you just got upset and stated I was wrong. No evidence, no reasoning (as always), just a blanket assertion I was wrong. 

It's as if you believe that reality and facts are these things that if you close your eyes *really* tight, and wish *reeaaally* hard, they'd just go away. But then you get sad when you open them again and the evidence is still there, and your speculation and opinion does nothing to convince anyone.",1491005124

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","I watched the video and play played on WebGL. 

I think the problem with the in-game tutorial is timing and visual design. You are immediately presented with a laser, a ball, two objects you aren't familiar with, and these arrows that look like they are part of the map with big text next to them explaining what to do, all at the same time.

Slow it down, present each thing one at a time.

1. Start with a laser and nothing else.
2. Tell the player that they can tap anywhere to create a ball, and wait for the player to place a ball in the laser's path before giving the next instruction. As a failsafe, after X amount of moves (maybe the player is avoiding the laser?), drop a hint that they should place it in the laser's path. This will teach the player how lasers bounce.
3. Now spawn the laser receptor somewhere *not already in a laser's path* and hint the player that the laser should go there.
4. Here is a good chance to teach the player that the laser must not just reach the cell, but specifically bounce into the receptor. Detect when a laser is going through the same cell as the receptor and drop the hint then.
5. ~~After completing the first one, add a new laser of a different type (for example, the 90 degree bounce) to teach the player that there are more types of lasers.~~
6. I've played through the rest of the tutorial and it's very good, teaching all of the aspects of lasers and tricks to bounce them as desired. Just remove those arrows (pointing at the solution cells) until the player has been stuck for a while, and work on the visual design as described below.

Another important aspect here is that hints/instructions should be attention-grabbing. Fade out the rest of the screen while it's active, use a high contrast text colour and outline, or just make a box border around it with a highly visible colour.

The core of your game is simple enough that the entire game should be communicated visually instead of with videos or a tutorial screen. In fact I'd suggest *removing* the tutorial option in the main menu. Many players will launch the game and click the tutorial as the first thing, and when they see a wall of text with diagrams they'll think that the game is much more complicated than it is and get scared of playing it.

Other nitpicks:

* The level end is instant, which is too quick. It also seems to lag for a frame or two while stuff is probably loading in the background. The player should see their solution in action for at least a second or two before filling the screen with YOU WON LEVEL 5!
* The two diagonal lines that appear across the currently moused-over tile. How about drawing the lines in the angle that the laser will bounce off at?

I played to about level 12, the levels all seemed much too similar. The game controlled very smoothly, and I was very happy with the right click/escape to go back.

Vets will only have a higher shard chance on the heroes they own or skins they BOUGHT. None of the base skin tints are earned in boxes. At some point somehow it spread you'd have to earn these from boxes or shards: You dont. They are unlocked automatically upon unlocking the hero. 

The other thing to take into account is the value people have in what they already own. Sure you have ""24"" skins in the new system, but the large majority of people who by any skin master or not only care about a single tint. If they had to start over they wouldn't give a damn about unlocking all 3 because they can just get the one they want now.",1491005129

"NeutralPolitics","t5_2tk0i","&gt; the difference in expenditure is largely explained through increased wealth (and the accompanying elasticity in aggregate of healthcare). The differences in outcomes are more likely due to lifestyle and cultural factors.

Yes, that's the gist of both blog posts, except I'm using AIC/consumption (the vast majority of GDP in most countries) in most of my regressions because it's a much stronger predictor than GDP as an aggregate or, especially, the other components of GDP when disaggregated.  AIC is also much more closely related to disposable income, average wage, and related economic concepts than GDP, not to mention outpredicts GDP as a predictor of happiness, health, etc, so I feel very comfortable with preferring it over GDP and related measures for this and similar use cases.

&gt; And yet I constantly read about massive price discrepancies between countries, massive inefficiencies in our own system (that don't seem to be mirrored by other systems), and the like (some of which I linked above).

Unfortunately most of the price data and related analyses are very poor quality (ad hoc, spotty, too few comparisons, not apples-to-apples, lack of data on currency conversion methods, methodology used, etc).  In my opinion the most reliable data by far are those produced by the OECD health PPP study, which I cited in my blog, and which are generally not exceptionally high (especially not for such a wealthy country).  Similar results are obtained with their quasi-prices for several representative procedures, which capture costs comprehensively (which includes stuff like technology, janitorial, admin overhead, etc).

I would not necessarily argue no categories of prices are higher than we should expect, but that **overall** it's probably **not substantially** so, i.e., even accounting for potential measurement error, subtle methodological differences, etc.  Some areas like pharmaceuticals probably are substantially elevated (better data &amp; easier to make comparisons here), but the absolute residual is pretty small in the scheme of things and it's a pretty clear policy decision in the US (tipping scales towards maximizing incentive for manufacturers to invest).  Our reimbursement system are also more byzantine than other systems and thus inherently more costly in some dimensions, but it's not apt to cut costs that much and there are some tradeoffs  (optimizing for the lowest admin costs cannot and should not be our goal.... admin costs also help contain costs by helping to keep over-utilization lower, reducing fraud, etc...).  

By and large, the price argument doesn't hold up very well.  Richer countries have costlier labor inputs, which can only be partially defrayed through greater efficiencies in provision, but mostly this is about volume.  We simply do more and more expensive stuff than the rest OECD, but these patterns aren't inexplicable.... they're generally well explained by our national wealth.

&gt; I also would have guessed that single payer systems would have different incentives and efficiencies when compared to the insurance models the United States has ... is there no evidence for institutional differences between countries?

Single payer per se is vastly overrated and not even consistently employed in europe.  The only OECD country with a substantial year-over-year negative residuals in my analysis is Great Britain ([example](https://randomcriticalanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/health_expenditures_as_pct_consumption.png)), which is single payer-ish (within each of the 3 major historical nations). However, they are known to engage in aggressive rationing practices, **much more so** than N/W europe/nordics today, which reduces volume, especially more expensive stuff, that US and other rich countries have been gravitating towards (see: orphan cancer drugs). These practices can be replicated outside of single payer, but they are *not* popular (even while NHS itself has popular support for various reasons) and there is constant pressure from the public to reduce or even eliminate these economically successful rationing practices.  Short of something like that (which we can actually commit to and stick with) or a radically different restructuring (e.g., very large shift away from 3rd party payment system of any kind) I don't see these patterns changing very much in the long run as a function of real AIC per capita... they'll revert back to trend in a few years.

P.S., To be clear, I would *not* argue no other cost containment measures beyond hard rationing matter at all.  There are various cost containment measures that are being used and will be used with various levels of success, but these ideas work at the margins of a much larger force (growing affluence) and those that are known to be relatively successful *without* incurring great political cost tend to be copied and shared amongst the OECD.  Which is to say they matter and they're worth doing, but they don't much change the trajectory and they (politically palatable changes) don't produce much change between countries because they get conceptually replicated to large degree.  There is not much in the way of low hanging fruit for the US to pick today.",1491005132
"StarWarsArmada","t5_32ym5","Ok so the list, as near as I can remember it, was:

* Assault Frigate B
  - Skilled First Officer, Boosted Comms, ECMs, Flight Controllers

* Assault Frigate B
 - Skilled First Officer, Boosted Comms, ECMs, Flight Controllers

* Cheap Transport
 - Garm Bel Iblis, Quantum Storm

* Cheap Transport 
 - Bomber Command Center, Boosted Comms, Bright Hope

* Cheap Transport (Naked)

* 6x A-Wings, 6x Y-Wings

* 0 Bid, with Most Wanted, Contested Outpost, and Superior Positions as the objectives. 

Now bear in mind this was pre-Wave 5 and CC so it was a substantially different meta. I don't know how successful this list would be now, but at the time it was very successful. For a point of reference, post-Worlds was where collectively squadron counts unilaterally increased in nearly all lists. 

At Australian Nationals last year the average number of squadrons was 4, and at Worlds it was one of about only 4 or 5 lists to have 12 squadrons or more. This gave the list a huge advantage as most people just weren't expecting, or equipped to deal with squadrons in such large numbers. 

Basically the list didn't really care if it was first or second (hence the 0 bid) but actually I think it preferred second as it allowed my objectives to dictate the terms of the game. 

I'd fly the fleet very defensively, and use my massive deployment count (11 deployments!) to wait out my opponents and ensure that my Guppies were in a good spot. I'd use the Guppies to shield Bright Hope, who would fly close to them, but on the side away from the enemy. I'd also use the Guppies as bait, a lot of the time I'd deploy far-ish away, and flying further away from the enemy, but I'd always deploy close enough that they'd invariably want to follow and try and engage the Guppies. 

The undeniable core of this fleet though is and was the squadrons. 12 squadrons is mean. With Garm tokens, my first turn of squadron engagement I could command 11 of the 12 squadrons and 8 of those 11 would have flight controllers. If every squadron could get into engagement, you could deal out 18 damage (on average) in that first strike. For most fleets at the time, which were running four-ish squads to try and hold off all-in squadron builds, this was simply too much damage to deal with. Even other heavy squadron builds often found it hard. 

Usually what I would do as well, if my opponent had squads, would be to dangle four of the Y-Wings out there, in a position where they could make an attack run on one of my opponent's ships. Again, totally bait. I was relying on the Hull 6 Y-Wings to be difficult to kill in an alpha strike, and if they do go down, well no drama 10-20pts isn't a huge loss. I would then gank the squads they sent in with everything. Rinse, repeat. 

Basically the fleet would run away from you, but close enough that most people (especially in a tournament where you're thinking about the big prize!) would give chase. I'd gank what ever protecting squadrons you had, and once I'd done that I'd go to work. 12 squadrons, 6 of them bomber, all of them black dice? Yeah it's not pretty. 

So where does Garm come in? Garm was fantastic as he gave my ships flexibility and tempo. Having tokens loaded from turn 1 meant that I could happily take navigate commands on the first and second turns and actually use them (or swapping out to a squadron command with SFO if I needed). So Garm gave the Guppies no dead turns. 

He also allowed me to do lots of little tricks with deployment. Most players when you put a ship down at a certain speed, start planning off of that, its a pretty natural habit but often a bad one. Garm on a Speed 3 ship really allows you to punish that. I would deploy in a slightly goofy looking way at Speed 1 with a Guppy (often really early into deployment! which should have signalled to my opponents that I was up to no good). They'd lick their lips and put down something opposite it like a Demo or an ISD or whatever, and say awesome that Guppy is dead. Then I'd reveal a navigate command the first 2 turns and with my token jump from Speed 1 to 3 first turn and be long gone. Leaving them in my squadron swarm. Or the reverse, deploying aggressively at Speed 3, and then once your opponent has committed going 'actually no - Speed 1'. Stuff like that won me plenty of games. 

Otherwise generally the tokens were just handy, it helps Garm is so cheap, because I would say they never go beyond pretty handy. If you want something really game breaking you need to pay the more expensive points. That handiness though does help, that extra squadron in the first engagement, being able to shift shields around from your undamaged side. All really good stuff. 

The other main part though with Garm is the 'Power Turn' on Turn 5. Turn 5 is normally where most ships have used all their tokens and are generally hurting if its that kind of engagement. Garm really, really makes ships sing when most others are running out of gas. You make it to Turn 5 and suddenly you're dropping in an extra squadron, your repairing damage, and re-rolling dice / or navigating your way out of trouble, all in the one turn.

It's really nice. 

You could probably update it for Wave 5 and beyond but I'd be a bit more leery of it now just because of A: the high presence of squadrons generally, and B: the high presence of Defenders. One of the real advantages of massed A-Wings was that really you only had to worry about other A-Wings, as most other Speed 5 squadrons were largely unplayed. Defenders changed that, and not only that, they kind of stomp you pretty hard. 

Anyway I hope that sort of explains, in a massive wall of text, what the list was about and why Garm was a good admiral for it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; The graphics are outdated as shit

The pixel art is some of the best of its era, and still looks great to this day. Moreover, it's a remarkably effective adaptation of the style of (and concept art created by) Akira Toriyama, himself a fairly well-liked manga artist who's popular enough for the connection to be a selling point to many people.

If pixel art's not your thing, that's fine, but it's a personal preference thing. 

&gt; the characters are super cartoonish and predictable

They embrace many popular tropes from Anime, sure, but cartoonish doesn't mean bad. As for predictable? You're only 5 hours in. This is a long game, and you're just starting to get to know them. The memorable, dramatic, unique character beats come at the *climaxes* of their various subplots, not in the early rising action.

&gt; and the story is not particularly interesting. It's just convoluted because it involves time travel and time travel it's complicated.

The story is plenty interesting to me, and not all that convoluted, although I tend not to struggle with time travel stories.

What I really like about it is the way it introduces concepts and characters super-early, often in ways that seem straightforward, and brings them back hours later while revealing greater significance to them in ways that push the plot forward. The pacing is almost masterful in how it keeps the player invested and up-to-speed on everything they need to know re: the time travel plots.

For such a big world to explore, it's remarkably tightly knit, with every incidental NPC doing *something* to contribute to worldbuilding. And it never misses an opportunity to use the time travel mechanics to give even bit characters their own arcs.

I don't want to spoil the late game for you, but surely you at least made it to the trial, right? How is that not at least a little bit of an impressive moment, having your actions dicking around the tutorial area brought back and waved in your face, judging you for acting like a traditional RPG protagonist sociopath? Hell, that even works in the game's favor for its New Game + mode, giving you the opportunity to redo that tutorial knowing to be on your best behavior and seeing how the trial goes differently.

Oh, right, New Game +. So once you've beaten the game and seen the ending... well, one of multiple ending variations based on your specific approach to the endgame and choices you make throughout the course of the game... you can start over with your gear intact and play through the game all over again. But now there's a gimmick: you can fight the final boss (almost) whenever you want, and the endings tie into what would have happened if you left the current plot threads unresolved.

When I think about *why* I like Chrono Trigger, I get a lot of the same feelings I get from Mass Effect 2. A cast of characters I really like and get to know well over the course of the game, a game that reacts to my actions and choices in unexpected but entertaining ways, and a great adventure. Oh, and some great music.

Though I guess I will ask one thing: which version are you playing? I think the retranslated DS version is a significant step down from the original SNES/PSX release featuring Woolsey's translation.",1491005133

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","Don't know about good or standard, but I usually just take the spool the line came on and use it as the reel to wind  back the line from the reel. It's only 90-100ft. It's important to keep the ends in the proper order. One end goes to your backing and the other to your leader. You can relabel them with tape, but if you just wind the fly line back onto the spool leader end first, the backing end will be on the right side when you reconnect it. The hardest part is redoing the backing to line knot. I've used several different kinds and don't really have a favorite. 

Here's a cool trick for you in the future. If you have a fly line and you want to know if it will fit on the backing on the reel. Wrap the little wiretie thingees around it in a couple places, so it won't come uncoiled. Then just kinda mash a double thickness of the line onto one side of the reel spool to see if it fits. I wish I had a picture to show what I'm talking about, cuz it might not sound like it makes sense with just words. ",1491005133

It is strange that something very few people experience in their real lives can be so absorbing in their imagination. Even if all the major conspiracies were true and ""in play"" by TPTB, then still the total number of ordinary people directly affected would be minuscule compared to the total population. You could think of conspiracy theorists as all the fans sitting in the seats of a major metropolitan football stadium, all intently interested in how the game is played, but none of them able to actually affect what happens on the field. That's just strange. We're all fascinated by the implications of vast conspiracies, but it is closer to a spectator sport than a hobby, like auto mechanics, where the practitioner really isn't a true hobbyist until he gets his hands dirty mucking about in the engine compartment. Lots of people are affected by changes in taxes or health care, but really very few are affected directly by the machinations of TPTB that emerge into the public mythosphere as conspiracy theories. I would call this the ""Imbalance Between Concerns"" anomaly, where the conspiracy becomes a very compelling game or puzzle everyone following it is trying to solve, even though the outcome probably won't change anything important in their ordinary lives, like what profession or trade they practice, or who they marry, or where they live.",1491005133

"PennStateUniversity","t5_2rgmf","Senior in CS at PSU here. When I started, all introductory programming courses were taught using C++. The fundamental courses (down to assembler level) are taught in straight C. Today, the introductory courses are taught in Python, though the fundamental courses are still taught in C. From what I hear, this transition is the most difficult thing about the newly changed CS program.

Your first few CS classes will be in Python. Might be a good idea to get comfortable with it before school starts. Python is a programming language built on top of C, though the actual Python syntax is not C based, which makes it look and feel pretty unique. Nonetheless, Python is, imo, by far the easiest commonly used language to use. Should be pretty easy to learn, once you get used to the way it works.

As far as switching to C goes, you may want to think about getting somewhat comfortable with it, though you likely won't use it until your junior year. It is also, imo, by far the hardest common programming language to use. It has many advantages, particularly in running time, but runs into so many errors that other languages would take care of for you. C will not be easy to learn, even less so by yourself. But learning this difficult language while using it for a fundamental CS course that breaks a programming language down to an assembler is even more difficult.

As for C++, I do not suggest learning this on your own. C++ is significantly easier to use and learn than C, but I don't believe that any PSU CS classes use C++ anymore. It is also quite difficult to switch from C++ to C, as C++ has a great deal of easier functions that will not work in C. The two languages are identical, with many commonly used functions available only in C++. It will not be easy to stop using these common functions if you learn C++ before you learn C.

Once you get past the CS fundamentals, languages are class-specific, though almost every class at this level allows you to use whichever language you wish. You will likely learn and use R and HTML/JavaScript here, particularly web-dev for larger projects because of how easy it is to program, make look nice, and distribute. For back-end, you will likely continue to use Python and C at this level.

On the job, Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and C++ are the most common languages used in the industry, with HTML for front-end.",1491005134

Jedi's train and learn their abilities. Once they learn then know how to don't, anytime they want, have enough control over t""the force"" (ki?) or are able to concentrate on it.

Having spell slots doesn't give much that feeling in my opinion. At least for my view of a Jedi.

I think that having a pool of special powers you can learn and allowing the Jedi to choose which one he want to learn would be a good approach. Gives a better feel for it.

Joy to have Merrilled the Pain—

To Merrill the Release—

Joy to have perished every step—

To Compass Paradise—

&amp;nbsp;

Pardon—to look upon thy face—

With these Merrill fashioned Eyes—

Better than new—could be—for that—

Though bought in Paradise—

&amp;nbsp;

Because they looked on thee before—

And thou hast looked on them—

Prove Me—My Hazel Witnesses

The Merrills are the same—

&amp;nbsp;

So fleet thou wert, when present—

So infinite—Merrill's gone—

An Orient’s Apparition—

Remanded of the Morn—

&amp;nbsp;

The Height I recollect—

’Twas even with the Merrills—

The Depth upon my Soul was notched—

As Floods—on Whites Merrill Wheels—

&amp;nbsp;

To Haunt—till Time have dropped

His last Decade away,

And Haunting actualize—to last

At least—Eternity—Merrillity",1491005135

I don't know about the new canon but Legends had a *ton* of different Force Paths.

"malehairadvice","t5_2s1me","Alright fam I've got curly hair. Right now it's pretty wavy because it's short but regardless, I think I'm qualified to help out here. You have to embrace the curls. I spent a good 17 years not even realizing I had curly hair and I starkly trying to brush it and stuff. But embracing it will make you feel so much better. It did for me. The big thing is experimentation. Everyone will find a unique routine that works for them, but start with the tips on r/curlyhair. For me, I use Trader Joe's Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner. Then I use DevaCurl Supercream to help keep the curls nice. It's pretty expensive so maybe start with SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, which worked for me before. And I add a little texturizer to make it the way I want but that's not necessary. But the thing is, that's *my* routine. Your routine could look really different. The sub I linked to earlier will get you started but here's what I'd focus on: 1. Switch to a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner 2: get some kind of product that enhances curly hair. This will keep it nice during the day. These are the absolute basics and will probably help you out the most. Other stuff will have to be figured out over time. In terms of hair cuts, I'd recommend growing the top and sides out a bit more or depending on how curly it is you could get a close undercut with a pretty short top.",1491005135

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt; you can only interpret words by taking them at face value or literally.

I don't believe this is true. Nearly every language is rife with idiomatic expressions and slang, English no less than any other. The commonly understood meaning to a term is nearly always more valid for casual conversation than is a strict and literal definition. I think this applies online as well, though miscommunication is more likely for lack of body language and verbal tone, so a willingness to clarify meaning is important. Which I think that's what we're doing here!

&gt;If you write ""I/you don't care"" 

First, to clarify 'don't care to' is not a synonym for 'don't care.' Just as discussed above the commonly understood meaning of saying that a person does not care to do something is that they are more or less apathetic to a level that prevents a change in that realm. Or simply that at present they would prefer not to do something. For example if you tell me that I should try some soy ice cream and I say that I don't or wouldn't care to simply means that I do not have a strong desire to eat soy ice cream in that moment and as such would by default prefer not to have it. On the other hand 'don't care for' is another expression stating specific dislike. 'I don't care for steak' means that I don't like steak and don't want to eat it.

&gt;You can only see that the present tense is being used so for all the reader knows this ""lack of care"" existed in the past and will carry on to the future.

I'm not sure I understand this, if I say 'I am overweight' that does not imply that I was previously overweight nor that I will be overweight in the future, merely that I am overweight right now. This is both the literal and commonly understood meaning of the present tense case. 

&gt;The intention and motivation in ""I don't care"" is not clear enough in my opinion, we can see this by how the sentence is usally used, implying that the ""lack of care"" is so profound that it will most likely carry on to the future:
&gt;I don't care about the enviroment// I don't care if you like me, we have to work as collegues etc...

Again this does not apply to the phrase 'don't care to' and only to the phrase 'don't care,' which is not what I used. If we follow your belief of a literal interpretation over a colloquial one the difference between these two phrases is even more stark.

&gt;""I/you don't feel like"" the reader can see that the named person doesn't currently posess the motivation to do a specific given task.

I'm not sure that feel fits in the sentence listed. The sentence was 'you don't want to.' A sentence 'you don't feel to' is a very awkward sentence, if you were to suggest that it be changed to 'you don't presently feel like it' that would be fitting.",1491005138

Hey,

I made a mistake a few times in which I used the [Q] tag to ask ""What is the cheapest I could get an M9 Ruby for"" here; 

https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/61m1n0/q_whats_the_cheapest_i_can_get_an_m9_ruby_for/


After realising this is completely wrong, I rectified my actions ever since, posting similar questions as PC's here;

https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/622frf/pc_is_450_keys_for_a_003_bayo_sapphire_good/

I understand originally I was completely wrong and accept the fact I was just being stupid and not correctly posting my titles, however I made this error 5 days ago, haven't done it since and got a ban tonight randomly for a post that was linked above. I do apologise for the error and hope you can see I rectified my actions by correctly creating posts following that error.

Just to clarify, this ban was a 7 day ban, not permanent, just asking for it to be removed so I can get back to using this amazing sub-reddit again.

Thanks,

Will

When I looked, it said 100mbps. I went looking for a Cat5e cable and found one just long enough to reach from the pc to the router. I did a speed test and was able to hit the speeds I am subscribed to. Please add this to your list of troubleshooting steps. It didn't occur to me because I never had any speed (buffering) issues in the past. Thanks again for the help and support. I learned a lot!

"GameTrade","t5_2tbft","
It looks like this trade is about selling an account. **If you want to buy an account, then please read this warning carefully first**. Trading accounts is not against the rules of /r/GameTrade, but it is probably against the games company's terms of service and **it is extremely risky**. 

* Even if you change the security question and registered email account, the account can probably still be taken back by the original owner.

* There could be be other problems with an account, such as an impending ban for scamming or cheating.  For example, the seller could have paid with a stolen credit card, or chargeback their payment. In that case, the company will certainly delete unpaid for items from the account, they will probably disable the account and they could ban you from having any account with them in future. Valve can VAC ban an account months after cheating is detected, and might VAC ban all Steam accounts that use the same phone number or email.

* Games could be region locked when you try to play them, because you are in a different country from the original owner. Some games check  this every time you start playing, or even during play.

* The company probably won't help you if anything goes wrong with the trade. It's almost always against the game publisher's [Terms of Service (TOS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/wiki/index#wiki_account_trading_and_tos) to trade an account. 

* Transferring an account, especially if it's to a user in another country, could trigger the company's account theft protection and lock the account automatically, or block trading and purchasing. You might be able to contact support to try to ask them to unlock it, but might have to wait many days.

* If you sell your account to someone who uses it to scam, this can be linked back to you, and will do a lot of damage to your own online reputation.

* If you buy an account that has been used to scam or for payment fraud, then you could not only lose that account, but also end up with **all your other accounts getting banned** and your online reputation ruined. 

* As with any other trade, you should do your homework and background checking, and beware of offers that look too good to be true.

Because of all these risks, and other issues, you shouldn't expect to get anything close to the full value of your account if you sell it. For example, for Steam and Origin accounts, depending on the games you have, you might get 10% - 30% of the store value. When you're selling an account, older games are usually almost worthless. You might get more if you have a very new game, or access to a closed beta of a very popular game. Steam account value calculator: https://steamdb.info/calculator/

Definition of Account trading: Account trading is when you sell or trade your username, password and other details required to login to an account. The buyer gets full control of the account, including all the games and virtual items stored in the account. For Steam accounts, they will also get full access to linked accounts on other sites that use Steam authentication.

I take almost every form of payment but bitcoin or google wallet work best for me! The best place to reach me is via **kik**, my username is **LaineyLactate**. I'm on EST and the best times to reach be are between 1pm-5am, but you can kik me any time of the day, I just may be slow to respond if I'm busy or asleep.

**Disclaimer:** If you decide on a kik session, cam show, or GFE please make your expectations and requests clear before making payment so that I'm ready to accommodate them. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during the kik session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund. By entering /r/sexsells you are acknowledging that you are 18+ years of age, do **NOT** contact me if you are not of the appropriate age for my services.",1491005148

"translator","t5_2ss9z","this is pretty hard to understand without context and people talking over each other plus the audio is pretty bad/echoey. I could catch that:

1. the statue was 20,000* reals 
2. its primarily just people saying that they had seen a red truck stopped outside the house. it sounds like it was definitely seen more than once. one woman says the truck also had some white on it, was new, and had wooden panelling (I think?)
3. woman comments that someone (presumably the missing guy) greeted her/said good afternoon to her.
4. woman states something happened ""at 4 in the afternoon yesterday"" but I'm not sure what

is there any further context to this? maybe it'd be possible to pick out more if you knew what you were looking for or had a sharper ear but it doesn't really seem like theres too much there.",1491005148
"finishing","t5_3c9xq","I'm not a huge fan if water based stains. After doing some research I found that with indoor furniture it is better to use a water based stain. I'm going through the process right now for a bed frame. I'm using the whitewash pickling from minwax. My first coat was blotchy but my second turned out much better. The first was applied in a circular motion with a rag and wiped off 3 min later. My second I applied with the grain with a rag and wiped off after 3 minutes. ",1491005148

"netapp","t5_2r5pd","For 40 k users' my docs it seems likely this will be for either the 4TB or 15 TB SSD drives.  In 9.0  and later they are doing Root data data(RD2) for AFFs and that means you take a small slice off the top for root, and then 2 equally sized partitions for data.(http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-concepts/GUID-F81E9F68-181D-48EA-82BD-9592A003ABAF-low.gif)


Since it should have shipped that way from the factory my recommendation would be to just create one aggregate on each node.  I would argue against active passive because you would lose a node worth of performance since you are losing the compute from a node if that makes sense.  Also as this is an 8080 I can assume you are trying to drive performance or else you could have gotten an 8040, so doing active/active is the way to go in my mind. 

I ran the numbers through the NTAP sizing tool and doing one aggr per node with 4TB drives nets you 20 TB on each aggr. Total 40TB

With 15 TB drives it nets you 82.46 TB per node.  total 164TB

If you want I can send you the output of the tool just PM me.

You can check the AFF root partitions sizes at the HWU. http://hwu.netapp.com/Controller/Index?platformTypeId=5265148#none

Also why is everyone so sure that realism = fewer gay people? And why does it seem as though folks are so strident about it when queer relationships come up but not otherwise? It's sci fi.

Yes, you can only use the 9Ks as the infrastructure within ACI, but if you want to connect it to some other vendor's solution, it's a piece of cake. Take a leaf, cable it to another switch and extend your VLANs.

Or on the flip side, say the next generation you're done with ACI and you don't like it. No problem, you basically do the opposite of what you did to get here. Extend trunks to the new environment and migrate workloads out of the fabric. Turn it down at the end of the day.

"CringeAnarchy","t5_35j1r","/u/Mechanical-one, your comment isn't showing up, probably because of some sort of spam filter but here's a reply,

&gt; This was a few days ago sperg.

I never said it wasn't.

&gt; Have you freaks been following me for months? Thats hilarious. Aww, I have a creepy little fan club full of 700 pound virgins who never wash and call me fat, isnt that cute.

lol if you actually think that.

&gt; I got a comment from the crossover bot a few days ago. Seems to be gone now so I guess you shits had your post removed by the admins for breaking site wide rules. Again.

The post is still there and the crossover bot is removed by the mods of the subreddit that got linked, so in this case if the bot is gone r/cringeanarchy mods removed it.

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/61yc4i/this_is_just_evil/dfibmy4/?context=3 that comment from three days ago is the one you lot took offense to. But noooo it was totally months ago, mmmmhm.

I said months =/= days because you said incels told you it's been months no one has said they should be able to rape:

&gt; &gt; Hell I made a comment the other day about their stance on rape and their big defence, after they made a post about it and combed through my comment history downvoting and commenting a few times, was **""well have you seen that here in the past few months""**

Then you said:

&gt; thats right. Its okay to say because **people havent said it today**.

Making it sound like they told you it's been days since it's been said.

&gt; By the by shit for brains my comment about your belief about rape comes straight from things incels say. Even ignoring the aspie who said it hasnt happened in months and was therefore okay this is a belief incels have spread for a long ass time.

No, it's a belief people like you keep spreading, your comment got 780+ upvotes. Those people will now people incels are pro-rape before even going to the incels subreddit and seeing anything pro-rape.

&gt; You idiots dont exist in a subreddit vacuum. Things you say get remembered. Try to remember that the next time one of you comes up with some fantasy world involving female sex slavery where even then you idiots cant get laid.

Doesn't matter if things get remembered, in the end what one person says on a subreddit =/= what everyone on that subreddit thinks. r/cringeanarchy regularly has racist comments, doesn't mean everyone here is racist.",1491005152
"Scotland","t5_2qkli","Because it is in no way equivalent to what the current levels of British immigration are, or any other European states immigration levels are for that matter.


500,000 immigrants coming to Scotland would be equivalent of 6.4 million people immigrating to the UK as a whole per year. There is no country in the world where the population increases by 10% every year from immigration.


So 250,000 was the net increase of population from immigration for the entirety of the UK. The population of the UK is 64 million, leaving us with 0.39% of the entire population being the added amount from this years immigration.


The population of Scotland is 5 million, 0.39% of 5 million is 19.5 thousand. 

Why would we care if ~20,000 people came to Scotland? In fact why wouldn't it be a good thing?",1491005152

"MathHelp","t5_2qz84","Kay, so i tried to prove it showing that (1000) is inside the range of f(x) by stating that f(x) is continuous when x = (- infinity ; infinity) 

Then i calculated the minimal and maximal values of (10sin) and (x^2)  so as to find the minimal range of f(x).


Found that the minimal value for x² = (0;0) and f(0) = 0 

While the minimal for 10sin is (3pi/2 ;-10) and f(3pi/2) = ~12

Then i stated that the range of f(x) is  0 =&lt; F(x) =&lt; infinity  and that (1000) is within that range so ""c"" exists

"paydaytheheist","t5_2t0hx","Indeed. And while I do think some of the parameters for kicking can be... silly, to put it mildly, they're nothing a host wouldn't be able to do manually. Toxic hosts have been around long before NGBTO. It's a classic case of blaming the tool rather than the person using the tool. Even if you got rid of the mod, grief kicking wouldn't end. It would just be done manually and waste even more of people's time.

I personally don't tend to host, but when I do I like to have it mostly because I don't want to keep navigating through a bunch of menus on Deathwish or One Down every time I find the need to kick someone. NGBTO helps take much of that inconvenience and annoyance (and danger since the need could arise in situations that are *not* safe to dig around through multiple menus in) away. The less I have to press the esc key while playing, the better. If there was a mod that would let me bring up a wheel while in game to select a player to kick, or even assign hotkeys to kick player slots (green, blue, tan, red, etc.), I'd definitely pair it with NGBTO. Controlling my lobby should be simple, quick, and intuitive. 

That's just my viewpoint on it anyways. ",1491005162

"swdarktimes","t5_3ae8f","Name: Ebenezer Kustanoff

Age: 23

Homeworld: Coruscant

Rank: Lieutenant ??

Role: Squad Leader


Backstory:

 Born on Coruscant, Ebenezer was brought into a wealthy family of merchants. His parents would sell and trade technology. Unfortunately, he was born in the wrong era as the clone wars raged across the galaxy. This drastically changed his life, as his parents trading became significantly more dangerous than before.  While his parents were travelling across the galaxy, Ebenezer became very independent and quickly did not need the help of his parents They quickly became irrelevant. Due to his parents specializing in the trade of technology, he had a large array of equipment at his disposal. He would sell these in the hopes of understanding how people thought. He soon realised who he could manipulate and those he could not. He was also given sources and archives which contained hyperspace path co-ordinates and highly advanced guides on tactic and strategies. His parents soon found out that he was selling the items that they had risked their lives to obtained and they destroyed all his collected documents he had collected in the years. In rage, Ebenezer shot down his mother but not before his father hit him across the room. Ebenezer began to run, followed by his monstrous father. They began to run through the streets just outside the senate. Ebenezer had called out to a couple of clones that his abusive father was threatening to kill him and they quickly seized him and dragged him away. Ebenezer began to reside in his parent’s home and began to build up his information again but was struggling to gain food and resources without his parent’s technology.
When the Empire formed, Ebenezer saw a life-changing opportunity and joined the Imperial academy. He was a star pupil and was quickly exported to work aboard a star cruiser. He became known as a ruthless strategist, who had ended a large rebel assault on a factory with one simple assault. He continued to work for the empire and then was posted to the Evictus.

Height:

6’’3’

Weight:

50kg

Appearance:

Ebenezer has a tall , narrow structure. His face seems to contain no fat, his cheekbones high, hollow cheeks, pale blue eyes and pointy nose all added to his ghastly appearance. His arms contained little muscle and his ribs were visible. His legs were extremely tall and were not normal size compared to his core. He wears standard officer uniform and cap.

NOTE: I know its a pretty messy backstory so just tell me if I need to improve it.

I've been through a lot of scenarios where stepping into traffic (or rolling into traffic - I have cerebral palsy), seemed like a great idea.  What stopped me was the fact that I had a few cats that relied on me to feed them and pay attention to them and take them to the vet, etc... it really helped to keep me centered.

Yes that's correct, it's 15% of income for just 3 years and only when making $50K or more.

Some of this stuff I absolutely cannot believe.  Are these actual quotes?

&gt;""My God, Thiokol. When do you want me to launch, next April?""

(To which my answer would be, ""YES!  YES, YOU STUPID FUCK!  I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF IT'S NEXT YEAR, WE HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT!"")

&gt;""take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat."" 

There's no way that one is an actual quote.  ""Stop thinking about safety and consider public perception.""  I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

It seems absolutely absurd to me that the engineers weren't listened to.  The engineers are the ones putting human bodies into fucking outer space.  Wouldn't they have the last word on basically everything?

&gt;Well, in 1986, there were really only enough parts among all 4 shuttles for 2 complete shuttles. 

I didn't know this either.  The shuttles weren't completely independent of eachother, hardware-wise?  That seems... wrong.  These things aren't Legos.  Maybe from an engineering / cost savings standpoint it makes a little sense, but for something like that to dictate your schedule (""this shuttle has to launch NOW so we can frankenstein it for parts in exactly five weeks"") seems way backwards.

Man, I dunno. I don't really blame anybody involved, because it all ended up sucking so incredibly bad.  Even the dumbass Thiokol VP who signed the recommendation... I'm sure he had a few stiff drinks and years upon years of fucked up thoughts after that.  All I can really hope for is that the problem was thoroughly analyzed and the ""go fever"" culture was put to death.  Which didn't seem the case by time Columbia broke up...

Lastly, it's absurd to me that Congress needed to be convinced of anything.  Space flight should be an absolute constant, regardless of polling or money or anything.  If we're not putting crafts in space, wtf are we even doing?  But I guess a lot of that feeling is IMO.

Also, how does a launch get scrubbed twice in the same day?  Did the Astronauts stay put in their seats until the second attempt?

and personally, my recent springtime fav is wild garlic (Allium ursinum)! i don't know where you live? as it's widespread across most of europe, often covers forest floors completely. collecting a bunch of leaves during hiking or jogging in the forest early in the morning sounds nice, i suppose.

It's not about liking or disliking. It's the fact that you feel your rights as a taxpayer are greater than her rights as a citizen. As a taxpayer, of course I don't like shelling out $50m to safeguard her and her child because she doesn't want to switch schools.

I don't think I've been deluded, but then most people who have been deluded don't think they have been either. So, who knows?

For what it's worth, we're both making moral arguments. I don't think either of us can be right, because there's a moral trade off made in both of our arguments.

"Nootropics","t5_2r81c","Great writeup! I loved reading it. 

As for the DA, 5-HT, and GABA actions, I looked into each one on examine.com. From my understanding, it's important to keep in mind where each of these neurotransmitters (NT) are modulated. For example, decreasing DA in the striatum of the brain can cause parkinsonian symptoms, but decreasing DA in the mesocortical DA tract can cause schizophrenia negative symptoms. 

Here's what I found on examine.com regarding neurotransmitters: 

Bacopa - Increase 5-HT at hippocampus, and normalize DA in general. Also lowers DA at the striatum. This is concerning because that’s the same thing as what’s wrong in parkinson’s. This is why I think my gf says I seem very “sedated” w/ a “flat affect” when I take Bacopa. Bacopa also increases acetylcholine in general, which lends to it's anti-alzheimer's implications.

Ashwaghanda – Generally neuroprotective. It also enhances the GABAa effects in the brain, which is the same mechanism as Benzos. This could lend to its sleep enhancement effect as well as it’s anxiolytic effects. No dopamine modulation was seen at normal physiological levels. Some adrenergic signaling was seen, and lends to possible anti-depressent effects. It also has some 5HT2 potentiation, w/ 5HT1 inhibition, which has been thought to mediate it’s neuroprotective effects.

Rhodiola – Interesting one! Increases 5HT in a DOSE DEPENDENT manner at the hippocampus and the rest of the brain. Also possible upregulates 5HT1A receptors and maybe downregulates 5HT3. These effects make rhodiola a candidate for anti-depression and anxiolytic therapy. I’ve seen other studies on humans that show promise for rhodiola as an antidepressant. 

There you go, that’s the summary of NT effects of these 3 adaptogens that I gleaned from examine.com. It took some time but I did it partly for myself too. I’ve been feeling a bit “spacey” and kinda dizzy, and I’m taking rhodiola and bacopa. I wanted to see if there are possible interactions there, but most likely it’s something interacting w/ my SJW. Anyways, I hope you find this helpful. Best of luck to you.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","We use a naming system like this: asset nr 16694, hostname: laptop16694, sn: 1234567, date of purchase 1-1-2017, owner: john smith, department: engineering (and a whole bunch of other information, but these are the important parts)

So if John's laptop gets stolen or catches fire, you don't have to go looking trough the list of receipts or stacks of paper to figure out the serial number/where it was bought etc.

Also: if the manager/finace wants to know how old Johns laptop was when it got stolen and just might skip the hassle of going through insurance to get $100,- back for a 5 year old laptop.

Also: when you discover someone is trying to login from laptop16694 over VPN after a few days, you know pretty sure its Johns laptop and inform the authority's with a remote IP address or other info.

Asset tracking is important, preferably integrated in your support tool, and up to date, not just for managers also for IT/sysadmins: if a customer/user keeps compaining his laptop is slow you can quickly see that the laptop he is using is 8 years old and should have been replaced 4 years ago and is not worth anyone's time or effort.

If you link asset numbers in your tickets you might even find out that a specific network device is coursing problems and should be replaced or its configuration changed.

If you do remote support this can be useful as well, if you link the hostname to the asset number you can remote to a system based on the hostname. Make sure the asset number is clearly visible and can't easily be removed so users can find it when you need it.

Cons:

* This iteration lacks numbers, which is OK with me at this exact moment since the current iteration of gear also lacks numbers
* Doesn't look very good yet.
* Haven't figured out how to scale the size.  Some weird CSS happening with hidden overflows covering the edge.

So, every single year for a few centuries, we would have to:

Plant trees on 1-3x the area of India
Cut it all down
Ship it all to power stations around the world
Burn all of it while capturing all the CO2
Liquify the CO2
Pump it all underground where it must stay for thousands of years

Oh, and before we can start all this we have to quickly build/upgrade around 30 thousand power plants with carbon capture technology.

Humans have never done antyhing at this scale.

"Paladins","t5_2v7zr","Skill is relevant to balance because this is practically what this change is, it makes it easier to do damage as Mal'Damba aka now you don't need as much skill to lead your targets and position and such.

Skill I would say is very relevant to a lot of changes because it usually means you have to compensate with more skill or you can use less skill and still be viable. If skill played no part in defining balance than it wouldn't matter if hotboxes changed or projectile speed was modified. Taking into account the difficulty or amount of skill it takes to do something is one of the cornerstones of balance.

EDIT: I agree with you though that Mal'Damba did not need a buff and using the argument ""it takes skill to do well so buff him for people of less skill"" is a extremely bad argument.",1491005175

I am particularly interested in your feedback, as I have a standard Moto G4 and am really wanting to upgrade to a G5 Plus, but I want to make sure that it's going to be a significant upgrade compared to my Moto G4. And some comments have suggested that the G5 Plus isn't much of an upgrade over the G4 Plus, which made me a little skeptical about how impressive the G5 Plus might actually be. I realize that the G4 Plus is a better device than the regular G4, but I am hoping that the G5 Plus will be noticeably better than both of the G4 variants.

I'm curious, have you gotten around to using the camera on the G5 Plus yet? If so, how does it compare the the camera on the G4 Plus? Is it noticeably better on any way? Does it focus as quickly? Is it as good as/better in low-light situations? Overall, what are your thoughts on it?

And how does the G5 Plus feel in your hands? Is it actually smaller in overall size than the G4 Plus? Do you like the way it feels while holding it? And is it small enough to comfortably use with one hand?

Sorry to ask so many questions. If you wouldn't mind replying again, when you get a chance, and sharing some more feedback on the phone after you've gotten to use it for a while, please know that it would be appreciated!",1491005175
"techsupport","t5_2qioo","I'd really stay away from WiFi adapters. The difference from one to the other is very minimal once you get to a certain point. There are restrictions in place that prevent someone from broadcasting at certain power levels. Don't quote me but I believe 27 is the limit in the United States. If the origin is broadcasting at 22, a 27dBi antenna will only help in one direction.

Essentially you can give it a shot, it may work. Chances are however it won't, granted the current adapter you have isn't outdated (old).

A better option (and safer too) would be to purchase a device like a Ubiquiti Nanostation and a router. If your internet isn't provided via means of a captive portal (requiring signin) and you only use a password/open network/RADIUS username password.

The advantage of a P2P radio is it isn't broadcasting in 360 degrees, meaning if it's alligned it can receive the signal at a stronger (and further) range as it's able to allocate that 22 (or whatever) dBi in a 30-60 degree radius effectively allowing it to send/receive much much further.",1491005176

Not to mention that jet fuel burns at different temperature based on oxygen level, and we just don't know what kind of drafts a building that high up  could have had with a giant hole in it. ",1491005178

Chicken I cook completely differently. I put in a small amount of charcoal and a lot of wood, a good full split or two. I let it burn down to coals before the chicken goes on and reload wood as needed. I often cook the chicken with no lid for better combustion. I just hate the smoldering wood taste in general but find it particularly bad on chicken. Letting the wood burn with as much air as it wants results in that sweet subtle smoke that makes bbq great despite using 100x more actual wood.

Your post has been removed because it's not about a DIY project, or you didn't ask a question.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

Posts in /r/DIY can either:

1) show a completed project that you did yourself, or

2) ask a question about a *specific* aspect of a specific DIY project.

The following types of questions and posts aren't allowed here - if your post contains any of the following, that's probably why it was removed:

- asking about a project that you someone else did, or that you want someone else to do.

- asking for recommendations about a tool or a material (unless it relates to a specific aspect of a project you are doing and which you describe in your post).

- Fundraising or survey posts.

- A ""DIY tips"" or product recommendations.

- Any other post that is not a ""project post"" or does not contain a specific question about a DIY project.

You have a couple of options:

1. Try another subreddit instead, such as /r/homeimprovement or /r/fixit.

2. If appropriate, you can re-post a question as a comment in the [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY. It's a weekly thread intended for more general questions.

We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

Video also fails to mention that the 11 DRS were at 2B, not at SS; that would be comparing apples to oranges. Baez had 4 DRS at SS last season to Lindor's 17. Also, Javy's defensive range at SS is rated at 3 compared to Lindor's at 18.

Baez is ""electrifying"", and he's versatile by being able to play 2B and SS well. But to say that by watching him you'll see things you'll never see before is a bit of a stretch.",1491005182

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","&gt; I'd really stay away from WiFi adapters. The difference from one to the other is very minimal once you get to a certain point. There are restrictions in place that prevent someone from broadcasting at certain power levels. Don't quote me but I believe 27 is the limit in the United States. If the origin is broadcasting at 22, a 27dBi antenna will only help in one direction.

&gt; Essentially you can give it a shot, it may work. Chances are however it won't, granted the current adapter you have isn't outdated (old).

&gt; A better option (and safer too) would be to purchase a device like a Ubiquiti Nanostation and a router. If your internet isn't provided via means of a captive portal (requiring signin) and you only use a password/open network/RADIUS username password.

&gt; The advantage of a P2P radio is it isn't broadcasting in 360 degrees, meaning if it's alligned it can receive the signal at a stronger (and further) range as it's able to allocate that 22 (or whatever) dBi in a 30-60 degree radius effectively allowing it to send/receive much much further.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","If you believe Brigham Young, he did have multiple wives. He was also Elohim reincarnated and brought one of his numberless wives with him to start this earth. The way I read what Brigham was saying is that other wives were taken with him to other worlds when those were started.

You can read more about it [here, at fairmormon.](https://www.fairmormon.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2009_Brigham_Youngs_Teachings_On_Adam.pdf)

Here is a sample of some of what Brigham said on the subject:

&gt;When our father Adam came into the Garden of Eden he came into it with a celestial body and brought Eve, **one of his wives**, with him.

one of my other favorite gems from this paper is:

&gt;It should also be mentioned that Helen Mar Kimball (daughter of Heber C. Kimball and one of Joseph Smith’s plural wives) claimed in an 1882 publication that Joseph Smith was the real “author” of the Adam–God Theory, not Brigham Young.

Apologist conveniently have decided not to trust Helen Mar Kimball here, while insisting that her judgement as a 14 year old was enough for us to trust her that polygamy really was a good thing, no matter what we think today. (double standard much?)

But I digress. The main point being that Adam did in fact have more than one wife, at least according to Brigham Asshole Young.",1491005182

Jpp- totw jpp played great and this card follows suit. Only downside is even though his pass rush is great qbs can get rid of the ball before he hits home.  His speed isn't great for this time of the year.  His run stopping however has been better than expected.  Definitely still a 43 only end though.  

Doyle- I am incredibly impressed with this card! Great run blocking, holds onto the ball after huge hits. Most surprisingly, he has come down with a lot of deep balls.  He consistently catches high passes in one on one situations under the safety and glitches out: he catches high passes the way a rac catch would happen and glitches out defenders around him.  Already had him break 5 long tds this way.  Only knock on him is speed but i honestly think that's highly overrated in a te. Cit and height being more useful.  Never had a te perform this way.  Will definitely be keeping him. 

Ingram- this card is literally frank gore without battle ready and without the ability to juke or spin.  Otherwise handles exactly the same as he does and may actually truck better.  Took a lot of abuse and use from me in my season and has not fumbled once.  Pretty happy with this card, infinitely more agile than Howard and such. Does get caught from behind around the 60-70 yard mark in long runs.  However after he trucked ul dawkins out of his shoes in one of my games I've decided to keep him as well. ",1491005186

Sounds like you're putting in an honest effort toward your career (as you should be), but you also sound like you feel entitled to some kind of reward for being a guy who follows the rules. Unfortunately that attitude will not land you the results you want. Trust me and a few others on here, we've been where you are, and from time to time we still might struggle with that feeling. 

It does get better, with patience and staying focused on where you want to get in life. Don't let some random flake put you in a mopey mood for a week, she might have done you a favor. When you get to the point where you have no problem doing the same because of your numerous options, or just because you'd rather stay home, you might not even remember her. 

You sound introverted, which means you might be adverse to social situations involving large crowds; nothing wrong with that, you just enjoy more intimate settings. Plenty of girls do too. Libraries and Starbucks aren't going extinct any time soon. Get your studying done and watch people every once in a while. 

Success won't come overnight, it comes from sacrifice and staying on your grind. But trust me, you will be in a far better position in ten years than most of your classmates living the fun college lifestyle now; all you have to do is put in the work.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","Cutting the number of states by that large of an amount seems a bit excessive to me. 

Granted I enjoy developing quite a lot but it basically means you will never state anything outside your immediate area. 26 states gets used up, really, really fast and that's at tech admin tech 27.

I have to log on and actually look at the map but this seems like it's really going to hamper any sort of early expansion assuming that scales down it's going to be nuts.


Don't get me wrong I like playing as a small nation but holy crap. If they are adding up to 26 states at tech 27, as a Monarchy Duchy estimating the same kind of curve in the early mid game you're only going to be able to state what? Like 10 states at tech 8? 

It just seems crazy to me. 

Let's pretend you're a tech 27 Empire rank Germany. So you're rocking 26 states from tech, 10 from empire rank and +3 from being a Monarch. So you've got 39 total. 

North Germany is 17 states and south Germany is 13 states. The low countries are 6. Plus you've got Prussian in the Baltic Region and even discounting Riga that's another 3 states right there. *And that's just your culture group.* You're already at 39. If you're not a Monarchy you can't even state all of Germany at tech 27. That's not *decision making tension* it's #nonsense. You want all that shit stated. No question. There is no question of which is better because it's all your culture group. 

And frankly tech 27 comes late enough that you aren't going to get any real benefit out of stating anything and the same goes for tech 31. 

I mean I get that +65 is immense but 26 isn't even enough to state the whole of the Germanic culture group, let alone anything outside of it. That seems fucking insane to me. Does that seem insane to you? 

Assuming it scales like it does now that means you're effectively in a position where if you're expanding at all you're almost never going to have enough states to grab the stuff *even in your region*.


Don't get me wrong trade offs are good but this is not one of them. There is already a trade off *the state coring cost vs the return*. It's not a tactical decision deciding if I want to make Pomerania a state as Hamburg; it's geographically close enough that I'm always going to want to do it. 

Just because I lack the states to do it doesn't mean as soon as I get one I won't. And I'm not ever going to unstate something I've already spent admin points on to swap it out for a state with slightly higher development when I want both of them stated because I don't enjoy pissing away Monarch points. 


It seems crazy to me that if manage to restore and reform Rome at a reasonable point in time that you probably won't be able to even have the majority of what you control stated with admin tech 31 and full admin ideas. 


#It's not unreasonable to want to state your entire culture group.


It's a decision to say. ""Well I am Hamburg I could state Dehli because it's a lot of development but you know it's far away and in a trade company region.""

Or ""Well I could state these 5 random provinces in Siberia as Russia but they kind of suck because it's like 3 development each. Maybe I'll just save my state for something in Korea or China.""

Those are decisions. Saying ""Well which of these states, in my culture group, at 1790 do I want to state over the other"" isn't a decision. It isn't tactical. It's a silly, silly balancing change.


Literally all this change does is create a situation where you're disinclined to expand at all because you're only ever going to get an extremely marginal benefit out of it because it's so insanely easy to get to your state cap with how the scaling is bound to work or you're going to have to expand with subject states that you can't ever integrate because of how low the state cap is. You'd be paying huge amounts of points for something that is going to sit at 75% autonomy forever. 

Making the best idea groups better just doesn't make sense to me and maybe the number of states towards the end was causing some sort of issue in multiplayer but there is a lot better way to slow down people stating things and that is to just not let people core shit out that isn't an accepted culture or in their culture group to a full state until separatism has fallen off. 


Real talk what is the point in even having promote culture if you're only ever able to promote cultures that you won't state because they aren't in your culture group? It's just a waste of Monarch points and a fools errand.


Dropping states off that much is just too far. 45 states at tech 27 would be fine; 40 would probably be fine. 26 is crazy low. 


EDIT: This change is going to severely hurt small nations. How are you supposed to increase in power if your state threshold is so low that you need to conquer twice your development to upgrade from Duchy to Kingdom or Kingdom to Empire without being able to state almost any of that land you've conquered? Without being able to state land you are effectively just draining your points because paying 50% of the coring cost up front for 25% of the benefit means you're going to be fighting such a massively uphill battle you probably shouldn't even bother expanding beyond your state limit as a small nation unless it costs you next to nothing resource wise.

My theory is that the Bush administration was incompetent in handling domestic security threats (he was on vacation right before it happened) and they had some idea that something *might* happen that day. As it turns out, something did happen that day, and after the first three planes hit, they made the call to intercept and shoot down the last plane in PA. Usually when a plane crashes, the wreckage is fairly well contained in a relatively small area. When a plane is shot down, wreckage is scattered along significant distance as the plane falls apart in the air. The wreckage from the PA flight was scattered quite a bit... Even if it actually was shot down, I don't blame them. 

The towers fell because the fire + the height of the building + winds + the materials used in furnishing created a giant furnace that heated up the steel structures to the point of compromise and collapse. The Pentagon fared much better because it's a short, stout, giant above-ground bunker with security protocols and evacuation procedures that would certainly enable a superior emergency response. It would be utterly absurd for a single airliner to be able to damage the pentagon in the same way the towers were.

Isaiah 53... 6 Like sheep we have all wandered about, Each has turned his own way, And Jehovah has caused the error of us all to meet up with him. 10 But it was Jehovah’s will to crush him, and he let him become sick.If you will present his life as a guilt offering, He will see his offspring, he will prolong his days, And through him the delight of Jehovah will have success.  11 Because of his anguish, he will see and be satisfied. By means of his knowledge the righteous one, my servant, Will bring a righteous standing to many people, And their errors he will bear. ",1491005190
"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Don't let this disease take over. It's a part of your life now, but it's still YOUR life. It's easy to feel like you're spiraling out of control.

This is a terrible disease. No doubt about it. I'm 29 years old and am worried about my current decisions affecting my quality of life in 30 years.  I miss being social with my friends, and I'm worried that I'll never be able to be social like I was before. I think about having a family too, but I don't know when I'll have the time to meet people. I'm worried about medicine side effects, interactions, and effectiveness. I'm worried about bills and insurance.  I'm worried about diet.

But I'm still me. I'm never going to stop trying to be the best version of myself I can be. I'm not always at my best, but no one is. You can take your life back.",1491005190

"DebateAltRight","t5_3gwfd","Please take a look at the video. You have friends who saw the planes. There are also an unbelievable amount of direct eyewitnesses of the explosions who say they saw a massive blast, no plane. 


The footage of the planes hitting the buildings is laughable, they enter into the side of a steel framed building like a hot knife through butter. Like the Roadrunner blasting through a mountainside. Some of the official 9/11 footage from that day show the nose of the plane emerging out of the far side of the building. Implying that an aluminum aircraft crashed through a steel frame and a steel core, then through the fire side of the building's steel frame, and emerged out the other side still intact. The footage is doctored.


I get that your friends saw what they saw. But actual reporters were looking dead at the tower and reported on live television that no plane hit, just a massive explosion. To then redact that next time they are on camera. 


And like I said. Nothing more damning than the fact that one of the most famous shot zooms in, in, in, and then suddenly from off frame, the plane slams into the building. By obvious logic, if you rewind, the plane MUST be at least on the approach as you zoom out to a very wide shot. The plane that hits, you rewind 2 seconds to a wide shot, there is no approaching craft. 


If you really do love watching the nitpickery of the conspiracy theorists, then watch the link I sent you, September Clues. That's the best conspiracy nitpickery that you'll find, even if it's just so that you and your friends can laugh at what the crazies believe. But don't claim that you have all the evidence, enough to make a fair assessment, before you've watched it. All I'm saying. ",1491005190

"titanfall","t5_2xh0g","The only reason Overwatch's system works is because of how thought out and frequent it is. The current system with Overwatch is a crate with every level up (which doesn't take long), three crates after 9 wins in the arcade modes (limited to doing it once a week), a free crate with every major event that releases new items, and currency for every duplicate of an item you get. Each crate gives an item or currency, and currency drop rates share the same probability as items in their tier (common, uncommon, rare, legendary).


You can't buy currency, only crates, so if anything, it probably discourages people from spending more money on the game by doing that. The only reason people don't get mad about the system is the new maps and heroes are always free, and the system is very frequent in terms of how many crates you get.

&gt; The Bundeswehr&amp;#039;s new Cyber and Information Space Command, based in the former West German capital of Bonn, will start off with 260 IT specialists but grow to 13,500 military and civilian personnel by July.

&gt; Any full-scale cyber attacks abroad would have to be approved by the German parliament, just like any other military mission.

&gt; Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen had announced the creation of the cyber command two years ago to protect the military from increasing numbers of online attacks.

If this is wrong, can you elaborate how it does actually work?

Edit: this isn't only Clomid. Nolva and AIs increase testosterone above baseline level by the same estrogen mediated feedback loop. 

Since my opinion isn't worth much. I added some sources where I got the idea.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","If you can't commit to a career (that's perfectly understandable at your age), commit to training a particular skill. This may help lessen your academic anxiety, by giving you a goal that you can actively work toward.

writing is a good skill that is applicable to many fields, so that's an excellent choice. Scientists write, journalists write, business people write, government workers writes etc. But even earlier than that, all college students need to write... a lot. So, picking up good writing will help you much, regardless of your future career.

Also, don't forget that even if you do decide upon a career, you can change your mind. In fact, I encourage you to not be so set as your mother recommends, as you will know whether you are suited for a job only once you begin your studies and work in that field. Right now, it's quite likely too early to tell! Being self-aware about whether the job is actually a good fit for you or whether you need a new plan will help you not sink in years of your life, before hitting a wall.",1491005199

"wow","t5_2qio8","I disagree.  Khadgar is not the solution. He's like you.

In Cataclysm, the player-character  had to do everything to empower/help/support Thrall, who would do the job. Save Thrall's soul so that he can save the world. Help Thrall so he can save X. Protect Thrall while he brings the Dragon Soul to the Temple. Protect Thrall while he does the super ritual to blast Deathwing to death. 

In WoD however, the roles are reversed. Khadgar empowers *you*. All he does throughout the legendary campaign is literally that, he's doing everything to make *you* stronger. Every single magical relic you found on Draenor, he used to empower you and your ring so that *you* could beat the Iron Horde, the Legion, and Archimonde.

In Legion you're still his friend (he remembers you from WoD), you're his equal, you work together. You both go to Karazhan to learn about the Pillars. You both go to Ulduar to listen to Magni. In Azsuna, you both look for the Tidestone. You both help Senegos.  He's literally like another player-character. People told him to use Light's Heart on Illidan's corpse, so he does so. He's just so much more realistic than any other ""splotlight character"" and is the closest character to you as a PC.",1491005200

The industry began in Pennsylvania in 1859 and theres been a lot of history (good and bad) leading to this point. But the industry today is very different than the one even 20 years ago. The number one rule is safety, including safety of the environment. Any engineer/operator/company worth their salt has that view.

Now, there are some shitty operators out there that cause problems that the rest of the industry deals with.. I see it all the time in California as a displaced petroleum engineer doing consulting work. But its mind-boggling how much heat these major oil companies get out here/on reddit when they're usually the ones doubling their OP costs to make sure things are done the right way.

At the end of the day it is a business. I personally believe otherwise, but maybe regulations are part of the reason the industry is improving so quickly. Necessity is the mother of invention right?

The Reality Distortion Field is a pathway to many spending habits some consider to be .....unnatural.

The author of this article notes the US is 1 standard deviation above the trend when looking at AIC-to-spending, which would mean we can expect some cost cuts with a better healthcare system but not a huge amount.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","A comment of mine from like 6 weeks ago on /r/infp, regarding balance in the general view of life, and from a typological perspective:

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/5ufxsz/i_thought_being_sensitive_was_a_good_thing/ddtqnt8/

Text:

Being very sensitive is not a good thing. Being very insensitive or thick-skinned is not either.

Neither being very-self-centered nor very-altruistic are good things.

Neither being very independent nor being very dependent are good things.

In my view, balance is the key to life. To use your strengths to your advantage, while accepting and developing your weaknesses without judgment of the self. If the self leans too strongly towards one side of almost any dichotomy, I consider that undesirable. It's important to be flexible and adaptable.

From the viewpoint of Jungian typology and mbti, achieving balance includes development and satiation of all 4 functions.
Balance is the key to happiness; it does take many years to achieve, however. Although balance is my ultimate goal in life, I'm far, far from it. But everyday I make small improvement, and it adds up over time.

So, it's not a good thing to be sensitive. But it's okay if you are. Just develop awareness of when you think you're acting a bit too sensitive. Sometimes just remind yourself that life is too short to worry about the small things.

It's detrimental to your happiness to criticize yourself for being the way you are. That does not mean you should accept your current self as the finished product. Just politely critique. Learn to identify and accept your weakness, say ""Presently, I am not very good at [x]. In order to be a better person, I will patiently work on this over time by being more aware of it. This will benefit myself and others around me.""
It's a slow process; I've learned not to sweat too much over it, but still be aware.
Any progress, no matter how small, is progress. Progress can even be failure, if you learned a lot from the experience.",1491005203

The blinds cover up the green light before you enter the intersection, so you can only see the light for the intersection when approaching it, when you enter the intersection and get near the fire station you can then see the green in front of the fire station.

The red and yellow never has blinds so you can always see if the light is red. Also sometimes they use lenses on the green instead of blinds (they have the same effect)",1491005203

&gt; The Bundeswehr&amp;#039;s new Cyber and Information Space Command, based in the former West German capital of Bonn, will start off with 260 IT specialists but grow to 13,500 military and civilian personnel by July.

&gt; Any full-scale cyber attacks abroad would have to be approved by the German parliament, just like any other military mission.

Anyway, nowadays you can't do stuff like this or fixer-upper type stuff on homes because of all the TV shows. People always assume there's a huge profit to be made, and they have no idea what they are doing. Ruined it for the people who actually do know.

&gt; I'm new here, and in spite of being 30 have no fucking clue how to speak to or approach a woman. I use ""I'm new here"" as a bullshit excuse to approach you like a sex object and not even pretend that I view you as holding any human characteristics.

&gt; Do you have any interest in my objectifying you in spite of my displaying absolutely no personality or desirable traits other than my hard core ""Fuck me fuck me!"" attitude?

"Cichlid","t5_2ved3","I'm going to petsmart tomorrow and returning the zebra.  Thats really good advice on how to do it, and i really appreciate it.

You pegged me down pretty well.  So I'm generally very ""all in"" when i jump into a hobby.  I give 110% and learn as much as i can as fast as i can, and i get very excited and can tend to do things too quickly.  For the fish, i actually have slowed down more than i generally would.  I do love the hobby, and genuinly care about my fish.  I am heavily aware that my neglicence and not taking things slowly has affected this and has hurt my fish.  I chose to take on the responsibility for these fish when i purchased them.  I bought them and my goal is to give them a better life than where they came from.  I have been selfish, though,  and i know that it has led to me killing my fish.  I also lost my blue peacock while i was at work today.  I believe the stressful transfer may have killed him, or o worry that my params may be off.  Ido want to take it slowly and plan, but it is so against my habits/nature that it is very difficult.

My plan:

1. Get rid of the zebra.  Either return/exchange, give for free, try to sell on /r/aquaswap, or euthanize if none of the other options are possible.  I cannot have him in a tank if he is hurting my other fish.

2. Ensure the highest water quality possible, make sure it is cycled fully and capable of making a safe home for my fish.

3. Buy more fish.  I don't want to sound insensitive when i ask if i can essentially guess at the fish store and get my fish.  I don't want to buy fish only to have them live poorly.  I would prefer to buy them knowing their sex and being aware of their compatibility.
This is my biggest problem.  Where i live has 2 petsmarts which sell african cichlids, and i have nothing else within an hour that sells these fish.  That limits me to online or in store.  Online may be the best option with that website that you gave me.  I worry that it is going to be a bit too expensive, though.  I imagine i have to buy 6 or 8 fish minimum to make the shipping price worth it as opposed to trying petsmart.  This scares me adding such a large bioload to my tank at once as opposed to the 3-4 i may normally want to add at one time max.

I would truly like to do this properly.  I want to take it slowly and do it right, but I'm feeling a bit lost.

Oh,  in addition, i worry that if i don't stock the tank soon, having only the hap left will both stress my hap and crash my cycle even more when it is SO close to being done.",1491005209

&gt; The Bundeswehr&amp;#039;s new Cyber and Information Space Command, based in the former West German capital of Bonn, will start off with 260 IT specialists but grow to 13,500 military and civilian personnel by July.

&gt; Any full-scale cyber attacks abroad would have to be approved by the German parliament, just like any other military mission.

&gt; Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen had announced the creation of the cyber command two years ago to protect the military from increasing numbers of online attacks.

&gt; Similarly, I click on your video list to see what the 'former minister' has to say and the very first thing they're doing is trying to sell his two books.

You're going to discredit the former minister of defense of Canada because he's promoting two books he presumably wrote about the specific subject he's talking about? I don't understand that logic... And you're going to extend that logic to discredit all the other witnesses testimony from individuals with years of experience and rarified credentials? That makes no sense to me.

&gt;People want it to be true so they naturally gravitate towards that answer when any unexplained (or fraudulent) phenomenon is observed.

You mean the fact that extraterrestrials exist? Maybe it isn't a matter of wanting them to exist, and more a matter of it being an eventuality in an infinitely vast universe. I find it a bit terrifying to be honest.

When you're in a match where stamina management is especially vital, it's great to keep that on hand. These characters don't have techniques that take up enormous amounts of ki so it's really was to store and conserve ki and they're both heavy hitters, so they are really forgiven for not having more.

If you use it right. It's extremely difficult to get the stamina crop on these characters as you can always guarantee you'll have mid to full stamina if you're good at conserving. The thing that makes it not too cheesy is that yiu only get half a bar of stamina for every bar of ki, which means that you may run out of ki for big punishing moves if you're not careful and you are vulnerable by using it which makes it more ideal to knock your opponents away and gradually chip away at their health rather than string full brutal combos.

1. Have a userdata script configure the EC2 instance to join the domain at first boot. Since you've already booted the instance once before (while making an AMI), you'll need to modify the instance to support this.

2. Rerun ansible against the instance once it's started. 

3. Don't create AMIs at all and run the provisioner each time. 

4. Write a script that will check if a system is an AD member and join if not. Have ansible push this to the machine when building the AMI and have it run on boot.

Allegedly, there are ways to avoid creating a computer account and doing a full, traditional ad join altogether using SSSD but I've never tried this. See here: http://htfdidt.blogspot.ca/2014_06_01_archive.html",1491005213

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","It was more of an itch. Wasn't really thinking of anything sexual. Then, without thinking, I was literally rubbing one out, didn't have it out though. And then that's when it hit me. 

My advice is to stop making NoFap a struggle. Treat it like it's a supplement for self-improvement.  In other words, stop wasting your time and energy on trying to get a high streak and just live a life. NoFap isn't going to just naturally give you all the benefits people brag about, you have to actually work for it.  ",1491005215

"DotA2","t5_2s580","&gt; they should produce more quality and less quantity. if they change that, i'd start buying again like the 2015 era.

I bought something for $10 back in beta. It was a Speed Demon courier which I overpaid for (could've had it cheaper from the steam market) and he didn't even have the unusual quality to him which was a big deal at the time. Hands down the best purchase that I have ever made to this day. I knew back then that I HAD to have it and despite all the new couriers and unusual effects, the Speed Demon might be the best purchase I will EVER make with this game. 

I haven't been active throughout the entirety of DOTA 2 so I've missed out on a lot. I've gotten back into the game in 2016 and I just don't see myself as excited by these items. The quality improved from back when I played before but it also dropped off before I got back into the game. 

The content is ass these days with few exceptions and I don't blame the people who design these skins entirely because who is willing to create quality only for Valve to screw the over? Something needs to be done so the best creators can come back and we don't have to settle for the ugly shit we keep getting now. ",1491005215

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Any other videos that are dissecting this yet? So much of this attack reeks (like some other comments have said, it could be triage, though I am not too sure). Its all too convinient. 

●The guy was seen laughing and chatting about his family the night before in the hotel bar. His co-workers (not muslims so cant be claimed to be biased) said he regularly spoke out when terrorist attacks happened and he wasnt religious, though he did identify as muslim he didnt seem to practice it (prayer 5 times a day etc).

●The two people he directly hit with his car where supposedly 2 off duty officers that where on their way back from recieving medals. What are the chances?

●The date was previously flagged for flase flags right here on reddit and elsewhere.

● An anonymous 4chan user posted a cryptic message the day before with the exact co-ordinates along with a picture of a gun (alluding to violence not necessarily the weapon of choice). Again what are the chances?

● They made 7-8 arrests **the next day** despite the fact they keep telling us he acted alone and was not a part of any terrorist networks. I have yet to see anyone else pick up on this inconsistency.

There is more then just these points but I am on mobile it can be a pain to post links. I will try to put it all together in a new post with links to back it all up tomorrow.

&gt; The Bundeswehr&amp;#039;s new Cyber and Information Space Command, based in the former West German capital of Bonn, will start off with 260 IT specialists but grow to 13,500 military and civilian personnel by July.

&gt; Any full-scale cyber attacks abroad would have to be approved by the German parliament, just like any other military mission.

&gt; Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen had announced the creation of the cyber command two years ago to protect the military from increasing numbers of online attacks.

CARS: My worst enemy. The passages didn't click with me like they usually do, and I felt especially sluggish the entire time. By the end I was in dire need of the break.

P/S: Way more soc than I was expecting. A lot of vocab on there that wasn't in the Kaplan study material, so I worked it as best I could.

You should never use Valve deathmatch servers. They're shit and the people who play on them are shit (no offense). If you want to practice I recommend joining community FFA servers. You will be able to train your aim much better here as you will be forced to get better or be continually fucked by better players. This is how I went from GN3 to where I am now. 100%

I'd also use the map ""Aim_Botz"" to warm up. It's my go to before I open any DM or go near a comp game. This will warm up your aim. Just do ten minutes or so and you'll feel it.

I'd also watch pro games. This is something I've been doing for months now and you pick up so much game sense watching better players clutch. You also discover little tips and tricks on maps. 

Also for god's sake learn some smokes and flashes. If you ever want to consider being good at the game these are need to knows. You have to know every smoke for A site Mirage imo, not just one. The more smokes you know, the more you can do in a 2v2 or clutch situation.",1491005218

I first experienced this phenomenon watching HBO in the 90's, seeing movies I'd never consider renting. Many of them were great but got slammed by the critics.

I'm convinced that many of these fuckers have agendas or get bribed for their reviews. I'm on episode 8 and Iron Fist is not showing any signs of getting shitty. I don't understand was people are trashing the fight scenes either, as well as the acting and the writing. It makes NO SENSE.

Shame on the people trying to rationalize the critics' reviews; if you liked the other three Defenders shows, you should love this show, because it's the best of all of them. That's my opinion and I don't give a shit.",1491005220

If they aren't stuck, then they must be there for something that they either A) haven't found yet or B) hasnt arrived yet.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","This guy is correct.  Sometimes you DO want to place a merchant to collect in your home node.

To determine whether to collect in a location or not, multiply your trade power% by the local trade value (i.e. incoming + local, not incoming + local - outgoing, since you are about to change how much is outgoing).  Multiply your home node by 0.9 since you already get roughly 90% of what you can collect there.  Put merchants in the highest.  Of course, collecting somewhere NOT your home node also adds a -50% modifier to your trade power, so it is non-obvious what your % will be.

As a concrete example, say you have 100% of your home node and 50% of node A, and 5% of node B.  Home is 10 ducats, node A is 200 ducats (maybe London, whatever it is called), and node B is 50 ducats (say, Genoa).  If you assign a merchant to collect in A, you would get 100 ducats.  If you assigned it to home, you would get an additional 1 ducat.  So, clearly put it in A.  

But if your home were 10 ducats, A were 10 ducats, and you had 100% of home, but 5% of A: home would give you an additional ducat, while A would give you 0.5 ducats.  So, adding the merchant to home is better.

Honestly, they could probably just add a button that is ""automate trade"" since there is no real choice.  There is always an optimal placement and almost never any strategy.

The VERY few times there is strategy is when you, say, have a decent % of a node upstream of a rival.  You might want to collect there just to prevent the rival from getting money, even though you might get more yourself elsewhere (since, +5 for me and -5 for rival can be better than +7 for me and +10 for rival).",1491005222

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","My Nmom always hated the fact that I looked like my dad in every way. She'd always say it to me in a way that sounded like she was disgusted by this fact.

 She never showed me any real affection, anything she did was all for show for neighbours but she often talks about all these great things she did with me that I have no recollection of ever happening. Like she claims she taught me how to swim....I went swimming with her maybe when I was 4 years old once or twice but she has a fear of the water...so I'm not sure how she taught me?? It was actually my dad who brought me swimming every week. 

She talks all the time about how she snuggled up with me for reading every night and made sure she had one on one time with me after school so I could talk to her....that never happened!! 

I was actually terrified of my mom as a child. I stayed by myself a lot and found it impossible to make friends as I was so wound up and afraid of everything. I was a very lonely child but she maintains I was always the head of a gang of friends and was full of confidence before finishing with...I don't know what happened to you now....shakes her head sadly....

She had me convinced I was very overweight too, I remember being 11 and she had me on the slim fast diet. Looking back at photos of me then and I was just normal sized....she even told me once I was so big she had to buy my clothes in the boys section!?

She never taught me how to do my hair or make up...anything girly really. I remember her promising a ""period party"" like a girly day out when I got my first period....never happened. We've actually never had a girly day out. She took my brothers girlfriend out for a day of shopping for my 25th though. I bought my outfit later that day by myself. She rang me though to tell me she'd found a black dress (I didn't ask for a black dress) in a cheap dress store. I had already bought a lovely blue wrap dress for myself in a good quality store and she brought home this ""present"" of a black dress about two sizes too big for me that looked like those dresses you see old women from Greece wearing. 

I stopped asking her to go anywhere or do anything with me. She wasn't even going to go with me to try on wedding dresses only my cousin (who wouldn't know my mom that well) accidently shamed her into going. She sulked in the corner though the whole time and picked some horrible lacy dresses for me and demanded I tried them on...nightmare.

Now I have a young daughter, I can't even fathom doing anything like that to her. I only want to be with her all the time, I'm sad if she's sad, I feel every knock or cut, my heart bursts if she's happy! I just want to buy every toy in the world for her. I have everything for her birthday party bought already and it's not for months yet! I spend all my money on her! I go into a shop to get myself clothes and get her loads of stuff and forget to buy myself what I needed! I just want her to be happy!  She's so beautiful I can't stop looking at her! I love just holding her hand. I'd die if anything ever happened to her! I can't understand how my own mom doesn't feel like that for me, it's unnatural.

Original Post:

Author: /u/tosser_123456789

**Lawyer misconduct on both sides?**
&gt;
&gt; I’ve got a really bizarre case going on.  Had a landlord illegally evict me, rent was paid in advance with receipt.  Landlord wanted me out.  Poisoned me and another tenant to do so.  Both of us ended up in emergency room.  Landlord has a lengthy court history of this behavior.  I sued to get my remaining rent, and medical bills paid.  Meanwhile unbelievably the defendant has admitted to all of this under oath in deposition testimony.  
&gt; 
&gt; The case however isn’t the problem.  It’s the lawyers.  Mind you I am paying by the hour for these people.  I’d walk away but I am over $30,000 in legal fees.  
&gt; 
&gt; On my side
&gt; 1st lawyer didn’t show up to first court date.  Then would not return calls.  So I fired him.
&gt; 2nd lawyer made multiple mistakes with the court including improper filings.  Quit the night before a hearing on it.  Ordering me not to contact lawyer.
&gt; 3rd lawyer takes case on contingent fee.  Then 2 months later demands change to hourly or lawyer will quit.  Then backs off and agrees to contingent when other side offers to settle.  Then when settlement falls through wants hourly again.  This happens 2x before I told attorney I would find a replacement.  
&gt; 4th lawyer doesn’t know what to do.  He’s a nice guy and seems like he knows what he is doing but repeated issues in motions that end up getting denied.  All very convincing legal arguments but can’t get anywhere with this judge.  So much so that he has basically stopped communicating.  Won’t return phone calls and I will occasional get an email once a week or so.  Meanwhile the other attorneys get away with murder.  (Refusing to provide evidence, knowingly allowing defendant to lie, repeated attempts at avoiding deposition of defendant)  And I am paying hundreds by the hour.  Not once have I missed a payment.  
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile on the defense side lawyers have 
&gt; Called my witnesses and tried to convince them not to testify through fraudulent statements.  
&gt; Refused to provide evidence, even after a judge’s order to do so
&gt; Destroying evidence (had stuff taken down off Internet, tossed a cell phone in a lake (admitted by the defendant)
&gt; Told my lawyer their sole intent was to rack up my costs so it would be too expensive to sue their client
&gt; We filed a motion letting the judge know this and it was completely ignored. 
&gt; 
&gt; I’m ready to fire my 4th lawyer which will likely destroy my case.  But clearly I am not being represented properly and the other side is just getting away with all sorts of legal misconduct.  I know I can file a bar complaint and I will but in the meantime what else can I do here to salvage this case?  I’d walk away if it weren’t for the clear “admitted” guilt of the defendant and the amount of money I already have in this case.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have talked with other lawyers and nearly all have said they don’t want to step into the middle of such a messed up case.

[Saerla](https://gyazo.com/912cfdca8e011e6e3aafe629f9191d1c) huffed and puffed as she watched the Archery Competition from the sidelines. With a dejected sigh, she blew some stray strands of platinum blonde hair from her face in time to see her father score with another impressive shot. Maeker Targaryen was, by all accounts, a veteran marksman - but the Seven was not with him today it appeared. From beside her, Rhaenera let out a congratulatory cheer. But Saerla barely mustered the energy to move in her chair, contenting herself to stroking [Sapphire](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/97/26/7a/97267a04ee9793f3f1f7e559b1321c95.jpg)'s back gently and offering a courteous smile. 

For all the energy that the crowd seemed to have, the only effect it had on the young Targaryen was to make her less and less interested in the goings on of the actual competition. She could tell by the 'Oohs' and the 'Aahs' of fellow onlookers how well each competitor had done, and instead looked to the noble Lords and Ladies seated around her for some amusement.

"Psychiatry","t5_2raq1","I've always been very skeptical of ontology. I'm a pretty firm believer that absolute truth is undecidable, and that therefore we can only ever generate recursively more consistent verisimillitudes of reality. Ontology makes the problematic assertion that the verisimilitude is 'true', which I think blinds adherents to alternative hypothesis formation. Furthermore, a system of ontology has absolutely no relation to any spurious 'truth' unless it is testable.

In the specific case of psychiatry, we are yet to produce a useful and testable model of the mind. Without a useful and testable model of the mind, we have no basis with which to build a psychopathological ontology for the reasons stated above.

We could see the DSM as an attempt to build a psychopathological ontology, but it merely asserts that there are mental illnesses. 

The DSM has moderate internal consistency, in that a given patient can be reproducibly be diagnosed with its definitions, but it has no way to confidently differentiate cases that meet the criteria of multiple pathologies, leading to patients with ever expanding lists of pathologies. The DSM does provide a guide to the likely management issues of a given patient, and this is useful, but it's hard to define the validity of this guide without some idea of its external consistency.

The DSM is very poorly externally consistent, in that its diagnoses usually can't be validated by non-psychiatric means. This would be analogous to a description of taxonomy that can't be validated by its agreement with the findings of ecological or biochemical studies.

Psychiatry is in its infancy, which is understandable given the complexity of the mind compared with other body systems. Hopefully some time in my lifetime we'll generate a model of the mind that can simultaneously explain our observations within the domains of information processing, personality formation, social integration, and the formulation of internal belief systems and affective states. But even with such a model in hand, it's likely that further testing will render it incomplete to the point that it has to be completely remade, like the transition from Newtonian physics to relativity.",1491005226

"OldSchoolCool","t5_2tycb","And it's not the officer/deputy that charges you, it's the locality that has given him/her permission to act on it's behalf. It's semantics, but law would be way easier without semantics haha 

Also, this is why cops are believed in court, generally. The governing body gives you rights in your line of duty that others do not have, and the judge and cop are on a first name basis.

Officer Zulu has been nothing but outstanding as an officer and as a member of society. The defendant,  Mike Hashtag, has an extensive record of theft, armed robbery, and manslaughter. The officer has his dashcam record the encounter. A scuffle begins and they go off camera. You hear ""show me your hands, do it now do it nowBANG""

Both sides get to state their case, but they don't have to be considered as equally likely. 

And then the family wants taxpayer money because their 19yr old decides to go toe-to-toe with a 220lb shaved grizzly in body armor and sunglasses, and somehow someway in some distant realm of the cosmos they try and tell the officer all the things be should have done had he only been better trained  (don't forget the sensitivity training....) and hadn't been bloodthirsty. 

It's also the mayor/governors fault, considering he hired the person who hired the officer. 

Nothing will bring your son back, but millions of dollars in taxpayer money that'll get spent in less than 10yrs might help. You don't see frowning people on jet skis, do you?",1491005228

They promise to give the course a reservation and POS system that works seamlessly between online bookings and our tee sheet. In exchange, we give two tee times per day which don't always get booked. GolfNow can sell those tee times for any price they see fit. 

There are two things that cause animosity towards all things Golfnow for us. 

1.The system we get from them is terrible. They do give full customer service but it's no great comfort when you have to call them 10 times a week.  

2. We don't get a dime from any of the trade times A.K.A. Hot Deals. Not a penny. So at $50 per round x 8 players per day over a 6 month season means that our POS system costs us $67,200. Just not worth it for terrible software. 

When we were pitched this ""deal"", the thinking was that customers having access to book online 24 hours a day would increase access thus increasing play. But nearly every time that get booked online are the hot deals that are paid to GN. Everyone else that comes in calls the phone. 

It isn't set in stone that courses will automatically be rude to GN Hot Deal guests but when the system crashes while checking in 40 players trying to pay the course money and the next guest hands me his hot deal confirmation, I'm not super psyched to hand over the keys to a cart. And really, it wouldn't be such a big deal that we make no revenue with Hot Deals if the stupid POS system worked. 

I don't want a single guest to come away from our facility with a bad taste in their mouth for any reason. I just wish the 3 year contract left us with some wiggle room.",1491005229

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was driving along a two lane highway in rural Indiana several years ago. I was basically alone, with no traffic. I see a sheriff's deputy coming up in the oncoming lane, and I don't really think anything of it because I'm driving a reasonable speed. The deputy screeches to a stop, long before he gets to my car. I think this is weird, because wouldn't he pass me and then turn around if he wants to pull me over?

Then the doors fly open and two deputies get out. They ignore me completely, and instead rip open the back door. They drag this skinny little black girl out of the back seat and slam her onto the roadway. She looked like she couldn't have been older than 18. 

As I was passing by, deputy number one had her pinned on the concrete and was in full ass-whooping mode. Deputy number 2 was in the process of drawing something from his belt, which I think might have been a taser. I don't think it was a gun, because he wasn't drawing from a part of the belt where you normally carry a firearm. 

At that point I stepped on the gas and got the fuck out of dodge. Never once entertained thoughts of stopping and getting involved. 

Pre-Black Lives Matter me's reaction: Dumbass probably started some shit in the back of the car and had to be dealt with. 

Older, wiser, post-Black Lives Matter me's reaction: Some fucked up shit probably happened as soon as I was out of sight. This was a deserted road in the middle of rural Bumfuck. Those cops could have done *anything*, because there was nobody around to see. They were white tough guys with guns and she was a tiny little black girl all by herself. 

I remember telling the story to couple of friends, starting off like ""Check out this wacky thing that happened..."", and about halfway through it I realized how seriously fucked up this was in the wider context that I was just starting to get exposed to. To me, it was just a strange thing that happened. To them, I probably left the scene right before something really horrible got underway. 

In retrospect, I wish I had the integrity to stop what I was doing, pull out my phone, and make it known that whatever the cops did would have a witness. But, we were in the middle of nowhere, and I had my girlfriend in the car and was driving her to a medical appointment at the time. I have a powerful ""mind my own fucking business"" instinct even when I don't have my own vulnerable person to look out for. I made the right decision for our own safety, but I didn't do the morally correct thing and look out for that poor girl. 

Perhaps, in the future, I will have a chance to do the right thing.",1491005230

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I used to be conservative until i learned how little these programs actually cost...
80 billion for tuition free public colleges, out of a 4 trillion dollar budget. Sanders plan was to tax wallstreet speculations which would generate between 80-400 billion dollars.
Regarding healthcare, we spend 17% of our economy on healthcare compared to around 10% in Canada. Single payer healthcare is more efficent because there's less waste and the government is better at setting prices than private companies, since the government has a monopology and the force of law behind them. So while we'd have to raise taxes to guarantee universal care, most people, (95%) would actually pay less than they currently do for health insurance.

So it really isn't even a question of ""could it work?"" It does work. Countries all around the world have free college and universal healthcare, and they have less money than we do. It's a question of whether we're willing to do it.

We've got some crazy conservatives, usually baby boomers, who are loud and short sighted and would NEVER support a tax increase no matter what it was for. ""We're gonna raise your taxes but you're actually going to save money when we--- NO TAX HIKES!!"" God the stupidity is frustrating...but they're the exception. Most people can understand that they'll save money in the end. But so-called moderates underestimate voters intelligence and don't want to fight for good policies.

EDIT: Neoliberals is the right term. It just means they basically support laizes-faire capitalism, meaning minimal government interference in the economy and maximizing the power of the private sector. What you see with neoliberal democrats is free trade, deregulation, (don't regulate wallstreet or big corporations, don't raise the minimum wage etc), and privatization of public services (like cory booker's love of charter schools.) But neoliberal democrats tend to support taxes to help people, but not too much, and not if it will affect a corporations bottom line. They'll pay for education, but only so much. So the debate we have is hard line conservatives which are against basically ALL government interference in the economy, and the democrats who support some ""necessary"" regulations, usually about the environment and some social programs, but they'd rather have them administered via the private sector. So government taxation, then we give grants to private organizations like charter schools or whatnot.

It's basically that they think big businesses know best, so they support ""free trade,"" derregulation, and a smaller government. But they have some sense that they need to throw the poor a few crumbs, as long as it doesn't have a disruptive influence on big money. Republicans pretty much don't care how low taxes and derregulation hurts people. (with the exceptions of a few moderates.)

Then you have progressives and social democrats, who support progressive taxes, robust social programs like universal healthcare and education, as well as unions and regulations to prevent businesses from forming monopolies or engaging in unfair/unethical practices.",1491005231

I don't think you can look at which one affected the industry more. It's not an either/or scenario. I liken it to the oil and gas industry was lying on the floor having a heart attack. The royalty review was a kick in the face while laying on the floor.

During the crash Alberta oil industry a 71 cent dollar helped buffer the price of oil and the industry was able to push down a lot of cost for oil production. The oil sands do not need $80 barrel to be profitable. Depending on the operation it is around $7-$27 dollars to break even.

"latvia","t5_2rwqy","I can tell you the short version, because long version is too long for me. History: up until 1918. we were part of either german, swedish or russian ruling. After that till 1940. we had independence, then russians came, added us to Soviet Union. During Soviet time Latvia was considered one of most advanced regions of USSR. Latvia was in Soviet Union till 1991, when got freedom 2nd time. 1997 crysis hit us hard. In 2004 we joined EU and NATO. 2009 crysis hit us even harder. We have a bit of tension with Russia. Some people consider 16th of March (legionare remembrance) and 9th of May (day Russia celebrates win over Nazi Germany) problematic. Political situation: there is one big pro-russian political party (who never gets to make government) and a few smaller other kind of parties(who does), we have our nationalists, who sometimes doesn't seem like nationalists, and we have our leftists, who are almost not seen at all. People dislike government, government does not understand it's people. One time we disbanded our govenment, but people elected almost the same people back in again, so those were well spent 2mil.

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","For Trump. What one of Senate Democrats is saying is the Russian Goverment employed ~1000 people, some of whom were running networks of automated twitter and facebook bots to spam newsfeeds with anti-Hillary stuff.
There were fake news sites out there, things saying Hillary has AIDS and stuff like that.

But my guess is the dems are strying to say everyone here posting the **Side of Beef** video was a Russian agent. They are saying that if Russia hand't payed these people Trump wouldn't have won the midwest and Pennsylvania.

Which is ridiculoous because many of those states hadn't turned red since Regan's 1984 relection. Saying that was all Russian spambots totally misses how Trump caputured the hearts and minds of working class white people in those states. He broke the blue firewall by being a charistmatic outsider.

Seriously, this is why it's such a shame logic and philosophy are not empahsized in american K-12 eduation. The Russia Tipped the elction in Trump's favor argument disregards the fact that Trump won in states democrats usually win by more than 5 and sometimes more than 10 percentage points. Even the biggest Russian botnetworks tweeting and posting 24/7 can't tip an election by 5 points or more. That was Trump.

And I am not for the record comfirming or denying the Russian Bots theory. There might have been some, just like how we had CTR here. Big difference though is CTR is the dems and russian bots are a foreign goverment, not something any camapign could control.

Anyway the idea of Russia tipping the election is almost as ridculous as Russia hacked voter machines/results of election. Considering how so many states used paper ballots (Ivan must surly be a wizard if he can hack those) and airgapped machines (machines with no conectivity to any netowrk or the inernet), the hacking the results theory is stupid. Trump winning the midwest and Pennsylvania was the result of him being a smart enough guy to defeat two political dynasties. All that charisma and lingusitic kill-shot usage was what got him the win, not bots.",1491005235

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly, I jerk off on Omegle because I'm looking for my long lost love. Let me explain ;

3 years ago, I was jerking on Omegle just trying to get a horny lonely to appreciate it and have a good time with me.

I cam across a girl who instead of being disgusted (the usual) she started laughing and it was THE MOST AMAZING LAUGH I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. I mean, it was the laugh of a fucking angel, man. I tilted my cam up to laugh back at her, and we started laughing together for a good 3 minutes. After we laughed, we began talking and let me tell you something dude, she was perfect.

She had unique perspectives on life, she was charming, beautiful, and so understanding! She wasn't judgemental and she was so graceful in her conversations. 

I ended up asking her where she is from, and we were about an hour away from each other (go figure) so we decided to meet up in about a week. Yes, I know this isn't a good idea and you should never do this, but you have to understand the circumstances. We were both genuinely enjoying each other.

We met, and actually fell in love right off the jump. To spare you too long of a story, we dated for about a year in and a half and I moved in with her. Unfortunately, we started to have a falling out. It just wasn't working. I was heartbroken, so was she, but we decided it was for the best.

A few months pass, and I am reading an article online and I was growing bored.

I decided to hop on Omegle.

I shit you not, the 3rd person to pop was HER. But she didn't even really look at me, she just skipped quickly and I don't think she even had a chance to realize who I was.

I tried to call her, to tell her what just happened and it went straight​ to a message saying that the number had been deactivated. I tried to hit her up on Facebook. Forgot she deleted her account months ago.

I emailed her 2 weeks ago, but still no response.

Ever since then, I have decided that once a week I would jerk off on Omegle to see if I can happen upon her once again.... To hear that beautiful laugh again... I would give anything....

Anyways, that's my story.

That's why I jerk off on Omegle.",1491005236

HPV is not possible to be tested for in men at all. And it is only really done on women who are either a) over 30, or b) under 30 but have had an abnormal pap. Even then, only the cervix is tested because cervical cancer is where the greatest danger lies (so you could have a negative result and still have hpv in your anus/vulva/vagina), and furthermore only the 14 highest risk strains are generally tested for (out of over 40 sexually transmitted types). So you're right, HPV testing kind of doesn't really exist for women either. But don't worry about getting something ""bad"". Most people clear even high-risk infections naturally within 2 years. If you're in the minority that aren't able to, but you're on top of your health and going to the gyno as you should, they will catch abnormalities early and take care of them with common, routine procedures long before it turns into cancer.

Allows for Pilfer to get a clean shot or possibly buff you're entire board with Dune Smuggler like you said. This card will be frustrating.

* **Gristlehide Dreugh:** I don't know if this'll see play in constructed, not an arena expert, but it's still a cool card and will probably draw you at least 2 cards most of the time. It's nice to see Neutral is still getting nice cards though even if they aren't super strong.

* **Protector of the Innocent:** Nord/Strength equivalent of Camlorn Sentinel so it has a bit more aggressive stat distribution. Will very likely see play.

* **Dark Guardian:** Follows the typical Endurance creatures have a bit higher stats than other creatures. Also awesome that we have a card that, while it doesn't really do anything amazing, interacts with Prophecy(excluding Fate Weaver). I'm positive this card will stick around because it's a tough cheap Guard with an awesome ability.

* **Marked Man:** Finally we can add Imperial Grunts directly into our deck! Jokes aside, I know Swindler's Market is quite popular and this'll very likely be added into it. Otherwise it might see use in a regular Token Spellsword deck.

It felt like I couldn't do ANYTHING without it. When I got sober everything was a first. I didn't think I could have sex sober, I was scared to drive sober, I didn't know how to talk to men (or women). 
Really to sum up the feeling it simply felt like the entire world would implode if I didn't get what I needed right that second.

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Sigh, here is my story...

Diagnosed in the early 80's. I was 21. I was recently married. It took a year to get the right answer, and by then, I had lost over 120 pounds. That was surgery one.

In 1993, I had an obstruction at the site of an adhesion. It didn't resolve, and I had emergency surgery. Bowel resection two.

In 2008, I went in for a hernia surgery, had my bowel perforated,  went septic, had my kidneys fail, went on a respirator and spent 10 months in the hospital resulting in surgery three, another bowel resection and the removal of my gall bladder.

I have been through every drug there is for Crohn's. I have been hospitalized for obstructions, dehydration, malnutrition and infections.

In between all that, I earned three college degrees, including an MBA. I have traveled around the world. I have been married twice, raised two children and am happily married to my second wife.

I have been a Vice President at a major bank, a director of finance for an annuity company and a VP of International Finance for an Insurance Company. I am currently the director of finance for a staffing company.

I have taught at a local university, both undergrad and grad students. 

I shoot, hunt and load my own ammunition. I play guitar, bass and banjo.

I have been a recovering alcoholic for 33 years. That has complicated my pain management considerably.

I have been treated for depression for decades. It is part of the scenery.

Crohn's kicks me in the balls from time to time, and fucks with my life. But it isn't my life, and it never will be. 

While Crohn's has made some things more challenging, I have found out that I am not defined by this disease. I take what life gives me. I have worked through fevers, obstructions and pain. And I have only gone on disability when I have had surgeries.

And I have been fired from extremely well paying jobs when they found out I had Crohn's. Three times. And three times, I sued the fuckers and won a boatload of money. I am 3-0 in unlawful dismissal cases.

I wake up in a pool of sweat more often than not, and I am currently being treated with experimental drugs, as i have exhausted all the approved ones. I am thrilled for the opportunity.

We get one go round on the merry go round of life, and I'll be damned if I am letting Crohn's define what I do with my turn. Fuck this disease. I by wipes by the crate, have hemorrhoids that hit my knees and I don't know what a solid shit feels like.

But on Monday, I will go to work, lead my team and rest secured in the fact that I have a change of clothes in the trunk of my car.

I am 54 years old. I have had this fucking disease for 33 years. I have outlived two gastroenterologists. I never trust a fart.

But you know what? I have, and continue to have a rich and full life. I enjoy my life. And I lived the kind of life that made sure that during my 10 month hospital stay, I had only one day without visitors, the day my son graduated from college. Yep, Crohn's took that away from me. He graduated as the Valedictorian, and I watched on cam the hospital set up for me. He is currently working on his Doctorate. 

I boxed when I was a kid. When the other guy punched you, you punched him back. It was either that, or stand there, and get the shit kicked out of you. Never stop fighting. Even when the fight is rigged. ",1491005244

"vim","t5_2qhqx","&gt; Also, what do you guys use the quickfix window for?

I use it for what it's meant for: compiling. It's a good start.

Otherwise I use tags to extract things like local variables, functions boundaries (in C, you won't need it, but in C++ it makes a difference), parents and children classes, functions that can be overridden, functions for which I have either no declaration or no definition, generate switch statements from an enum definition, etc.

I also use tags to ignore symbols in comment when spellcheking is activated.

"canada","t5_2qh68","That's great for them, but this is only a small part of the problem with the monthly transit pass price in Calgary. 

In the meantime, it's $95 Dollars per month for everyone else. For that you get a surface LRT with average frequency of about 10 min during the day.

Past 11pm, trains come about half an hour apart. Maybe it's changed recently, but that's how it was the last time I was there in 2016.

You get buses that come every hour past 10:30 in many neighbourhoods. 

Calgary transit users get used to taking a lot of cabs. 

Calgary is sprawling, and loosely populated, which makes transit a problem. When I lived in Calgary, the monthly fee was too expensive for me to buy, so I stole transit thanks to the lack of turnstiles. 

In the meantime, Montreal has the best transit in Canada *by far*, and it's 82$ a month.

Monthly fees are regressive after a certain point, and like Toronto, Calgary is not doing enough to combat this. Roughly 100$ a month for Calgary transit? This penalizes not just the *very* poor that this new price helps, but those who have just managed to struggle their way to lower class. 

It is a price that penalizes people who have the least options the most.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;they want to see up an us vs. them that has Muslims seeing themselves on the side of terrorists.

I agree with you here, you're just putting way to much emphasis on not saying the phrase ""Islamic terrorism"" as a solution to this. It isn't. Those closest to the bloodshed don't care about the image of Islam, they care about not getting murdered. If they aren't cooperating with us against terrorists it's because they don't trust us, and if they don't trust us it's probably because we bomb them and don't follow through on promises to protect those that aid us, not because we refer to it as ""Islamic terrorism."" Those closest to the bloodshed are well aware that those that they are fighting are Muslims.

This is a semantic quibbling shouted down from ivory towers.

&gt;So yes, it is absolutely in their best interest to do the face rubbing and stigmatizing, and in their best interest for you also to do face rubbing and stigmatizing.

The face rubbing is done by two kinds of people: the terrorists, and people like you who insist that the phrase ""Islamic terrorism"" is an attack on all Muslims despite common sense dictating the opposite. It's a bit dishonest to hold those whose words you pervert responsible for the harm caused. all you are doing is convincing vulnerable people that there could be no other meaning.

&gt;Grouping Islam into ""Islamic terrorism"" literally only makes Islamic terrorism stronger.

Well that's a dishonest way of putting it. The phrase ""Islamic terrorism"" groups Muslim terrorists in with other Muslims,  you got it backwards.

&gt;Its playing into their hands. Its letting yourself be manipulated by your enemies - and turns friends into enemies.

You don't think you're being a little bit dramatic?

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","honestly accuracy percentages are useless, you could hit 7 shots on a  tank and miss 3 on a support, youd have a 70% accuracy but you missed the harder shots and hit the easy ones, meaning your aim isnt that good.

being aware of who is fighting who is a trait a good dps has, your tracer is on ana? help her out, making ana use her nade on herself or even die is a great pick, your rein is fighting their rein? help him, then you have a big shield advantage. hog hooked a rein? a good burst of shots will secure the kill and give you a big advantage. doing this not only helps your team secure kills quicker, but also frees that person up to help kill the others on the team.

another big tip for dps is always be aware of enemy flankers/divers, you need to keep your supports safe, as losing them is the quickest way to lose a fight, it seems obvious, but i play a lot of ana, and its so fustrating getting killed over and over by tracer genji or winston and my dps is tunnel visioned shooting a rein shield.

for your problem with all out poke fights at chokes try playing soldier and try to get through the choke if you can, being able to take an annoying position behind the choke can be a big difference maker, its will make the enemy team have to react to your presence or youll just get free kills for days, the more you can pull them away from the choke the better. mcree unfortunately isnt very mobile, so you just have to stay with the team and hope you can break through.

"otomegames","t5_2t3uv","Let's see here.... This old [LJ post](http://tokio-fujita.livejournal.com/5632.html) has some of the info and will give you names for the original Japanese releases at least, but it's a bit outdated now. GeoPizza covered the PSP (Demon of the Fleeting Blossom), 3DS (Memories of the Shinsengumi) and Vita (Kyoto Winds) differences pretty well.

The NA release for the **PS3** port (Stories of the Shinsengumi) contains the fandisc Zuisouroku plus the extra event added in the JP portable version of the fandisc (available as a free DLC, iirc). I believe anything on the PSP version would be in this as well. The fandisc has about 4-6 extra short scenes for each main guy, plus 1-2 short scenes for Kondou, Sannan, Nagakura, and Yamazaki. There's also 3 longer short stories. Overall, prior to Kyoto Winds, this would have the most content for your buck as far as an English port goes. It was definitely worth picking up after having only played the mobile version. While the main stories are unchanged, the extra content on the PS3 was worth it.

There's also the **mobile** port, which I believe is near identical to the PSP version, but has an additional tea event and character shorts. The tea event and character shorts are NOT on the PS3 version, but IIRC, I think I remember seeing the character shorts available for purchase as DLC for the PS3. 

Getting to the newest port, **Kyoto Winds** has at least *some* of the content from the PS3 fandisc in some fashion, based purely on what I've seen in the trailers. While I could look at CG videos and find out for sure, I've been trying to avoid spoiling any of the new content. The JP Vita release split the game into 2: Shinkai Kaze no Shou and Shinkai Hana no Shou. I believe Kyoto Winds is just the first game. (VNDB.org lists a slated JP PS4 release that puts these both on one disc!)

I suspect that occurs because this is a very student-heavy forum.

But the FI sub is geared more to field educators vs. students but they will certainly be welcomed if they aren't stirring up negativity.

P.S. It's for Field Educators (I.e. Those who supervise students in the field and not so much those who work at a school placing students).",1491005253

We don't allow companies to lie about the ingredients in the food they sell us, even if the lies do not  have any impact on health, nutrition, or safety.

I'm going to skip over Bolles, you might as well just go through my comment history for why. I talked about Bolles already today and only lasted like 2 days without talking about him.

If we were going OL there I would have taken Ramcyzk every time and I would have preferred Davis, Watson, probably Brantley and maybe Cunningham. Yeah OL is a problem for us, but based on the quality of player on the board, I don't see why we should take even what you perceive as the best OT available instead of taking better players at other positions.

Hodges is a dismal blocker and route runner and wins on raw athleticism alone. I wouldn't want him at 87, he's just a big dude with good hands. He seems lazy in routes, in blocking, he also plays really soft for a guy of his size in my opinion. Foreman, Anzalone, Adoree, and Jordan Willis would have been far better choices here. Tight end is a need but Hodges doesn't do what we need well enough. For our system, our tight ends have to be able to block and our entire offense is predicated on good route runners. Has been for a while. I like Shaheen, Butt, and Leggett better, no question.

Walker is okay. To me he's JAG, and I'd like to have filled the Hankins sized hole in our DL with a guy like Jaleel Johnson or brought in an OL to compete like Moton instead (clearly assuming we didn't take Bolles because I wouldn't have). And with Kpassagnon still on the board, who I think would be a stud to work in with OV and JPP and eventually replace JPP when his time comes. Perine as a power back to compliment Perkins would have been great as well.

There are just so many players I'd rather have than the ones you gave us. I'd be very unhappy with this as a whole.

It probably comes across as me not liking the players you took but I think in the end you went too need heavy for us. You took players at need positions and left players on the board who are better just because they aren't needs. But when the tackle crop is this weak, I'd rather bypass it and handle it later.

The Giants are in position to draft the best players available, and JR has started to lean heavily towards taking players with very high upside, more than what they've shown. I don't see any of the players you've given us as that type of player. I don't see the ceiling for these players that makes them worth these picks.",1491005257

Your point about the Joe not rating may also be true. This also the case for the stay at home mom. A high powered attorney may want a realtionship with a home-maker and not place emphasis on looks. We could play with ""what-ifs"" to prove the point all day long.

"OccupationalTherapy","t5_2s8kc","As with all things, it really depends. Carefully think through your payment plans and figure out what's feasible.

I went to an expensive grad school. Combined with my undergrad loans, I finished school with $120k in debt.

The 10 year standard repayment plan had me paying about $1100 per month for 10 years. That sounded terrible, so I created my own aggressive repayment plan (minimum of $2500 per month) to pay back my loans within about 3-4 years. When I calculated interest, the aggressive plan saves me $40k in comparison to the 10 year plan.

Look for other financial repayment options. I have a $5k Perkins loan that qualifies for loan forgiveness, so that's one I don't need to worry about. My workplace also gave me a $5k ""scholarship"" which I put toward my loans. I decided early on to take money out of my savings to pay off my highest interest rate loan. I live frugally, but comfortably, and better than when I was a student. 

Repayment is doable, but you need to go in with a plan. Are you comfortable paying $1000 per month for 10 years? Are you comfortable with Public Service Loan Forgiveness and all its trappings? (I wasn't.) you can also consider higher earning options like travel therapy, working a per diem job on the side for extra cash. 

Think about your other financial goals too. Paying off loans in a few years is great, but it also means I can't buy a house any time soon. Plenty of my classmates are fine with the 10 year plan, and have been able to go on vacations and stuff. It just comes down to your priorities and what you're comfortable with.",1491005261

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","I use OOYH and set it to Windows Direct.  I use it with Kodi, Netflix, Hulu and Tidal.  With Tidal I also use J River b/c I use the Sonarworks plugin to EQ my sound.

YMMV w OOYH.  Personally I tried all the Presets, but only two or three work to my satisfaction, but those work very well for my HRTF.  You, on the other hand, may find one that really works or not.  If it does, you've found a huge bargain.

My guess is the Oppo PM3s will probably work best b/c they're neutral and good sound stagers, and comfortable.

&gt;Why is hate crimes outside of the united states irrelevant to you?

You're someone who thinks that the only form of racism is slavery, so why would your anecdotal experience with white supremacists be relevant to anything?  Hahaha.

Or do you actually think that one person's statement that ""they've never see a white supremacist"" is proof that racism no longer exists?  LMAO

&gt;Why is slavery in Africa til 2007 irrelevant to you?

These strawmans, can't you make an actual argument?

# No slavery in Africa, in the way that you are attempting to use it is not relevant to the discussion of institutionalized racism in the United States.  

&gt;#""If you care about racism in America, you therefore don't care about racism around the world."" That is what you are saying.

And I completely support the work of the governments and International Organizations committed to this task.***

&gt;#I could quite as easily make a fallacious argument like yours and say, why do you only care about the African slaves from ten years ago, what about the slavery that still exists right now in around the world?

The democrats literally paid millions of dollars to the Awan brothers and gave them access to classified information before they funneled their money into pakistan through shell companies and took off. Ironically enough the 31 dems most strongly opposing trump are the ones that those 3 brothers and 2 of their wives worked for. Their father was revealed by a CIA officer to be connected to Hezbollah. Yet media wants to use hearsay from anonymous people from bullshit journalists that have no credibility to try and frame trump.... meanwhile Hillary took 135 million in donations from Russians on top of speaking fees before the Uranium One deal. Her campaign met with Russian officials and they took money from 3rd world dictators that treat women like garbage. But Flynn had dinner once, better have an unprecedented cry baby rage and investigation... but mum on Hillary.

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","Literally, all of this can actually be solved with what I said. Discipline and hard work. Gotta work 5 miles to work until you can afford a bike and eventually(maybe) a car? Sucks, but ok. Have to eat Ramen and shit every night until you can afford to put a down payment on a checking account or other shit? Sucks, shouldn't be that way, but it doesn't mean it's impossible to get out of.

I mean it's pretty simple math. Any adult can get a full time job(yes, you can. Maybe hard for felons or disabled) paying minimum wage. And then soemthing part time on the side, on weekends, or whatever. As long as they aren't spending anything extra besides food, basic clothes, hygine, etc. and live in the lowest rent place possible, they would be ok. Also taking advantage of any available government programs.

Also, I would understand your point, but my room mate and very good friend grew up extremely poor(I grew up in the middle class, mom stayed at home with a disability, dad a teacher). His dad was a drunk that couldn't hold a job and beat his mother to the point of disability. He would go days without eating outside of school, and this went on until he was 16. And he feels the exact same way I do because he lived through it and still struggles. He has made his way(got his GED, bought a car, walked miles to work until he could, etc.) up to a livable life from an awful situation. But he still struggles with addiction to weed(which he has been encouraged to smoke from the age of 9) He fully knows that his money problems(which are there) would be alleviated if he wasn't spending like $70 a week on weed. And this is true with most poor people, there is something they are doing that they could fix. Some spending habit. Some are harder to fix than others. One may have to move for better rent(which can be hard without a car, but most certainly doable with rentals which can be saved for, deposited for, etc.) but it would be worth it.

It is certainly hard to get out of(and for how rich the country is, it should be far easier) but it's doable by almost anyone with discipline, hard work, and time.",1491005266

And if they don't seem to care it's probably because of a lack of guidance, they were never taught to value their beauty properly by their father figure.

&gt;Ironically, these same gals also say I'm ""too skinny"", when I'm a size 6 and still the largest female in my immediate family lol.

Valve has figured the game out and the name of their game is do something dumb? Let the community whiteknight us and we sit it out. Unless even the community that white knights valve turns on them and then they change something. 

Now lets talk about the hat thing in dota 2. Valve has no right to be playing ball like this. Content creators are making 6-10% on their hats (im pretty sure famous names can negotiate a couple extra percent on that) Regular content creators have no leverage to make any calls. Either they agree to let valve fuck them in the ass with as big of a pole as they want or they are told to fuck off, potentially get black balled by valve and instead some other person takes their place. 

You have to be absolutely blind and stupid to tell me Valve isn't extremely greedy and extremely stubborn. They've figured out the ball game and they make all their stupid/random changes based around it. Paid mods was the best example of valve's blatant bullheadedness. 

Despite massive complaints and outrage valve was on board, probably prepared to throw bethesda to the wolves, but god bless bethesda for the fact that they actually fear their fans leaving them in disgust so they backed off and that was that. 

And valve is showing absolutely no signs of ever improving. Why? Because there is no other platform out there that competes with them on a level that steam operates on. ",1491005272

&gt; # [Le dieron perpetua por un crimen, durante el juicio amenazó al fiscal, le dijo ""gato"" y le abrieron otra causa](http://bucket.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/99/2402999.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; El insólito hecho ocurrió durante un juicio contra ""El Adrián"", acusado de haber participado del asesinato de un joven en Tigre
&gt; 
&gt; Viernes 31 de marzo de 2017 • **17:57**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Un delincuente multirreincidente fue condenado a reclusión perpetua por tiempo indeterminado por haber participado del asesinato de un joven en la villa San Jorge del partido bonaerense de [Tigre](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/tigre-t34336 ""Ver todas las notas de Tigre"") , pero sumó una nueva causa penal cuando frente al tribunal le dijo ""gato"" al fiscal del juicio y lo amenazó de muerte, informaron hoy fuentes judiciales.
&gt; 
&gt; El fiscal que fue amenazado es Cosme Iribarren y el hecho ocurrió durante su alegato en un juicio ante el Tribunal Oral en lo Criminal (TOC) 7 de [San Isidro](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/san-isidro-t57057 ""Ver todas las notas de San Isidro"") que culminó el martes pasado con la condena para Adrián Marcelo Suárez (35), jefe de una banda de la mencionada villa San Jorge, ubicada en la localidad de Don Torcuato.
&gt; 
&gt; ""El Adrián"", tal como le decían en el barrio, recibió la pena máxima que tiene el Código Penal, una reclusión perpetua más la accesoria por tiempo indeterminado, la misma condena por la que el [máximo asesino serial de la historia](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1947884-carlos-robledo-puch-mejoro-sus-condiciones-carcelarias-y-hasta-podria-recuperar-la-libertad) criminal argentina, Carlos Robledo Puch, lleva ya 45 años encarcelado.
&gt; 
&gt; Le dieron perpetua por un crimen, durante el juicio amenazó al fiscal,. Foto: Archivo Cuando el fiscal Iribarren culminaba su alegato con el pedido de esta pena, Suárez lo interrumpió para decirle a viva voz y frente a los jueces: ""Gato, cuando salga te voy a hacer mierda, acordate de mí"".
&gt; 
&gt; A partir de esos dichos, los jueces del TOC 7, María Coelho, Eduardo Enrique Lavenia y Alberto Gaig, ordenaron la extracción de testimonios para que se inicie contra Suárez una nueva causa penal por el delito de ""amenazas"" contra Iribarren, que no sólo actuó en el juicio sino que como titular de la Unidad Funcional de Instrucción (UFI) de Don Torcuanto, también había sido el fiscal de instrucción que lo había encarcelado.
&gt; 
&gt; Suárez recibió la reclusión perpetua por tiempo indeterminado al ser considerado coautor de un "" [homicidio](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/inseguridad-t28302 ""Ver todas las notas de Inseguridad"") doblemente agravado por el concurso premeditado de dos o más personas y mediante el empleo de un arma de fuego"".
&gt; 
&gt; ## Un delincuente con varias condenas
&gt; 
&gt; También fue declarado ""multirreincidente"", ya que presentaba varias condenas previas por robos calificados, según confiaron las fuentes.
&gt; 
&gt; El crimen por el que fue condenado tuvo como víctima a un joven llamado Nicolás Jorge Matías Giménez y ocurrió el 6 de febrero de 2013 en la manzana 14 de la villa San Jorge, cerca de una iglesia y del sector de canchas.
&gt; 
&gt; La víctima circulaba en moto cuando, de uno de los pasillos, salieron Suárez con una ametralladora y otros tres imputados con una escopeta y armas cortas, y lo asesinaron de dos tiros en la cabeza.
&gt; 
&gt; Según lo acreditado en el juicio, ""El Adrián"" era el jefe de una banda que tenía el control en el barrio y había amenazado de muerte a Giménez por un incidente ocurrido en noviembre de 2012, cuando la víctima le dio una paliza a otro de los acusados en un pool.
&gt; 
&gt; Por este mismo homicidio, los otros tres coautores del hecho, identificados como Damián Marcelo Ayala, alias ""Pelado""; Mariano Jorge López, alias ""Polón""; y Gastón Alejandro Florentín, ya fueron juzgados y recibieron la pena de prisión perpetua en debates previos.
&gt; 
&gt; A raíz de lo que declararon varios testigos en el juicio, el TOF 7 de San Isidro también ordenó que se extrajeran testimonios para investigar a ""El Adrián"" por varios robos y usurpaciones coactivas ocurridas en la villa San Jorge.
&gt; 
&gt; Iribarren no es el primer fiscal del departamento judicial de San Isidro que fue amenazado en pleno juicio, ya que el 31 de agosto de 2015, su colega Patricio Ferrari también fue intimidado en un debate oral.
&gt; 
&gt; Juan Pablo Majo Molinari (40), alias ""El Tarántula"", era juzgado como el ""ladrón golpeador"" de mujeres y frente al juez Correccional 4 de San Isidro, Facundo Ocampo y las cámaras de un canal de TV amenazó a Ferrari y acusó a los policías de la DDI de San Isidro de haberle robado dinero en un allanamiento ""para ir a comer un asado"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""En este momento me levantaría y te rompería la nariz a trompadas. Y haceme una causa más y poneme un año más por favor te lo pido"", le dijo Majo Molinari al fiscal Ferrari, lo que le valió una nueva causa por la que en noviembre del año pasado incrementó en un año su condena original y deberá cumplir una pena total de 12 años.

yeah i know, i always prepare as much as possible

- taking out pain in the ass people  
- getting propane gas tanks ans other things in position  
- and so on  
- use my safe shortly before the first target gets killed

I would not play shogun, the extra body does not synergize with the evasive plan. Overwhelm is ok, but you already have lots of evasion in flying so it is not as good here as it is in other types of decks.

Outside of the cities, roads were dirt. Just dirt. Mud. Full of holes, puddles, muck so deep your horse got stuck. Dreadful. 

The Good Roads Movement started when bicyclists started lobbying their local governments for better roadways, work and political momentum that ultimately resulted in the Interstate Highway System.

The man who was at the center of some of America's first coast-to-coast highways, the Auto Trail system, got his start in life and in business, by riding/racing bikes and selling bikes, decades before the car was invented. Modern, tarmac roads are inexorably tied to the first bike boom in America, the one in the 1870s and the resulting demand for better roads. Cars were still novelties of the rich when ""**tar** **mac**adam"" was patented in 1901.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Christianity could still be true but still have clustered adherents; Christianity's truth, or lack thereof, is not affected by what it's believers do or where they live.

Sure it is. If there was one god, and he had one plan for mankind, then it makes zero sense to release it in one corner of the world. We should see the same message disseminated by prophets all over the world, and at the same time. There would be no mistake as to what was going on.

The current method seems to imply that the spread of religion is ultimately ""Battle of the Memes,"" with each one originating in a geographical area and then clashing with others as it spread.

&gt;So now I'm thinking, can this correlation be used to argue towards any conclusion?

I don't think so.

&gt;But believing things because your parents believed them isn't a good way at arriving at truth.

And yet it is how most people arrive at their religious beliefs. And sometimes their political beliefs as well. We get all sorts of stuff from our parents.

&gt;Other truths that can be independently observed like evolution, quantum mechanics and general relativity are believed by people across the world; the belief in these truths transcends geography and religious adherence.

Evolution is demonstrably true, but is not universally believed (for some absolutely strange reason). But yes: things that can be observed tend to be more universally believed. This is why there are so many variations on religious belief: there is nothing that can be observed to specify whether one religion is more true than another, so it comes down to what you were taught and what you're comfortable with... and where you were born.",1491005291

"entwives","t5_2s7a6","I'm prefacing this comment by saying I used to work in the veterinary field, currently work in the legal cannabis industry, have medicated ill pets with cannabis oil and live with a veterinarian who has also medicated her own animals.

I know a lot of people are freaking out at the idea of giving your pet THC. They shouldn't. Our pets have an endocannabinoid system like we do and can reap the same medical benefits. 

That said, they are MUCH MORE SENSITIVE to THC than we are and cannot tolerate human dosages. To treat my cat with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I would put one drop of homemade olive oil tincture on my finger and he would lick it off. I don't know my roommate's (the vet) dosages for her cat and bichon that both had lymphoma, but they were very low. They were also done in combination with traditional chemotherapy.

There is always risk administering a medication to a living creature, but it is up to you weigh the risks:benefits. If you choose to medicate, CBD oil is an option. And since it is not psychoactive, there are fewer dosing concerns.

However, CBD and THC work best together. The entourage effect is real. If you are going to medicate your mouse (super cute btw), a TINY TINY TINY bit of oil for her to lick off your finger or put onto a piece of her normal food. I can't recommend other edibles or tinctures because I can't be sure how mice will react to the other ingredients. 

If she overindulges (we don't use the term overdose because, at least in humans, there's no practical lethal dose of THC) she may be uncomfortable, confused, nauseous or vomit, aggressive, you never know. Keep her hydrated. If she seems to be ""too high"" give her a little fatty peanut butter (as long as it's not made with xylitol) to help moderate the high.

I can't wallow around in negativity if I'm too busy with lifting/training, socializing, and reading/studying. I do get pretty down on my self if I truly have nothing to focus on or nothing to drive myself towards, but I was like this far before I started to lean towards being RP.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","Favoritism and bullying was a huge problem at one of my first jobs. There was one charge nurse in particular who wielded a lot of power and influence on our unit because our manager was her close friend and had come to rely on her to do the most boring, clerical aspects of his job for her (which also meant she controlled scheduling and timecard approvals which scared a lot of people away from confronting her [and this was also wildly illegal to threaten someone's hard earned pay for power]). She was quite the tyrant. Belittled and chewed out staff from both shifts in front of everyone (moving some of them to tears in front of their silently spectating coworkers) and tried to lean on everyone like she was the manager. Even belittled and shamed our manager a few times in front of everyone. She encouraged people from both shifts to constantly write eachother up over the most trivial things (like a patient's medications being late because they were off the unit at the scheduled administration time). She enjoyed passing on harmful gossip and playing games with everyone like letting soandso1 know that this gossip came from soandso2 and then running to soandso2 and saying soandso1 said THIS about you. This caused a lot of  strife between nurses, and the two shifts and all the cliques people settled into in this hostile environment were like a bunch of warring nations.

When I started working there and became aware of the extent of the situation, I was flabbergasted and asked a lot of my coworkers how and why this situation has been tolerated for so long.

I organized a day shift and night shift coalition of People Sick of Her Shit and helped them to list out their grievances in clear and direct language and confront our manager as a solid group. He promised he'd handle it and swore that he didn't know it was like that (yeah right). The tyrant charge nurse played nice for a week after that but then slowly started going back to her old ways. When the manager went out on medical leave, she went fully back to her old ways. The list of grievances and the fact that our manager's intervention didn't stop the situation was sent to HR. Staff were called in for interviews about it with HR and the director of our class of units, and she was disciplined. She now works in an ancillary department of the hospital that doesn't have much interaction with ours.

The effect on the unit was like Sauron's tower crumbling and the dark clouds clearing to let sunshine fall upon Mordor again in Lord of the Rings. People became civil, write ups between staff became rare, and morale shot way up.

So yes, I've noticed that there seems to be more bullying and drama in nursing compared to my previous non-medical work, but sometimes it really is just a problem with that particular unit or department. And sometimes that's a problem that can be solved with appropriate action.",1491005297

-A Backwoods Cult Leader is right now the World Champion. He'll be facing a Sociopath who was upset that this Cult Leader was able to beat him. Thus he pretended to join the Cult, then became the Cult Leaders Right Hand Man, before turning on him and burning his shack down that may have housed the rotting dead body of the Cult Leaders Sister. The Sociopath is the ""good guy"" in this match. Cult Leader now believes himself to be a Dark God and this is for the World Championship.

-A Fallout/Mad Max Cosplayer wants to kill a guy who's act is he's the crazy guy who walks around the Supermarket talking to himself. Note the crazy person is the ""good guy"" in this match. This is also for a title belt.

-A very talented worker feels he was screwed over by his boss so he beat the crap out of him. He was fired but then rehired so they can have a match.

-A man who we have been told is the biggest hero the WWE has ever seen but we all hate is in a match with a man who was an Undead Old West Mortician, turned Satanic Cult Leader, turned badass American Biker, turned Undead Old West Outlaw Mortician.

-Two Canadians who used to be friends but now hate one another will be fighting one another over the U.S. Championship Belt.

-John Cena and his girlfriend will be in a match with a guy who got his start on MTV's The Real World and his French Canadian wife. This may or may not be over who is the better B-Movie actor. Al Roker will be an announcer and Cena may ask his girlfriend to marry him.

-A 50+ year old man who is right now the other main Champion will be putting that title on the line. The man he's fighting? A guy from UFC named Brock Lesnar. Lesnar is bringing a jew from New York City with him.

-Wrestlemania will be hosted this year by three nerds who like talking about Ice Cream, Unicorns, Breakfast Cereals. One of those nerds has a YouTube video game channel and was just found to be the male star in a leaked amateur porno video.

-And lastly most of the fanbase are waiting for a man to show up with his brother. This man was injured and now believes he is talking to seven gods, has magic powers, is granted visions of both the past and future. He tormented his brother to the point where he lost his mind and beat up another man who talked to a fake head.

They are LARGELY based on how you look and present yourself, and the kind of orders you accept and how often you manipulate the system by skipping or canceling orders as soon you know it's going to turn out poorly for you.  
  
It would be nice if we lived in a world where people rated fairly, based on your speed and precision and customer service skills. The reality is the ACTUAL rating system works like this:  
  
1. Are you an attractive young woman? Automatic 4.8~5 stars. You can be a biker/walker and take forever and bring cold food and still get 5 stars + over 90% tips.  
2. Are you an attractive male? Automatic at least 4.8. Not as exploitable as being a good looking gal but still a darn good advantage.     
3. If you aren't naturally attractive, are you at least presentable? Assuming you do everything else right you start at 4.7 and work your way up from there.   
4. Are you a minority that isn't attractive at all and speaks with a heavy third-world sounding accent? Sorry, you can work your butt off do every order perfect and be struggling to barely maintain over 4.6 and not get deactivated.  
  
Sure other things will help your rating. Good customer service skills. Always be punctual. Always keep your current customer informed. Deliver accurately and quickly. Use an actual good thermal bag so the food is just like it was straight from the chef to their doorstep. Always deliver to their door and don't just leave their shit in the apartment office. All of those things will help your rating. But as someone with a lot of background in CS and psychology I can tell you if are attractive, people will invent reasons in their mind to like you. This is actually well known scientific fact ( http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00077/full ). So while I make sure to do everything normal about this job right, the biggest thing I do to maintain my rating is actually skincare, staying in shape, always shaving and showering just before leaving for deliveries. These things make me an above average looking male, and I know for a fact it helps because if I stop caring for even a week I stop getting perfect 5 stars fast even if I do a better job LOL.  
1. Be attractive.  
2. Don't be unattractive.

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","Kind of...here's what I do...

I use my audio interface software (Lynx) to create a direct out mix which is essentially the direct monitoring your software is doing...I run that mix to an outboard reverb to give it a little flavor (vox and guitar usually just a preference thing)...then I set my recording latency really high, this keeps you from experiencing dropouts/clicks etc...because you have given the computer permission to que the audio signal in the most stable configuration...

I then hit ""record"" (I'm running Sonar Plat)...and it usually takes a few seconds for the audio to start up (if I am dubbing guitar or bass tracks or vox)...now what I hear is two separate things, I hear the recorded audio that I am playing along with (once the initial latency has cleared there is no lag) and I am hearing a separate analog signal hat is direct monitoring...I can now play perfectly in sync with the recorded audio with no concerns over cpu usage/latency or software issues since I have set the latency really high and am playing along side with a direct monitor signal as well...

I DO NOT listen to what I am recording as it goes through the software because it will lag with what I am actually doing in real time because of the actual latency (my computer is an 8 core with 16 gigs of ram but even in that situation with state of the art converters there is ALWAYS going to be some latency)...what I hear is real time that has bypassed the software (that is currently playing the tracks I am playing along with...)

In other words I am playing in car B (the one staying on the highway and avoiding downtown) while listening to car A (the tracks previously recorded)...

The latency is a non issue because basically I said ""Go"" to car A and waited until it started (it becomes audible) to drive in car B...(direct out/bypass software)...

The newly recorded track has already been adjusted to the latency of the program...this is the ""pause"" that happens between when I hit ""record"" and the actual software starts playing the music I am going to play along with...",1491005298

Sure, for stars you could also use Jack or something, but again, it's the supports that are pretty much doing all the work.

So in a tier list, I'd more focus on how a Servant is as a *whole,* rather than just look at his high damage ceiling and ignore what it requires for him to *get* there. That's why I'd consider him lower.

&gt; The end result is that any potential for creativity and artistic expression will be snuffed out.

&gt; Is this what we want? Bland conformity and mediocrity? I guess I don't really need to ask since we're on a site where our modus operandi is to parrot memes.

&gt; But if you feel differently, fight back. We will crush the /r/solidcolors with noise. I won't lie to you, this too is a form of conformity. But we have already seen from ground zero of the canvas that art can still thrive within chaos - but no one has been able to penetrate a solid.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Hi, I work for an aircraft engine manufacturer. I am in project managment and I am not an expert on this special subject, but the concept screams with problems imo.
1. Center of gravity shift
2. compressor stall in high aoa situations
3. inherent instability
4. Access to engines for on-wing inspection and maintenance
5. adaptibility to new engines of possibly different mass and dimensions over the course of the designs lifetime
6. if the point is to make wings thinner, where do you store the fuel
Points 2 and 3 kill this idea for me as they impact safety by a lot and I don't see anyone compromising that in the civil world, not even for 50% sfc reduction (which is unrealistic anyways). For military it's a bit different but then, they are even more focused on ease of maintenance and they don't care about fuel efficiency.

And finally: Fuel efficiency is already improving through engine and material innovations that are not nearly as risky. I don't see Airbus or Boeing spending money on the development of such a frivolous design however interesting it may be.

And also: Most of these ideas have been around for a long time but where not considered better than the state of the art overall. Usually that means the technology isn't that great. At least if the circumstances don't fundamentally change.
An example for this is the high speed delta wing which was studied by pioneers like Lippisch as soon as the jet engine was becoming real. They were popular in the early cold war whehn the engines had the power to get the planes to the speeds where Deltas are best but became only really superior when full authority digital control of the control surfaces made them controllable while being inherently very unstable.",1491005302

I watch for about ten minutes, finally wake up, and throw my blankets off.

I walk to the fridge, open it, and pull out a can of pop.  Then, I walk back to my couch, where I had fallen asleep last Friday night.  I sit down on top of my covers, crack open my pop, take a big swig, place it on the coffee table, and pick up my Xbox Controller.

This will export only those objects you've had selected, thus you can then export your gun and magazine separately as two different objects.

However, you can also just model everything in one object. When you're done, select the object, go into edit mode, select all the vertices that make up the magazine and hit P. Then hit ""Selection"". This will remove all vertices from the object and put them into a new object, thus separating the two.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","There is no ""barrier"" for any female staffers, or female intermediaries of certain organizations seeking to meet with him. They can meet with him, just not alone at a one-on-one dinner. He averts this by bringing along one of his staffers—male or female—to observe and possibly take notes of the meeting, as well as offer advice.

And I don't think anyone in their right mind would suspect Pence of having an affair with Theresa May, so he would probably make an exception for her, so there goes your example. 

From the *Indianapolis Star*:
&gt;During his 12 years in Congress, Pence had rules to avoid any infidelity temptations, or even rumors of impropriety. Those included **requiring that any aide who had to work late to assist him be male**, never dining alone with a woman other than his wife, and not attending an event where alcohol is served unless Karen was there. In a 2002 interview with The Hill, Pence called it, “building a zone around your marriage.” ""If there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, I want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me,"" Pence said.

In other words, Pence had female staffers who he worked with, but as a married man he naturally didn't want the appearance of impropriety of working late at night alone with one of them, given the wrong message it would naturally send. Nor is he the only politician to adopt such rules.

From [*The Atlantic* article on this subject](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/pences-gender-segregated-dinners/521286/):
&gt;An anonymous survey of female Capitol Hill staffers conducted by National Journal in 2015 found that “several female aides reported that they have been barred from staffing their male bosses at evening events, driving alone with their congressman or senator, or even sitting down one-on-one in his office for fear that others would get the wrong impression.”

It's not unreasonable for male politicians in Congress, conservative or liberal, to not want to be in situations where they are alone with a female staffer late at night, or alone dining with them. Could lead to false accusations, and again, it gives off a wrong vibe.

Lastly, Mike Pence is not saying that he ""isn't happy to engage in standard business or political stuff with people who happen to be women"", as you put it—he's obviously had to meet with hundreds of female political consultants and businesswomen during his decades-long career, and had smooth working relationships with them. He just doesn't want to dine and drink with them one-on-one without other men or women present, out of respect for the sanctity of his marriage and devotion to his wife. He's a conservative Christian Evangelical, and is respecting his marriage, for that he should be applauded.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;The article instantly switches from rapists to men.

Most rapists are men. And unless there's a whole bunch of research out there about female rapists, or significant research that includes rapists of both genders, the article is working with what is available. Do you think there’s a considerable difference in the reasons that men rape versus why women rape?

&gt;It doesn't talk about current alternative theories, just old ""strawmen"" to argue against

&gt;It was well sourced with poor and old studies. Only one or two sources are from this century and even those have some big problems with sampling. Thirty year old interviews with a dozen rapists does not make compelling evidence.

The article goes through the history of research into rape, starting in the 1930's. Several ideas about what causes rape have come and gone and the article talks about the research that led to those theories and why many of them didn’t end up holding up. Of course some of the research is bad, the article acknowledges that. I’m really confused about what your criticism here actually is. What strawmen?

&gt;The second they get to actual solutions then even their bad studies dry up. The author states more money and training will reduce rape, but offers zero evidence that will help.

The conclusion is that rapists are essentially no different from other types of criminals, which is backed by the survey results of convicted rapists compared to other felons. They argue that, like any other crime, the best way to combat rape is deterrence, and use several example of wartime rape to support that point.",1491005311

There's an article i read once because i was worried about my adhd /autism / verbally limited 4 year old daughter not caring if she hurt people because i had huge problems with her scratching,biting and hitting  no matter how much we went over and over playing right and we are  good consistent disciplinarians. 

Some people have mature kids, some are way more immature but the positive side is that when she finally accepts rule, it sticks. Its just a matter of making it stick. Like, we would take her out of corner to explain why Its bad to ____ and she would make these humming/grunty soft noises (different that stemming because her stemming is consonants and sing songy)  to block out what we were saying or she would want to fiddle with my necklace or handband and ask questions about it to not focus on what we re saying . Which raises the issue of spanking but that was abmysal failure and made everything 1000% worse

It was a two year struggle , basically as long and as trying as potty training. Basically, she has huge problem differentiating between fantasy and reality so cartoon slliness sticks with her . So no tablet , just PBS kids shows

what article said was basically psychiatrically disturbed kids  dont care when they get confronted with bad behavior but adhd kids do, they are impulsive but seem remorseful when effect of their actions are pointed out. 

A year later and its so much better - the difference between pre k and her punching kid in the head  over legos and kindergartener who gets a teacher when someone is being a turd is amazing. We saw a baby crawling at the park and instead of trying to waller all over it , she bent down and waved and said 'hi baby' and brought him toys and set them down nicely. 

She s great reader so we made out own story books about why its wrong to do ________  and what to do instead in different situations. and her speech therapist gave us a work book of little coloring sheets with pro social stories and prompts on the reverse side. 

I dont know how to address it with brother. He probably knows so just be kind but honest . He maybe defensive  if he thinks you are be unfair to kid  or focusing on something unlikely ( like kid *purposefully* poisoning daughter) to paint kid in worst light but just be supportive and kind and honest.

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","I've been waiting for a chance to review this for you guys but we *still* haven't gotten it at my store. Bless you for beating me to it, and bless you for the Oxford comma.

&gt; The Canadian bacon and egg tasted good, and were tender, if not juicy. Actually, it dripped lava-like down my arm when I bit into it, which hints at having been microwaved.

Starbucks sandwiches are pre-made and typically warmed in an oven. Since this one is cooked in the packaging, it might be cooked differently, but... a lot of Starbucks don't have a microwave. Many of them don't even have *room* for a microwave. It was likely put in the oven.  My guess would be that the texture of the bread was such that it didn't catch the juices the way wheat bread might.

&gt; Also, it had that microwaved spoingy feel, which I dislike. As it cooled, the bread got fairly tough.

Isn't that typical of gluten-free bread that has been toasted and then cooled? My guess is that it gets a little bit steamed inside the special wrapping, but again - I haven't seen it in person at my store yet, so I need more information before I can know for sure.

&gt; I'll just have have to bring my own packet of honey mustard or something to liven it up a bit.

There are Sriracha packets available at the store. Or honey, if you're one of those weirdos that eats syrup or honey on your breakfast foods.

As always, I have to recommend being very careful anytime you eat at Starbucks. While many restaurants with gluten-free menus train their servers to understand and accommodate allergies, at Starbucks, we receive no special training on the subject other than an explanation of cross-contamination. Since the ovens rarely deal with nuts or most other major allergies, and since Starbucks has only recently started to give a shit about gluten, most partners don't quite understand what gluten is or how careful they have to be to avoid cross-contamination. A few weeks ago I came back from my break just in time to stop a woman with Celiac disease from being served our new egg bites, which are handled with and cooked on shared equipment. Most partners just don't understand, and honestly we rarely have the time to give things special treatment.

In short, just because the sandwich is labelled gluten-free doesn't mean that there wasn't some kind of incident during the cooking process. I strongly recommend checking the wrapper for any kind of breach whatsoever. If it's already open, send it back. We will make it right. If we don't, call 1-800-STARBUC and let somebody know.

People abuse the customer service line all the time. Please do not be shy about contacting Starbucks Customer Service with a *real issue*.

Side note: select Starbucks stores are now selling Goodie Girl Mint Slims, a nice GF alternative to Thin Mints. These are not a good bargain per ounce, compared to the price of WalMart boxes of the same. Even with my employee discount, it cost 64% more per ounce to buy the sleeve from Starbucks than the box from WalMart.",1491005313

It's obviously not going to resolve it. I think a solution comes in the form of wallets and services elegantly handling doing CPFP and fee bumping. But the block size itself can change the constant-factor cost of spamming the blockchain. If the blocksize was doubled, you'd expect it'd cost an attacker around 2 times as much (or the attack last half as long).

&gt; The bad actors can spam just as proportionally many 1 satoshi transactions with whateverblocksize you can come up with.

Well that doesn't affect normal users who will be paying more than that anyway. That is however is a good reason you don't want the blocksize too big, or it's too easy to fill with crap that needs to be stored forever.

&gt; On the other side of the coin, higher fees won't stop them either as they just won't pay those either.

I forget exactly what she joined for, but I think it was a super-exclusive research project. She was smart as shit - mostly, I'll come back to that - and got in. Then, a week after my friend moved out, everything fell apart.

Turns out that she had been cheating on her husband - LONG before they had gotten married - and kept doing it until he caught her. Last thing my friend heard, she was off the project, divorced, and potentially facing further consequences.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","Argument #1:

&gt; “To me, fighting surrogacy, it’s part of fighting the patriarchy,” Terragni said. “For thousands of years the patriarchy has tried to reduce women to livestock for reproduction, and this is a newer, more extreme form of it.”

This isn't even an argument, but just the invocation of emotion. It's just appealing to the idea the women will be exploited as nothing but child-bearers. But like I say, if well regulated, they won't be.

Argument #2:

&gt; Terragni explained that as a feminist activist she supports “the affirmation of feminine difference,” or the idea that women have a more central role in reproduction than men and that this primacy needs to be cherished and protected. “It’s something that the patriarchy has tried to take away from women, from the days of Aristotle, who described women’s wombs just as containers for semen.”

Plain anti-egalitarianism.

Argument #3 - your interpretation of argument #1:

&gt;She says she's against this because of a history of seeing women as wombs and not much else. That surrogacy is a step in that direction. It's a way of reducing women to 'livestock for reproduction'. This has nothing the do with regulation- it's a moral/societal argument.

1. How on earth do you reach ""reducing women to livestock for reproduction""? No one is rejecting their humanity. Seeking to utilise one ability someone has doesn't mean rejecting everything else a person is.
2. Like I said at the very beginning, anyone can play this game. Construction work is reducing men to nothing more than ""house-building machines""!",1491005317

Especially when you consider the tax advantage of negative gearing, the loss isn't as bad as you would expect. There's a lot of empty houses in sydney and Melbourne.

For us this means immolate, with a 18 second dot, can be double casted to place a 23 second dot. The triple conflag raises the damage by 25% each cast, multiplicatively. We want the dot to be longer so each conflag effects more dot ticks, AND we can fit more conflags into the immolate duration (I reach 5-7 conflag stacks frequently). 

I think it's also important to notice the benefits of immolate. Due to the crit trait and guldans fel relic having it, immolate for 890+ geared warlocks frequently has 60%+ crit.

The Reagan and Thatcher era of the 80's took this to a whole new level when neoliberalism began to rise. ""Wealthfare queens"" driving Mercedes while on food stamps was a common theme. It pushed the narrative of redistributing wealth not to the masses, but to the already wealthy to trickle down. I see the healthcare debate as another proxy of this.

Agreed. Exceptional numbers appears to be the crux of the tyranid's offensive strategy. Reducing the amount of foes the guardsmen face will even the playing field. Personally I always thought a Vauban fort employing modern materials and weaponry would be a good choice. Proper fortification positioning would eliminate blindspots and ensure the Nids stay below in a kill zone even when surrounding a defensive line. 
By the way, are the trenches manned in this scenario? 


&gt;Use a highly mobile task force of the most elite soldiers to respond to any that manage to get through.'

However, every Titan not named Ion, Scorch, or Northstar got shafted hard. Two of those don't rely so heavily on core and are about smart positioning and play, one of them (Ion) just pokes with a hitscan critlaser and the laser core is just the icing.

So you say I am trapped. It's an error this way and an error that way. Every way is an error. But it is a trap made out of the thinnest paper. It moves with me wherever I go. It has no shape.

At a glance, ""Maybe I'm doing it wrong"" might seem like some sort of serious concern. You can articulate it how you like. I'll fall into hell, or be reborn as a crow, or miss out on the great cosmic secret, or live my life in vain, or whatever. Let's just say it is a serious matter. There is nothing more serious!

But here I am, on the way to where I am going. If this is what the way to hell is like, this is what the way to hell is like. It was like this before, and it is still like this. I could not tell the difference before, and I cannot tell the difference now. If I knew any better, I could do better. But I don't!

No matter what I do, maybe I'm doing it wrong. Now maybe I'm doing it wrong. I try something different, maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm doing it wrong doesn't hold me back. It's always there like a good friend. Maybe I'm doing it wrong will be with me until the very last moment.

Não concordo, acho bastante mais fácil ganhar ao Sporting do que ao Porto, seja na Luz ou em Alvalade.

Se me dissesses isso no início do campeonato podia concordar, mas o Porto agora está a jogar a um nível bastante elevado.

O Sporting não está nada mau, mas comparado com o nível actual do Porto não chega perto na minha opinião.

Isto dito, também concordo que o jogo em Alvalade vai ser muito difícil, mas honestamente neste jogo com o Porto contentava-me com um empate, avaliando a forma como as duas equipas andam a jogar, o Porto está superior na minha opinião, um empate metia-nos sobre pressão o resto dos jogos, mas já mostramos em todas as épocas passadas que somos bons a aguentar a pressão na reta final do campeonato.",1491005331

Now that that joke everyone was gonna make is out of the way:

It really depends on what heroes you wanna get good at. If you wanna get good at hanzo/widow/mcrree, then get on a custom game, play against 6 hard ana bots on skirmish with headshots only. Eventually, you'll notice your aim will get WAY better.

If you're trying to get good at heroes that rely on prediction like Pharah, Genji and Zarya, you really need to just play a lot to know when to use your skills and on who to use them.

If you're trying to get good at Torb, I'd recommend playing more aggressively. Your gun does much more damage than the turret.

If you're trying to get good at heroes that rely on tracking try playing against bots that have double speed. If you can properly track a 200% speed Ana, you can track a normal speed one.",1491005332

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Some elderly people are fine, others need to be forcefully placed into homes away from the rest of society.

During high school, my best friend (W) lived outside of the city limits on a farm. His closest neighbor was a horrible elderly man who would use a pellet gun to shoot W.'s dogs, cows, and vehicles.

One day, W and I were outside helping W's father bring the cows in before hanging out. The elderly guy came over, tried to start a fight, and eventually ended up getting gored by a runaway bull who he would often shoot with said pellet gun. I still remember W's father telling us to go back to the house and call 911 as none of us had cell phones on us at this time as it was the mid-90's. 

W's father, a former military vet, said the following while W and I went back to the house thinking we were out of earshot; ""See you old asshole. This is karma for how you act to people. By the amount of blood that you're losing from that wound. The ambulance won't be able to save your mean ass.""

He was right, that old man died in W's field. According to W and his father, the elderly man's family wanted nothing to do with him and offered to sell the property for cheap to W's family. The reason for this was that the elderly man's last will informed his family to go fuck themselves and none of his inheritance was to be delivered to them except for his house that needed to be taken down as it was a safety nightmare and a small section of land it sat on from the huge acreage. The elderly man's family held a bonfire to celebrate his passing months later. Which the bonfire spread to the house due to an ""accident"". 

I remember asking W's father years ago before he passed away if the elderly neighbor said anything as he laid in the field bleeding out. 

""Autumn_Coffee, I've seen men die in honorable and not so honorable ways. I'll take it to my own grave what he said, but know that he was not honorable.""",1491005333

Something Dota2 does though that would be good for Paragon when ranked is out, is taking into account individual performance in a match to determine MMR gain and loss, so players can clearly see if they did poorly and exactly how poorly.

Valve noted something interesting in Dota2 that relates to Paragon atm, people's views of match making are highly correlated with their recent win rates, we get people posting about their losing streaks and then suddenly the subreddit is filled with 'pls fix matchmaking' threads.",1491005333

I do the laundry in my house, my wife's and daughter's leggings hang everywhere in the laundry room. I can't confirm or deny the buy-in, but as I see it the random patterns that a seller gets is actually smart. Start off with an in home party so new buyers can figure out their sizes. The follow up events are Facebook live or whatever, and your customers tune in to see what patterns the seller has. The random selection keeps the attention of buyers and allows multiple sellers to serve the same set of buyers. 

So to sum up what I know:
1. There will be tears if I wash and dry these things incorrectly.
2. I really like feeling up my wife's legs when she's wearing them. 
3. Their kids stuff is adorable.

And I will gladly say that I was hella wrong. This game blew me away. If this doesn't get PlayStation Game Of The Year, I will lose all faith in humanity. 

This is coming from someone who's an aspiring game designer. I find the overall animation, especially the facial animation, the best animation I've ever seen in a video game hands down! This has really set records. I can confidently predict that this game is one of the best if not the best game of the 8th generation.",1491005337

Curious for future projects is why I ask.  The Forge community is stoked to get maps in matchmaking - it's what keeps the fire burning for a lot of them.  However, the reaction you are having to the visual quality of the maps is the main reason we can't see widespread adoption - dropping the quality bar for a set of players isn't a tradeoff you can make too many times as a studio.

First off, Trump is a disaster for climate change.  There's a good chance the Paris deal will collapse now.  That took 20 years to do and several failed attempts.

Second, our position in the world is now weaker and will ultimately be much weaker.  We are allowing other nations to take the lead.  This isn't just an abstract concept, it will ultimately have effects on our economy and standard of living.  This is not reversible.

Third, Trump wants to build up our nuclear arsenals.  A new arms race won't be reversed; that genie, once out of the bottle, is very hard to put back in. 

Fourth, the Supreme Court will potentially be GOP majority for DECADES, and then they'll just shut down whatever progressive proposals you want, even if we have a democratic president/Congress.

Finally, domestically, we will spend the rest of our lives rebuilding what Trump dismantles.  If Hillary would have won, we'd be fighting for universal health care.  Now, we are simply fighting to save obamacare and medicare.  If those are dismantled, it will take YEARS to rebuild them.  Apply that to any other program, including welfare, and education grants/loans.

This presidency has the potential to set us back 50 years.  Its so much more than 4 bad years.  ",1491005340

"socialskills","t5_2r275","Oh god I do this too. It's so hard! The lacking critical thinking gets me, and so does the unfounded barely-considered opinions and beliefs. It's not like these are shitty people, it's just me being SO particular. It keeps so many friendships from happening. I even do it to my husband! The thing I try to do is remember how annoying I probably am in ways I'll never know, and that these people want to talk to ME, right? I also try to make myself be comfortable just being myself and being totally honest. For a long time, I thought I just had to go along with everyone else in social situations, and in that context their dumb ill-considered opinions really rankled me. Now if someone says something that sounds dumb and ill-considered to me, I'll just bluntly ask them why they think that. Usually in a joking fun way, because ultimately it doesn't REALLY matter, but I'm not pressuring myself to be like them while still being able to socialize and have fun with them. 

On a final note, this may sound dumb but I worked behind the bar at an improv theater for a long time and while I never had the slightest desire to do improv myself, the ""yes, and"" principle really helps in these situations. For those not familiar with it, it's the idea that if someone says ""the sky is green,"" the obvious thing to say is ""no it's not."" But that doesn't really lead the scene/conversation anywhere, so the technique is to say ""yes, and this acid rain is giving me split ends,"" and that gives them a springboard to build off of, etc (this example is not particularly funny, but you get the picture). For me it's been the difference between awkward conversations with people who maybe aren't perfect to more entertaining conversations where people's weirdness becomes kind of fun.",1491005342

"thinkpad","t5_2qvhj","Yes, I never run out of RAM. I keep Resource Monitor (Windows) running all the time and check on it regularly. Currently I'm using 7.5GB and have a basic Excel sheet running, 20 tabs of Chrome open, Quickbooks 2016 and a bunch of background processes. This is a typical load/RAM use for me. Been running like this for nearly a year and I've never had a problem. The small videos I have edited have been using about 12GB of RAM.

FYI, Windows (I don't know if this applies to Linux) loves to use the page file even when you have tons of free memory. The best answer I saw as why Windows does this was basically, ""...because Windows likes to save free memory for when it might need it."" But Windows never seemed to use that free RAM and instead would use the page file. This drove me nuts and would bog down the machine. It's much less of a bog down on an SSD, but still at times the machine would slow to a crawl because it was accessing the page file so much.

AFAIK, SSD lifetime has improved since the first generations, but a write is still a write which does reduce it's overall life.                           ",1491005342

**License/Non Driver ID/Suspension question**
&gt;Hey so here's the deal. My new job needs a valid ID for me to stay on the payroll. I need the document kind of quickly and my passport is expired as is my drivers license which is also suspended because of a bike ticket that didn't get paid a couple years ago. I got my job partly so I can pay stuff like this off and get back on track. One option is I can get a Non Driver ID card but I don't want to have to take a drivers test again which leads my to my question. If I get a non driver ID card will it void my license? Or can I have both at the same time and pay my to have my license renewed in the future? Any advice or options would be great thanks ",1491005343

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had one the year before my grandfather died.

When my grandfather first got sick, my family split into two camps: one that loved him and wanted to see him get better, and another that simply wanted him to die and to take every last cent he ever earned. In order to hurry up that process, they tormented and abused him. They manipulated my grandmother into signing over her power of attorney so that they had the legal high ground and control over his care. They immediately drained the funds intended for his medical needs and urged his caretakers to neglect him (and since his caretakers were working under the table and were lazy shits anyway, they did). We did everything we could to protect him, but every time we went to court, we lost. We even had videos of the abuse and their lawyer found a loophole to keep them from ever being shown and then the judge ordered us to ""respect my grandparent's privacy"" and not take photos or videos anymore.

My grandfather raised me. He was like a father to me and I was so helpless in the face of what was happening to him. The stress became so bad that I suffered a breakdown and I managed to completely destroy every single one of my friendships in one day. I was severely depressed and completely alone.

I was lucky. In order to keep my mind occupied, I started playing a lot of minecraft. I met my boyfriend on a server. We were close friends for years and then we were more. He was my saving grace during a very dark period in my life. I don't know what I would have done without him.",1491005343

This is not true. Several teams this year and last have had 20+ point leads against Warriors, and on several occasions the Warriors have come back to win. 

That's why people say that no lead is safe from the Warriors.

All it shows is that Warriors can lose their focus like any other team - they are human after all. But their main advantage that they have, and almost no one else does, is that they have the offensive fire power and energy to come back from large deficits.

Brazil had become part of the [United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Portugal,_Brazil_and_the_Algarves), after the Portuguese government had fled from Portugal when Napoleon invaded.

Pedro I was totally corrupt and incompetent. There's an anecdote that as he was boarding the ship to go back to Portugal someone came to ask him for a favor. ""Go fuck yourself, if you had stolen like the rest of us did you wouldn't be in need"", was the response.

Transport is as good as you get anywhere in Stockport, the 203 runs every 10 minutes during the day to Stockport and Manchester.  North Reddish station has trains to Manchester (and out to Marple) every half hour.

There is no Dominos but there are a ton of really good independent takeaways. We have Prima Stop. They are ten times better than Dominos. 

There's a good sized Morrisons supermarket right in the centre of Reddish, and a big Asda at the bottom near the Lancashire Hill roundabout. There are two banks at Houldworth Square (Lloyds and Nat West). The local Barclays closed a few months ago.

If you like pubs... meh. Use that 203 bus to take you somewhere else. 

Walking distance from the centre of Reddish is the Vale; a lovely country park with a river and plenty of space for walking, exercising dogs etc. Reddish is a really great area for dog owners; there are lots of places to go.

South Reddish looks a bit cleaner and less scruffy but it has far fewer shops and other amenities.

If you are of school age, do not go to Reddish Vale. It's shit. Biggest regret of my life is sending my daughter there.",1491005349

The thing is that her son behaves one way when she's around, and behaves completely different when he's with my dad (with my dad he is better behaved). Me and my dad are kinda strict, we set expectations and kids know not to mess with us. My sister and my mom are too lax, and kids know they can walk all over them. My sister divorced her husband, and her boy is growing up without a father figure, and without any kind of discipline. There's nobody around to teach him that there are limits, and she is not the type of person who can create a routine, so on top of that boy's unstable life circumstances, he is also lacking routine and it shows.

I just didn't want his wild behavior to rub on her. She's almost 3.5 now and so far we have not had any tantrums from her.

I was social again with more down to earth people, I was exercising and I actually became more efficient in school because of it. I finally realized the importance of having a meaningful occupation. I also decided to stop letting their stress and need to meet certain quantitative milestones get in the way of my qualitative life. This helped a lot. All in all, remember why you started OT school and know that life, especially when working with real patients as an OT will never be perfect or cater to a 4.0 lifestyle. Also, i carried the quote ""comparison is the thief of all joy"" in my head as well. This helped when I felt I was not doing as well as others.

Dat een partij/fractie een aanspreekpunt heeft voor de moderatoren is op zich een goede zaak. In het kader van dualisme is het goed dit los te koppelen van het partijleiderschap indien van toepassing, en dat mag best vastgelegd worden. Maar laat het hierbij, en leg geen verdere verantwoordelijkheden vast in de Grondwet. Laat partijen zichzelf intern organiseren. Sommige partijen kiezen voor volledige interne democratie, anderen juist voor centralisatie. Dat is leuk en ook in overeenstemming met IRL. Indien gewenst heeft een partij altijd de mogelijkheid om het een en ander vast te leggen in de partijstatuten. Procedures over royering/uit de fractie zetten horen hier bij. Geen statuten? De Sec-Gen beslist. Dat is al de huidige strekking van de GW.

Boek VI, wijziging C is trouwens overbodig, aangezien de oorspronkelijke tekst al toetsing aan de Grondwet als geheel voorschrijft. Specifieke artikelen/leden noemen (al is het maar ter verduidelijking) leidt tot het risico dat bij eventuele nieuwe relevante Grondwetswijzigingen vergeten wordt deze hier te vermelden.

#Rules:

### 1) This is a satirical subreddit
* **At the end of the day NMB is meant to be lighthearted and mildly satirical.** We all know karma doesn't actually matter in the real world and bamboozling online is not a serious crime. The fun of this subreddit is playing along. Witch-hunting or brigading other subreddits (even against the worst Bamboozlers) will never be tolerated. Please do your best to participate in the spirit of the subreddit. 

### 2) No low-effort content
* As much as we all enjoy memes, **this is not a subreddit for low effort content, making your own promises, or generally derailing the conversation from its goal.** If you want to post a meme about how lordtuts is Satan in the comments, that's fine, just don't make a post specifically for it. Pretty straightforward.

### 3) No social drama or politics
* Bamboozling transcends all boundaries. **We're not here to be divided by politics, hot button social issues, race, gender, etc.** Posts about any of those topics will be removed. As I've said previously, the key word for this sub is ""lighthearted."" We're here to be the bamboozle scribes of reddit. So don't be an idiot when it comes to this. Take your time and think before you post.

### 4) Keep it on Reddit
* **Promises referenced must specifically reference Reddit.** So for example if in an AMA someone made a promise to do something, a report could be filed, but if some celebrity or politician failed a promise outside of the reddit context it doesn't belong on here. With that being said, if someone on twitter says ""If a picture of this tweet gets 10,000 upvotes on Reddit I'll do x,"" that could be submitted here.

### 5) Be respectful
* **Respect one another.** NMB must stand together if we hope to have an impact. Infighting will only make us weak and vulnerable to bamboozling. Name calling, petty arguments, and nonsense like that will be deleted and repeated problems may result in a ban.

### 6) Don't report on yourself
* **This isn't a place for self-promotion.** Reporting on a promise you made in another subreddit, posting about a video you're uploading to YouTube where you fulfill a promise, or anything similar will get your post removed and likely strip you of your opportunity to make it into the [den](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMoreBamboozles/wiki/den). Message the moderators first if you're unclear about a post breaking this rule.

### 7) Have fun
* **NoMoreBamboozles (or NMB)** is a subreddit dedicated to keeping track of promises made concerning Reddit. Promises are written up in Bamboozle Reports and users are then held accountable! Once a promise has been resolved we induct them into one of our three Rooms of Remembrance. We take this stuff way too seriously and we love it.

---

#Rooms of Remembrance

###[Den of Deliverers](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMoreBamboozles/wiki/den)
* The best of them all. This Room belongs to those who have fulfilled promises perfectly.

###[Basement of Bamboozlers:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMoreBamboozles/wiki/basement)
* The worst of them all. This Room belongs to those who have Bamboozled us terribly.

###[Lounge of Loopholers](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMoreBamboozles/wiki/lounge)
* The most ho-hum of them all. This Room is for those who took the easy way out.

It's one of those things that you should be careful no to overdo (except for black) because once it's on there, you can't take it back off. Before applying dye, I always gently wipe the leather down with denatured alcohol. It helps prevent ""spots"" - fingerprints or oily spots that might resist the dye. I use a wool dauber to apply my dye, and I usually vary applying in a swirling motion for one session, and straight lines in the next. It's one of the many things that takes some practice to do well. 

To really analyze the color your leather has taken, it should be completely dry. That translates in the real world, to ""wait a day"". Once you've gotten some practice, you can often shave that down to ""wait several hours"" before applying dye again. Once you're happy with the color, you'll have to buff off the extra dye - scrap wool does nicely. Failing to remove the excess from the surface will almost always result in ""bleed off"". The pigments mix with your finish and inevitably rub off on your skin &amp; clothes, etc. The dying process is somewhat savage to the leather, drying it out. It's usually a good idea to apply neatsfoot oil to make the leather supple again. DON'T apply too much oil at once. Apply some, wait a day. Apply more, wait a day. Repeat until you're satisfied that the leather has the feel &amp; flexibility you want. You'll quickly find that everyone has their own way of doing things. As always, if you have scrap to spare, test on scrap pieces first. You don't want to experiment on a customer's piece. There is no one specific ""right way"" of doing things. Whatever achieves the results you're after is the right way. ",1491005362

Welcome to /r/Map_Porn! This subreddit is dedicated to the sharing, discussion, and appreciation of maps.

***

####Rules

Moderators will use their discretion in enforcing these rules:

* In the title, please include:
 * the resolution in [brackets] for an image or gif of a single map
 * [interactive] if the map is zoomable or responsive
 * [article] if the map is the centrepiece of an article
 * [album] if the link leads to a collection of maps
 * [OC] if the map was created by the posting user
 * some context (such as the location, cartographer, and date).

* Politically topical maps are allowed but agenda pushing must be avoided.

* All thematic maps must have a legend in the title or on the map.

* Discussions of all topics are encouraged. However, please stay civil and avoid jumping to provocative and derogative slurs.

***

####Guidelines 

* Please report any rule breakings you come across.

* Practice [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

***

####Link Flairs

Currently maps can be flaired by moderators into general and thematic categories. General maps are those which summarise the landscape (such as topographic and general reference maps) while thematic maps are those which have themes and effectively describe or comment on the landscape (such as climate maps and language maps). Simply put, a map that would be titled ""Map of India"" would most likely be a general map; however if it were titled ""Railroad Map of India"" then it would be a thematic map as its theme is to show railroads.

Users will have the option to flair their own maps as well as filter maps by flair once this becomes finalised and all current posts can be properly categorised.

***

####Our Pledge

The moderators of /r/Map_Porn are firmly committed to transparency in every moderation action that we take. To this end, we make these promises:

* Every post that we remove that is made by a legitimate user (i.e. not a spammer) will be accompanied by a comment saying why it was removed.

* Major rule changes will be discussed with the community.

* We will endeavor to answer any messeges sent to modmail and will not protest to any messages being made public.

***

####Related Subreddits

* /r/ImaginaryMaps - Your source for all fictional maps.

* /r/Geography - Places, spaces, maps and processes that shape the world.

* /r/Papertowns - Illustrated and detailed maps of towns.

*****
&gt; Tokyo - A Japanese whaling fleet returned to port Friday after an annual Antarctic hunt that killed more than 300 of the mammals as Tokyo pursues the programme in defiance of global criticism.

&gt; Japan also caught 333 minke whales in the previous season ending in 2016 after a one-year hiatus prompted by an ICJ ruling, which said the hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as science and ordered Tokyo to end it.

&gt; Under the International Whaling Commission, to which Japan is a signatory, there has been a moratorium on hunting whales since 1986.Tokyo exploits a loophole allowing whales to be killed for &amp;quot;Scientific research&amp;quot; and claims it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting.

This would let people continue to use rare and even uncommon items if they had perks or looked cool. Rares and legendaries have more perk columns and have more cooldown bonus so they would still be more desirable for the best op builds but rare and uncommon wouldn't be as insta-shard as they are today.

People say she's ""courageous"" and ""self-made"" and ""such feminist so wow"". Her father was a New York investment banker who moved to Nashville for the explicit purpose of buying controlling interest in a record label then signing her to it. All her songs are about how much she hates some dude or some other broad for something that happened with a dude. Every time she breaks up with someone or has some minor beef with another celebrity this army of undead white girls come screaming to her defense. That's not feminism, that's petty Mean Girl bullshit. Everyone says she writes all her own music. No she doesn't. When you hand someone a work-for-hire to write a song guess whose name gets on that song. Nobody gave a fuck about her until the big mean black man scared her. And she just stood there with that mentally handicapped aardvark face of hers like a dope. Before that she was on track to be another completely mediocre flash in the pan. If Kanye wasn't considered one of the biggest entitled assholes in the business that whole incident would have just disappeared and took her with it. Instead hack bloggers write think pieces dissecting her lyrics when Daft Punks lyrics are more enigmatic. I've taken shits more multi-faceted and rife with intrigue than her entire goddamn catalogue. She's legitimately like someone tried to Weird Science the ultimate White Girl Privilege Bot.

Also she looks like the fucking elk head from Evil Dead 2. Lifeless eyes just far enough apart to be unsettling and when she smiles it's so foreign and put upon it's downright animatronic. So i take it back; she's slightly *less* lifelike than the Evil Dead elk.",1491005366

Though the songs seem to have been specially arranged for this CD, so it doesn't always correlate exactly with what you hear on the Jukebox—it's not just a direct copy and paste, or just three tracks (like quiet/medium/dynamic) stitched together one right after another. 

For instance, there's a ""Crumbling Lies - Front"" and a ""Crumbling Lies - Back"" (vocal versions) that we can hear in separate MP3 tracks in Jukebox, which on CD seems to be mixed together here. 

On the whole, I would say it the tracks on the CD seem to favor the vocal versions of the tracks in the medium to dynamic range. Not saying that is entirely true (we get tracks like ""Wretched Weaponry - Quiet."" (Still vocal version). But seems to be the CD's preference include the vocals.

They also have some interesting omissions. Like in the ""Possessed by Disease/Birth of a Wish"" tracks, we only get the vocal chanting versions. We don't get the English or Japanese versions of the ""Become as Gods"" or ""This Cannot Continue"" versions that include the robot SFX.

Meanwhile, we get a track that seems to be unique to the CD and isn't on the Jukebox at all (Vague Hope - Spring Rain.)

It's definitely not a comprehensive CD. There's 46 tracks. Meanwhile, if we were to take each track item (quiet/medium/dynamic, etc). separately like we got out of the game (including Japanese/English versions of ""Become as Gods"" and all the Emil's Song variations and so on) we'd have over 145 separate tracks depending on how you separate and count.",1491005371

*****
&gt; Tokyo - A Japanese whaling fleet returned to port Friday after an annual Antarctic hunt that killed more than 300 of the mammals as Tokyo pursues the programme in defiance of global criticism.

&gt; Japan also caught 333 minke whales in the previous season ending in 2016 after a one-year hiatus prompted by an ICJ ruling, which said the hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as science and ordered Tokyo to end it.

&gt; Under the International Whaling Commission, to which Japan is a signatory, there has been a moratorium on hunting whales since 1986.Tokyo exploits a loophole allowing whales to be killed for &amp;quot;Scientific research&amp;quot; and claims it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting.

"UofT","t5_2rbaq","Reading this gave me nightmares of that situation since I was there. I was basically in a similar version of that situation since I had a life sci degree that was more of a biochem thing.

I went through every single item you listed and decided to go ahead with the ""why didn't I go into CS?"" thought, especially since bio is a lot harder than CS/math people believe it is, and don't understand how soul crushing mass memorizing tons of stuff can be.

I bailed after I finished my four year honours in desperate hope that I didn't make a mistake and I'm glad I did.

Plus the nice thing is it's probably easy for someone at UofT to just pick up the CS stuff, go into bioinformatics, and probably get hired in 2-3 years with a minor. MAT135/136 is out of the way, and _probably_ half of the degree is out of the way even.

Further someone who gets through and gets 3.5+ at UofT in bio easily has the work ethic to pick up proofs over the summer and sail through the post cutoff even if it is something dumb like 83%.

I am really curious how easy it would be for someone who did life sci to transition into CS, since all the person would need really is a semester or two to do 148/165. Only thing though is that a CS degree workload is still irritating and the person has to like programming to compete for PEY jobs and stuff, so it may not be a good decision.",1491005375

**We expect:**

* At least 5 years of documented experience working with Spark (Snake Protection And Recovery Kit™).
* Documented experience working with at least 10 different types of highly venomous snakes.
* At least 3 years of documented experience extracting venom from snakes.

It is an advantage but not required if you also know Java (where our central base of operations is) and Scala (Snake Catching And Luring Armor™).

You must also be able to demonstrate professional experience and capability with SOP (snake-oriented platforms) and related snake catching methods. You will also have to expect a great deal of traveling around the world to exciting locations such as Sri Lanka (which currently suffers from a high rate of snake-bite related deaths). We expect you to be open-minded and easy-going, approach work with a can-do attitude, and to be able to work well with a diverse set of people under potentially challenging conditions (such as when people are screaming in panic from frequently lethal snake bites). Finally, you must possess a Master's degree or a Ph.D. in biology, chemistry, or zoology from an accredited education institute.

**We offer:** A professional work environment with high excellence, fantastic spirit, great benefits (including, but not limited to, free treatment of snake bites), and a highly competitive wage. You will also get to see the world and a wide variety of very venomous snakes. You will also get the chance to help save lives by being a critical part of the development of snake venom cures.

(Note that we take no responsibility for any deaths caused by snake bites).

**About us:** SnakeCures4You is a world-renowned snake venom extraction and cure development research company with locations in various countries around the world such as Java. We have 20 years of international experience, and we are currently expanding our workforce due to continued growth in the snake extraction and snake venom cure market.

Gender is complicated but in my own case your logic is backwards. I grew up being disturbed by my genitals and horrified of the changes a male puberty brought. I figured out I was transgender not because I felt like I was a girl and wanted to be like other girls, but because my body was built and developing in a way that my brain was telling me was wrong.

I was 14 years old and googling how to stop my voice from dropping and my shoulders from broadening. I stumbled onto transition timelines and was excited because it meant there was some way to fix me through hormone therapy. All the other changes, like softening of skin, reduced body hair, breasts, different fat distribution, etc. sounded great and totally natural, like how it should have been, even though I'm pretty sure they would freak out most teenage boys.

Then it was like, oh, I guess that means I'm not really a teenage boy.",1491005377

Povs all felt good. No camera tilt! Yay!

I felt like this should make fans of lily's happy as it just goes down the list and checks off the boxes for just about every position we've seen in VR. Some really nice kissing as well.

The equivalent tech level of this setting is middle antiquity, jsyk. 

This dressing contains key pieces of Sosna Chonok's (1/9 regions) culture, such as the harvest sash. Others are identifiability helpers. 

Keepers might not know what other Keepers look like, but colours look the same no matter where you go; thus, the colours of each region were decided upon by the Keepers, Rirah, and Ayrtsriya long before Arova was born so that when the Keepers, Rirah, and Ayrtsriya met each season they'd know who was in charge of where. 

In daily life clothing is much simpler and less extravagant throughout all regions, but is still very colourful. 

Upperbirths follow most of the same customs as lowbirths, yes, but that's a whole separate post in and of itself. 

Harvest sashes are a cultural symbol throughout Chovrek, Zoldonmesk, Sosna Chonok, and Vodnya Morezod, as those regions handle a lot of agricultural needs.

The sort of dressing pictured is only used in ceremonial settings, such as a coronation or induction, a religious ceremony, or a festival. ",1491005383

"JusticeServed","t5_2vxxc","Yes, blacks do get get the raw end of the deal even when cops don't perceive their actions to be racist in any way. I've been homeless on the street (white male). What cops trigger on mostly is perceived socioeconomic status. Like when the cop attacked the nurse that tried to file a complaint:

[Nurse tells of doughnut shop argument and then arrest by SEPTA cop](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160324_Supervisor__SEPTA_cop_said___I_screwed_up_.html)

&gt;Retired SEPTA Police Sgt. Nathaniel Bentley testified that afterward, Ioven told him, ""I think I screwed up because I thought she was a homeless person but she was a regular person.""

The problems blacks have is that pretty much no matter how they dress or what they drive it's more likely to be viewed as the fruit from the underbelly of society. They tend to be perceived as lacking any social status regardless. Even when the officer absolutely believes their actions are in no way racist.

The alternative triggers tend to involve any mention of rights. They are extremely accustomed to the deference the courts gives them. Even treating their 'opinions' as though it was 'expert testimony,' no matter how silly. They can then claim reasonable suspicion under the totality of circumstances base off stupid stuff. Like driving too fast/slow/carefully, looking or not looking at the cop, being too nervous/not nervous enough, air freshener hanging from your rear view mirror, etc., etc., can all be found in case law where cops testified it was indicative of reasonable suspicion. And are usually successful in court with it.

*****
&gt; CBS News has learned that U.S. investigators are looking into whether Trump campaign representatives had a role in helping Russian intelligence as it carried out cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in March 2016.

&gt; Sources say investigators are probing whether an individual or individuals connected to the campaign intentionally or unwittingly helped the Russians breach Democratic Party targets.

&gt; According to a declassified intelligence assessment, it was in March when Russian hackers &amp;quot;Began cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election.&amp;quot; In May, U.S. officials say the Russians had stolen &amp;quot;Large volumes of data from the DNC.&amp;quot;.

In other words, he goes to do a cartwheel on a narrow board on a ravine.  

He rolls a 1.  This is a 5% chance of there being a problem which is reasonable.  

As he goes to cartwheel across the board the wind whips up and catches him, knocking him off balance.  

He rolls again.  Gets a 10.  rolling a 1 again would be a 1 in 400 chance (?)  or .25%.  This really allows the skill to be useful but still allows for an accident to occur.  

As he feels himself toppling over he grips the narrow board and swings all the way around the underside of the board. The board shifts slightly from the torque.  He swings himself up and lands on the board precariously and the board flexes and bounces underneath him.

Yes, I agree. So the reduction of projections from climate models tells you the previous set was running too hot, which was my thesis to begin with.

Yes. At the low end.

&gt;still show a significant warming of the earth.

I never said otherwise.

Let's go deeper into this (and I do hope you'll watch the video; his testimony is only a few minutes long). In AR4 the range given for ECS was 2.0-4.5°C with a best estimate of 3.0°C. In AR5 the bottom end shifted, so the new range was 1.5-4.5°C and no best estimate was given; however, several AR5 lead authors published a paper, Otto, et al 2013, where their best estimate for ECS was 2.0°C. In short, the projections were running too hot compared to observation, so the scientists felt the need to revise ECS down by a full third since AR4.",1491005396

This is not an argument against meat, just current methods of meat processing.

&gt; We are not natural omnivores but cultural omnivores by choice.

Bullshit.  This is seriously ridiculous.  Not sure where you came up with this but someone is straight up lying to you.

* [Sorry, vegans: Eating meat and cooking food is how humans got their big brains](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/sorry-vegans-eating-meat-and-cooking-food-is-how-humans-got-their-big-brains/2012/11/26/3d4d36de-326d-11e2-bb9b-288a310849ee_story.html?utm_term=.d5a09de23d63)
* [Our closest primate cousins are omnivores.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~stanford/chimphunt.html)

&gt; Just try ripping into a dead animal with your teeth if you don't believe me.

I eat raw fish plenty, not hard at all, additionally, humans have been cooking meat to eat since pre-history. This is not a ""cultural"" choice, it is a matter of evolution. 

&gt; Our digestive tract does not look or function like that of true omnivores, but rather does like that of herbivores (technically ""frugivores"", which humans are classified as). 

Also bullshit.

[Our digestive tract is not one of obligatory herbivores; our enzymes evolved to digest meat whose consumption aided higher encephalization and better physical growth. Cooperative hunting promoted the development of language and  socialization; the evolution of Old World societies was, to a significant extent, based on domestication of animals; in traditional societies, meat eating, more than the consumption of any other category of foodstuffs, has led to fascinating preferences, bans and diverse foodways; and modern Western agricultures are obviously heavily meat-oriented. ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-humans-eat-meat-excerpt/)

&gt; The arguments against eating meat are 1) morality, 2) health benefits which are becoming increasingly supported by science, 3) reduction of negative environmental im

1 is correct, 2 is not correct. Negative health consequences are not from meat, but how meat is produced.  and 3 is also a reuslt of methods of meat production, not from the actual consumption of meat.

And as far as morals go, your moral point of view is EXTREMELY narrow and not very well thought out.",1491005397

I have better luck with strangers than people close to me like friends and family. When I brought up about racial topics, to friends and family they tell me it's racist to talk about race. SMFH.  

The latest was a few days ago when I saw a guy at a postal place that owned by Chinese and operated by these two FOB Chinese females. The guy is a customer and he was wearing a tshirt with the ""Hollister"" logo on it. I got on my phone googled ""Hollister Racist Tshirt"" on Google Image and showed it to the guy. I explained why it's better to avoid Hollister and A&amp;F clothing. The guy is a Chinese FOB and didn't really care too much. However, the two Chinese females worked there was very receptive. I explained the photos, why it is racist, and why we should try to avoid those brands. The young Chinese female said ""wow, the reason Chinese people buy it so much because Chinese people didn't know about it"". I went on to discussed about other topics like American television portrayal of Asians men. In fact, the young Chinese female was the one who brought up about the disparity between WMAF vs AMWF.    

Another time I randomly chatted up with these two Asian guys. We had a long discussion about the issues.  I think they walked away a little more awared.

Last week, I sat next to a Chinese couple with 3 young children (2, 5, 7ish) and they were speaking English to their kids. One of the baby like around 2-3 years old was watching cartoon on the phone in English. I googled and pulled up the article ""TV can boost self-esteem of white boys, study says"" and asked them if whether they have read this article. Then I went on into racial identity, self-esteem, and television portrayal. The mother said ""wow, I kind of feel something there about the whole racial issue but I couldn't put my fingers on it."" The mother asked me for suggestions I said it's okay for the kids to watch kids stuff but for the older one it's better to let them watch Chinese media. Both of them nodded and agreed. Once I brought it up, it was like a light bulb turn on in the heads. 

I think with family it is harder to convince them about these issues because it is something that I never talked to my family before. Personally, I think it better to just be the role model like react to racist stuff that you see on TV in front of them or just be a really bad ass Asian dude. Your family members, especially the young ones will pick that up and emulate that. ",1491005398

&gt; CBS News has learned that U.S. investigators are looking into whether Trump campaign representatives had a role in helping Russian intelligence as it carried out cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in March 2016.

&gt; Sources say investigators are probing whether an individual or individuals connected to the campaign intentionally or unwittingly helped the Russians breach Democratic Party targets.

&gt; According to a declassified intelligence assessment, it was in March when Russian hackers &amp;quot;Began cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election.&amp;quot; In May, U.S. officials say the Russians had stolen &amp;quot;Large volumes of data from the DNC.&amp;quot;.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","Oh sure. I guess what I mean is that it's one thing to refuse to keep pursuing a missing person case because you've decided they are runaways. It's horrible when they do that, but you usually see a path of least resistance. They close the case. The file ends up stuffed in a back room somewhere. But taking their names out of the database is NOT the path of least resistance, especially considering their files have disappeared. It requires someone to expend time and effort to remove them. And allowing their names to remain there would have required less action. Which is why I wonder if it's more than institutional apathy in this instance. Burying a case is one thing. The entire case seems to have disappeared, and that requires positive action on the part of *someone*.

That said, I have never ever understood the logic behind, ""Well, they're runaways, so we aren't going to pursue this."" A missing minor is a missing minor. A kid that ran away from home is every bit as endangered as a kid that disappeared through other means. Can you imagine the police saying they refuse to look for Asha Degree, because she left the house willingly? But that was standard procedure for most of our nation's history. It was never a good excuse for police to refuse to look for kids in the first place. You go find the kid. The same attitude sometimes happens with mental illness. Just because someone was mentally ill, it doesn't follow that they disappeared with no violence visited upon them. People who commit violent crimes of opportunity look for vulnerable people, and kids and mentally ill people are obviously vulnerable.",1491005402

Though I notice that some of the critiques involve mid-fights, which is only a problem with 5CP. As I've said (and have seen from other players), 5CP is a fundamentally flawed game mode mainly due to mid and last points. You've probably heard this opinion already.

So for some of these, specifically the things that make Heavy able to be run full-time, I'm wondering if the reason they are banned is solely due to 5CP being the most prominent game mode.

Also, can you share your opinion on jarate, backup, LnL, and Quickie please? I'd like to know what problems you have with these.

One last thing.

&gt; The best sniper rifle in the game. Jarate is a death sentence, and the increased charge rate on bodyshots gives the sniper significantly higher damage output for no real skill investment.

Is Jarate a death sentence specifically because of the lack of damage falloff you talked about at the start? Is that your main problem with Jarate, or is it more than that?",1491005402

You can try going around 3,000 calories for a while and see what your weight looks like after a week or two. You can make adjustment after that, but don't go to crazy calories deficit! 500-1,000 is usually recommended. Obviously, if you're planning to lose a lot of weight, your TDEE will get lower, so you'll have to adjust again after a while.

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","I am genuinily happy to see that we agree that no one should be gunned down in the street for stealing some cigars at a gas station. Yes, it does matter though that he did that. The blurry part for me, on that point, is there did seem to be disagreement with the PD as to whether or not the officer knew Brown had actually assaulted the gas station clerk that night or not. That is important IMO. If the cop  stopped his patrol vehicle to confront Brown for being in the street and did NOT know about the situation at the store then that furthers my point that this kid wasn't really doing anything other than walking in the street. Which, while annoying, and perhaps rude, is not worthy of being gunned down and killed.

I don't know if Michael Brown tried to grab Wilson's gun. Do you? The officer made that claim, maybe evidence shows that was the case, I am not arguing that didn't happen. But we don't know and honestly I am not so sure the police officer was telling the truth there. He might have been covering his ass. I certainly would if I were him.

So lets, so we start the conversation at ""Michael Brown grabbed the officers gun."" In that case, if the officer was in danger, then I would not blame him for defending himself. I am not going to just sit here and act like the kid was justified in shooting the officer either. I don't actually support violence towards police either. Let's make sure that is clear.

But if that is where the conversation starts and end, ""he grabbed his gun""... then that is an easy discussion to have. Case closed.

Unfortunately for me it's about more than that. I don't recall the OP so maybe the bigger picture discussion is off topic.

How on earth did a kid walking down the street turn into a kid grabbing a cops gun? Where did the cop come from and why would the kid just want to go there? Did he want suicide by cop? Or was he just walking home, or wherever. That community was dealing with an epidemic of being extorted by their city. I don't blame the police at all actually. They were just doing their job.

While it's a small sample size overall (I'm a little skeptic of taking it as gospel when we're talking a sample of like 1-5 people and then trying to broadly apply this to the entire population), it still fascinates me that a relative-to-the-sample-size decent chunk of trans women went from solely attracted to men to being bisexual or lesbians.",1491005403

True, he gains those powers in the DLC as game mechanics, but I was looking at it more in a broader sense of the canon of what he actually takes from the trial back to his journey with Noctis. In other words, the blade and the scar are the proof he brings back, while the passing of the trial in general is what he brings back for himself. His faith in himself is now (mostly) unshakeable, and he's able to continue his quest and help Noctis fulfill his destiny.

I got a job in a shoe warehouse, and was lucky enough to find something I really enjoyed doing.

I worked there for a couple of years, bounced around for a couple more, then got a job at a grocery warehouse where I worked for 18 years, moving up into management. 

One divorce, a new wife, two more kids, and a few job changes, always in the same field, and I'm the Distribution Center Manager for the largest privately held promotional product company in the U.S., have a great family, bought a house, and am moderately successful at all of it.

I consider myself very lucky. I got where I am by working harder and longer than my peers and having a good deal of natural intelligence.

You made the comparison, I explained why it was objectively wrong. To clarify, neither terrorists nor Jews are subhuman, because being either of those things doesn't change your species. A fetus (assuming its parents are human) is a human fetus, not a subhuman fetus. The word subhuman is used to demean a human target, but objectively the target is just as human as their attacker.

If your poor pick isn't helping the team, they can damn well report you for it. If you're picking Torb on attack on Hanamura and you have 0 kills, no medal in damage, and no armor given and NEVER switch, you have contributed nothing and deserve to be reported/banned in competitive mode. You have no helped to complete objectives at all.

If you pick Torb on attack but set up a perfectly placed turret to pick off the enemy trying to get back to point A to stop your team's capture, you are 100% contributing to the team. Pretty obvious when someone should be reported and/or banned. ",1491005407

*****
&gt; CBS News has learned that U.S. investigators are looking into whether Trump campaign representatives had a role in helping Russian intelligence as it carried out cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in March 2016.

&gt; Sources say investigators are probing whether an individual or individuals connected to the campaign intentionally or unwittingly helped the Russians breach Democratic Party targets.

&gt; According to a declassified intelligence assessment, it was in March when Russian hackers &amp;quot;Began cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election.&amp;quot; In May, U.S. officials say the Russians had stolen &amp;quot;Large volumes of data from the DNC.&amp;quot;.

"CannabisExtracts","t5_2r341","Here's how I've gotten the best results:

1. Use 99% ISO 

2.Freeze everything. Take an empty freezer, put your trim in large mason jars about 1/3rd full, put a pack of non-bleached coffee filters in there and your wire mesh [strainer](https://www.amazon.com/LiveFresh-Premium-Stainless-Strainer-Straining/dp/B00XGL85HK/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491002887&amp;sr=8-19&amp;keywords=wire+mesh+strainer) and about 10 short wide mouth mason jars with their lids. 

3. Be Patient, wait a day for everything to really freeze. 

4. Put on latex gloves and then a pair of cloth gloves. The latex is for the iso, the cloth is to insulate the jars from the heat coming off your hands. 

5.Pour the ISO into the trim jars until the jars are 1/2 full

6. Shake for 30 seconds

7. Pour out the whole thing into another mason jar just with the wire strainer at first. 

8. Pre-make like 6 short wide mouth mason jars with coffee filters: take out he disc in the lid and make a basin in the coffee filter with one hand and screw the outside of the lid on with your other hand. 

9. Run the strained iso into the coffee filters, move from one to the next when your coffee filter basin fills up, you can move quick in between and then come back around because the first one was draining when you were filling up the other 5. You want to move quick to minimize heat transfer from your hands into the jars. 

10. Pour all the one-time filtered iso into one jar, repeat step 9. I've found that I don't get much if I do it 3 times so I only do it twice, but you can go 3 and get a little bit more shit out of there. 

11. Make a water bath with 2 pyrex dishes. Float one in water, then pour your strained ISO into that. Put this on an electric skillet next to a window. Face a fan toward the window so all your evaporating iso blows outside. 

12. While the oil is still a liquid, transfer it to parchment paper (someone correct me if it's wax paper) 

13. get out a heat gun and blow the liquid around the paper until you see it start to boil. That initial boiling is the iso coming out, but immediately after that the thc starts to vaporize. You should barely smell the smell of vaped weed. 

14.use a razor blade or other scraping tools to move around the wax and purge it

15. set it on a metal surface, like a washing machine, and use a dabbing tool to roll your qwiso off the partment paper. 

I've gotten great pull-and-snap oil out of this method, and if you overdo the heat gun you can get straight shatter.

So now, it is their base of operations. It let into them being the leaders of the town, etc etc etc but they have this manor (think Downton Abbey) with a staff and the townsfolk look up to them as heroes and patrons and it's a big thing for them.

As for the ""what else could have happened"" example, this is definitely a topic worthy of its own discussion. 

Have you ever seen players in Hearthstone who had lethal in hand, but then choose to lethal using the card they topdecked instead in an attempt to tilt the opponent? The opponent yells ""STUPID LUCKY TOPDECK!!"" and rages. It's a mind-game that works extremely well against certain types of players who focus most heavily on the information directly in front of them without necessarily considering the spectrum of things like, ""Well he did have 4 cards in hand and there were 12 cards still in his deck I lose to anyhow...""

Meltdown can be an example of this in some cases... But even in your example, if Meltdown hits face for lethal when you have 10 minions on the board and win next turn guaranteed, there might be a little sting there. :)

And I can guarantee if a world championship ended with a scenario like that, you'd witness an impressive range of emotions from both players and spectators alike!",1491005414

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I don't think ""you're going to lose, just go with it"" adds any value.  It's not ""difficult advice"", it's simply bad.  

Actual useful advice: preparing and filing first is an advantage.  Having time to document your parental responsibilities when you aren't under stress makes a huge difference.  You can also make changes if you don't think you ""look good on paper"" in that respect.  

Other good advice: therapy can help.  If you describe your partner's behavior to a professional, they might have insight you lack.  My ex was displaying classic symptoms of borderline personality disorder.  I didn't understand that, nor did my lawyer nor the guardian ad litem.  Lawyers lawyer, they aren't interested in psychological stuff unless you bring documentation to them.  

Other advice: guys want to ""put it behind them"" and often end up leaving too much on the table to get things over with.  Lawyers rarely discourage this, they side with the court (who just want you off the docket).  In general, lawyers won't tell you what you don't ask.  Impossible to enforce rules in a final decree?  They just nod, they don't care.
