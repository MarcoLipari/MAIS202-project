Check out the [ASEE fellowship site](http://www.asee.org/fellowship-programs/graduate) and look into the SMART and NDSEG fellowships. SMART has a year for year work requirement at a government lab after college, NDSEG has no work requirement but is harder to get.

Most professors also hire graduate student research assistants (GSRAs) that they will pay for, both with a stipend and for tuition. If you are GSRA, your research/thesis topic will typically have to be in line with a professor's research area, and likely for a specific grant that they have written. If you hook up with a professor early, they can also write a grant ahead of time and try to secure funding for you before you start grad school.

A lot of the larger schools will also have other departmental funding opportunities to get you through your first year, or if your fellowship doesn't go long enough.","1341100805"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Maybe it is a little bit of the 4chan rules. But I think it actually goes a little bit deeper.

Note: I may be making some generalizations here, but you get the point.

Before the days of Facebook, Twitter, 4G connections and high speed internet (before it was all that popular outside of commercial use) most personal internet users were geeky and nerdy. They enjoyed computers for a lot of the same reasons we do, freedom to be ourselves, anonymity, expression and acceptance from peers. Think of some of the first BBS, forums and IRCs. When you think of users for those sites, you think of sweaty, greasy basement dwellers. We've all seen the stereotype in movies (e.g. Dennis Nedry of Jurassic Park). Part of what drew some of these types of people to the internet was the fact that they WEREN'T popular. They were ""socially awkward"". For them, using the computer was a form of ""escape"" or a way to connect with like-minded people from all over the world.

Nowadays, we have a way of forgetting the social stigma that was attached to being-into-computers. I believe that this social stigma is partially behind why certain internet users feel afraid to express their interest in such sites as Reddit, 4chan, tumblr etc. At the time, you didn't want people knowing you were some sort of computer nerd. It wouldn't have been worth the extra social stigma in real life.

But it mostly presents itself in older users, people from the days of Somethingawful, Slashdot, BBS, IRCs etc. To these people, the internet was ""theirs"". It was for the computer geeks, the internet nerds. I would go so far as to say they feel like most mainstream users and encroaching on ""their territory"". Enternal September comes to mind, but that's a wholly different discussion.

Let's visit 4Chan's infamous rules 1 and 2. Your personal stance on them only existing for raids, or being impermeable laws or that they don't really exist notwithstanding; they do provide that insight into not wanting other people to know about ""their site"". We've all seen the infamous pissing contests between ""oldfags"" and ""newfags"" on the site. It boils down to the fact that based upon how long you've been at the site the more entitled you are to it. People look down on new users oftentimes because they don't read the rules, use poor grammar, don't conform to the norms, etc. So site users would oftentimes not want additional people coming to their site for those reasons. Vaguely reminiscent of ""hipster-ism"". ""I was using this site before it was cool"" -Internet Hipster.

But let's not forget how the internet has exploded in the past few decades. From 16 million in 1995 to 361 million users in 2000 to 938 million in 2005 to over 2.2 billion users today. And these new users AREN'T the geeky nerdy types. You've got the 12 year old on an iPad to Grandpa Joe using his Windows 98 machine. All these new users don't know the rules, they aren't the nerdy types. Longtime users may feel a bit ""encroached"" upon.

To some it up as best I can; longtime users are subconsciously or consciously trying to avoid social stigma of internet use or feel like the internet is entitled to them.

TL;DR Awkward internet hipster nerds butt-hurt over too many new users.","1341100811"

*minor spoilers ahead* As for where, I recommend starting where I started, ""Spearhead from Space"" The Third Doctor's first story. It's a unique time in Doctor Who because The Doctor is stuck on Earth for quite awhile starting from this episode. Plus The Master shows up for the first time early in his run. The reason I don't recommend starting at the very beginning is because a lot of episodes from the First and Second Doctors are missing. Do check out the first episode ""An Unearthly Child"" though.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","After getting in line to put all of my stuff through the scanner conveyor belt, they pulled me out of line to go through the evil, dreaded ""see-you-naked"" scanner. They told me to just leave my things there to be scanned.

Had to stand in a line to get wand-searched, then had to stand in line to go through said dreaded scanner. Then had to wait after that to be patted down. 

By the time I was back to the end of the conveyor belt, where my poor backpack had been waiting for about 15 minutes, the laptop was nowhere to be found. 

I told them it was gone, and asked them to help me find it. Nope. Not a chance. Just a blank stare. 

I started looking around. My brothers and my mom were looking too. Then I realized it had been stolen. It was nowhere to be found. 

I threw a FIT. I am not one to raise my voice, or cause a ruckus, and usually I just let everything slide. But this was different. Because they had to be ridiculous with their dumb old scanner, my laptop had been stolen. So I started demanding they find it, or they were going to buy me a new one. 

Then, probably because of my state of hysteria, they pulled me to the side, and told me they were now going to have to search my bags because I was causing a scene. So I had to stand there and wait while they went through every single pocket, while my laptop thief was surely long gone. 

As this is going on, my mom is calling my dad very concerned because I'm so upset, and they've never seen me like that (haha). My brother starts looking for it. 

He found it at another TSA conveyor belt station like 5 stations down. There were only 2 open, and the other 2-3 were shut down. It had been taken and stowed in a drawer there by itself. He opened the drawer and found it, and came back with it. 

CLEARLY, TSA tried to steal my laptop while I was playing scanner-puppet. ","1341100818"

&gt;Stuart cited, against that Obama allegation, Glenn Kessler, “The Fact Checker,” at the Washington Post, who, on 25 May 2012, said that, “Under Obama, ... federal spending as a percentage of the U.S. economy ... has hit highs not seen since the end of World War II,” partly as “the result of a sustained higher level of spending.”
But this statement was itself silly: How could these “highs” be anything else than a “higher level of spending”? That’s what they were, if they existed at all (which they did). So, they weren’t “the result” of those “highs,” such as Kessler said, they were those highs. Then, Kessler tried to seem like the phony objective “On the one hand, ... but on the other hand” type of person, by his saying, “Part of this, of course, is a consequence of the recession,” which was itself outright false: It was instead a response to the “recession.” For example, in Europe, spending is being cut while the depression rolls on. Their response to the depression is “austerity,” not spending (such as with Obama). An economic depression does not cause government spending to go up; that can – and there it does – go down. **So, yet again, “The Fact Checker” was simply false.**

What the hell does this mean?? How has the author demonstrated that the fact checker is false about the statement that spending as a percentage of the economy is very very high in the Obama administration.

The author seems to simply quibble with how the fact checker phrased it.  After demolishing the phrasing, the author asserts that the fact checker is wrong.  Help me out here guys, is this just really bad writing or should I go ahead and enroll in a reading comprehension course?

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;if you are certain that the world will not end one day (which I would find very scary), one may expect that Evolution, science, philosophy, art etc. continue infinitely - isn't that great?

Actually, it's pretty much a certainty that the world will end one day. The Sun will expand in about 5 billion years and will vaporize Earth in the process. It's also not impossible that any number of human-caused events could kill us all or an asteroid could destroy all life.

&gt;Hitler's world view - including the racism - was based on religious teachings (e. g. that the Jews killed Jesus); he even considered Evolution theory as wrong (because it was backed by some Jewish scientists).

Hitler probably was a theist, but he was almost certainly not a Christian. His private correspondence and opinions were very anti-Christian, which makes sense because Christianity is based on Judaism. Further, Stalin, undoubtedly an atheist, tried to suppress information about evolution because he thought it was against the ideals of socialism.

&gt;Imagine, if we only had this life and no afterlife, would you not want to leave your children (or mankind in general) the best world possible? And would you not want other people to do the same? Would you not want to find out how the world works and tell others about your findings? Would you not treat people friendly so that they treat you friendly, too? Would you not try to live as healthy/happy as possible?

I've thought about the world and what it would be like if atheism were true. To shorten my answers to your questions, who cares? You'll be nothing after you're dead so what does it matter? I can see why you might be moral now, because there will be consequences that you'll have to face, but after your dead you can't feel shame or pride, joy or sorrow. Life is meaningless and even if we can give it our own meaning, that will all evaporate once we're dead. Humanity's existence is equally meaningless and could be considered one part of a strange array of coincidences that allowed life to form on Earth.","1341100832"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Freshman year of college, I had a roommate kicked out of school after just one month. Another roommate, Adam, had a ladyfriend staying overnight. Adam slept in the upper bed of a bunk bed so this woman was sleeping with him. During the night, our roommate stood on the adjacent dresser, sexually assaulted the woman as she slept and masturbated. The woman had been sleeping and thought Adam was doing it so she let it go for a bit.

When I woke up in the morning, my other roommates sat me down for a meeting and told me what happened. The cops were already called. Later in the day we found a note from our roommate saying he had been caught masturbating but wanted us to still be friends. When the cops talked to him, he confessed to the assault too. 

In the only act of any quickness I've seen from the university, he was moved out by that evening. I gave a statement and a cop gave me his number. Never saw that roommate again and heard nothing of the charges. I hope it ruined him, but he probably just moved back to Utah and nobody ever spoke of it.","1341100860"

I've just never heard anyone say this about the US. If anything, most people seem to say that in the US *not enough* people go to the doctor because they apparently can't afford it.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","They're discussing changing it, but a lot of people are against it - they claim it's part of what makes this country great. Kubrick lived here, in part because of the harsh copyright and libel laws. He used them to his advantage (He sued someone for quoting a single line of a conversation, and won). There's a tradition of harsh libel laws, which are sometimes almost comically harsh. Let me give you an example:
&gt;
&gt;A woman has written a book. She goes to publish and review copies are sent out. A reviewer reads it and he realizes, he knows the author and some of this sounds familiar. This man claims this character might be in part based upon him. *Might be*. *In part*. Her book has never been published.

Parody is 100% not covered in the UK. The libel law changing might, at the most, get parody included. Parody has been tested and lost time and time again. Right now it isn't included and a lot of people have a problem with that.

Shakespeare ripped off everyone. Greeks, Italians, the Welsh, the Irish, and more - but he borrowed mostly from antiquity. The argument doesn't hold up too well, because he was rewriting classical works, not contemporary fiction. Shakespeare didn't read Marlowe's Fautus, then take his characters and expand the fucking universe without telling him. Shakespeare was taking old poems, stories and myths and dramatizing them for a wide audience.  

I really am not comfortable at all with someone writing fanfiction about my work. I not only don't see any value in it - but I don't even understand the motivation. If you don't have a voice, then don't write. That's it. Do you know how many people I know who say ""I don't read much, but I love to write my own stories"" - Fanfic is what they write. I'm not kidding, they do. No matter your argument, Fanfic is the refuge of bad writers with no style or voice. 

The ""when your learning guitar, you don't play your own songs..."" argument is also rubbish. Fanfic is not helpful. You know what you should write about? Stuff that happened to you. Roman' a clef. Develop your own characters, using your life as a starting point. Not someone else's work, someone else's life. That's not fucking relevant to you. They're not you. You're not them. It's very easy to ape someone else's voice. Find your own voice. Fanfic is short hand for ""I can't be fucked to try on my own"".

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;The Byzantine state was exceedingly wealthy for the majority of its existence, how else would Justinian be able to launch campaigns in Spain, Italy, North Africa simultaneously?

Well the vast majority of the history of the Byzantine state is post-Justinian.  If you'd like, I'd revise the statement to state that the Byzantine state was flat broke for the majority of the time post-Justinian.

&gt;Looking solely at the reign of Heraclius and calling the Eastern Romans poor, is like claiming France was poor by only examining it during the Napoleonic wars.

Again, pretty much post 630, the Byznatine state was broke.  There were brief moments where this was not the case, but compared to their prior wealth or to the Roman period, the Byzantine state was broke.  Rich compared to some other places on the continent, but a shell of its former self.

&gt;Justinian was certainly not a western emperor, he ruled form Constantinople at a time when there hadn't been a western emperor for over 100 years, he spoke Latin as opposed to Greek( which I guess you could make the claim makes him more western then Eastern)

Well, Justinian thought of himself as a Western emperor.  His stated goal was the reconquest.  I mean, it's really semantics.  Justinian speaks Latin and ruled in Italy.  He's the last Roman emperor that you can say that about.  Pretty much after Justinian, all the Byzantines spoke Greek and ruled in the Balkans and Asia Minor.

&gt;As I already mentioned the Roman army was not a mercenary army prior to Heraclius ( although it did contain large numbers of foreign troops).

Okay, coming back to this.  I don't think you're quite right here.  Not just Ostrogorsky (who admittedly has been proven to be off a bit by later scholarship), but a number of other sources put Justinian's army as mostly mercenary.  J.B. Bury's *History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian I* concurs about the majority of mercenaries.

Procipius, by the way, lists Belisarius's force to re-take Rome as thus:
&gt;It comprised no more than 15,000 men, of which 10,000 infantry, about half Roman and half Foederati, and 5,000 cavalry, consisting of ca. 1,500 of Belisarius' own bucellarii, 3,000 Roman and foederati cavalry, and 600 Huns and 400 Heruli horse archers.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've had a guy do this to me!

He took me home from a mutual friend's party, both of us roaringly drunk and making out/dry humping on the hood of my car while we waited for a taxi, and (as I later learnt) my GGG mate whom I had slept with in the past had played wingman when he realised I wanted this guy. And by 'played wingman' I really mean that he told him straight up I was down to fuck and like it up the ass.

We get back to his place, I go to the bathroom and come back to find him (presumably) naked in bed. So, naturally, i strip like lightning and get in on top of him to find his shorts are still on. Ok, I can sort that out myself, cool. Make out for a bit, start to move south and he stops me. Ok, he wants to go first, what a gentleman! He goes down on me briefly, we make out, I try to go down on him and he stops me....

AND STARTS TO FUCKING CUDDLE.

So at this point I think, ok, this is a bit weird, but he's probably just too drunk to perform. That's cool, shit happens, let's see where he wants to go from here...

""so, uh, everything ok?""
""yeah, why?""
""uh... Are we gonna fuck, or are there some minor technical difficulties?""
""oh. Uh. No. Can we just cuddle?""
""Um. That's a bit weird. I barely know you, I'm naked, and I'm kinda confused about why you brought me home."" (yes, I find cuddling more intimate than sex, no, I don't have daddy issues. Deal with it, son)
""well I really like you. Can I take you out for breakfast in the morning? I don't sleep with people I've just taken home from a party..""
""oh. Um. No, sorry. A bit of warning would have been nice. I'm just gonna go, then.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My current gf was 'raped' by an ex (her best friend says the story went from consensual to regret to rape). Over last summer, she slept with a guy at a convention who was much older than her.

Now, since me and her didn't get together until about October, I didn't care. But when me and her had sex the first time, she told me I was her 'first consensual experience'. I asked her about that guy at he con, she denied it ever happening and it was a fake story she told me because she wanted attention from me because she liked me.

Move onto today, 9 months after we started dating, I got an anonymous email with images of chat logs between my gf and this guy. Proof that they slept together over the summer. I called her out on it, she still denied it. Eventually she broke down and admitted to it, but I was like ""You lied to me for 9 months making me think I was your first after your 'rape'. Why did you do that to me? Do you even know how much this hurt me?"" ""I'm sorry""

Bitch. Those words do not absolve you of your errors.


Moving on to the other contents of that email? Other logs. One of them showing that my current gf, not even 2 weeks after starting dating me, had feelings left for the guy. Also, the same day we had sex, she told him she fucked me out of pity (virgin) and that sex with me compared to him was terrible. And the nail in the coffin? Him inviting her over for pizza and stuff while his parents were away. She said ""We wouldn't eat pizza would we lol"" and then he suggested moving to MSN.

She had no saved logs.

I was also given her account email and password to look at this info first hand to prove it wasn't faked. All checked out. After me and my gf talked this all out and ended with her realizing that this is not at all acceptable? The logs were deleted by her. All of them.

Will I ever know if she actually cheated? Nope. Gave her benefit of doubt because she's been so damn sweet, but her best friend is looking into it in ways I couldn't hope to do.","1341100888"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The CPU tells the OS ""tell me what instruction is at program counter location X"". The OS and the BIOS get that instruction out of memory or from the hard disc and send it to the CPU. The CPU starts working on that instruction, increments its program counter, and tells the OS ""tell me what instruction is at program counter location X+1"". In general, it will keep incrementing the program counter, until it hits an instruction that creates a loop or a branch, and that will make it calculate the next program counter location differently....it may not just increment to the next one, it could loop backwards or jump somewhere else entirely.  
  
Of course, it's really more complicated than that. The CPU contains local memory called ""caches"" that may already have the next instructions, because it previously told the OS to give it a bunch of them, figuring it might need them soon.  CPUs are fiendishly complicated so that they can be very efficient. But everything they do is implemented by fairly simple circuit elements that are individually dumb.  
  
And of course the CPU is actually working on many programs, some simultaneously, and switching back and forth between others. The OS is just a program, but that program helps tell the CPU what other program it should run next.  So the CPU has multiple program counters, and when it runs out of available program counters it stores program counter contents in memory to retrieve them when it needs them again.","1341100901"

For instance, I almost exclusively Sunbro in the Burg. I like it. I like helping people. I play well with others.      

Some people don't like playing nicely with others. They like to cause pain, suffering and misery. They thrive on that. They send retarded messages to people who kill them. They invade for PvP action (rather than co-op).       

So to reiterate:    

People who ""play nice with others"" either sunbro or (try to) engage in honorable ""duels"".       

People who ""don't play nice"" engage in PvP to fuck people's shit up.

Well, first, the Doctor often can't save people, even people he dearly wishes he could save.  And he never brings them back.  So... yeah, the +1 is basically totally wrong.

The suspend power is *interesting*, and it emphasizes the Timelord aspect, but it's also not something the Doctor /does/.

And the Super-Karn?  Um.  This would be way more appropriate for Rose than for the Doctor, since one of these two people actually sort of more or less fragmented an alternate reality.

Re: Christos, Messiah Figure

Alright, *this* version of 'comes back when out of loyalty' is way better than the previous Doctor, and is almost enough to save the whole card on it's own :)

+1 Superfog is... a bit much, but I can dig it.  Especially since it can only be used on your turn.  Ironically, it means Jesus encourages you to attack wildly.  Not sure if that's intentional or not.

-3 Holy WTF.  Alright, Islandwalk is amusing in this context, but why is Jesus Super-Gideon?

-7: Man, that's a lot of text for 'You win the game'.

The main problem I see with this Jesus is, nothing about him screams *Jesus*.  He doesn't heal the sick (removing Poison or -1/-1 counters), he doesn't redeem, he doesn't teach.  The only thing that conveys his Jesus-ness is the 'if he would die, suspend 3 instead'.  Oh, and Islandwalk.

Wake up, your attitude is backwards. You're more than likely going to struggle and struggle and struggle. ITS FINE TO ASK FOR HELP. Okay? I know this subreddit is for neurotics, but you should know better!

You should seek help. Can you imagine if you actually have a chemical imbalance in your brain? You may end up fighting FOR YEARS against something you have no hope in beating successfully. It's best to get medical treatment for your disorder, they will help you accordingly.

ESPECIALLY now, if you're struggling now, it won't be all shits and giggles at the university. You will be under new stresses in a new environment with new people.

Just the thought of driving to work and having my car dying, the traffic lights going out, power going out, my watch, my walkman, and my cell phone dying all at the same instant is terrifying. When/if that happens; I know what happened, and then I'm in ""oh shit"" mode.

I'm used to worrying about having my ass evaporated by the USSR because I grew up in the age of the cold war, where multiple thousands of nuclear weapons would usher in doomsaday with a 45 miniute warning to get to shelter NOW. Not to where one 350 KT bomb detonated over Kansas at an altitude of 300 miles could knock out the entire western hemisphiere in 1 shot.

Imagine being the unlucky fuck riding the express elevator to his office that stops every 10th floor and you're on the 93rd floor. Unless you take your life into your own hands, and try to make it to safety, your fucked. Imagine being 7 miles above the earth and flyintg trans-contidental, amd all of the sudden your plane goes black while your sitting on the toilet and you start to fall out of the sky. Since no electricity is working, there is no water pressure. Fires rage out of control, and the fire department is overwhelmed. You can't call out trucks either. They don't even start. The city burns down, and there's nothing you can do about it. You cant even evacuate. The radio stations aren't working. Raging fires out of control for weeks on end. Millions of people forced from thier homes. They expect relief, but no relief is coming, because everywhere is like this. Approximatly 50,000 people are in the air at any given time. Imagine 5000 independntly raging fires, with no way at all to put them out. Fires rage out of control, and millions of people are rendered homeles, missing, or dead before the fire rampage is over.

Then you have the aftermath of hundreds of millions of people roaming the countryside in search of food, medicine, and other supplies, most of these people will be dead within the year from lack of essential medicinal services, and the absence of modern hygene. From our population of 340 million, it is expected that 300 million would be dead within the first year. We would be thrown back into the 17th century technology wise. Hundreds of millions of people would be dead, and for what? Because of a large international dick-waving contest. It doesn't seem worth it to me. We need to prevent this horrible outcome. EMP is the most horrifying thing that I can imagine happening. I almost wish for the old days of the soviet union, where only MAD was a concern. At least if they nuked us, we would hit them back. How are we going to hit back if they had 2 EMPs targeted to us, set to detonate 3 miniutes apart? The first one takes out the primary grid. We switch to backups for military, hospitals, and national security. A second one goes off, and takes out the backup systems.

Welcome to the stone age. Like the saying goes, ""most people are within 3 missed meals of complete anarchy.""

Previous examples where EMP effects have been observed:

Operation Starfish prime, (US nuclear test). Burnt out street lights, dimmed electicity in parts, and completly shut down other areas. Telephone lines melted, as did transformers.

Soviet Test 184 over Kazahstan, (Soviet Union), Burnt out electical lines, fried transformers, an electrical plant caught fire, underground telephone lines were fried. Phones rang because of the pulse. People who picked up the phone were electrocuted.

EMP is a very real phenomenon, and has been well documented. We now have EMP bombs, and we can make them non-nuclear.

As for Deryck Whibley trying and failing to write a punk album, I don't think it's ALL bad. I quite liked screaming bloody murder, and the album had a couple of other songs that were pretty okay in my opinion. But music is all relative, so it's probably fairly different for you.","1341100913"

John 14:29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.

2 Peter 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy...

2Pe 1:20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

2Pe 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

Revelation 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

Revelation 19:10 for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

Why do we believe? Why do we believe this strange and archaic book? Why not the Koran or why not the words of Buddha or why not all those New Age Occult books? Why not Thelema? Why not The Book of the Law which Aleister Crowley claimed was dictated to him by Satan himself? Why not the Satanic Bible by Anton LeVey? Why this strange book called the Bible? 

This is why I believe. I believe because of the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, especially those of Daniel chapter 2 and 7 and also the last phophecy of chapter 9. I believe because of archaeological evidence that had time and time again vindicated the Bible. All of the history of the Old and New Testament I believe to be true. I believe because true science supports the events of the Bible, including a world-wide flood. Because if there were a world-wide flood, what would we expect to find? We would expect to find billions of dead things, laid down by water, all over the earth. We would expect to see a chalk layer of calcium carbonate formed by dead marine life on every single continent in the world. And what do we find? Billions of dead things fossilized by water, all over the earth. And we find that chalk layer of dead marine life and it is the only layer that is present on every single continent on earth. And that can only mean one thing, that all the continents in the world were are one point, underwater. And we would expect to find monuments to such a disaster, like the Grand Canyon. What has been believed to have taken millions of years we have seen formed by floods in minutes, and hardened to rock in months. I believe because the devils also believe, and tremble, and have attacked God in the mystery and occult religions since ancient Egypt and since ancient Babylon. I believe because there have been people who have been involved in the occult who have come forward with what they have been through. I believe because of the deceptions and the evidence and proofs in the other religions of well-known ones and less known ones, such as Mormonism, which has great ties to Freemasonry, and Thelema of Aleister Crowley and Scientology of L. Ron Hubbard, two men who were close friends. I believe because of these strange and hidden truths. She is called **MYSTERY**, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. She is hidden in the occult and mystery religions. Throughout all of ancient Israel, time and time again, the children of Israel forgot the LORD their God, and went a whoring after other gods, such as Baal, and worshiped and lit incense to their gods and built their idols and altars in the groves of the forests. These ancient occult religions still exist today. I believe because of these strange and hidden truths which is there if only we would seek it. 

""And have no partnership with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of those things being done by them in secret."" - Ephesians 5:11,12

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","No one will read this but whatever, I'm drunk and want to rant about philosophy. this is a really subtle thing in the religion debate, and most people miss it, it's essentially the clock maker argument, sorry if this is long.

a)**aside**) I'm not convinced it is *terribly* fine tuned.  Simulations have been run(or so i've been told) varying the basic 4 forces and atoms have a tendency to go to hell at weird force constants.  But I've yet to have someone tell me, that we've tested *many* configurations, it may be that there are configurations weird to us that work perfectly well for life, and there are a lot of them, but I'll argue with out this for the next part, since it's mostly speculation.

b)**Suppose the universe is fine tuned**,  that is that this is one of the few configurations that works for life.  There are a lot of reasons that the universe could be the way it is.  God is just one of them.  Maybe we just got fucking lucky.  Maybe there was a previous universe with life that engineered this one.  Maybe there's infinitely many universes so there was bound to be one supporting life.  

Maybe I was an entity before the universe and I farted the right conditions because interuniversal Taco Bell has the right mix of molecules in their interuniversal 1/2 pound cheesy double beef burrito.

The point is there are infinitely many reasons the universe *could have* wound up the way it is.  God is just one of them.  If you find any other evidence other than ""we don't know why it happened, so it must be god""(or an intelligent design), then there should be discussion, but this question does not entail any of that evidence.

Circumstantial, i think you mean (IE completely rubbish. I can see auras you know? So can all my friends. Therefore auras exist). And yes, while it may give relief from schizophrenia, that does not mean it doesn't cause it

&gt;Correlation does not equal causation.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Such a fun assassin champ to play.  I love just being able to burst down enemy carries.  I rarely ever play him as my team usually has mid taken care of and he's pretty situational due to being a melee mage.  Fizz is a tricky champion to wrap your head around but once you learn how to use him...  Playing aggressively on fizz is extremely rewarding.  During laning you should be looking to kill your lane opponent whenever possible or pushing to their tower so you can gank another lane or secure objectives.  I like to level R&gt;E&gt;W&gt;Q as E gives you huge burst damage and wave clearing power.  When going in on an opponent usually a W+Q combo is the preferred method with E used for escaping or follow-up damage.  Though personally I sometimes hop onto them with E first the Q(W) through them or to a minion to escape.  If you hop right behind them you can dash the full distance of your q back towards your tower.  The damage on this combo is insane and will easily drop a squishy enemy by half health or more even during the early game.  His ult cam be tricky to land on moving opponents.  I find it best to use one of your gap closers first then ult them point blank to ensure it hits.  So usually my full burst combo is E&gt;AA&gt;R&gt;AA&gt;W&gt;AA/Q.  Sometimes you may not be able to AA between each of your skills but if you have sheen or lich bane, spacing out your auto attacks in this way maximizes your damage.  For runes I use mpen reds, hp/lvl yellows, flat MR blues, and flat AP quints.  A lot of players prefer the AP/level blues on fizz and they defnitely work well but I feel the MR is necessary to mitigate lane harass.  Movement speed quints are also a very viable alternative if you are against a skill shot champ so you can weave through the minions with your passive.  Though I find that with two gap closers MS isn't totally necessary and the flat AP goes great with his fantastic ratios.","1341100954"

They are completely aware of the US's complete air superiority. While f-22's are a giant waste of money, the US has still been investing in them for years because they are the dogfighters that keep any sort of foreign power from even considering aerial assaults on the US. Plus we have unmanned drones which we can and do make by the buttload. And, again, China doesn't want war. Maybe in 20-30 years, when oil is running a lot lower and is a lot pricier, if alternative energy investments haven't proved fruitful, but now? No way.

"india","t5_2qh1q","While Ayurveda originated pre-modern scientific methodology you might be suprised by its contriutions to modern medicine. For example the grandfather of modern surgery [Sushruta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita) wrote about plastic surgery like rhinoplast, cataract surgery, puncturing to release fluids in the abdomen, extraction of foreign elements, treatment of anal fistulas, setting fractures, amputations, cesarean sections and stitching of wounds, all in the 3rd century CE.  

As Ayurveda is over 5000 years old (the oldest continually practiced medicine in the world) as you can imagine much knowledge was learned by observation and trial and error. Regardless, when studied it holds up remarkably well as an evidence based medicine. Even if the evidence wasnt originally a double blind study. Also keep in mind that if you cant patent something, for example an herb, there is less financial resources to properly studying it. In any case you may want to do some more research on published studies before completely writing it off. I listed a few places below to get started.

All capitalism means is that companies compete with one another to earn your business.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'll do my best to explain this.  But if you get confused by any numbers, go straight to the bold conclusions.

Looking at budget numbers:
In 2000, we spent $1.79 trillion we got $2.03 trillion in taxes.  
In 2012, we are projected to spend $3.80 trillion and get $2.47 in taxes.  ([source](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf))

Said another way, **over 13 years, we're spending 112% more than we used to.  We're also only bringing in 22% more money now than we did in 2000.**

As a percentage of the economy: 
In 2000, our spending was 18.2% of the economy, and we taxed 20.6% of the economy.
In 2012, our spending is planned to be 24.4% of the economy, and taxes 15.8% of the economy.

Said another way, **over 13 years, spending has grown by 6.2% of the economy.  Taxes have shrunk by 4.8% of the economy.** 

As for what things were spent on, as a percentage of spending:

                      2000      2012
    Defense           16%       18.8%
    Medicare          12%       14.8% 
    Medicaid          6.6%      6.9%
    Social Security   22.9%     20.2%

Now remember, spending has shot up 112%.  Those four programs took up roughly three-fifths of our spending in 2000, and they take up roughly three-fifths of our spending in 2012.  Said another way, **these 4 programs have grown consistently as spending has grown.  All are at fault to blame for the rise in spending, some only slightly more than others.**

As for tax changes,

In 2001 and 2003, there were two rounds of Bush tax cuts.  In 2009, Obama pushed the stimulus, which cut taxes further, and those temporary tax cuts have still been continued until today. Those are the major changes in the tax code.  

To see these changes, look at taxes as a percentage of the economy:

                            2000   2002   2004   2006   2008   2010   2012
    % of economy            20.6%  17.6%  16.1%  18.2%  17.6%  15.1%  15.8%

You can see these numbers dip in response to new tax cuts.  You can also see them dip and rise according to the economy.  For example.   In 2000, taxes were high, and the economy was in a bubble state.  In 2004 they dropped after two Bush tax cuts.  In 2006 the economy was good, and tax money was back to historical averages.  By 2010, Obama's tax cut hit, plus the economy was bad.  

**Overall conclusion:  There is no single, easy thing to blame.  Spending has shot way up, taxes have gone way down (though not by as much as spending has shot up).  Major budget programs are all growing as spending is growing.  Also, it's also harder to compare a bubble year of 2000 to a recovery year like 2012.  (Incidentally, wars are blamed in the comments.  War spending as a percentage of the budget is surprisingly small.  During the worst years of Afghanistan and Iraq war spending, it contributed to roughly 5% of federal spending.  Today, it's much lower as Afghanistan is winding down and we aren't militarily in Iraq.)**","1341100977"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I know you claim you are trying to explain why homeschooling extremely harmful to kids and basically useless as far as education goes, but it sounds more like you are bragging about your academic accomplishments. So let me brag about mine.

I was homeschooled my whole life until I started taking college classes. In my high school years I was part of a teenage research program that taught me computer science and advanced college level math (discrete math) AND got me published in a scientific journal before I turned 18. I started community college full time at 16 after taking the High School exit exam. So I agree that most parents can't teach AP calc or AP physics, but a community college teacher can. Maybe unschooling students would object to that, but many homeschoolers I knew did the same. I didn't take the SAT. I didn't take any AP tests. So how did I get into a top 25 university you ask? I worked my butt off getting my GE and major classes done before applying as a physics major. I ended up switching to math and graduated a few years later with a degree in pure mathematics. To boot, I saved money by going to a community college. So despite your preconceived notions about homeschooling, it is quite possible to do well in that situation.

All that being said, I completely agree that there are problems with homeschooling. It is much harder get enough social interaction, but some parents do a great job at filling in those gaps in a variety of ways. It's also possible for the kids to have gaps in certain areas. But I work closely with the local school system which is in a well off area and home to two highly ranked high schools. Let me tell you that these students often have gaps in their knowledge as well, especially when it comes to math. Are there kids that take AP Calc BC in high school? Of course. As you said, brilliant minds will succeed anyway. But there are also tons of kids that are failing out of Algebra 2 in droves because the middle school teachers taught for tests and not for understanding. I'm not going to tell you that homeschool is without flaw. I've seen plenty of kids come out of homeschooling homes barely knowing algebra, but keep in mind that the same thing happens in publics school, even in nicer areas.

I forgive you for your ignorance and close-mindedness. But before you run your mouth next time, consider the possibility that you judged a whole slew of people prematurely and unfairly in a single post.","1341100985"

From reading your post there doesn't seem to be anything for you to feel bad about since you did nothing wrong. I don't think you fucked up, the onus is on your mother for not listening to and believing you - you haven't put either of them through anything. Stop over-reacting, go explain to your mother what you were doing, all you can do is try and make her see the truth. If that doesn't work then you've done all you can - I suspect due to the way you're handling this you don't misbehave or whatever and so she should believe that you wouldn't do something like this.","1341100985"

The govt doesn't 'save' that way. It would just be taking from churches and spending that money.

Yes. The people in your community are responsible for feeding them.

$71 billion at the federal level. http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/05/congress-mulls-cuts-to-food-stamps-program-amid-record-number-of-recipients/


&gt;Do you think getting rid of food stamps should be the #1 priority in saving money or getting new revenue?

Getting revenue. But not with higher taxes. And the govt ""saves"" nothing. it only takes. The only people that get to save are the people taxed less by the govt.

&gt;I want to know because my post was assuming that there would be better ways to save more money and with less negative side-effects (as i imagine them).

&gt;do you see a corresponding, if this is done, increase in crime and therefore police and jails and the money spent on them? if not - why not?


Well, since we have far more selfish Liberals that think charity is the govt's job and not theirs and other Liberals that think that the rich stole from them in some fashion and think they are entitled to the property of others, yeah, crime will probably increase. ","1341100986"

"Cartalk","t5_2s47e","The best way to go about this is probably getting all your generic tools first, for instance: 

* Breaker bar.
* Generic metric box set 1/4 3/8 &amp; 1/2 ratchets &amp; sockets &amp; some extentions.
* A generic set of metric wrenches (if you get a set of ratcheting ones have a set of standered open ended/box end ones too). 
* A set of line wrenches. 
* 2 or 3 sizes of vice grips. 
* 3/8 1/2 inch torque wrenches.
* Volt meter.
* Flat and philips screw drivers (of varying lengths and sizes), pliars.
* 2 or 3 pry bars in varrying sizes.
* Floor jack and set of 4 jack stands.

You may already posess a number of these tools.

The reason for getting a set of generic wrenches/ratchets instead of, lets say, Snapon is if you manage to break/loose one you can go out and get a whole other set of wrenches for less than the price of a snapon wrench, (Snapon does have a lifetime warrenty on their tools, but if its lost or stolen you are SOL)

After this get the tools you need for a specific job as they come. (pressure tester, ball joint popper, belt tentioner tools) Tools that have a specific job that you may never need unless you are doing that job.

Finaly, if you have decided that you realy enjoy working on your own cars you should get an air comressor, air tank, hoses and some air powered tools as you need/want them.

Now, if you find yourself getting older, lazier, or richer you can always get a hydrolic portable scizor lift. I don't have a picture of mine on hand but they basicaly lay flat on the ground, you drive a car over them, put the arms on the jack points and press a button on the hydrolic motor and it lifts the car up to about 3ft off the ground. They are nice for a standard garage. But not necissary in any sense.

Well, the razor came [with the wisteria handle](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/uh78n/feels_good_every_time/), used it for a couple months and then i figured there MUST be moisture collecting under the handle. Carefully then I removed the handle and there it was, slight brown spots that could develop to rust. 
I cleaned the razor with soap and toothpaste, gave it a good strop and looked like new again (bought this razor about 4 months ago, so it's fairly new).
I used it for sometime without the grip, but i wanted to see if i could get creative with it. Found some leather strips and thin rope and carefully rolled them to place.

My day-z group has about 8 people who help each other. We all look after eachother and make sure that everyone has what they need. That's the closest to society day-z will get. We've had a few people want to join, but we are afraid of the group getting too big. We're contemplating having another group started, so that our server will be friendly to us. Imagine having two or three tribes on a server that trade with eachother.

 The inherent problem here is that people will get bored--it is a game after all. My group is at the stage where we're preparing to obtain a chopper. We have most everything else. Society in Day-Z will not ever progress past tribal gatherers if there is no greater goal than survival. Once man's basic needs are met, he must move on to greater things. Like industry, or creation. 

Perhaps the game could have repairable buildings; factories, farms, radio stations, stuff like that. Points of importance that require great cooperation to control, and even greater benefit.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","**Walrus_arkark**  
Type - Human / Walrus  
Hp: 20  
Str: 15  
Vit: 14   
Int: 12   
Dex: 7 

  
*Special abilities:*  
**1-3500**: Walrus_arkark writes down a number between 1 and 3500. He then asks all enemy players to guess his number. No player may guess the same number so that team must share or discuss what numbers they're guessing. If no player guesses within 250 numbers of Walrus_arkark's number, Walrus_arkark restores +8 Hp and gains +4 Str and +2 Vit for 4 turns. If any player guesses his exact number or within 3 numbers of his exact number, Walrus_arkark must buy that player a copy of terraria. Use this only three times per game.

 

**Sleep down sheeple:** Flip a coin for each player on the enemy team. For every heads, that player can decide to either be affected with the sleep status effect, or lose 5 Hp and if any liquor is present that player must drink.

* **Sleep**: At the beginning of every affected player's turn, that player must flip a coin. If heads, they wake up. If tails, they skip their turn. Any damage caused to this player ends this status effect including damage done by teammates. 

**EDIT 405:** Walrus_arkark can summon the mystical and fabled Probydoby to magically inscribe the number ""405"" into the air infront of him. His turn is now ended. At the beginning of Walrus_arkark's next turn the number 0 in the inscribed 405 magically manifests itself as a small black hole, consuming the numbers 4 and 5 next to it. This affects the entire universe, removing any player with 4 or 5 Hp from the game. Use this only twice per game and only after 10 turns have passed.


*Passive Abilities:*   
**thanks for the response guys!:** Whenever an enemy player says a number, Walrus_arkark may choose to gain +1 to the stat of his choice (other than Hp). This bonus lasts 3 turns and is stackable. Players may still spell numbers without triggering this ability. 

 

*Ruler of the ebony tusk empires, Walrus_arkark was a tyrant who was hated by many but feared by so many more. He adored to see his slaves prone around like rodents for croutons. Or cultured milk or something. Everyone who dared to follow his mighty fist was known for having no self respect, and being so pathetic. Rumors have been spread around that he has risen once again and is on the way to building another blubbery army of death.*","1341101019"

Upgrade or replacement is fine as long as you have the money. Something you can do is simply buy another motherboard and case. Since your CPU uses an AM3 socket you can easily upgrade to upcoming and current AMD CPUs and use a modern Mother Board. Doing this you can transplant all the other components from your current rig and save money.

Marxism thinks there needs to be a state to get everything started (Marxists, please correct me if this is inaccurate).

Anarchists fear a state may never give back control once it has it and it doesn't think it will effectively take care of people's needs because starting everything up again is more difficult from the top-down rather than just allowing people see to their own and each other's needs from the bottom up.

[The Conquest of Bread](http://libcom.org/library/the-conquest-of-bread-peter-kropotkin) is Peter Kropotkin's vision of how a communist revolution must take place.

I suggest reading chapter 5 to answer your question (better yet, read the whole thing). The whole book is very interesting. He criticizes past revolutions and suggest how best to correct their mistakes. I think this makes his book timeless. He watched revolutions fail and shares what he learned with us.

Here is a quote from that chapter:

&gt;And if the impetus of the people is strong enough, affairs will take a very different turn. Instead of plundering the bakers' shops one day, and starving the next, the people of the insurgent cities will take possession of the warehouses, the cattle markets,--in fact of all the provision stores and of all the food to be had. The well-intentioned citizens, men and women both, will form themselves into bands of volunteers and address themselves to the task of making a rough general inventory of the contents, of each shop and warehouse. In twenty-four hours the revolted town or district will know what Paris has not found out yet, in spite of its statistical committees, and what it never did find out during the siege--the quantity of provisions it contains. In forty-eight hours millions of copies will be printed of the tables giving a sufficiently exact account of the available food, the places where it is stored, and the means of distribution.

&gt;In every block of houses, in every street, in every town ward, bands of volunteers will have been organized. These commissariat volunteers will work in unison and keep in touch with each other. If only the Jacobin bayonets do not get in the way; if only the self-styled ""scientific"" theorists do not thrust themselves in to darken counsel! Or rather let then expound their muddle-headed theories as much as they like, provided they have no authority, no power! And that admirable spirit of organization inherent in the people, above all in every social grade of the French nation,2 but which they have so seldom been allowed to exercise, will initiate, even in so huge a city as Paris, and in the midst of a Revolution, an immense guild of free workers, ready to furnish to each and all the necessary food.","1341101036"

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","Man, I can't watch Flea play - how his joints haven't seized up yet is beyond me. 


I'm no expert at this instrument, but I have played for ~ eight years and have recently been fortunate enough to meet an excellent teacher. I've been working on tearing down and rebuilding my playing and, from that experience, I don't think this is a great video for a few reasons - the first being his technique. His left wrist breaks position every few seconds, his fretting fingers aren't very independent... I'm sure I could find a number of other problems with more time. Second, while he talks about a number of great exercises for beginners (the major and chromatic scales) he does so without the aid of a metronome - it's kind of pointless to work on exercises as a beginner without one keeping time. By doing so you may be learning a bit of theoretical knowledge but your execution will always be lacking. He mentions (around ~45:00) the need for good time but it would have been great to see him demonstrate these concepts in the video.


That said, I do like his philosophy of bass as base, as foundation for group expression. Always always ALWAYS listen to your drummer. The video should have started with the footage from the last five minutes, not his slap riffs. I think MarloweDK's videos would be a better place for beginner players to seek knowledge but have to say that, from my experience as someone who spent years learning from online resources and listening to records. these are no substitute for one-on-one contact with a professional instructor.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I agree that in some extreme circumstances, divorce is the only option. However, I also think that most divorces come about from much more mundane issues, and are done relatively frivolously. Just because you have better options, doesn't mean you get to have a divorce. There's a different between being married with children and being boyfriend and girlfriend, and I think people don't give that difference it's due weight. 
  
If you don't have kids, I don't give a shit. Get divorced, and married, and divorced again. It's just any other relationship at that point.
  
Once you have kids though, that's it. You are obligated to make that relationship work, with divorce only as a horrible last resort after every other reasonable measure has been exhausted. ","1341101038"
"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;Dumping her now would be pretty selfish of me

I do think dumping her without trying to fix her self-esteem issues might be selfish. Your job, as a boyfriend, is to make her a better person. To improve her life. All that stuff. 

But, to engage in metaphor here, there's nothing selfish about keeping your hand out of the garbage disposal. You aren't obligated to stay in a situation that has the potential to hurt you in ways you can't even begin to imagine.

You say this is your first serious relationship. They're exciting and awesome. But trust me when I tell you that you're not rolling the dice over trivialities when you choose to stay with someone who's already considered cheating on you. 

You may not be able to help your girlfriend. She might be more selfish than you realize. She might need to grow up. She might be unfit for long term, monogamous relationships. If I could save just one person from the low I hit last year I would consider my life worthwhile.

More importantly, you need to realize that **you are not at fault** for her desire for affirmation etc. You can't eternally keep a relationship as vividly exciting as the first couple months. You can't replicate the rush we all get from being hit on by strangers (Everyone loves it, but some people like your girlfriend might need it, which is very different.) It's not a question of your worthiness as a boyfriend or anything close to that. We're talking about your girlfriend's self esteem a lot in this thread but keep an eye on your own as well. You don't deserve to be told ""You're not exciting anymore"" and you definitely don't deserve to have someone you love fuck around with someone she just met to feel validated.

So to reiterate: I am not an unbiased source. There's a real possibility that you may be able to fix this with your girlfriend and I sincerely hope you can. But just seeing this thread and your responses is enough to make my heart start racing a little bit.","1341101039"

AAC is mp3's successor according to ISO and MPEG groups documentation. I'm mobile so I'm not going to look up the facts and paste them here. 

And before you downvote me, I'm 100% aware that AAC-HE v2 for example was designed for lowest possible bitrate and quality for streaming and not for storage. AAC-HE at 40kbs, to me, is baseline to 128kbs and better in my opinion. But that's what Apple decided to be the ""standard"" bitrate so 2G edge mobile listeners can enjoy.  

But... AAC has it whole different audible issues. The encoder decides for common ears what it would not be able to hear and uses overtones as methods of compression.

This is going to affect your sister in a really negative way. 

15-16, either she's incapable of consent/making her own decisions or not.

If you did this to protect her, she can't consent to the guilt she's going to shoulder over all of this.

If she knew what she was doing, then you just screwed her up by getting revenge on her.

She and your ex-BF are not good guys in this. At all. But you've guaranteed in that making him the bad guy, she gets part of the punishment. You've created a schism between you and her, possibly your family. She's going to have to testify against him (or maybe she won't) and she may not want to do it. She may have done this to get back at you for something and now you've really pissed her off.

Who knows? What if she feels guilt and it hurts her confidence and self-esteem? You know what that feels like. Now she has the same issue you have.

I think you could have handled this more diplomatically. Now it's an entire shitstorm. You could have gotten rid of him without implicating your sister even more, who is a victim here.

Finally, I think it's interesting that you blame him and not your sister and that your level of payback for his wronging you and your sister will be many times greater than what he did to you. If you cool off and you have a conscience, you're going to feel guilty about this. You can still do the right thing and get rid of him, but you've essentially given this guy a lifetime ban for something that doesn't have an appropriate punishment. 21 and 15-16 is not that offencive and he will be punished, rather than rehabilitated, which was easy enough once this happened. Our ""justice"" system doesn't have a solution for people like him who lack common sense.

"JusticePorn","t5_2sokh","&gt;this person can contribute nothing good to society

You really have no way of determining that.  What if, after years of jail-time, Mical D. Thomas actually does change?  He's 18 years old and been raised in an absolute shit environment for his whole life.  He's apparently had no real parental figure outside of gang members, people who encourage this horrible lifestyle.

If he was 48 instead of 18?  Yeah, I could be more accommodating of your view.  You can't change too much with 35 years of jail at 48 or 58.  But 18?  Is it his fault that his whole life revolved around the illegal and championed murder and violence?

Look, it's good that he went to jail for a long time: it got him off the streets and it's given him a chance to atone for what he's done.  Realistically, I'm with you; I doubt he's going to change.  The prison system is absolute shit the rehabilitation stories are few and far between.  But is it better to kill him outright?  No second chances?  Is that entirely fair given the circumstances, ones that I doubt many of us here will ever full understand?

That's obviously not up to either of us to decide, but let me just end with a point made in the article:

In the first game on Daybreak I actually thought he was doing a 1 base all in type of play so I thought that if I held the initial attack, that he would be behind, I could max out my army (which I did) and just A-click into his base. That way I could attack at a timing where he would be guaranteed to have a weaker army than I. Turns out a tech advantage negates an advantage of army supply to a large degree.

Regarding stim, when do you feel is the best time to start it? I usually start it around 100 gas either before or after the factory goes up. In that game I just got a bit flustered after he attacked and wasn't macroing all that well in those moments.

When would be good times to scout during the game?  I'm finding it hard to balance scans and mules at the moment. Are there some basic timings, besides the initial scout, where I should send out an SCV or a marine? I honestly thought that scouting didn't really matter at this level.

At the moment my multitask is not up to snuff I feel and I find it difficult to do any micro or strategising in the heat of the game, so I just spend most of my actions macroing. Are there any macro builds for Terran to which winning engagements does not rely so heavily on army positioning and control?

I was posting on a stream chat the other evening and the viewers there stated that with good macro you can simply A-click your way into Diamond league (one guy even said low masters). Do you think this is true? I feel like just spending your money, constantly making SCVs, not getting supply blocked, and expanding at reasonable times is not always enough to win you games. Most of the time some form of micro, game sense, army compositions and counters are required. Not to say my own macro is perfect as you just outlined below, but looking back to the advice given on some of the earlier TL threads some of the masters players emphasised macro to the degree that one guy was willing to give out free coaching to anyone in platinum or below who had decent macro.

"community","t5_2qu49","For me, I liked the show from the begging. However, it was when I found /r/community that I really started to absolutely adore the show. The subtle nuances that others pointed out helped give me more of an appreciation for the genius of the writing and the care and love I can clearly tell the writers put in to making the show. 

I know this will sound total cheese ball, but I also really like how we have a group of people who by all accounts probably *shouldn't* get along, but do. You have a Muslim, a Jew, a fairly preachy Christian, an atheist, a jock, etc... These are the kind of people that **typically** are not seen together as a group of friends, but they make it work, and that is completely awesome and even inspiring, almost an idealized America of disparate people being humans and putting the petty shit aside (although they do some petty shit as well, let's be honest). Yeah, they argue sometimes, but they show the power of human compassion and camaraderie, despite their differences. 

Plus the Dean. 

It's weird but I have never felt that a show was made *for me* before, but this one does it. It hits me in all the right places. ","1341101068"

I don't think I can convince everyone otherwise, but for some people on /r/science who don't really have any opinion on GMF one way or the other, hear me out.

- GMF is actually not a recent phenomenon. It's been happening for tens of millennia. GMF has been happening ever since people settled in one place to grow crops and herd animals.
- Benefits of having GMF simply outweighs irrational fear or potential negative consequences by miles. Resistance to harsher climate, insect-resistant crops, more preserving, more disease resistant animals, and many other benefits are often simply taken for granted. But they are all results of countless experiments for hundreds of years.
- Mass-produced food production and market-oriented system of distribution of food is fucking awesome!! It fed billions of people for several decades in an efficient manner. I am hopefully that continuous innovation and breakthrough in this area will increase the food production even further in the future.

I welcome more recent effort by people to eat *organic* or *local*, if they feel better eating food of different method of production and distribution. But it's important acknowledge that mass-production of GMF is essential for vast majority of population in the world.","1341101095"

Huh? That's a terrible non-sequitur. But anyway, no one is arguing that healthcare isn't necessary. The argument is whether or not providing it in this manner is appropriate. 

&gt;The point is, do you have 5K in the bank to pay a hospital? No.

I do. Still, I know many others don't. But the solution isn't to give everyone $5k to pay their medical bills. The solution is to bring medical costs back to reality. The reason we pay so much is because of the greed in the medical industry (not the insurance industry). Insurance companies negotiate costs down, not up. It's the hospitals deciding that a cancer treatment should cost half a million dollars. It's doctors that want to be paid 150k per year for a job that literally most anyone can do if given the education. It's the nurses that want to be paid $40 per hour. It's the receptionist that wants a salary of $60k.

Then you have the medical device companies charging $20,000 for a simple mesh. You have rods going for $5,000. These prices do not reflect the R&amp;D that went into creating these devices. They reflect greed. Are the devices life saving/life enhancing? Sure. But so are cars. Without cars the world is back to horses. Should we charge a quarter million dollars for vehicles? 

The medical industry is full of greedy bastards that would fit in nicely with the worst of wall street. Giving everybody the ability to pay their insane prices is not the solution. We need to regulate the cost of medical care down.","1341101098"

Indeed it is. However, taking money from me to take care of another person and their children I have never meet is not a human right and is stupid. 

&gt; If they all acted like I would, we'd be taking away their right to have children and that's morally wrong.

Lol wut? I'll let you figure out why this is fucking retarded logic. 

&gt; What we should be more concerned about is teaching people about safe sex, making sure couples have access to safe and affordable family planning services

ITS FUCKING 2012!! Who honestly doesn't know that unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy, or the spread of disease? Really? This shit is covered as is within the education establishment, and if it isn't, then the parents should have had sit-downs with their kids while they were going through puberty. 
&gt; making sure that nobody has to live in poverty if they're willing to put in the work

I have no problems with this. However, you will find there really are a lot of lazy people out there that really do just want to be handed something. Fuck those people.

&gt; A lot of poor parents do care and try to make it out, but they can't because our economy is terrible.

Don't appeal to emotion. This has been plaguing mankind forever.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a roommate who refused to clean her room. She was extremely attractive, friendly, and an intelligent college student, so this behavior seemed extremely out of character. We both lived in newly renovated, swanky shared house owned by a mutual good friend who is understanding to a fault. 

After living with us for around a half a year, this roommate somehow let it get to the point where the room stunk enough to emit through a closed door when you were near it. After my complaints (I live in the same basement) my friend that owned the house approached our roommate and requested that she clean the room because she is breach of her lease. The roommate agreed, apologized and cried because she said that she had been so busy and depressed. The owner understood and the two had a decent heart2heartz. 

Fast forward a week later, and the room hadn't been cleaned at all.

The owner was exasperated so decided to go into the room and throw away any obvious garbage to be helpful to her busy, terminally sad friend. She also wanted to leave a note stating that she would be terminating our roommates lease if this continued, but wanted to stay friends.

The removed tons of half rotten food containers and other obvious garbage. Upon removing the garbage, the owner realized the smell was coming from the closet. She opened it thinking she would find an overflowing garbage or Tupperware, but instead found a mountain of used tampons... Most were in stuffed tightly in shoe boxes, but our roommate had clearly run out of room in those and starting stuffing them into the corner of the closet. Some of the tampons had saturated the closet carpet causing mold.

In a rage my friend threw away the tampons and garbage, and when the roommate returned told her to move out immediately. It was a horrifying and embarrassing ideal for everyone involved.

TLDR: Roommate didn't clean room for half a year, it smelled terrible, the smell was actually a mountain of used tampons rotting in the closet.","1341101107"

The other was a Remington 1858- the mainspring that controls hammer rebound (the percussion cap going off would cause the hammer to come back if nothing was stopping it) was wound too tightly to begin with- and when the softer hammer met the hardened steel nipple, it caused it to mushroom out. It mushroomed out so much that it would not longer pass through the cut out in the frame that the hammer rides through. If there had been a cap on the nipple instead of dry firing, the pressure would have acted as a cushion and the hammer not mushroomed out.","1341101112"

What was Stannis going to be doing the whole time? Was Tyrion going to live it up in Pentos doing nothing for _five years_? How were young characters like Tommen and Devan growing up going to be handled? Was Aemon going to still be alive?

Was Brienne never intended to be a POV character? That would explain a lot. How was Arianne intended to be introduced? Was she going to be the same age she was in AFFC or older? 

I can see why the jump turned out to be unworkable.

You won't get an infection, because you're taking all the right steps.  Even if you did (but you won't!), since you're being so diligent about it, you would be able to catch it and get medication for it before it has any lasting effects.

The people whose corneas get so damaged that they need transplants have some other kind of disease that caused it, or do not take care of their eyes if they get infected. You are not that kind of person.

The people still have the biggest influence on government, they just very rarely come together in the numbers necessary to take advantage of it.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The earliest Mars landers used the inflatable cushions landing system. This was much simpler than the rocket-based landers, but limited the lander weight and didn't allow for a very precise landing. The Curiosity is way too big for a cushioned landing.

The next step is using rocket motors pointed downwards. Before Curiosity, those were always mounted on the lander itself. This allows for much more massive landers to reach Mars' surface, but one disadvantage is that the area where the lander touches down gets blasted by the rockets. This destroys whatever surface texture there was before and creates dust clouds, the dust can get into the lander's machinery and electronics and do damage there.

Which is why the Curiosity has the rockets mounted above the lander. The ""rocket crane"" will bring Curiosity in with much more mass than a cushion landing would allow, position it as precisely as possible, drop it down on cables without doing much damage to the surface beneath and without raising dust clouds (since the rocket engines stay well away from the ground), and then fly away to a crash landing nearby and leave the rover to do its job.","1341101143"

"canada","t5_2qh68","You make a lot of great points! Too bad the test doesn't actually test for any of them!

""In theory, the test is supposed to determine an immigrant’s knowledge of Canada – among the topics are elections, rights and responsibilities, history and geography – as well as their language abilities. In practice, a pass or fail can hinge on questions that have been described as trivial by some test takers, on subjects including Canadian athletes, battles and discoveries.""

The version of the test that’s been used since 2010 is based on a revamped 68-page study guide, Discover Canada, which is slightly longer and covers more ground than the previous one. To pass the multiple-choice exam, applicants have to get 15 out of 20 questions correct, compared with only 12 previously. Government staff at the exam also assess test takers as they arrive, asking questions about their life in Canada to test their verbal language ability.

“Coming from a place that was ruled by Britain once upon a time means you’re likely to do well and that’s probably because you can read the guide more efficiently and read the test more efficiently,” Prof. Triadafilopoulos said. He noted that the Conservatives’ changes to the test have put a particular emphasis on military history and the monarchy.""

The problem with your argument is that it cuts both ways, and there will be times that the right doesn't want to give states authority and sometimes it's the left.  The problem is not right vs. left, it's that the federal government typically screws everything up and creates more problems than it solves in America.  We are so huge and diverse that the feds can't possibly do much of anything that is good for everyone.  Limit the federal government to what they do well, let the states make choices on how to do the rest.","1341101166"

Yeah this is one of the biggest problems I have with hollywood horror comedy.

Not only this most ""horror comedy"" films are rarely scary either, at least to me.

Scream, Cabin in the Woods, Drag me to Hell - I never found more than 10-15 minutes in each film actually ""funny"". And they weren't unsettling, creepy or scary either.

Horror themed comedy thrillers on the other hand works really well for me - Evil Dead 2, Ghostbusters, Beetlejuice, Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Shawn of the Dead, Gremlins.

The other thing that REALLY puts me off this specific genre of horror is the tacky special effects, the low budget quality that is constantly forced down your throat, and the inherent campiness. Not to mention the bizarre gigantic cult following that makes these films out to be Godfather/Citizen Kane/Lotr level.

I want something that is fucking scary OR something that's actually funny. Horror and comedy just don't mix well at all.","1341101168"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Even as an atheist, I disagree. I disagree for two important reasons:

 1. A pure-hearted Catholic or Evangelical can read their texts and see that homosexuality is forbidden. Therefore, their disagreement with it may be entirely legalistic: ""This is what the book says and I follow the book."" That does not imply ""homophobia"" at all. It just implies a wish to follow the book. I disagree strongly that anyone should outsource their morals this way, but millions of people seem to.

 2. It is a very common phenomenon that people we love do actions we hate. Husbands cheat on their wives, children get into drugs, etc. How is loving them despite their bad behaviour anything other than ""loving the sinner but hating the sin.""

I think that it is incredibly sad that there is anyone who would call romantic love between two people of the same gender ""a sin"", but I don't dispute that some people see it that way and can do so even as they love people who commit this sin.

"AllThingsTerran","t5_2tfht","I'm in a weird position, that I'd say most Terrans can empathise with:

As much as I think TvZ is in a bad at the moment, I have a lot of respect for good Zerg players.  Zerg requires good mechanics, good decision making, and if you fuck up, you risk losing the game.  Players like Nestea, DRG and Coca, and I guess to a lesser extent Stephano blow my mind with the way they play.  They have unbelievably mechanical and mental prowess.  Some of the mindgames I've seen from the aforementioned rival any level of Terran mindgame.

Protoss players are shit.  It sounds like a crude statement, but everything about them is weak and worthless.  No joke, I have seen code S protosses with full chronoboost on a nexus at 8 minutes.  They can make mistake after mistake and still pull ahead.  They can effectively play a single player game, making whatever decisions they want and get away with it.
I never see decent, frequent warp prism usage, lategame DTs, templar drops, observer usage, or micro.

Honestly, even the highest level Protoss players, such as HerO, Parting and Genius don't impress me at all.  HerO's multitasking is okay, but his micro is average at best.
The only thing Parting does is warp in HTs at weird places on the map and get off storms, big fucking deal.
Genius does nothing, NOTHING that I find skilful or talented.

Terran players - at all levels - are more skilful than their peers.
People cried ""wahwah, Terran imba"" for so long with GSL, but I REALLY don't feel there was a balance issue, Terran players were just so much better.  Look at MVP: his multitasking, micro, decision making, macro, EVERYTHING are unbelievable.  MKP the same (bar perhaps his decision making at times ;p).  MMA is one of the most mechanically solid progamers out there.  Even less successful notables like DeMuslim or Dragon have better micro, macro and multitasking than your average Code A/S Protoss.

It DISGUSTS me seeing a Protoss complain on a forum, or ask me for a gg after a game, or tell Terrans to ""stop complaining pls, and play better"".  It's actually borderline offensive.  To this day, I can play Protoss on the ladder (Masters) with a higher win rate than my own race.  In fact, without any solid knowledge of metagame or builds for their MUs I can do this.  Why? They are &gt;easy&lt;.

I'll gladly wait for some Protoss player come and post about how they're actually difficult, and I'm talking bullshit, and quote some day9 quote about how Terran are easy, or Protoss are actually really complicated or whatever, but be aware: everybody in this subreddit, EVERYBODY, knows you're wrong.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I think Jonathan Brown gives a great answer in his book, ""Muhammad"". Which you sort of answered yourself. 

&gt;There is nothing more controversial to the modern reader than Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, who is believed to have been between nine and ten years old hen the marriage was consummated. (The most reliable historical sources on this marriage are the *Sahih* Hadith collections of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Interestingly, no critic of Muhammad, from his fiercest opponents in the Quraysh to medieval Christian clerics, objected to his marriage to so young a wife until the modern period. This is noteworthy, since there has certainly never been a shortage of detractors seeking chinks in the armour of Muhammad's character to exploit.

&gt;It was his marriage to Zaynab, his adopted son's former wife, which attracted criticism even during Muhammad's own lifetime. The fact that Zayd is one of only two contemporaries of Muhammad ever mentioned in the Quran (the other is Abu Lahab), as well as the book's sizable passage on the Zaynab episode, testifies to the controversy surrounding Muhammad's marriage to her. One of the earliest Christian polemicists against Islam, John of Damascus (d. 749), accused Muhammad of 'tailoring' the Quranic laws on marriage and adoption to legitimize his 'desire' for Zaynab. This accusation has been repeated endlessly throughout Christian writings on Islam. The 13th-century English historian Mathew Paris, for example, wrote n his great chronicle that Muhammad had pronounced polygamy permissible to cover up an affair with a servant's (presumably Zayd's) wife.

&gt;The reason that no pre-modern critics paid attention to the Prophet's marriage to a ten-year-old was because marrying girls considered underage today as commonplace in the pre-modern world.

&gt;Muhammad's decision to consummate his marriage to a ten-year-old would have been based on the same criteria as most pre-modern societies: Aisha's sexual maturity and readiness to bear a child. ","1341101181"

We hated each other.  No, we really fucking despised each other. I thought he was a self-promoting, snooty, holier than thou, busybody ""oh I'm such an important person"" douchebag.  In truth, he was, sort of.  He thought I was an arrogant asshole sonuvabitch.  Which I was, sort of.  

We would be at the only and very small gay bar in town.  Him with his pack of fawning fans at one end.  Me, by myself talking with this guy or that at the other end. Which was _maybe_ fifteen feet away - naw, more like ten.  So I'd hear him vaorting with his buds and I couldn't help myself. I'd yell back ""keep it to yourself ya tiresome little fuck."" he would shoutmback ""just go away you fucking asshole."" And so on and so forth. 

One night I got pretty seriously spifflicated and, walking back to my place found him following me. 

""What the fuck? Go away.""  he didn't, just kept following me, like two feet behind. 

""What the fuck do you want? Leave me alone."" He keeps coming. ""I'm going home with you."" ""Oh no you aren't, no goddamn way now piss off!"" 

So went pretty much the entire 20 or 25 minute walk to my apartment. I mist have been even drunker than I thought because next thing I remember we're having sex in my bed.  Really good sex.  Very very good sex.  

That was over 20 years ago.  The sex is still good. ","1341101186"

A couple years ago I was house sitting for my parents and they told me Isaac might have hurt his leg and they wanted me to keep an eye on him. So the first night I go out to feed him and visit but he's just standing there in the middle of his stall, seemingly uninterested. So I feed him and leave him be. I go out the next morning and he's standing in the same place, hasn't moved an inch. He's eaten the hay I left at his feet but he hasn't moved to the other side of the stall to his water, which is still full. I was concerned at this point, obviously. I drug his water bucket to him and he sucked down half of it. Despite being that thirsty he hadn't moved all night. He wasn't putting any weight on his back leg and I realized it was probably worse than my parents thought. 

He was 24 years old, too old to recover from a serious injury. But I didn't want to believe it. I haltered him up and tried to get him to move. I started crying as I tugged his rope and he wouldn't budge. It was as good as a death sentence.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","&gt;Nothing has any inherent essence, but that doesn't mean that nothing is meaningful or important.

I never said that nothing is meaningful or important, just that it is sunyata. However, it seems you are taking an essentialist stance when you say that Buddhism is intrinsically taking refuge in the three jewels -- that you cannot be a Buddhist if you do not. But is Buddhism Buddhism in virtue of the path it lays out, or the end it wishes to achieve? If Buddhism *is* taking refuge in the three jewels, is it really upaya then? It seems to me like it is not.

&gt;Because there have been a lot of people who have been striving for the same end as the Buddha, and (according to the Buddhist teachings, at least), they have not gotten there by other means.

Then why does Buddhism have a concept for upaya at all if there is only one means to the Buddha's end -- the Noble Eightfold Path, etc?  What purpose does it have? Is it really the means that the Buddha was stressing about, or the end? If it was the end -- nirvana, in this case -- then can't we consider all his words to be upaya?

&gt;But more importantly: why not follow the Buddha's teachings, if they are there? Why not take advantage of the path that is laid out?

Because things change? That the means always come and go, but that the end always stays the same? What worked for the Buddha may not work for some people now, or for some others in the future. Is this not the entire point of upaya? And if this is true, is not Buddhism beyond the words of the Buddha? Or is it only what he said it was?

Start from that link and take a wiki-walk and see if you can come to any conclusions about the meaning of his role in the plot, as a son, a brother, an antagonist and an ally.

Unfortunately, I can't find much in the way of developer's notes regarding the characters and their relationships - only about the gameplay and aesthetic aspects of the game, not the narrative side.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Do you believe that science, in any way is being impeded by religion?

no not really - some high powered conservatives are impeding certain streams of it, but like wise i think any realm of science that ends up dealing with morality ends up being impeded by some group that disagrees with the morality of it, not the science - not just religions

&gt;In your opinion, do you believe this is a good thing?

i think some realms of science need to be held accountable and not play God to use a cliche - so some opposition is a good thing in order to ensure accountability and consideration of all points of view

&gt;What are your thoughts on science?

all good - but science has a large, broad definition so some ""sciences"" are not as useful or as accurate as others. When science starts to make unsubstantiated claims or guesses that enter philosophical territory i start to like it less.

&gt;Do you really believe that a talking snake can exist?

i am surprised so many people have said it is a myth... I have no problem with believing that a supernatural entity such as God can do whatever He jolly well pleases with His omniscience and omnipotence. Just as I believe demons and angels can exist, and possession by spirits exists - i can believe on miraculous or spirit-based phenomena. If i cant believe that a snake could talk, then i cant believe in the exodus, i cant believe in any miraculous healing and certainly not the resurrection - then where are you? not a Christian any more....

&gt;I have seen people refuse to accept the existence of space, and it dumbfounds me. And It's sickening to believe that only a few hundred years ago, you could be killed if you claimed that heaven was not above the atmosphere. 

that is just dumb - some things are a proven fact, like space, and planets, and gravity. some things i think there is still enough of a gray area to question the certainty of the fact - evolution, big bang, sexuality etc. Christianity has been ruled by the ignorant and represented by the poorly informed or overly zealous despite ignorance. But that should not be indicative of the religion per se, but rather individuals or groups of people corrupting something. Just as all Muslims are not terrorists, and all Hindus don't lie on a bed of nails, some people are not representative of their faith

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Hey, you're the one who started the name-calling.

I totally agree with everything you said - baby boomers, banks fucking everything up etc. But let's be honest - WE as citizens are a large part of the problem. That's what the quote said. We can blame banks, blame older people, blame politicians. But really, WE are at fault too.

Yes banks were irresponsible. But that didn't stop stupid, greedy people from taking out £450k 110% mortgages on mediocre salaries. Nobody put a gun to their head. They saw a ""good offer"" and took it. And it didn't stop people from taking out a shitload of easy to get credit cards and not paying them back. It's a cycle of greed, caused by both banks and people. Most people have debt now. Nobody has savings.

Same with most things. We bitch about our local stores all closing, yet everyone shops at Tesco regardless. Even when people protest new Tesco stores, they're still super popular because they're cheap and convenient. We ARE lazy and entitled.

Most companies, banks and politicians are just giving us what we demand. It's that classic case of ""be careful what you wish for"". Our own greed and entitlement is our own worst enemy. We want things cheap, we want them now, we don't want to wait or save etc etc. And no surprise, banks and businesses want to profit off this, so we get reckless lending, spending and debt. I'm not superior - I'm exactly the same. Hearing about how my parents lived without chairs in their house for months until they could afford them seems like a whole different world. Now anyone would just take store credit or something.

But as I said earlier, it's the middle people who get fucked over. I'm sure that life on the dole isn't amazing for most people, but isn't it a mess when you can actually be worse off from working? My Reddit enhancement suite says that I've upvoted you +8 times, so we probably agree about a lot of things. I think it's ok to be unhappy with the current state of the country, but we should look at ourselves before blaming everybody else too. That's all.","1341101252"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I used to be a state coordinator with a national breed club rescue.

One time I had an animal control about 250 miles away call me, there was a dog there that had been there for 67 days.  She came in with a male, they were both the same breed and they only picked the male up, claimed they never saw the female in their life before.  No one believed that one.  The dog came into the shelter emaciated, still dripping milk (lost puppies somewhere), she had a staph infection on her skin, and heartworm positive.

I picked her up on her 68th day at the shelter, took her to have her spayed, and that vet picked up the chip.  She called the owner and asked for his permission to spay the dog, and he went nuts, saying absolutely not.  So that vet refused to spay her for the rescue.

I contacted the former owner and informed him that he no longer owned the dog, and that the state of Texas would back me up.  He threatened to sue me, I told him to knock his self out, I was ready for a lawsuit.  He started threatening to sue to shelter that we got her from, and the sheriff actually went to his home and told him that after 72 hours the dog was state property, and that he had better settle down.  Never heard a peep out of the guy again.

Flip side, there was a rescue in League City called Whiskerville, and someone brought them 2-3 dogs that were running as strays.  A woman brought them in, and after a couple of weeks, the proprietor of that rescue adopted them out.  There was a big lawsuit and court battle, the court decided that since the dogs never went through the state (as far as being put in as strays), the owner go their dogs back.  They originally found the dogs were at that shelter after two weeks?  So the rescue should have had ownership of the dogs, but it didn't work out that way through the courts.  (edit - it took months for the court battle to play out, and it was a heck of a long time before the dogs went back to their original owners)

http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/consumer&amp;id=7580298

So as someone who had the potential to get into some really ugly situations, I learned it was just so much easier to let the state take ownership of the dogs first, and then no matter what happened after that, I was on solid footing.  Once a shelter was awarded the animals (assumed after 72 hours in a shelter), the court would never award them back to the owner.  And often, I would foster the dog at my home while it was in the system for those 72 hours.","1341101256"

"darksoulsbuilds","t5_2t7at","Ok, here goes:

I would put 2 into attunement and 5 into vitality for your remaining 7 points.
That will give you an additional 118 HP (well worth the 5 points, 45 is optimal vitality IMO) and one more attunement slot for Wrath of The Gods. I know, it's super annoying, but with only 3 casts you'll have to avoid spamming it (which is when it gets ridiculous) and it's great for 2v1s (against you).

Do NOT make your Shotel chaos/lightning. With 40 dex, you want to keep that scaling intact, and then it remains buffable.

I think you messed up your item slots, you want Uchigatana in right hand and talisman in left, otherwise you can't use those wonderful weapon buffs.

If you want a lightning/chaos weapon, try to find something that scales poorly with what you have (ie, using a Club or something with high strength scaling rather than dex).

Well, that's all I got. You could always dump those remaining points into Faith if you want stronger buffs, or put your strength up to 16 rather than take an extra attunement slot if you dislike WoTG (don't knock it til you try it!) 16 strength would be enough to use the Claymore and some other nifty-keen weapons.

Clearly you don't understand what is actually going on.  She has never made the claim that citing foreign precedent means the court considers itself bound by foreign law.  If that is what you think, you're simply wrong.  

&gt;You confuse the idea that government should be small with the idea that the Federal government is one of enumerated powers, and that there is a mechanism for expanding that power (Constitutional amendment) which has been turned on it's head by liberal activist judges who have taken to re-writing the Constitution by fiat.

Lol.  Article III gives the judiciary the power of judicial review.  You don't like the outcome of every case, so you complain about judicial activism and you accuse me of wanting to re-write the Constitution?  The one who does not respect the rule of law is you.  If you did respect it you'd know that Scalia has a duty to respect *stare decisis* instead of rewriting the Constitution by contradicting *his own precedent*.  You're sad, and your thinking is sad.

There is nothing separating your political philosophy from a child stamping his feet in the grocery store when he doesn't get candy from mommy.  The fact that you can't separate judicial decisions from politics just illustrates your inability to comprehend the purpose of the judiciary.  Your contradictory stance on judicial activism is hilariously juvenile.","1341101269"

"skyrim","t5_2s837","Facing down a frost dragon in the north somewhere.  I can't recall the location, but the lair had a lot of rocks large rocks, such that it was almost like the area had two different levels to it; either on the ground between the rocks (almost like a maze) or up on top of them.

A few of my friends were actually sitting in the room watching me play when I ran into this thing.

Start peppering it with arrows, Lydia's helping out, dragon is flying around; typical fight.  It lands on the ground between the rocks a distance away from me, breaking line of sight.  I ran toward the rock, jumped on top of it, and then jumped toward the dragon.  As I fell toward it I unleashed a Yol!  The dragon simultaneously hit me with a Fo Krah Diin.  The two shouts met in the middle and basically exploded; it was a bright light and some of my friends actually jumped.

I landed, still being hit by some of the frost breath, and fired a few arrows into the dragon.  It's health was quite low when it took off again.  It circled around, landing back up where I had just run from.  I ran up the hill, and it was me, the dragon, and Lydia in a triangle formation.  I started to ready my bow as the dragon looked first at me, then at Lydia, and apparently made it's choice.  It opened it's mouth, preparing to blast the low-on-health Lydia with a point-blank shot of frost.  The cold air was just beginning to escape it's throat when my arrow sank into its neck and the dragon collapsed in ruin.

It was possibly the most epic fight I've had yet.","1341101270"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not as fantastic as some of the stories here, but I went on a study abroad trip to Central Europe with a group of students. Keep in mind this was grad school, not undergrad. I was matched with another girl who seemed normal at first, but turned out to be annoying and slightly gross. 

Our schedule was to get to the tram at 8:40a or so, to get to the U on time. I liked eating breakfast with the group (8:00), and she hated getting up early, so we agreed that I would get up and have the bathroom first. So I would get up, (keeping in mind that these are old buildings with creaky wood floors), try to be quiet while I showered, and go to breakfast. Usually, I would come back to grab my bag for the day, and she would just be rolling out of bed. No shower. This would have been fine with me once in a while- many people don't shower every day, or they do it at night. But she didn't. She just wouldn't shower, and this would be after us having a day at school, and then full nights of traveling, sight-seeing, walking around in the heat, etc. Smelled gross. This also comes up later.

I'm not the skinniest girl around, but I was a fairly small size at the time. Roommate was a larger size and complained about it all the time. However, she would complain about it while eating jars of Snickers Spread right from the jar with a spoon at the same time. She had somehow smuggled them in her suitcase. Like I said, I always wanted to get up early, so I would go to bed early. But as soon as she would see me getting my headphones out (on full blast- the only way I could drown out her snores), she would start talking about how she doesn't understand why she is heavy. She ""usually eats normally."" She is just eating this Snickers stuff ""as a treat."" Right. I had never even heard of Snickers spread. She also complained that everyone in the trip walked too fast, and we did it on purpose to be mean to her. 

The best was when she would not let me go to sleep because she wanted to talk about her bra troubles. I was trying to settle in to sleep, and she started in about how her bra was so sweaty. She just couldn't get the sweat out of her bra. Complaining that her bra smells, and she doesn't know what to do. I don't even know this girl! Gross. So I told her to wash it. She complained that she couldn't get the sweat out. OK, so go buy a new one. She said they don't have her size around here, and she doesn't know the language anyway. Alright, spray it with rubbing alcohol, then. No; that doesn't work. And she doesn't have any rubbing alcohol. On and on and on, complaining about her nasty bra while I wanted to go to sleep. Part of me was thinking ""OMG YOU ARE 24 YEARS OLD. YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MORE THAN ONE BRA AND SHOULD ALSO SHOWER."" The other part of me was thinking that no one could be this clueless- she must be fucking with me.

Near the end of the trip, I went on a weekend with some of the other girls on the trip, and they told me that my roommate had been complaining to them of my ""inconsiderateness."" I woke her up all the time very early, and ""didn't care about her problems when she wanted to talk."" o_0 

(I want to be very clear that I am not trying to be mean about her size. I am heavier myself now; but I know it is because I eat junk and don't exercise, so I don't complain about it to random people or think it isn't my fault.)

TL;DR: Roommate did not shower or understand how sweat worked.","1341101273"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Obamacare forces insurers to offer more benefits

True

&gt;requires them to spend more money on health expenses

Kind of. It requires them to spend a higher *percentage* of money on health expenses. I.e., they have to spend 80% (or 85%, depending on the insurance group size) of the premiums they collect on actual medical care, which means only 20% of the money they collect can go to overhead and profits. So there's no incentive for them to pass that cost down to you, since they'd then have to pass any extra profit they gained from it down to you to in the form of an actual check.

&gt;and subsidizes the consumption of richer insurance packages.

I think you've got that backwards. There's an extra *tax* on the really high-end insurance packages. That's one of the ways it stays budget-neutral in the worst-case scenario and budget-positive in the more likely cases.

&gt;Someone promised you something for free.

If you think Obamacare gives anyone a free ride, you've misread the legislation. For the most part, it doesn't have a big effect on how the US insurance and healthcare system works. It just sets up a system to help out lower-income people get insurance, takes away things like lifetime caps and pre-existing conditions, and mandates that everyone has to get insurance if they can (since otherwise getting rid of pre-existing conditions would be unworkable).

&gt;The laws of economics dictate that these costs will get passed down to consumers

The idea is that the mandate means a much, much larger percentage of the country will be paying into health insurance plans while healthy. This will more than make up for the extra coverage that the insurance companies have to provide, and they can't just take that money and shovel it into their profits because of the profit cap mentioned previously.

More healthy people paying in = a lower percentage of people actually needing to use their insurance, +profit caps = lower premiums for everyone = Lower taxes because the government will be paying lower healthcare premiums as well. It truly blows my mind that the tea party is so against this.","1341101279"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","This will be a semi-difficult task given your gear, but not insurmountable. I've done some shooting like this and have listened to a lot of podcasts about it, so here is my advice. 

Exampe - [This](http://i.imgur.com/pMmh3.jpg) is what I consider a flawless execution of this type of photography.
 
1. Rule of thumb for getting a sharp image of your subject when shooting handheld is to set the shutter at 1/focal length. For that lens you will need to set it at 1/300 at a MINIMUM since you are at 300mm. However, with the crop factor applied, you'll need to set it higher, so start at 1/500. You might even need to go a bit higher than that, but if you go too high it will freeze the motion, so it will look like the car is parked on the track, which is not good. Play around with the settings to see which works best. 

2. Control the shutter speed by shooting in shutter priority, and set your camera to continuous focus, or AI Servo. 

3. When the car is approaching place your focus point over the car, or the driver's helmet if it is visible, then activate focus and start firing away while smoothly panning with the car. If you can pre-set your focus to a point on the track where you know the car will be in focus, do that. I could never figure out how to do that TBH. 

4. If the driver's helmet is visible, make sure it is what is in focus. 

5. Check your images and practice, practice, practice. Shooting fast-moving vehicles is incredibly difficult to get it JUST right. If you can get eye level with the drivers that is best, but not always possible. 

6. If this shoot is really important, consider renting a camera or a lens. Having a really long, fast lens can make a world of difference in this type of photography, and the same goes for a camera with 10fps but your budget may not allow that. 

Good luck and remember to have fun :)","1341101300"

Although it is gender neutral in wording, I can't think of a single instance in which a woman was prosecuted for drunk sex, rather than the man.  Even in cases where both are drunk (which is clearly stated to not be a valid defense), why is the male automatically charged, rather than, say, the instigator?  I mean, IF it was actually gender neutral, both would be guilty and innocent, would they not?

Yet curiously, this gender neutral law has never produced a guilty verdict against a woman for 'raping' a drunk man....hmm....

I guess I must be reading judges minds...

That is what I'm talking about.  Unless and until women are prosecuted for the same behavior men are, the 'gender neutrality' is a thin veneer for plausible deniability only.  ","1341101312"

Well that's wonderful, but unless you own the company, you can't tell them to do things like ""build a multi-billion dollar oil refinery"" if it's detrimental and unprofitable for them to do so, and it would be unethical of the management to arbitrarily respect your wishes if it were against the best interests of the shareholders.


Even if ""we"" did own the oil refinery (as in, our oil industry was entirely nationalized or something), I still don't get why we wouldn't just choose the most profitable method - if the profits flow into the government anyway, we should be trying to maximize those.

My current understanding of why it is more profitable to pipe this bitumen down to Texas is because it is extremely ""heavy"" - it requires a specific refinery, which already exists, and has excess capacity for refining, in Texas. (i.e. They aren't piping it to the US and also building a new refinery - the multi-billion dollar pipeline is *cheaper* than building a new refinery, and I can only infer from that that the refinery must cost much more than this massive pipeline and its maintenance costs.)","1341101312"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Wasn't gonna do this, but I'm bored as shit so why not.  I think the last few ""end of book"" deaths are really cheap and don't impact the story much (besides Dumbledore because the death of the mentor is pretty essential for a typical saga like this).  There were several offscreen deaths (Lupin?  Moody? wtf?) in the last book that were just ridiculous and meaningless because these characters were no longer as relevant to the story.  

While bored at work one day, I had this whole alternate timeline written out that she could have pursued with some forward planning.  Instead of just being his first 6 years of school and then awkwardly going off looking for the Hallows in the 7th, You have Years 1, 2, 4, and 7 in the first four books.  In book 3/year 4, Harry is unable to save Sirius and he's ""killed"" by the Dementors after Harry has one last conversation with him through the bars of his cell (because aside from some advice that could've been given by almost anyone, what does he really do for the next two books?  Harry can learn everything he needs to know from him during Prisoner, can't he?  Yes, he's a cool character but...)  This also teaches Harry a valuable lesson about how the past is the past, let it go etc.  

The fourth book/year seven shows the Triwizard Tournament happen, but Hermione is the Hogwarts Champ (makes sense because of her brilliance) instead of Cedric.  She dies in his place at the end.  We are now in serious shit-zone.  Harry returns with her body and Ron is uber-butthurt/stops talking to Harry.  The fifth book shows Harry becoming an auror to help combat the return of Voldemort, where you introduce all the bureaucracy and cover-up of the original story showing Harry becoming disillusioned with the effectiveness of the ministry.  He trains under Mad-Eye Moody and the whole thing is like, wizard detectives/agents investigating dark magic and whatnot.  Ron is also an auror training under another auror who turns out to be a Death Eater mole that kills Moody.  More DRAMATIC TENSION between him and Harry because of this.  They have an intense duel like the Harry/Malfoy bathroom one in Half-Blood Prince and Ron is dismissed from the Ministry for being an asshole.  Voldemort is still legilimens'ing Harry the entire book and at one point suggests that he has Ginny captive in the Department of Mysteries (instead of Sirius).  Ginny is missing for some unrelated reason, so Ron begrudgingly accepts Harry's offer to team up and save her.  Obvious trap is obvious, the Order shows up and the battle starts.  Harry and Ron duel together and save each other's skin a few times.  Bellatrix's spell throws Ron through the veil and he dies.  Everyone's conflicted because Ron's been a dick lately but Harry is uber-torn up that his former BFF is dead.  End of the book, Harry leaves the Ministry and accepts Dumbledore's offer to become the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  

Begin Book 6.  Here he begins working more closely with Dumbledore to find one single horcrux (fuck this video game scavenger hunt bs) they find the locket which is fake, Snape kills D-Dore, Harry vows to find the real one.  Last book is Harry traveling the world, not just searching for the Horcrux but recruiting allies to join their cause.  Not only does this help bring back major characters and forces introduced in the previous volumes, but also allows her to show places like Durmstrang, etc for the first time and shows the scope/stakes of the conflict.  Voldemort besieges Hogwarts to draw Harry out of hiding.  The Prince's Tale arc happens in some way and Harry learns he is the real Horcrux.  He decides to end his life by walking through the veil, where he finds himself in limbo like the King's Cross scenario in the book.  He talks to Ron, weighty philosophical bs about life and death and Ron forgives him.  Closure city.  Wakes up on the other side of the veil and brings his army to a near-demolished Hogwarts with the defenders almost beaten.  Neville does his brave thing (character arc-critical) and leads one last rush against the Death Eaters to give Harry his chance to attack Voldemort.  They have a duel and it's actually epic (something the films actually got right) instead of lasting two seconds.  There are a few scenes of immediate aftermath, showing him reuniting with Ginny, etc.  There are no Deathly Hallows because they add very little to the story.  There is already one MacGuffin driving the plot.  

The ""19 Years Later"" flashforward is adult Harry and Hagrid having tea in the hut and catching up.  IMO, this is more of an organic way of bringing the story full-circle and wrapping things up, instead of the gaudy cheesefest that I'm pretty sure everyone hated.  That's pretty much it.  I had some other loose ideas about the earlier books that aren't as important but made everything more connected and relevant, like Draco Malfoy actually being the Heir of Slytherin and getting killed by the Basilisk, Tom Riddle's diary being introduced at the end of the first book, Harry almost murdering Bellatrix but finds himself incapable of doing so (there needs to be something to get rid of that awful ""not my daughter you bitch"" scene) and Quirrell initially being a mere psychopathic follower in Book 1.  He sees Harry holding the philosopher's stone in the Mirror or Erised during their final confrontation, casts a curse, it rebounds off the mirror and incaps him.  He doen't die but is sent to Azkaban where Sirius escapes while he's being brought in.  He too breaks out and eventually becomes the ""man with two faces"" vessel for Voldemort's return in Book 4.  Also, Voldemort is more elemental and less of a James Bond villain.  But...yeah, that's just me.

TL;DR JKR doesn't know how to appropriately use character deaths to build dramatic tension and didn't really make an attempt to have all events connect/be relevant to the greater story.","1341101314"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Light (photons) are massless. They bend due to gravity because they follow 'straight lines' (meaning the shorted paths) in spacetime, and spacetime itself is curved by mass. As for momentum...you requires a lesson in relativity.

Essentially though, the equation for momentum that people are used to for momentum, p=mv, is only true for non-relativistic particles.
One important equation in special relativity is:
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
For photons, m=0, so you're left with E=pc, or p=E/c.
Photons/light have energy proportional to their frequency, so their momentum is as well.

I realize having equations thrown at you isn't really a satisfying answer, but the point is photons have momentum without having mass.","1341101322"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Freshman year, roommate #1 (Constance) liked to watch me sleep, so I'd wake up with her staring at me every morning. All she did was knit socks and go on Plurk, whatever the fuck that is. She liked to walk in on my suitemate and I when we were in the shower or toilet, and threw up in the sink and left it to harden when we weren't there. She asked my suitemate how long it took her to grow her huge boobs and said she was so proud of her wide birthing hips. She wore a fanny pack and called it a ""belly pouch"". She told me she didn't want to share my new tv and made me move it to my side so she couldn't see it, but a little while later I came home to her watching tv on my bed, knitting. It started to piss me off to have her yuckiness on my bed, so I hid my remote in the far back corner of my underwear drawer under my bed. I came home and she was on my bed, knitting, watching tv with the remote in her hand. 

Roommate #2 (Madison) started out normal then started going crazy. Started binge drinking every day until she passed out in the middle of a sentence. Her only meals consisted of pixie sticks, nerds, and glazed doughnuts. She stopped going to class and doing homework, sleeping the entire day forbidding me to make noise, and stayed up all night sex-skyping with all the lights on. She played Farmville all the time and started bringing 30 yr old creepy men into our room so she could sit in their lap and fuck. Her parents got her a room to herself after a while, blaming me (dean's list kid on a scholarship) for being a bad influence. The sugar never came off the floor.

Roommate #3 (Meghan) started out great like the others - as a friend even - but quickly turned into a passive aggressive bitch. She let the dishes pile up in the sink, left strange foods in the fridge to rot, and refused to speak to me, even when I had to let her in after losing her keys constantly. One night, as I took out the trash for her, I got locked out. We had a foot of snow on the ground and I wasn't dressed for more than a couple minutes outside. She decided to leave and lock the door when she knew I didn't have my key. I called her, didn't answer, texted and was told she couldn't come let me in because she was out with friends. I asked when she'd be back, she replied 3am. So there I waited from 6pm to 3am, outside, in the cold. After it was 4am, I texted again asking where she was and she replied she decided to go to school to work (we're art majors) and would be back at 6am. 6am came around, she still wasn't there and my phone was dying and I was freezing. No reply from her. I was woken up by a stranger, who happened to be roommate's friend, and he told me he got a text that if I wanted in I'd have to come now because she was leaving for a friend's house at 11:30. It was 11:30. I pounded on the door for half an hour to no reply. At 12:30 she opened the door and tried to slam it behind her, all without looking at me in my half-frozen state. I managed to wedge my hand in the doorway before it closed and got inside. First thing I did - scrubbed her toilet with her toothbrush. ","1341101333"

Wolves have none of that at all.  They don't comprehend pointing, although they *might* register that we are staring at something, but we would have to give them a lot of clues, such as stalking.  It's not that they are dumber than dogs, quite the opposite.  It's more akin to humans ""speaking English"", and wolves ""grokking Arcturian"".  Neither has any idea of what the other is saying/doing/thinking.

Wolf-dog hybrids on the other hand have some ability to read humans, it depends on breeding.  They usually understand pointing, looking and facial expressions nearly as well as a fully domesticated dog.

But they also have a wolf's intelligence and ""IDGAF about what you're doing, *I'm* going to do what *I* want"" attitude.

They are **NOT** harmless, and yes, that *is* why you are being downvoted.  Loyalty only extends to those the animal considers to be part of the pack.  Protectiveness may or may not be an asset, depending on what's going on.  Protective when someone is breaking into the house is one thing, but being protective when your neighbor's kids are rough-housing with yours is quite another.  To make matters worse, they might have a wolf's parental instincts, which means your kids will be disciplined the ""wolf way"".

That means getting smacked with bared teeth, or even nipped.  Not bitten, they'd lose an arm.  But wolves, wolf-dogs and some dogs will bare their teeth and slap you with them.  On fur, it makes no mark or damage.  On human skin, it leaves a frightening bruise and may even bleed a little.

Humans do *not* react well to seeing that happen to other adults, let alone their kids.  

It doesn't matter that the kids were stuffing a roasted hot dog down the animal's ear or something equally ridiculous or painful, the animal will be declared vicious and put down.  If you're lucky, that is.

So again, no.  Unless you are going to specifically breed for socialization, then a wolf-dog will only be what you describe out of sheer luck.","1341101350"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh man this one is so embarrassing, and creepy now that I think about it. So anyway back in the day, when I was a Junior in High School and still a somewhat socially awkward guy around the ladies, I had this one friend, a girl, who was really hot. Now at the time, AIM was still a thing, and people would chat all the time on it.

One day I was at my friend's house getting really, really, baked as teenagers tend to do. He went downstairs to make us some bagel bites and I was dicking around on his computer. I noticed his AIM was up, and that he was AIM buddies with the aforementioned hot girl (who we were both mutual friends with).

For whatever reason, in my extremely stoned mind, i thought it would be a good idea to type out something really really raunchy into the message box. So I typed in something like ""I want to ram you so hard in your tight pussy."" Now, I had no intention of sending this, and I was presumably doing it because my high brain thought it would be funny, but out of pure reflex I immediately hit enter. **FUCK**

She responded back, as one would imagine, with ""WTF did you just say?"". And I made up some BS about accidentally sending that to her instead of someone else, then quickly shut AIM down. Then my friend came back upstairs and we chowed down on some bagel bites and mountain dew.

The worst part was this was all on my friends account. And i never told him about it. So presumably she thought he was a total creeper from then on out. I never heard anything else about it so I guess she was too embarrassed to bring it up.

TL;DR: FRIEND MADE ME BAGEL BITES IN HIGH SCHOOL, I MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A CREEPY RAPIST.","1341101361"

If you want to blame anyone for the destruction of small farmers you might as well blame equipment manufacturers for creating the giant machines that make it possible for such a small number of people to do so much.  Also another reason why there are so few small farms is that the kids just end up moving to cities.

The vast majority of ""corporate farms"" are just family farms that incorporated for tax and liability reasons.  It might be different here though because the land is good enough to give higher margins of profit and allow smaller scale operations to exist.  Also my inheritance will always be worth something because the land is all paid for.  It's impossible to lose money at this point as long as we get crop insurance.  ","1341101369"

Your cpu runs at 3.4ghz and with turbo it'll goto 3.8 by overlocking you can push it to 4.0 or above but you'll get MUCH higher temps and suck more power. With The ivy bridge CPUs at 4.8 I got load temps of 90C with an Antec Kuhler 620.

It wasn't until my father died, then 4 months later my best friend died, both from natural causes, that I began thinking how much this would suck if their existence meant absolutely nothing.  Why bother existing at all if this is what awaits at the end?
  
Being familiar with death I too figured my time is short and probably won't live past 55, I began question why I even exist in the first place.  Tragedy after tragedy from being surrounded by both death and loss I broke down so bad that I begged and pleaded to the point I wanted to waste away and die.  Then my prayers got answered.  It wasn't sudden, but gradual, right then and there I've concluded that the universe is bigger than my understanding or what's written in science books. Fate suddenly became very real to me that existence isn't wasted. People serve a purpose not just for themselves but to interact with others. My life had become scripted and had I didn't exist, other people would have actually been affected because I wasn't there to serve my purpose to them.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Oh, a well presented issue for a change, that's refreshing.

First i'll make one thing clear, there are an infinite amount of possibilities for those constants, so whichever happens to exist, can be considered a ""huge coincidence"". But the fact is, one happened.

Coincidences are a demonstrable and observed situation, so by a reasonable standard it is still more logical than ""God did it"". Because ""God did it"" is not a demonstrable and observed situation, it is pure speculation.

---

Now we got that out of the way,

You present a false dilemma. You are saying that multiverse and god are equally logical. Yet it is absurd to say atheists all believe in the multiverse.(I am an atheist and i don't.)

One does not have to judge and believe one of those two.

I simply don't believe in God because i have no reason to do so. In more clear terms, i just assume less than a theist does, for i do not assume God exists. For the record, i don't assume the multiverse exists either.

When talking about those constants you must also realize that there's a layer of human interpretation there, what we see as constants in those ratios may just be properties or necessary laws of nature, and our languages puts them as numbers instead of their due place.

Because, if you want to argue that way, you'll also have to account that you need gravity's existence for life. As well as nuclear forces and any other you can think of. It's sort of a house of cards, you get rid of one thing, and stuff starts failing.

Either way, since none is actually reasonably considered more plausible and much more probable then the rest, i don't assume either as truth. I don't assume either as false either. I just make no assumptions on them.

---

To put a stop to this wrongfully accepted idea that at some point everything is too much of a coincidence, therefore God is more probable:

Of all possible scenarios, how much a coincidence is it that a God that can create this exact universe with those exact constants and gravity and so on, exists?

Can you see how introducing a God just adds up on the coincidence? Besides accounting for the existence of those, now you also have to account for the existence of a being which can create those, can calculate those and chose those.

And if you go through the ""necessary path"", then you might as well cut God out and say these properties and constants etc. are necessary. Because it assumes less.(aka Occam's Razor)

---

In conclusion, you can call the universe ""fine-tuned"" according to our standards, but that's basically word play, it serves no real purpose, it takes us no further than we are.(At least that i can see.)","1341101411"

Movies in general let us believe the good guys always win. These particular good guys have always won before, often against impossible odds. The genre, even just the man (Joss Whedon), everything around this has a pattern of either comic-book death, or outright *defying* death, or *very* occasionally, an actual, good, heartwarming death (like Book), with time to say goodbye, to see he died a good death, it wasn't pointless...

We barely got to know Mr. Universe. Kind of sad, but he did sell them out, and he was only there for the movie -- and only for very brief moments. It's hard to care more about him than if the twins had been killed.

If it was just Book, we would've gone into the final battle confident that everyone would survive, the good guys would come out on top, everything would be fine.

But because of how Wash died, everything else matters. When Zoe's hit in the back. When Simon is shot. When River jumps through the closing blast doors and is dragged off by Reavers. And, of course, when the Operative does his knifehand-pain-thing on Mal.

Any of those could've been another random, senseless death. We knew it, and the characters knew it. Even Jayne is terrified.

""Do you really think any of us are going to survive this?""

""Well, I might!""

Now, we could probably guess that things would turn out alright, and that ending would still have worked even if Wash were alive. But that was the warning that *shit just got real.* That was the point where I really could believe that most of the crew might die, if not all -- where I could believe that only River survives, and she's taken back to be experimented on...

Of course, that's unlikely, it's hard to imagine that ending actually working and not being universally hated. It would also suck if every movie that wants to create dramatic tension has to kill off a main character. But as far as seeming the most real and pointless, yet doing the most it possibly could for the dramatic tension of the entire movie, it couldn't have been better executed.","1341101426"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Only 1 out of the 5 shared places I've lived in I've been lucky to have all good housemates. 


First year at uni we had a couple of really loud girls on the same floor. We regularly trashed the kitchen during parties and cleaned up the next morning. They however would leave rotting food out, and keep eating it! We didn't see them for a couple of weeks and assumed they had major food poisoning. 


Then in my first shared house, one of the guys showered about twice a week. When he opened his door the smell would travel up the stairs and warn us he was up. He would follow us around constantly, creep out everyone who came over, try to add our friends on facebook he had never met. The smell and mess was disgusting, I never once noticed him clean. 


Then I had the good year. 


Final year at uni I lived with 2 people I knew and 1 stranger to take the last room. He never cleaned the house, ever. He did his dishes, but would leave all the rubbish from cooking on the sides for me to put in the bin. The kitchen was tiny, you could nearly reach the bin from any point in the kitchen. When the bin got full, and he was feeling generous and not leaving his stuff on the side he would just get a new bin bag, put his rubbish in it and leave it next to the bin. He would also bring rubbish down from his room and leave it by the bin in the kitchen. 

When this guy moved out we did an inspection of his room. It was filthy, still had rubbish, had pins on the floor. The worst part were the windows, he had a problem with black mold it turns out. Never asked for help on how to deal with it, never cleaned it. When we said he should come back and clean it or he would loose money from his deposit he said he tried. We wiped a gloved finger over it loads of mold came off, clearly didn't try hard. 

He was a nice guy though so although it was frustrating, we thought he was just a bit of a idiot rather than trying to get us to clean up after him. The guy from the second year though was an a-hole, hated living with him.



TL;DR: The worst thing about bad housemates is the smell!","1341101426"

"starcraft_strategy","t5_2smn2","Yes you are correct. 

1) its a beta layout that they are still working on.  It is not race specific yet and  I personally ended up modifying a decent amount of it to suit my own needs.  I was more concerned with being able to control shift/ctrl with my thumb than anything else.  Feel free to do the same.  

2) hardly anyone uses camera locations in SC2 (only a few BW pros).  They are not at all necessary for Zerg and less necessary for toss/terran since you need less hotkeys to control your army.  I have really only seen them used for terran rally pts... and in that case you need only 1 location.  I personally didn't want to learn how to inject with them for various reasons which was why I initially stared modifying the layout.  I prefer to have my queens hotkeyed individually, even though it takes ~1 sec to hit 4 hatches instead of .5 sec.  I think it is easier to respond to harass that way.

3) Nobody uses the go to last notification button... like really no one uses this.  I have no idea why they even bothered assigning a hotkey to it in ""the core"" layout.

I'm a zerg player if you didn't catch that already so I can send you what I have modded if you are picking that race.  If not like I said feel free to mod that layout however you like.  The only things I found important to keep were using your thumb for ""shift"", ""ctrl"", ""/"" (main buildings), and ""."" (adv. buildings).  They only recommended you pop of two keys on the bottom right, but I removed alt as well... mainly b/c I don't use camera keys and ""."" was a little difficult to hit otherwise.  I also condensed some of the stuff to get rid of any units, upgrades, or production that uses the lower keys such as n, m, and , These keys are hard to hit and will slow you down.

Lastly I ported most of the keys over from the standard layout on left side so I wouldn't have to re-learn how to build units or use control groups.  However, if I was learning from scratch I would make (I to \) my Number hotkeys and make (8 to =) unit production, buildings, etc .  I want to note that his type of arrangement is slightly more suitable for zerg than it is for toss and terran.  Why?  It's because zerg players usually hold down the unit production key most of the time they want to build something in quantities over 10.  For terran in particular you will probably be hitting unit production hotkeys more so it won't be as benificial, but I personally love to spam though my hotkeys and while 8 to 0 is super easy I to P just takes even less effort... I would say this is a very minor thing, but when you are mass gaming at 300-400 apm your hands do get tired and anything you can do to reduce strain helps.

If you would like me to help you create a layout with you I would be happy to help.  Just pm me your skype info.  Even if you don't play Z I could probably give you some insight into what would be good to change and what would be not so good to change based on how often things are used at the pro level... as well as keys that are needed or not needed for little micro tricks.

**Ultima I:** Played it after watching Spoony's retrospective of the series, and I honestly found it very difficult to complete.

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","Please treat me in precisely the same fashion as the OP, for all relevant aspects of the discussion (especially in terms of privilege). I habitually support pro-choicers politically, while having personal moral qualms.

The key argument Warren makes seems to be this:
""[A 7/8 month old fetus] is somewhat more personlike [than a very small embryo]; it can apparently feel and respond to pain, and it may even have a rudimentary form of consciousness, insofar as its brain is quite active. Nevertheless, it seems safe to say that it is not fully conscious, in the way that an infant of a few months is, and that it cannot reason, or communicate messages of indefinitely many sorts, does not engage in self-motivated activity, and has no self-awareness. Thus, in the relevant respects, a fetus, even a fully developed one, is considerably less personlike than is the average mature mammal, indeed the average fish.""

I think this argument superficially brushes away the fundamental concern here, which is that during the months of development a significant change has occurred within the fetus that make it capable of conscious experience. In these months, it seems likely that the systems that allow conscious experience have developed.
(FYI, I consider definitely non-conscious vegetables to have no moral status, and am uncertain enough about animals' moral status to be uncertain about whether it would be moral to kill mature mammals, if that were necessary to have abortions)","1341101465"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Actually, this is a bad example of correlation does not equal causation. It doesn't really need to. 90% is a very strong statistical advantage, and if this statistic holds true for a large sample size, then there are no bullshit conclusions to be drawn. Let me explain with an example:

If I say that 5% of the broader population get diagnosed with lung cancer, 20% of the broader population are smokers, and 90% of people with lung cancer are smokers, there is no causality between smoking and lung cancer, only a strong correlation. In spite of the lack of causation (once a strong marketing tool for tobacco companies), a statistician could easily infer from those numbers that smoking is directly related to the incidence of lung cancer.

An early gold advantage from farming and successful ganks results in a critical +- 12 min mark where snowballing ensures victory for the team with the small lead. Some team compositions are better suited for middle and late games, but even when these teams hold stronger players, they're still not coming out on top nearly as often as teams who gain and early gold advantage. What's more, some players buy gp5 items off setting their effectiveness until later in the game. OP's statistics pretty much indicate that these strategies are ineffective and teams must focus on early game leads to ensure victory. 

Personally, I don't think these stats are very meaningful simply because of the small and tilted sample size. Comparing results from a large number of games between teams with similar ELO ratings would make this a much more interesting topic.","1341101472"

None of those subjects are 'anti-theist'. They might counter *particular* assertions about a particular-god-concept. They don't have anything to do with god-concepts in general.

The big bang was conceived by a Catholic Priest, for example. 

Atheism is absence of god-beliefs. There's nothing that says a theist can't accept evolution and the big bang, and there's nothing that says an atheists must accept them (and some don't).

They only become an issue when theists insist on particular dogmatic beliefs about how particular things happened.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Apart from hunter gatherer tribes, anywhere you can get meat you can also get non-meat foods for cheaper.  

If veganism seems to be a '1st world luxury' its because:

- While you can get calories, protein and nutrients anywhere for less than you can get meat...you can't get fresh diverse produce everywhere and you can't get vegan b12 supplements everywhere.

- Frankly being vegan is almost certainly highly correlated to exposure to a certain type of culture that is present in the industrialized West, especially the Anglophone world, and not present in some other regions.  (Just like following a certain religion or appreciating a certain type of music).  

- Most vegans are leftwing and a great number of leftwing people are easily cowed into giving up moral claims in the face of people ostensibly less privileged than themselves indicating that the left-winger's morality is incompatible with the cultural practices or mores of the less privileged person  (note I am leftwing but this is a problem).  So, whether or not veganism is actually a first world luxury, telling vegans that they are privileged first worlders who don't understand the plight of oppressed peoples of the world, is a really effective way of shutting many of them up or at least getting them to modify their views when it comes to other cultures.

"picrequests","t5_2scp1","&gt;In the case of corporate identity, for example, it is easily enforceable - if a company tried to use your logo without paying you, you can do something about it.

How exactly is a corporate logo different than copyrighted intellectual property? Trademark and registration are basically the exact same things as the copyright of something like a photographer's images. In fact, you should talk to a graphic designer by profession to find out how they are the *very same circumstance*, but for now I can give you a quick rundown:

A designer is contracted to construct an identity for a company. They are paid an amount up front - this amount is to lock them into the work and a contract that states that they will provide the expected service for the company. They then design a logo. This logo, however, retains in the copyright of the agency or the designer. When copies of the logo are transferred as specs for discussion, they are kept low-resolution and watermarked, to avoid the company from taking them before they are finalized and paid for. When the company is happy with the product, the designer is paid again for *the finished product*, high-resolution, unwatermarked copies are transferred, and the copyright then is in the hands of the company, who pursues legal registration for their mark, so no one else can take it. By the way, all of this money and legality is surrounding an intangible good (a logo), and is enforceable by law.

A photographer does the exact same thing, especially in a portrait session. The subject pays an amount up front - this is the same contract that states that the photographer will provide his services to the customer. This covers the fees of the photographer (film, development, equipment, time, what have you) but he does not necessarily make a profit. Then, once the pictures are created, he puts them up for sale to the subjects. The subjects then pay the photographer a second fee for the *finished product*, rather than the session itself. They do not necessarily have to buy the finished product if they are unhappy with it; they paid the photographer to compensate his time, they do not necessarily have to pay him for anything further, just as the company paid the designers for their time and effort before paying for the final logo.

But without the second exchange of currency, the copyright and legal rights to the intellectual property *stay with the original creator*. It is the second exchange that effectively transfers the rights to its use. And thus is the creative process's relation to how artists make money. Do you know why you don't pay for movies twice, or music? Because you don't receive the rights to it. 

You might be a fan of video games. How do you feel about piracy of video games? You may do it, but how do you feel about it? Is it wrong because video games are a ""tangible good""? A disc that can be burned and inserted into a computer or game system to provide a piece of software? Well, print out a photograph. Suddenly, that photograph becomes as much a tangible good as a video game or a DVD. 

The laws surrounding copyright infringement get lost on the freedom fighters of the internet often, those who don't understand why they shouldn't be given everything for free and that they are entitled to everything. This is an incredibly narrow viewpoint, and I hope that this post explained a little bit and gave some insight into how the process of currency exchange for creative, ""intangible"" goods works.","1341101494"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I would guess that skim milk is more nutrient-dense per calorie, because fat has 9 calories per gram while protein and carbohydrate both have 4 calories per gram. 

150 calories (about a cup) of whole milk has 8g fat, 12g carbohydrate, and 8g protein. 

150 calories (almost two cups) of skim milk has 0g fat, 22g carbohydrate, and 15g protein. 

Assuming that it's possible to remove fat from without removing anything else, there would be more vitamins and minerals in the skim milk per calorie because whole milk is more calorie-dense. 

[This chart](http://www.dairycouncilofca.org/Milk-Dairy/Nutrients-in-Milk.aspx) might be useful, but remember to double the measurements of vitamins/minerals in the skim milk column because it is approximately half as calorie-dense, meaning that you can consume twice as much of it. ","1341101497"

There are only a few woman that are naturally beautiful with or without makeup.  Just look at how many movie stars look awful without makeup and you will see how much it helps.  

Until you develop a really deep and loving relationship you are in competition with every woman out there.  If you have developed that kind of relationship you can gradually drop the makeup.  Then if he has a problem with you not wearing makeup sometimes, you can assume he would leave you for someone else eventually anyway.  He is just not that into you.

This is [my build](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#WXVYhO!WgU!aaYcbY). It is targeted for end game gear. This biggest difference is I do way more damage. I got rid of Meteor for Explosive Blast - Short Fuse. With a 40% crit chance rate I can use Frost Nova/Explosive blast non stop for 150K damage shots in large mobs. Since I have such a high crit rate I dropped cold snap for Bone Chill(15% more dmg) and use the passive Cold Blooded for 20% more dmg on top. 

Everything is built around use the Nova/Explosive Blast combo. I consider short fuse a must. For simply one reason - Elites don't stay frozen long at all. You have a very short window to deliver the most amount of damage. So as soon as they are frozen you use short fuse for instant damage. 

I have a AP on crit of 10 so I don't need prodigy/astral presence. I use Temporal Flux for the 30% slow down rate. I want everything to be as slow as possible. Especially ranged monsters running away from me. I also use Wicked Winds/Temporal Flux when I need to kite things. I can get good crit rate while kiting them to a better location. Most of the time I am not kiting away from elites. But the true beauty of this build is the bigger the mob the better off you are. So with tough elite packs I kite them TOWARDS big white trash mobs. So I can get crits off them while attacking the elites. ","1341101506"

Saudi Arabia I don't think would ever have a one country inclusive sales but some of the other oil producing countries may turn away from America.

I think it's a long game. You have to secure resources for the future. The way it's done is the disgusting part. America now has some very large bases to operate from in Iraq and Afghanistan. A product of both wars has established a base to launch operations from to anywhere in the Middle east. Of course, apart from the military aspects (which i believe has been used to secure oil), there are shady political and financial deals to make sure they get the contacts to drill for oil.

China is investing in parts of Africa and the Middle East and I think America recognise the potential to lose some of its resources which as you can imagine can be catastrophic.

Why do you suppose a lot of countries that have been invaded are oil producing countries? No one would give a damn about the Middle East if it didn't have oil. It would be like Africa.

Lastly I'll say the people that benefit the most from securing oil is the people that finance and drill it. Sure, local populations benefit from jobs and cash injections the local community receive often from oil companies as a deal sweetener, but ultimately their oil is being extracted, there is an environmental impact and it's only fractions of the value of the oil they ever see.","1341101519"

If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him. More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him.” -Miyamoto Musashi, Book of the five rings.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My great uncle was at normandy, and other locations too.

we're talking about state-mandated rehab, not the issue of legality. i believe in state-mandated rehab if necessary for all drugs (except tobacco and marijuana, probably). the problem is how to make state-mandated rehab effective without using jail time as the alternative, and also when to say an addict needs help.

to specify, i'm speaking about former marijuana (not really the issue), alcohol, cocaine, and amphetamine addicts i know who are relatively functional if left alone, but have destroyed their families and friends emotionally and (somewhat) financially since i guess they ""cared too much"". these former addicts would not have gotten better if they had not been arrested and forced through state-mandated rehab, with most their charges being dropped at the end (usually DUI, possession, disorderly conduct, sometimes resisting arrest). they are now clean and pursuing their dreams, rather than drugs.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Those hostile to House Arryn might find the tribals not to be the largest of problems, but that tangental to the larger issue that the Bloody Gate, and the High Road are not the only ways into the Vale.  Gulltown, Heart's Home, the Sisters, and the Fingers are all places mentioned within the Vale where ships might (and do) land.  

Old Anchor, Strongsong, Runestown, Coldwater Burn, Wickerden, and Snakewood are also places mentioned on maps and in appendices where you might be able to sail.

Sansa and Littlefinger traveled into the Vale by first going to the Fingers, then making their way to the Eyrie.  Presumably they didn't sail all the way from the Fingers down to Saltpans to then travel past the mountain clans on the High Road, pass the bloody gate, and travel up to the Eyrie.  The lords, likewise, are unlikely to sail out of the Vale to walk back in.  So there must be some alternate route to even the Eyrie, from within the Vale.

The Arryns themselves were Andal invaders that took the Vale from the sea.

Armies attempting to conquer the Vale in the Age of Heroes often were destroyed at the Bloody Gate because, frankly, sea travel was not well developed in the Age of Heroes.","1341101547"

Similarly, another idea is that if you're taking money from citizens and companies to pay people to do things that aren't needed (or which are just simply inefficient, given it's not a market need), then those companies and people  can't use that money to instead create businesses or jobs to hire the people who are currently unemployed.

are you one of those 'end of the world' kinda guys?

What disaster? If you work and have a 9 to 5 you will have a paycheck and might have savings and cash on hand. If you own a small business and the end of world comes what are you going to do sell your website for food? If all hell is breaking loose the last thing I want to be is a small business owner with all my assets and money tied up in equipment, intellectual property etc. Maybe I am not thinking this through all the way but as a small business owner I can tell you I am always poor. I pay myself last and I can always spend more on advertising, hire some more help, or revamp the website etc. I'm listed high on seo but I heard about some new twitter sniping project I can do, maybe I should eat ramen again and spend some more on adwords. 

As for the 9 to 5 you missed my point. I was talking about with 9 to 5 and set schedule (work for the man jobs)once you are off you are off. It's not your ship. Sure you work hard and are a team player but if the place gets robbed, site gets hacked or all your contracts go to china, then guess what? it doesn't really matter too much. Sure you may have to get another job, but like someone smart once told me- 'if I can get a job here, then I can get a job somewhere else'

Just saying it's not all easy and you are a success story and barely scraping at 30%. One thing I want to make crystal clear that is just because you are in business and PROFITABLE doesn't mean you are killing it. I am talking about any business. 

It is cool to not take shit from a boss? sure. Is it cool to plan you own hours and structure the whole deal ( right down to the type of spiral notebooks you buy)??

Sure.

But your boss is now the client/customer/user and now you have to suck dick like you never have before ,because you don't want a bad yelp review or to be sued. You don't want a liability issue and you certainly don't want to fuck up taxes or anything to do with OSHA, EEOC etc.. You better be on your game and good luck sipping ritas the whole time in cancun. You need to be involved and on it. 

You might be lucky and be a trust fund baby like donald trump.. most of us live in real world..same as OP. I love it when trust fund babies start bullshit businesses and it almost doesnt matter whether or not it makes money... and if it doesn't so what? fuck them. That's not who I am talking about..

Being in business for self is tough and don't let OP or anyone else romanticize it.. It's a tough world and if you are going to start business I say go for it... But also with 9 to 5 enjoy that time off away from it and that pleasure to do anything you want from 5 pm FRI until 11PM sunday night when you go to sleep. There's some charm in that, and being in business for self is not the bees knees. Like I said I have worked everyday since 2005. I'm fucking jaded don't let me be a hindrance.. just know what you are getting yourself into anonymous redditor that read this far.. and wants to start own business. Have some dough to cover expenses. Prepare for that ramp up period and remember you might not make big money all the time or at the beginning. As my dad used to say 'the donkey dies while the grass grows' My business was no different.. Have operating cash with 0 income for a good year and then really be honest with what it will make and go for it. Try not to take on too much debt. I have an SBA loan and it's supposed to be gov't but in the end these bastids are charging all kinds of lame ass set up fees and the interest is 9%. Maybe I got shafted on the loan but they are a small lenders doing SBA government loans. You would think the gov't wouldnt be in on the pillaging. You think regular banks like chase and bank of america will loan to small businesses? haha yeah right the banks aren't for small business and anyone who thinks that is shitting themselves. fuck the big banks too. Not to be all typical reddit but a credit union gave me a decent personal loan that I ended up of course applying towards expenses with the business. So there again patching around and playing with banks. Thankfully not too deep in debt but man everything I sell now I have to take into account the interest on the sba loan. Maybe one of you accounting types will tell me that should deduct that, and maybe on page 47 in my taxes it is.. I can ask the CPA but all I know is when I worked at the restaurant or shoe store when I was 18 I could fill out my shit on turbo tax in 10 seconds. more money more problems I suppose but working 9 to 5 is typically not a referesher in tax code. In your own business you better know something. Certainly my account is a nice lady and I can use quickbooks.. and all sorts of other snappy tools to get me there, but at the end of the day I am still the one supplying her the details. That can take time and is tedious as fuck. sorry for my rant. If one of my businesses ever does well I will buy you a ferrari OP. Since that's probably not going to happen then at least be advised that my heart is one the side of hoping I can get that ferrari. My bet is with you. I'm on the same team. let me get us there. rant over. sorry.

"Republican","t5_2qndt","I feel lie is a strong word. The main problem is their main pundits really don't know what they're talking about nor do they have any real obligation to know what they're talking about. When they make false statements, most of the time they believe what they're saying to some extent. Purposeful lying isn't the word. Willful ignorance is more accurate. The actual news shows on the channel will say when they've messed up. But the talk shows? They stick to it through and through which is what makes it willful ignorance. Once again the big problem is they have no obligation or motivation for that matter, to gain a better understanding of what they're talking about. Their reputations are already in the toilet and to be more accurate is to be less controversial and lose ratings.

They're not lying. They're just wrong.

I was going to give you a bunch of links but I figured it be better to just give you the pages and let you see how many of the pundits statements are true and then do some comparison

A few bad examples first of Fox pundits and their favorite guests
Bill O'Reilly:http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bill-oreilly/

Ann Coulter: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ann-coulter/

Glenn Beck: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/glenn-beck/statements/

And of course, Rush: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/statements/


And then some good

Sean Hannity: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/sean-hannity/


Now lets look at some liberal personalities huh?

Paul Krugman (popular NYTimes opinion columnist) is very good: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-krugman/statements/

Keith Olberman is meh: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/keith-olbermann/statements/

Same with Rachel Maddow: http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rachel-maddow/statements/

The main running theme here is that these people have their own popular well known segments on our biggest media sources (radio stations, FOX, MSNBc, and NYTimes). The person with the best ratings for truth is Paul and he has major differences. First, his segment is the only one in print, and not just any print, but in one of the oldest most well respected newspapers in the country. His ""channel"" is built on telling the news as accurately as possible and constantly updates its readers on mistakes made. The very nature of a written article requires it to be very well thought out, not just spat up.

As for everyone else, their job is to sit down and just talk. Yes they plan these things out, but most of their shows are interviews and conversations and those really can't be planned. By their nature, people are forced to make generalizations and exagerations. The human memory is only so good.


Sean Hannity is very close to Krugman. He is admittedly an enigma amongst his T.V. peers, though he can be seen repeating their original lies often.

Besides Sean, Fox generally does worse than MSNBC in terms of truthiness when ranking their most well known contributers. Ed Schultz and Bill Maher pull them down, but I didn't include them since politifact only had 3 ratings for each and I thought a fair analysis required more.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;The point is that in a hierarchical file system each file can only have one location. If you have made a photo in New Year in the year 1993, where does it go? ""photos/by location/New York"" or ""photos/by year/1993""? Both? None? There is no way to solve this issue properly in a file system that forces you into one fixed hierarchy, as the data you try to organize simply doesn't fit into a single hierarchy.

/Users/JoeSmith/Pictures/Travel/New York/72nd Street 1993.jpg

I can search by type (travel), state, street and year. It requires a tiny bit of thought to name the file actually so does your system.

Searching by those things only works if someone is willing to take the time to input the metadata. I go travelling anywhere and take 500 pictures and you expect me to input all that information?

Actually, I probably would but if you think someone who makes a shit tip of their file system is going to do that then you're having a laugh.

And by using folders and file have an nearly unlimited choice of things to tag an image as in a relatively quick fashion. You method suggest it'll be hard coded to limited choices, it's a generic text area to input anything (thus making some searching options painful or impossible) or you can to define search options (ie wanting to add street as a sort  / search option) which means anything prior to that point requires me going back and filling in the meta data for each one where as a simpel drag &amp; drop into a new folder may resolve the issue.

A quick google search show most people don't even rename their files so you can easily find piles of photos with standard file names generated by photos, cameras, etc. So while you can argue that proves that people can't be bothered to rename their files which *could* break my methodology it makes your suggestion useless because a person that lazy is not going to setup the necessary meta data.

Taking 1000 pictures on a holiday trip could require only making a few folders name smartly and then dump all the files into it without renaming them and you're done in a couple minutes. Maybe your way will only take a couple minutes too or it'll take longer. So I'm not really seeing the benefit and I'm not seeing how it convinces people who are too lazy now to tag things.

&gt;Your OS only allows query by directory and filenames. Everything else is an application specific hack that tries to replicate features of a proper database, all to often in an extremely slow, ugly, outdated and incomplete manner. When your file manager searches for files with a given date, it is forced to look at all files on the system, which is why that process takes so long. 

Even if that were true  to be honest is about all you're going to get out of people. As I say if they're too lazy to organise files why will they provide metadata? Unless you mean the default meta data (which won't work on old photos or even a lot of photos from the net).


If you're relying on photo meta data then that may not be perfect when trying to convert long. &amp; lat. to a name and you have to do that because no one will search by long. &amp; lat.

I can already search on meta data. I just tested spotlight and put in a value for a focal length for an image I took. It returned that and some of the others I had taken. I can also search for program and it returns a link that will open the program, help documentation and then other results that may contain my search string in case I didn't want the program but something else instead.

Windows lets you search on meta data too (not sure about image meta data) and all operating systems allow you search the contents of files when it makes sense (text based documents). 

Windows only downfall is that it doesn't index data (as far as I know) so it's slower. A mac does index it, it's instantaneous, groups my results by types and it doesn't require me to do anything other than dump the file on the drive and more importantly I still have full access to the file system and because it's unix based I can pretty much guarantee where ever my file is it's in my home folder.

Windows does have the downfall that it makes it too easy to put files anywhere unlike Linux and OSX which do their best to confine you to your folder and they give you sensible default folders like pictures, downloads, documents, etc all of which are accessible as well without navigation through something like Windows file explorer.

I can understand if you're using Windows maybe you don't think things work well enough but I think everyone else has already solved any problems and it didn't require abstracting the file system away from the user.","1341101580"

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","A while ago I had a thread where I posted my regular makeupless face, and while it was mortifying, I received some invaluable tips. Since that time, I've invested in some new products, including Caryl Baker Visage [Shadow Magnet, in Light](http://www.carylbakervisage.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;Itemid=17&amp;category_id=46&amp;product_id=144). I am BLOWN AWAY by what this stuff does to my regular old department store makeup!!!

* Eyeshadow: Blue is the royal blue in [CG tropical fusion](http://imgur.com/a/XGuQa).
  Purple is the brighter purple ""lid"" shade from the [Maybelline stylish smokes quad, in amythest smokes](http://www.maybelline.ca/products/88/eyes/eye-shadow/expertwear-eyeshadow-quads/amethyst-smokes/6?shadeId=450&amp;view=shades&amp;position=746)
  Orangey gold is Golden Sunrise in the [CG Golden Sunrise trio](http://www.ezauctionet.com/ebay_photos/2492_a.jpg)
  Light Yellow is First Light from the same CG Golden Sunrise trio.

* Eyeliner was ""[Denim](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/343692/300.JPG)"" from Prestige on the outside, and on the inside I used a Wet n Wild shimmer eye pencil in ""[Copper](http://img.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/07780251570_450x450_a.jpg)""

* Lips: I used a base of L'Oreal Infallible lipstick in [Unending Kiss](http://cn1.kaboodle.com/img/b/0/0/1a2/6/AAAAC2l7JLYAAAAAAaJrjA/loreal-infallible-le-rouge--unending-kiss.jpg?v=1321681311000) which is my favourite lipstick ever, it's the first colour I've found that REALLY matches my colouring. Over that I put a thin layer of some gold sparkly Mary Kay lip gloss that I've had forever.

* Mascara was Maybelline Great Lash in brownish black

* Eyebrows: I did use a tiny bit of eyebrow pencil; [Annabelle in medium brown](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0NEI05QULcY/TVbYvZbkcoI/AAAAAAAAABc/nyZUY67kS8s/s1600/annabelleeyebrow.jpg). Yes, I'm aware that they need a trim, that is being taken care of post haste. 

* Rest of my face: Other than that, the only other makeup I used was a concealer, [Caryl Baker Camouflage in ""Fair""](http://www.carylbakervisage.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;Itemid=17&amp;category_id=2&amp;product_id=212).


Lessons were learned today. Chief among those lessons is that I need to invest in a blending brush. Also, I have made up my mind to get eyebrow gel. I hope you all find some small part of this look to like, and, as always, I BEG for constructive criticism. Thank you, guys and gals, this funkiness would not be possible without your sage-like guidance.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I would say that depends on your definition of ""religion"". Yes, religion is *extremely* varied, but it must have at least one quality in common for it all to be called by the same term, yes?

I would claim that quality is faith, or theistic belief, which I would define as belief without, and in some cases despite of, valid evidence. In other words, theistic belief is belief in something merely because one wishes too (this may be consciously or subconsciously). Without that quality, theistic belief, it is just a philosophy, not a religion.

Buddhism is a particularly good example, as it has a significant number of followers of both the religious and philosophical types, the difference being the theistic belief or lack thereof.","1341101634"

"science","t5_mouw","It's not that we prefer them--rather it is that it makes them easier to mass produce. When you are going to grow tomatoes in a vast mechanized farming operation, you need uniform size and shape so that is easier to design mechanical harvesting equipment for them, and you need uniform color so you can more easily recognize when they are ready to harvest. You also want need to mature at the same rate so they all come ready to harvest at the same time.

Notice that ""tasty"" and ""nutritious"" were not on the list of attributes you need. Farmers, and the giant agribusiness companies that buy and process their tomatoes, do not actually object to taste and nutrition. If someone developed a tomato that had all those attributes they need and was tasty and nutritious, they probably would happily mass produce them.

In addition, have kids. Cute ones. Encourage them to seek their own meanings in life be it religion, atheism, music, art, math, school, sports, etc. but emphasize that whatever their path, be the best they can be at it. 

It doesn't hurt to take a gazillion pictures of them and email/send them to your in-laws. Hopefully that will help them look past your differences and see what they are missing when they act in the manners that they do.

"economy","t5_2qhpn","Our wealth has been systematically and legally stolen. Since 1913 our money has lost 98% of its value. The Federal Reserve has stated goals of devaluing the currency. This is no secret. What people fail to realize is that inflation is theft by the government and by the elites on a massive scale. Inflation, by definition, punishes savers and fixed incomes. Imagine this: 

There is $100 of sound money in circulation. You have $10 in the bank i.e. 10% of all wealth. The government decides it must increase the money supply for whatever bs corrupted reason they can come up with. So they decide to PRINT $50 more. Printing money does not create wealth. So now there is $150 in circulation. (The $50 of fiat [read: fake] money has been given to large banks) You still have $10 in the bank. However, you no longer have 10% of the wealth in the economy. Your $10 in the bank can only buy you 7.5% of the economy, instead of 10% of the economy. You did nothing to lose this wealth, but what might have bought you 4 bushels of apples yesterday only buys three today. 

So where did your wealth go? Ultimately, it ends up mostly in two places. Either the largest banks are allowed to make loans where they can't lose (because the Federal Reserve lends them money at artificially low rates of &lt;1%) Or the Fed ""buys"" treasury bonds by dumping money into the economy (Politicians love this because they can raise funds without having to vote for a tax increase) The Treasury uses the printed money to finance government pipedreams where it eventually comes back an bites the ass of John Q Public. See, the Fed buys the bonds. Like all bonds, the Treasury has to pay interest on them. The US Treasury is indebted to the US Federal Reserve. Meaning eventually they have to sell more bonds to pay for their debt, which means the Fed prints more money, thus devaluing the real wealth in the economy and creating a vicious circle. 

Today many of the problems the typical American family faces are due to debt slavery. Banks make profit by making loans to consumers and earning interest on those loans. In a free market, Banks have a limited supply of money and stand to lose A LOT if they make loans to individuals who cannot afford what they are applying for financing for. So they have to make careful decisions, balancing risk and reward. This process has been destroy mainly by two things. Congressional ""reform"" in the name of ""equality"" that forces lending to individuals who cannot afford loans. And the big one: The Federal Reserve loans to big banks at unrealistically low rates. Basically, banks have an unlimited supply of nearly free money. So they cannot lose (until the scheme crashes, like it did it 2007-08). Even if a loan goes bad, the money was free to the bank anyways and they stand to lose nothing. In the end, it is the consumer who is screwed. They have to pay back a debt of fake money. And the real income that they are earning is being systematically devalued and savers are consistently punished by inflation. What's more is that in the last 50 years it has become tradition for companies to offer health care benefits instead of larger salaries. This is a huge problem because the cost to companies is steadily rising, but the employee is not being paid more because their spending money is stagnant due to rising health costs. But health care being fubar'd is a whole other topic. 

All of this combined has an effect on all prices of everything in the economy. Inflation makes day to day things near affordable for some since incomes and savings are devalued constantly. Additionally, all of this amounts to a horribly inefficient allocation of resources. 

In summery: The Federal Reserve has absolutely destroyed any notion that we are operating in a free market. The system is corrupted beyond recognition and only benefits the wealthy and powerful. Inflation has robbed the American people of real wealth. ","1341101648"

There are so many people in this city who don't even root for the Bills. It's like saying a franchise in San Antonio is going to take away from the Texans and Cowboys. A small percentage maybe, but any fan worth his salt will still follow both teams or remain with his or her original team. All we need is to build a new stadium which could arguably be said for London as well  because Wembley is much better suited for soccer.

I just felt/feel the need to rant about the black market that weed prohibition has created: 

Growing a few of these harmless plants, that are native to 6 continents, that man has benefited by since the nomad days, is a federal crime that results in a person being sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, ever. Why take that risk? Same as the meth producer just better for your health: the plant sells for approximately $5 THOUSAND per pound and can be resold for DOUBLE. Well fucking a, that's a just arrangement. But it only gets better, all of those productive members of society who are arrested for paying this king's ransom for the illegal plant.... no we don't fine these people, we put them in jails so that all of society can pay the cost of rendering these people unable to earn money ie fuck there lives up. touche government, an astute plan.

your own words here

&gt;Keep in mind Chael also threw over 300 punches so him 'laying' in silva's guard as you put it, might have been simple I dunno... fatigue? 

The smart move for a tired Sonnen would have been avoiding the ground and backing away from Silva's strikes for the last round, he was up huge he didn't need to do anything in the 5th round besides avoid the KO and Sub and come on the guy has 'great boxing' right so why not depend on that?  And again just like in my original comment, Chael is a one dimensional fighter, who even in when it's in his best interest to change his game up, refuses to.

You twisted this into a Silva vs Sonnen debate, what I've said in my original comment and previous replies to you has very little to do with their first fight.

One was hilarious, but had a nasty habit of exposing himself.

One was a rich kid from the Middle East who didn't understand that in America, weed wasn't 'a moral issue, man' but rather a practical one, vis a vis *everyone would lose their scholarships if it was found in our room*. Also, incapable of speaking at anything less than *yelling*.

One was a deeply closeted self-hating nerd who was obsessed with being a 'cool kid'.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","&gt; Are you serious?

Yes.

&gt; You might pick up a thing or two from the study of social linguistics.

I have studied linguistics, including sociolinguistics, formal semantics and pragmatics. That's likely why you find my discussions ""obsessive"". 

&gt; But here's a news flash: A UFO, under that construct, is no more meaningful than the fact that if I'm walking out the door and something catches my eye and I do a double take, that for a split second I had a Unidentified In House Object experience.

This is *precisely* why I wanted to define UFO more rigorously. When you take say Edward Condon or Carl Sagan's definition of UFO as any report which is unidentified to the observer, you end up talking about a mess of meaningless misidentifications. A UFO under this definition is a tautology because of the imperfection of human perception. If instead you take J. Allen Hynek's definition of UFO as a report which remains unidentified *after* analysis by competent scientists, you end up having to confront some extremely strange cases that are defy rational explanation. If you happen to be interested I could gladly link you to some Unknowns as well as the relevant scientific analysis that classified them as such. 

&gt; Funny how in /r/UAP there aren't many articles about the fallibility of human perception, or how the zeigiest of particular phenomenon can lead to uneven reporting of said phenonmenon.

You know I've been thinking about a good post on just this subject. We have our [Posting Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/UAP/comments/jkdyf/posting_rules/) and we generally encourage people to emphasize verifiable facts over speculation. But a post about human psychology, perception and perhaps epistemology as a larger question would be useful. Can you recommend any good resources? Even better you could submit such a post yourself. Maybe one such reference is Donald Menzel's paper in the book [UFOs: a Scientific Debate](http://www.amazon.com/Ufos-Scientific-Debate-Norton-library/dp/0393007391?tag=duckduckgo-d-20). It offers a list of some 400 conventional sources for UFO reports and also discusses the similarities between UFO reports and beliefs in witchcraft in Europe. I frequently recommend this book as a best text on UFOs anyway. 

&gt; People can imagine and invent great conspiracies to entertain themselves, as long as their entertaining, but when it comes to your precious UFOs being ANYTHING other than common objects or natural phenomenon being mispercieved, well now that's our fault here at /r/skeptic.

The hypothesis that UFOs can all be explained as misidentification of natural phenomena or human observational or mental distortion does not hold up. It is absolutely true that many reports begin as UFO reports and end as IFOs because of these reasons. This hypothesis breaks down when we start talking about cases involving multiple modes of observation [[1]](http://dewoody.net/ufo/Science_in_Default.html) and physical traces [[2]](http://www.reddit.com/r/UAP/comments/s2qzs/1981_transenprovence_ufo_case_peerreviewed_paper) [[3]](http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_04_1_vallee_1.pdf). I'd be more than happy to discuss those references or provide others if you're interested.

&gt; that doesn't change it as a meaningful comment about the disassociation between physical evidence and biased laiden perception. In short: we're impressed by the idea - not who said it.

As you can image, I do not agree that the quote is accurate. [I already replied to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/vtuo6/five_good_reasons_to_believe_in_ufos_national/c57sww4) if you'd care to engage any of my arguments or examples. 

&gt; Is that enough of a skeptical response to your UFOs?

"buffy","t5_2sd68","I don't see Xander as the ultimate good guy friend that many people do. I still appreciate his character because he's realistic and interesting, but I don't think he's always a very good friend. 

As early as season one, we see him get mad when he is rejected by Buffy and hate the suitor she chooses over him...typical ""nice guy"" move. Despite knowing how rejection feels, he happily ignores Willow's feelings toward him. This continues into early season 2. 

At the end of season 2, he chooses to keep vital information from Buffy in regards to Angel because of his own feelings. Whether or not those feelings are valid (I tend to agree with him when it comes to Angel), it wasn't really his call to make. 

In seasons 4 and 5, Xander seems like he has really started to mature and acts like a great friend. He's secure in his relationship with Anya (although I think he belittles her too often) and I think that makes it easier for him to be just a friend to Buffy and Willow. It helps that Willow has completely removed any chances of a romantic relationship with him by coming out in season 4. As for his pro-Riley attitude, I have read arguments that Xander can actually see himself in the ""regular boyfriend"" role that Riley fills, which is why he supports their relationship but I'm not so sure where I stand on that. 

In season 6, Xander is a terrible friend. The way he acts when he finds out about Buffy and Spike is just awful. At the end of Entropy, his behavior can be excused by the shock of seeing Anya with Spike. In Seeing Red, he acts like he's Buffy's father and it's really gross and unnecessary. Why should she have to justify her actions to him? They aren't children anymore and it wouldn't hurt if he showed a little compassion to a friend who has been struggling the way that Buffy has. 

In season 7, we get lovable Xander again. 

Every character on BtVS is fascinating for their flaws and Xander is no exception. I don't think he's the best friend, I think he can be petty, jealous, and paternalistic....but he's also loyal and reliable, characteristics that are clearly appreciated by his friends. ","1341101683"

I can't imagine them catching up with Intel for at least 3 years with their current technology—well, I couldn't imagine them catching up with Intel ever at this point—but the minimum seems to be 3 years, and until they can start giving them a run for their money I don't see much reason to invest in the stock.

If he's on your team, help him do roshan by having wards up where the enemy might strike, and be prepared to stop early pushes.  If he's on the enemy team, ward roshan, and push early before he gets really farmed. Is that a balance issue?

Second, you need to study the new CBA and how it will affect roster building and free agency. I know that right now teams like Denver aren't getting very far but in a few years if you have a team built by specialization it will fare a lot better than a team crippled by its superstars due to the effects of the CBA. In fact I think it will be better to build a team with six or seven solid players than with one or two superstars (I don't think big threes will be able to come together any more) simply because of better preparedness for injuries and the immense advantage good role players will have over the scrubs that teams with stars will have to sign.","1341101689"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; Is it really considered a new idea just because you took it from a computer and it's now on a phone?

As I understand it, that's *actually* what ""unobvious"" refers to in patent law. IANAL, but if something is ""obvious"" it means each part of the claim already appears in other patents and you're just combining stuff. (I.e., it doesn't mean ""anyone could have thought of that."") So, yeah, this should have been tossed, if that's all there is to it.

However, you also have to read the patent prosecution history. I.e., to understand what the patent *actually* covers, you have to read all the letters between the patent lawyers and the patent office. The patent tells you how to do what they did, but it doesn't necessarily indicate what you're not allowed to do. I.e., it tells  you how to practice the invention, but it doesn't tell you specifically what the patent holder can prevent you from doing, which might be a subset of what's actually covered in the patent.

&gt; Software patenting needs to be reevaluated. 

All patenting needs to be reevaluated.

&gt; Fun fact: Patents actually only apply to machines.

Well, and nowadays process patents as well. It's hard to come up with a good way to say ""you can patent a new process to more efficiently make this drug"", but not ""you can patent a new process to more efficiently operate this machine attached to a computer.""","1341101703"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Like others said, it was basically market saturation. Too many games were being released too often so people became less excited about each release, which dropped sales.

The thing is though, there are plenty of games that used the same general formula of rapid releases that rely on the same basic formula that are successful. Just look at the Madden games (or almost any EA sports game): They release a game every year and most of the time the only differences are updated rosters, graphical improvements, and a few new features. Plus both Madden and Guitar Hero/Rock Band are trying to reach a more mainstream audience, so why did Madden succeed where Guitar Hero/Rock Band failed? I think there are two reasons:  

1. Sports games are released on a yearly schedule, so you know around when a new game will come out every time (usually just before the season starts). The problem with the rhythm games is that, since you had multiple companies competing with each other, customers often didn't know when new games were going to be released, or if they existed at all. 

2. (And I think this is the most important issue) Rhythm games often required you to purchase new gear with every update. While the average person might be willing to part with $60 for a new game, asking for $100-$200 for every new release is just too much money. Any innovation in a rhythm game is most likely going to come from the hardware, and the average consumer doesn't want to buy a new plastic guitar when they've already got one. And if you don't want to buy the new plastic instruments, the only to get a new game is the songs, in which case buying individual songs as DLC makes much more sense then spending $60 on a pack of songs that you might only like 10 or so of.

"batman","t5_2qqt8","&gt;he was just too dead for my taste.

You should look into the making of the movie, they wanted it to feel like a dream turned into a nightmare. 

You don't even know his character's name in the movie. It's a different movie to be sure, but for me it was incredibly refreshing. The body language is awesome.

I just realized that Bryan Cranston was also in Drive ; another GREAT choice for Jim Gordon. 

Getting back to Gosling. If you see him in Crazy Stupid Love he does a great job at the ""playboy type"". Something needed for Bruce Wayne's public persona. 

Then if you see him in Drive and in Ides of March he's very vengeful and focused. He has the body language to pull off the times when Bruce is alone and deep in thought about his past. 

Not to mention if they're going to do a reboot and restart the story then John Hamm is out. He's too old to pull off a younger Bruce Wayne. Unless they jump in like the 1989 Batman.

The writing, the directing, the cinematography, the music, the casting (with one or two exceptions), the action sequences, and so on were all excellent.

The movie only had two real flaws that I'm aware of - Ozymandias could have been cast better and Malin Akerman's emotional acting on Mars could have been done a little better. Granted, those are noticeable flaws, but the movie just had so much RIGHT going for it, that those flaws are tiny by comparison.

People like to toss around the word economy and then infer there is some correlation between the game's and real life. There's not. The rules of the game are completely different.

First of all, they also introduce a shit ton of items. That's why gear is so much cheaper now. The high end stuff is more because less people can get at it. Gearing for inferno costs far less now than it used to. 

As for gold inflation. Ok, x item drops out of thin air, you sell it. There is more gold, it sells for more (nevermind this isn't actually happening, for various reasons), now it doesn't matter. There is gold inflation in all games. Botting has almost no effect on players. 

Your entire argument is flawed though, item prices have gone down except near perfect items have gone up. See the correlation?

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","&gt;Anyone that suggest the purpose of Romney/Obama-care is to bring down costs is either lying or misinformed.

It's pretty easy to be misinformed about the idea that the purpose of Obamacare is to make healthcare more affordable, considering the official title of the bill is ""Affordable Care Act.""

&gt;They have nothing to do with cost, only coverage.

Yep. If you want to keep the private insurance system, government policies can put downward pressure on price or they can make sure everyone is covered, but they can't do both. All it takes is a rudimentary knowledge of supply and demand to understand that making people buy insurance will increase demand and put upward pressure on price.

As for which is more desirable...I'd tend toward lower costs myself. Lower costs serve the dual purpose of helping to expand coverage to those that choose to buy it and reducing the financial strain put on people. It doesn't force people to buy it, which can be seen as a downside, but the important question is how many of the people without insurance *could* have it if they wanted to and just don't buy it?

&gt;To address costs, government negotiating for prescription/medical device costs or a single-payer system is necessary. Otherwise, the US will continue have about double the per capita health care costs of any other industrialized nation.

I disagree with this one. There are other solutions to the problem. I'd propose TitoTheMidget Care, if you want to call it that...remove regulatory barriers to entry and competition in the health insurance market. Allow insurers to compete across state lines. Reform tort law to decrease the cost of care. Remove the tax incentive for employer-based insurance giving people a greater incentive to shop around and insurance companies a greater incentive to offer policies at a lower cost in order to attract customers. Remove licensing requirements for doctors, increasing the supply of care and putting downward pressure on price. You may not like all or any of these ideas, but all of them would have the effect of reducing cost without a mandate, without removing the requirement to provide emergency care, and without single-payer care or tax penalties.","1341101764"

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","&gt; Based on what? I guess the thing I don't get about a lot of this is that it's just speculation.

There are no projections for peak energy that let it go for that long without things falling apart. Sure, someone might invent some cheap-and-easy fusion process tomorrow or something even more exotic... but that's science fiction.

&gt;  And yes, there are economic collapses as a result of this.

This one won't be an economic collapse. While it's true that when the Roman Empire fell apart it was possible to rebuild, it won't be like that again. When we first started pumping oil, it could be pumped with 1850s technology. That oil allowed us to progress to the point where we could drill for oil that you couldn't reach with 1850s technology, which allowed us to progress further and it repeated many times.

Today, you can't drill for oil without circa 2000 technology. If there is a collapse, even though there's still oil in the ground... how will you get to it? You can't get to it with 1850s-esque technology, but you can't manage more than that until you have the oil.

And it's not just oil, it's coal too. Why do you think we level mountains to get what we used to send men down holes with pickaxes for? It's the same with natural gas... now we have to pump all sorts of noxious things down boreholes just to force the methane back out.

I like science fiction too, and in the back of my thoughts I keep hoping someone will come up with some science-fictiony solution, but be honest with yourself: how likely is that?

I figure we have less than a 5% chance of figuring out fusion before we don't have anything left with which to figure it out, just a guess. Another guess: less than a 1% chance that political viability of fission changes in the next couple decades. ","1341101776"

He was staying with a couple other guys his age (early 20s) who apparently really like ecstasy. They would have little get togethers where they would take a bunch of pills and make a mess of the house. My cousin usually left with his girlfriend on these nights and would come back EVERY time to someone passed out and drooling in his bed. This really annoyed him but he pushed through for a few more weeks until the event that caused him to move out immediately happened. Apparently, one of the patrons who would use his bed to pass out in woke up in the middle of the night and was so out of it, he didn't know where the bathroom was or even how to get out of the bedroom. He looked around and started urinating in the closest thing to a toilet bowl he could find: My cousin's laundry basket filled with ALL of his freshly cleaned clothes in it. I think my cousin cut off communication with all those guys and rightfully so, imo.

TLDR: Guy fucked on pills pissed all over my cousin's laundry basket of ALL the clothes he had, freshly washed that day.","1341101787"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Interesting thought - I never considered the whole, robots replace human workers in all possible industries. I find that whenever I consider robot replacements, the fact that the increase in productivity flows around the entire supply chain. This of course causing a massive increase of materials, available, speed in which created, etc. In the end these robots could probably keep working through the night, say two 12 hour shifts or four 6 hour shifts - this boosting the economy significantly. 

If we were under the effect of a single company effectively selling these robots, prices may still be high and those unable to afford the robots would now have a large amount of people to hire from, all willing to work for any sustainable income level. 

If we had multiple companies selling the robots, the price competition would drive prices down and make them available to anyone, causing most people to be able to afford the machines. The people replaced would either move up and oversee the production made by robots or retrain in skills robots cannot do yet.

An AI is a completely different story though, having a machine process that much information - For example - A large skyscraper holding many business' all using the same AI interface (For this example - Aleisha) would increase productivity hugely - ""Aleisha, display the files on the Robertson incident for me please"" - In which, AI finds them in the cloud or off site storage and then displays them wherever the user is in the room. You are able to organize so much more as the AI's talk to each other - Aleisha at 406 Main North road talks to Gabrielle at Corporate Taxi's HQ at the airport. Overall, I think this would be hugely interesting.

I don't necessarily agree with a benefit or the government sourcing income. Whilst in some cases, completely necessary, it would actually cause us to train up beyond belief. Imagine when people would have to stop dropping out of school, get their heads straight so they can work in highly advanced suites designing things, making corporate decisions, overseeing the piloting of vehicles. Whilst yes, the Primary and Secondary industries would be replaced, an entirely new one would be created though - Overall the impact would be a positive one I find.","1341101788"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've read all of your comments. Your basic thesis so far concludes, that parents should decide over the well-being and upcoming of a child, including their religion and thus including circumsizions.

So far, you acted irrationally whenever your arguments were confronted with rationalism.

Let me explain, HOW you could argue against my summary of your posts and WHY that is futile.

a) If, for example, I have missed a crucial post, where you denounce everything you've said. In that case, sorry, my bad. But I did not.

b) You might want to argue, that parents don't choose the religion of their offspring. In that case, they don't have the right to circumsize their children, because *de facto* those would be atheists (or at least not part of a religion/faith/cult, whatever) and a circumsizion for religious reasons on a child, which is not part of the same religion, is *de jure* child abuse.

c) Also, you could try to bring up the argument that you allow children to choose their own religion (how very noble of you, kind Sir!), but parents are allowed to circumsize their children because of parental rights.

In that case, the child would have to be old enough to make a rational decision to join a faith. If he in fact did so and his parents now want to circumsize him as part of that faith and he agrees - fine. That's in line with the court's ruling. If he, however, decides *against* a circumsizion and his parents *still* circumsize him, that'd be *de jure* child abuse via physical violation.

China has been working around the intent of international laws against forcible relocation by flooding the area with Han immigrants, and shamefully suppresses many of the expressions of Tibetan culture which instead it could and should treasure and reap benefit from. The recent episode with the dual Panchen Lamas is just the sort of transparent bad business that might have worked a thousand years ago but doesn't today with the world watching on television.

Advocacy of the right to self determination is basically the only commonality between activists for Tibet/China and Israel/Palestine, and without impugning the validity of Tibet's desire for their rights to be respected, including self-determination, I would say that the Israel/Palestine issue is of a very different character.","1341101814"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","&gt;iOS relies on view controllers to determine whether the app is running on an iPad or an iPhone. Check. Apple's own documentation goes on to basically say ""you can recycle your code, but it behooves you to build a new, custom user interface from scratch for each aspect ratio."" On the other hand, Android now uses fragments to intelligently and automatically build a multi-pane tablet UI that adjusts itself depending on the aspect ratio. Do both require planning to use effectively? Yes. But one is designed with use on a wide range of devices in mind, one is not.

True... but I think the results must be considered here. iOS has more, better and more popular tablet apps. It's like porting an app directly from one platform to another. I've seen many complaints on Reddit about Android apps which are direct ports of the iOS ones. The same applies here: The best apps are mad. specifically for the platform.

And the best tablet apps have, not rearranged UIs, but custom UIs made specfically for the platform.

&gt;No, but at one point iPhone was waaaaaay ahead of Android in terms of market share

Of course. iPhone came out *first*. How could it not?

You have to allow time for a market to settle out. That's why comments that ""Oh, no! The iPad is losing market share!"" are stupid. The iPad was the first of the new breed of tablets. It started out with 100% market share. Of *course* it will drop.

&gt;And your point? 

That the events that led to the marginialisation of the Mac and the events currently surrounding the iPhone do not correlate. The situations are entirely different.

&gt;Apple's lawyers would say otherwise.

Well, okay, but you know what I mean. Microsoft was convicted of far worse and far less mundane things as patent infringement.

&gt;I dunno, you would think making an architecture that can only be used on devices they manufacture, combined with their current legal strategy, would suggest otherwise.

The architecture argument is irrelevant. In fact, it's normal. There has only ever been *one company* who has *only once* successfully sold the OS separate to the device. Sure, they managed to dominate the market but they are, nonetheless, an exception. Not even Microsoft itself has managed to repeat the tactic successfully again and they've tried many times.

&gt;Why? Because Android is made to be used in as many places as possible, 

Hm. So was Playsforsure, Windows Phone 1-6, Windows Phone 7, Symbian and so on.

Later that same day when I had made the decision, I get a text from her basically saying ""Hey, I can tell things aren't really working out, and it's cool with me if we don't see each other anymore.""  I'm sitting there thinking I'm totally off the hook, and how awesome this worked out to be.  I text her back and say, ""Wow, that's really cool of you.  Sounds good to me, don't be a stranger"" or something to that effect.  Then all hell breaks loose.  She starts telling me I'm such a coward because I broke up with her via text, and she felt sorry for me and all that.  The relationship still ended, so that was good, but I had to go back and reread all the texts she sent me so I could remind myself that she actually dumped me first, and I wasn't actually an asshole.

Well, the game is in a very early stage. I've just implemented texture polygons, which will be used as floor textures.

Visually, the lights will be polygons, maybe shaded. At the moment, I don't know if I should just collect pixels around the player to determine if there is enough light, or just calculate it from the known positions of lights, the player, mirrors, glass walls, etc. I'm drawn towards the calculation, because there would be less room for bugs. Not to mention what if there is just plain blackness on the floor, what would I collect from those black pixels?

Also, I don't want to forbid the player to go to dark places. Mainly because I couldn't figure out a good solution, which doesn't feel weird. So I just had the idea of fainting-effect: the less litten the place where you are, the less things you can see on the monitor. And slowly you will float towards the closest light source. Also, movement will be randomized if you are in dark, so even the most intelligent player can't complete the map in total darkness.","1341101823"

3. 12 hours few days on few days off usually again depends on the service.

4. There are grandpa medics still around and this is subject to change via technological advancement however career longevity for medics tends to be on the short side due to either back injury from repetitive lifting of heavy patients, emotional exhaustion/burnout/ptsd, or often a conjunction.

     There is room for advancement in upgrading from primary care paramedic to advanced care paramedic where the scope of practice explodes. From there you can upgrade to critical care paramedic who are frequently fixed wing aircraft or helicopter medics. Aside from these you can obviously apply the acquired knowledge base to anything else healthcare relevant and many medics move into anything from respiratory therapy to nursing to teaching.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","First, stop using curry powder. Typical ""curry powder"" isn't for making curries, it's for making ""sambar"", a south Indian food that is definitely not curry. If you use curry powder, you have no control over what spices go in, and in what proportion. It's whatever's in the curry powder. Also, there is no ""standard"" curry powder. Different brands have different spices in different proportions, so if you switch brands, your curries will suddenly start tasting different.

There is a wide range of Indian spices, and different types of Indian food (even curries) use them in different proportions.

The basic spices for a meat-based curry would include cumin, coriander, turmeric, powdered red chilis, and crushed black pepper. The fresh ingredients would include onions, garlic and maybe ginger.

These are the starter spices, almost all north Indian meat curries will include them. There are many, many more, which can be used for different dishes, or to make more elaborate and complex flavors. However, you can cook a perfectly good and tasty curry with just the spices I listed above.

The additional spices might include stuff like cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, anise, mustard seeds, and lots of other stuff. Certain things go with certain dishes. For example, you would not usually put fenugreek or asfoetida in a meat curry, but they are essential for most dals (legumes). You would not put delicate flavors like cardamom or cloves in a very hot curry, but they are wonderful for lightly spiced rice/meat combinations, such as biryani or pilaf.

Better to start with the basic spices and get a feel for them and their proportions. Then move on to the more elaborate curries once you are comfortable.

Some other things:

1. all spices need to be roasted to bring out their flavor. Generally, if I'm using a whole seed spice, I dry roast it, that is, I start off with a dry frying pan and roast the spice on medium heat for a few seconds until it releases aroma, before I add other ingredients. Powdered spices can be roasted in the same oil or fat you use to fry the onions. They don't need dry roasting.

2. since spices are used in very small amounts, Indians often use some other ingredient to ""bulk up"" the curry, to give it volume. Different things can be used. Some recipes use excess onions for that. Some use yogurt, some use tomatoes. Each contributes its own unique flavor and texture, so you need to be aware of what you are adding and how it will affect the dish.

3. Ingredients are combined and added in certain orders. For example, if I'm not dry roasting, I'd start with heating some oil in the pan. Then I'd add the wet ingredients, which are usually onion, garlic and ginger. Protip: chopping this stuff isn't the best way. Just peel it then drop it all in the blender, and blend the shit out of it. You will end up with a paste, which you add to the heated oil and fry. Fry until the paste turns brown.

4. Now it's time to add the dry ingredients. These are the various spice powders that come in a dry form in a bottle. Another pro tip: don't just toss the spice powders directly into the fried onions and stuff. Spices burn very easily, and burnt spices taste bad. I take all the dry spices and put them in a little bowl, then add a few drops of water and mix them up with a spoon to make a thick paste. Then I add this paste to the frying pan after the onions have browned. The few drops of water protect the spices from burning because the oil was too hot. Turn the heat down to medium low, add the spice paste, then let fry for a good few minutes while stirring constantly. This is the key to bringing out the spice flavors and blending them - sufficient roasting time at a low enough heat that there is no danger of burning.

5. Finally, add the bulking ingredients if you are using any. You could add a can of tomatoes, or a few tablespoons of yogurt. Continue stirring and frying. The bulking ingredients have a lot of water, you want most of this water to evaporate, and the solids to blend well with the rest of the stuff in the pan. You can tell it's done when the oil starts to separate from the solids. This means that most of the water is gone.

6. Now you're ready to add the meat. Some people brown the meat separately in oil, and I agree that this is the faster way to do it. But it's not the best way. If you really want the most flavorful meat, it has to roast WITH the spices, brown with them. So unless I am in a hurry, I never brown the meat separately. I add it to the pan after step 5 above, then fry it with the spices, turning frequently to coat the meat thoroughly with the spices. This method of browning will be slow, because you can't turn the heat up too high as you could if you were browning the meat separately. If you turn up the heat too high, the spice mixture will burn. So this has to be done at medium heat, and will take a longer time. Probably 15 minutes, depending on the amount of meat and the size of the pan. But it's so worth it. You don't have to stand there every second and stir, you just can't leave it for long in case the spice mixture sticks to the bottom and burns. Do other stuff around the kitchen meanwhile, but remember to stir frequently, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to ensure that no spices stick to the bottom and burn.

7. Finally, you are ready to cook the meat. For dry style roasted meats, you add no water. Just cover the pan and let the meat cook over low heat in its own juices until done. For wet style curries with plenty of gravy, you add water, cover the pan, and cook over low heat.

You want the meat to be very tender. This is best done in one of two ways. Either use very low heat and a LONG cook time, kind of like how a crockpot works. Or else use a pressure cooker. Both methods produce very tender meat, it's up to you.","1341101848"

These kinds of sayings that acknowledge the fact that many different people believed in many different gods, but only one of them is the true god, sparked my journey towards atheism.

I realized that the notion that all people who believed in other gods were completely wrong, and that the small percentage of people who believed in the Judeo-Christian god were completely correct, was very unlikely. This question against the idea of a god also led me to many other questions as well, and I became an atheist.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Kind of. Declaring the lineage of the person is only a small part of the Patriarchal Blessing.

The majority of it is filled with ""inspired"" prophecy about how your life will turn out if you live in accordance with the gospel. As such, most mormons get their blessing somewhere between age 14-18, so they can have some guidance for their future.

However, the promises in the blessing are *extremely* generic. Stuff like ""You will be married in the temple,"" ""You will have children,"" ""Life will be difficult but worth it,"" and ""You will be able to support your family.""

The patriarchal blessing is actually one of the things that prompted me to check out the church a bit more. I loved mine when I got it. I finally decided to share one of the promises given to me with one of my best friends. It was something akin to ""Satan will have no power over you."" Pretty awesome; I envisioned myself as a spiritual Jackie Chan. So I was naturally taken aback when my friend said, ""Oh yeah, I have that one in mine too!""

What?! How could my friend have the *exact same blessing* in hers? This didn't seem like a normal blessing, either. Being immune to Satan didn't sound like something as common as ""married in the temple."" Confused, I checked out my brother's patriarchal blessing, and it was 70% the same as mine. Of course, this made me devalue mine and to eventually investigate the rest of the church.

Personal story done, it's a *huge* social no-no to share your patriarchal blessing with non-family members.","1341101870"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I find whining like this entertaining because there is no scenario under which you would be happy. You whine because no one can tell YOU to buy a product. Knowing you will eventually need expensive healthcare that you will not be able to pay for is fine with you...someone else will buy it for you. You whine that healthcare is too expensive, but you'd whine if we legislated caps on doctor salaries or hospital profits. You indignantly whine that you pay your fucking bills, but you won't live long enough to pay off one serious medical procedure. You'd whine if our taxes provided Medicare for all. You'd whine if we decided to refuse services to those who couldn't pay up front. So yes, the adults are sick and tired of whiners crowing about how they pay their fucking bills, then whining that ""health care is too expensive"" while sticking the rest of us with the cost of an entirely predictable and legitimately expensive medical procedure.  In other words, no, i do not believe you have the ability to pay your fucking bills when your fucking bills include $250k for surgery, rehab, and therapy.

And make no mistake...the ONLY reason ""it's a given that healthcare in America is a mess"" is republicans have convinced people like you that healthcare must be privately funded. The only people who have a problem with the dreaded socialized medicine are American republicans. You know...the same internet tough guys that claim others will ""hear it"" from them. 

The larger issue is how severely twisted your idea of freedom is.  It does not mean anarchy; freedom means a whole lot more than keeping the big, bad ol' gubmint from making rules. It also means protecting the citizenry by curtailing the freedom of rapists, thieves, greedy money hoarders (remember pre-Nixon tax policy?), drunk drivers, and whiny children who think they're entitled to everyone else paying for their healthcare.","1341101880"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","This is something that has been really bugging me for a while.

Objectification is not what feminists have a problem with; it's *sexual* objectification that they fight against. I think that this is an important distinction because there is a big problem with how people think about objectification, and where it's acceptable. 

We all objectify people based on the roles that they take: when I'm at work, I am objectified as an object for the sole purpose of helping customers with their orders, and I'm fine with that because it's an accepted part of my social contract.  I don't expect people to treat me in any other way, because in that instance, that form of objectification is completely acceptable.

Humans objectify each other as a matter of course; there's no way for us to survive our day-to-day life if we're expected to empathize with every person we see. We objectify other people walking down the street as ""strangers,"" we objectify people we work with as ""coworkers,"" and we objectify people we love during particularly intimate moments as sexual objects. It's a completely unavoidable aspect of human psychology, and is not a problem until it is misplaced.

That is where feminists have a point: sexual objectification is not acceptable in many circumstances. However, the problem with what they fight for is that they have a seriously stretched definition of what ""sexual objectification"" is, as well as what situations it is acceptable in. They seem to think that sexual objectification as a whole is unhealthy, when it is a completely normal aspect of the human psyche. If they wish to really make a point, they need to accept this fact and then work on defining where sexual objectification is acceptable.  As far as I can tell, it seems to really be acceptable mostly in the bedroom, and in situations where people are hooking up, dating, etc.

Sorry to make such a long comment, but this is something that lots of people don't realize and I think needs to be known.","1341101894"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","Not a big pickle expert (only made a few batches here and there) but as far as I am aware - you should not have to be overly concerned with remaking pickles in this manner. The vinegar and salts in pickle brine typically prevent bacteria growth and can be reused without concern as long as the brine remains clear and free of yeasts and so on. If it gets cloudy then the brine has possibly been contaminated and you should discard it. You should however change pickle jars between every few batches - pour the brine into a sanitized pickle jar with a sanitized lid (boil the jar and lid in water for at least 5-7 minutes) just to be safe, and make sure you clean the pickles well with just water. Add to the jar, and lid pour in the brine and seal and fridge them. Pickling Tip - cut off the stem end of the cucumber/pickle to help to keep them crisp (there are supposedly enzymes in the stem end that soften pickles).

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I was an AMD fanboy and am prior service. Semper Fi.

Let me preface this with a little anecdote. My Dad bought stock in a company as soon as it went public because he personally knew the name behind the brand (but not the C-Level managers) and wanted to see him succeed. On the other hand, my dad's investment adviser and I had discussions about betas and market caps on stocks that were random jumbles of letters to him. We were able to get him to diversify despite his emotional attachment.

Guess which one lost literally all of its value, bankrupting the faceman and making the C-levels quite rich in the process? It wasn't the random jumbles.

I,too am guilty of emotional investment. Investing in things you know and love gives you an easy advantage; investing knowledge is cumulative. The longer you've known about (investment) products, the better armed you will be when it comes to making rational decisions. However, You need to understand that you are buying only one product: future returns. Any product which is not promising to produce future returns is literally costing you money (See: Opportunity Cost). Don't get too attached to seeing them succeed. I have a feeling you'll have to find out through trial and error when you're too attached.

On to my AMD speculation: Intel was named by Linus Torvalds as the most Linux-Friendly hardware manufacturer. AMD, not so. ""So what?"", you might ask; consumers don't use Linux. That's true in America. But guess whose Governments and Consumers embrace Linux? The BRIC (and other emerging markets). That means Intel is sitting pretty for the long term, whereas AMD has a struggle ahead to be competitive in those markets.

2. Write up intricate plots about how you will blow up the london bridge and send it to yourself. Do it from a starbucks (or whatever you have in london), and when you get caught you call yourself a writer, and tell them you were in starbucks writing your latest novel

3. use psuedo english. I want to see a case go to trial where the communication is as follows:

As far as I know UK still doesn't have a ""thought crime"" does it? Is it a crime if I plan on how to blow up the london bridge ? What is the actual crime committed? Having thoughts?

What is the difference between a conspiracy and a fantasy? Maybe my fantasy is to blow up the london bridge and see dead bodies fly. So...how many years in prison for that?

As a reservist however, if you soon realise that defence isn't really what you thought it was going to be then you can leave without any problems.

&gt; Schizophrenia (/ˌskɪtsɵˈfrɛniə/ or /ˌskɪtsɵˈfriːniə/) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests itself as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction.

I would say that screencap reflects the following:

1. Auditory Hallucinations

2. Paranoid/ bizarre delusions ✔

3. Disorganized speech/thinking ✔

I would say 2/3 is close enough to suggest a ""touch"" of schizophrenia

If you have a laptop, I would either use something like Audacity.. or see if there is a basic oscilloscope/spectrum analyzer program available for your computing platform - then make a microphone or pair of microphones that has a good low frequency response..plug it into your audio input.. then see if you can identify the sound in the display and figure out its frequency.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","I do believe you're missing the point. Algorithms works. My point isn't the validity or usefulness of it. Your basic management of pathology, up until the level of consultant doctor, should adhere pretty closely to the current accepted algorithm for the pathology. What I'm trying to point out to you is that if you want to be a great doctor, you should not be blindly following algorithm; you should be a master of the basics of medicine that you automatically come up with a management plan that closely follow that algorithm.

This is important for a few reasons. One, you'll find that the future of medicine will utilize more and more mid-level providers (NP, PA). They cost less than an M.D., and you'll need to justify why you cost more to hire. Two, those guidelines were created, and modified, by doctors based a great deal on their understanding of medicine. This is how medicine is evolving and improving - by us making modifications on algorithms (again, based on our knowledge of medicine), seeing it work, confirming it with RCT, and spreading the findings. Three, you will quickly learn that even the best algorithm misses many factors still, and relying on them blindly will result in you missing some diagnosis, or go down the path that may not be in the patient's best interest. If you know basic medicine, you'll know why algorithms work, and you'll be able to modify it to suit your patient. 

Four, and most importantly, at least for me: this approach makes medicine much, much more fun. It allows for the art of medicine to co-exist with the science, and makes it a joy to practice.","1341101961"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","That is not how addiction works, and is not what addiction is.  Please don't fill people's heads with false information; people are gullible.


Lets take a look at addiction. What is it exactly? Those who are addicted continuously expose themselves to a certain stimuli, despite problems in their social life and health. The greatest confusion, which many individuals  seem to believe, is addiction and its relation to physical dependence. Many people equate the two: They see drug addicts as people who are stuck in a vicious cycle of stimulus, withdrawal, and back to the stimulus. This is inconsistent with evidence. Addicts sometimes take the drug to alleviate withdrawal (Baker et al., 2006), but even if they are hospitalized past withdrawal symptoms, they still relapse- Pinel, 2011 - Biopsychology.


How does addiction occur? Well the mechanism is not specifically known, but there is a highly supported theory known as the positive-incentive.  The positive-incentive theory is based on the assumption that most addicts take drugs, not to reduce their withdrawal symptoms, but because the drug (or stimulus) feels great. This theory believes that this positive factor begins to be a craving, and is the primary theory behind addiction (Cardinal and Everitt, 20044; Everitt, Dickinson, and Robbins, 2001). But many things feel great, so why aren't we addicted to many different things? Well this is likely due to the positive-incentive value of the stimulus/drug; this is the anticipated pleasure of the action. Many addicts see a large difference between this anticipated pleasure, and the actual pleasure they receive, such that the anticipated pleasure is high, but the actual real pleasure is lower than expected (Ahmed, 2004; Redish, 2004).
Now some people also can take this positive stimulus, and not be addicted. Why aren't they addicted to it, while some are? This is explained by the theory of incentive-sensitization theory, which states that the positive-inventive value (anticipated pleasure) increases with the drug use or stimulus use (Aldridge, 2009; Miles et al., 2004). In addiction prone individuals, the use of a drug sensitizes the drug's positive-incentive value, causing them to be highly motivated to seek the stimulus. This suggests that addiction is not based on the pleasure of the actual stimulus, but the levels of positive-incentive value - the anticipated pleasure (Robinson and Berridge, 2003). Initially, the positive-incentive value is similar to the drugs hedonic value, but tolerance often develops, but the positive-incentive value remains the same. This large difference in values explains a higher addiction.

You are associating addiction with consequences - that is not addiction.  Just because someone drank once and beat their wife, and then does it again 10 years later does not make him an alcoholic.  If you've understood what I've said so far, you will know that addiction is the continuation of drug use despite its adverse affects on their health and social life.  An alcoholic would be someone who continuously drinks, despite the health and social consequences.  And most importantly, someone who is addicted will CONTINUE to use the mentioned drug despite repeated efforts to stop.  Your alcoholic explanation does not fit what-so-ever, as and alcoholic would have extreme difficulties stopping for 10 years with no problems.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;Again, pretty much post 630, the Byznatine state was broke. There were brief moments where this was not the case, but compared to their prior wealth or to the Roman period, the Byzantine state was broke. Rich compared to some other places on the continent, but a shell of its former self.

So the Byzantine State under Manuel or Constantine IV was poor compared to Under Constantine I? If you want to make a general statement like that I could say the British Nation is poor today compared to under Benjamin Disraeli. It is technically true, but it ignores the fact that the UK is a pretty wealthy country today. And the Byzantine State continued to be wealthy well past the loss of much of the Roman East. They were not as wealthy as before, but they were still ""wealthy"" especially compared to  **every other state in Europe.**

&gt;Well, Justinian thought of himself as a Western emperor. His stated goal was the reconquest. I mean, it's really semantics. Justinian speaks Latin and ruled in Italy. He's the last Roman emperor that you can say that about. Pretty much after Justinian, all the Byzantines spoke Greek and ruled in the Balkans and Asia Minor.

NO this is just **blatantly wrong**, Justinian ruled from Constantinople ( Modern day Istanbul). He would have considered himself ""Roman"" Not Eastern Roman, Not Western Roman, ROMAN. IN fact the Eastern Romans would have a presence in Italy for another 500 years and they would rule Rome for hundreds of more years but it was exceddinly rare for an Eastern Emperor to visit rome, so Justinian was hardly the last Roman Emperor to rule over Italy. The only thing that makes Justinian unique is that he was the last who spoke Latin as a first Language.

&gt;It comprised no more than 15,000 men, of which 10,000 infantry, about half Roman and half Foederati, and 5,000 cavalry, consisting of ca. 1,500 of Belisarius' own bucellarii, 3,000 Roman and foederati cavalry, and 600 Huns and 400 Heruli horse archers

So 1000 Mercenaries( who were probably not even really mercenaries in the western thought but Tribes who were bound by treaty to provide the Roman State with troops)? Foederati are not mercenaries, they are ""barbarians"" recruited to fight for the Byzantine State. Secondly Roman armies had always comprised a large number of auxilia and foreign troop. In fact non-Italian troops had comprised a majority of the soldiers of the Roman Empire since the first century!","1341101979"

The trend now for resumes and interviews is to find things you did that helped your company. It's achievement based. Focus on that. Do mock interviews with friends. Ask for feedback why you didn't get a job after an interview. Sometimes they'll tell you and it can improve your chances next time. ","1341101981"

Can you get a tourist visa and actually travel to the Netherlands? Once you get there you can work with a group there to apply for refugee status. Alternatively, what would happen if you applied to a university in the Netherlands and got a student visa? Would you be able to go with or without your parents knowledge, permission or support? Studying is a great way to spend time in the country while working on your application. 

Really, can you leave at all without parental approval or support? If not, working out a way for that to happen is step one.

backup. before anything else: backup.
make a working copy to have a backup to work from
make a copy of that as a current file to test your system.

also you do not want to use excel to rename them please but you want to construct naming and commandos through excel.

also do believe in the mantra of cinderella: good ones first, bad ones out. take the easy ones and rename them first, like the ones you can filter out with the simple date, without the sig and so on. in the end you will have several batches of commands to rename.

test that on your working copy and if everything goes well, then you can do it on the real thing.

some notes

you will need to work through different steps.
you will want to introduce something into the filename to make it a real separator for the future. 


*and most of all you want to tech them proper date names!!*

it is not 01.01.12 is is 120101! If they need to be readable by people, make them 2012-01-01

&gt;, but the real kicker is going to come in when you get similar or even duplicate names referring to different people

there is only a limited amount of people who are doubles. You can mark them: work first the ones who are unique, and mark the ones who might be doubled, run a pivot table over the lookup of the names and count the number of people. bring that back to your work sheet with a vlookup like ""if vlookup of that name column 2 in the pivot table is &gt;1, mark ""to be looked at"" other wise okay""

how long is the file numering? make sure to not use 1 2 3 and 2212 but make it with leading zeros.

if you can split out the date into a column, you can use excels built in mechanisms to recognize the date and then harmonize it in an extra column.

i would probably try to break it down through the spaces and reengineer the file name from there.

make sure to keep the name and the complete filename of the original so you can change the names.

"Warhammer","t5_2qqd4","I haven't started playing yet, was just thinking about starting playing with a Tyranid army. However, reading the new rules, something that might be funny:

- Swarmlord gets 4 powers and can use 2 a turn. According to the FAQ he can convert all of those powers into any of the permitted psychic power lists.

- The power I am thinking about is ~~Divination~~Telepathy - Invisibility. Gives Shrouded AND Stealth, stacking to a +3 to cover save and CC attackers treated as WS1. For the rest of the game.

- The unit I am thinking about is the Venomthrope. Gives a 5+ cover save to any unit within 6"" AND any nonvehicle attacker must take a Dangerous Terrain check (Beasts or Move Through Cover etc doesn't help, since the FAQ further down says that even if there's a roll it is not actually a piece of terrain). So roll 3D6 and pick the lowest 2 for assault distance.

- Durability can be helped out by the Prime joined to a unit. Like, have 3 Venomthropes standing out in the open with the +3 armour save Prime in front of them. You can then do Look Out Sir on a model basis, absorbing one wound on each Venom before the Prime goes down. Tervigon Catalyst can also help.

- Fun CC cheese: Move up slow but steady, with those 2+ cover save, ignores wounds on 5+, regenerating, unchargeable Carnifexes with Bio Plasma and free Assault grenades.

- Fun Shooty cheese: Make a totally shooty army. If you can put the Venoms out of LOS, you can on turn 1 have a unit of Hive Guard with 2+ cover save, T6, 5+ wound ignore, 6 BS3 S8 AP2 shots, rerolls 1s to hit and to wound from the Swarmlord (so average 4 AP2 rerolled S8 wounds), ignores LOS and received cover. Or a regenerating Tyrannofex with its unchargeable Pyrovore buddies.

- And want to throw out there as well - does the Focused Fire rule allow aforementioned Hive Guard to focus on individual models out of cover ignoring LOS?","1341102017"

"spiders","t5_2r1sf","What part of your face were you bitten on? The blood circulation that pertains to they triangular area including the eyes and the nose (I hope I remember this diagram correctly) is shared with the brain. In a book I have on mountaineering medicine it says to be very careful with wounds in that region. (If you get sick four walking days from your car you may not receive hospital treatment in a timely way, so it is better to avoid the need of such treatment.) Whatever bit you, it may have produced this delirium because the venom went pretty much directly to the brain. I haven't heard of Loxoceles venoms causing delirium (confused thinking and excited actions). Delirium sounds more like something that a neurotoxin might do. 

See a complete description of Loxocese envenomations at: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in576

When you say you were sick, do you mean that you felt nausea? Nausea is a symptom of Loxoceles envenomation. What was the time sequence? You were asleep. You woke up. Were you nauseous at that time, or did it take a while to develop? If you woke up sick and nauseous and the condition lasted for about an hour, then it sounds like it might well have been a Brown Recluse bite. If you were, instead, thinking confusedly and acting excitedly, then I don't know what might have caused the condition. 

Ordinarily people get bitten by Brown Recluse spiders when the spider gets crushed between clothing or bedding and the spider. Maybe one was walking across your face and you covered your face with your arm or in some other way managed to crush the spider against your face. The odds of crawling into a sleeping bag with a spider are fairly low to begin with. The odds of one accidentally walking across your face and getting a big squished in the process are even lower. 

If something like that had happened to me, I would be sure to flip bed spread, blankets, and top sheet back from the bed every night just to be sure that another intruder had not entered. I would give clothing and shoes a shake before putting anything on. If I felt that the place might be heavily populated with problem spiders I might put each leg of the bed in a dish holding a pool of vegetable oil or something like that.

I think others have already made suggestions such as getting everything inside boxes and the boxes inside plastic bags or otherwise sealed to prevent a spider from sneaking in. Denying habitat to Brown Recluse spiders without keeping helpful species (cobweb weaving spiders, for instance) out is probably the best long-range strategy. I wouldn't want to fill my house with insecticides that are themselves neurotoxins.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Some of the replies here are pretty terrible. I need to preface this by saying that I am *not* and expert in this, so please do your own research too. But, here goes anyway:

There are two main influences on the foreign policy of a nation like the United States. The first is national interest, that is, what actions can the government take in the outside world to further the goals of the United States, her businesses and citizens, and her international allies? The second is domestic politics, that is, what actions do the citizens of the United States demand of their political leaders? The United States supportive position towards Israel is dictated by these factors.

First, the interests of the United States. Israel is the closest thing to a western country in an important region of the world; the Middle East and North Africa. This region stretches from Morocco in the West, to at least Iran in the East, and as far North as Turkey. It includes the largest oil-producing regions on earth (including the Persian Gulf, and other areas), and an important international route for the transport of cargo by sea (the Suez Canal). For those reasons (and some others), the great Western powers have been deeply involved in the region for a long time. When Britain and France were the most powerful countries on earth, they divided most of the Middle East and North Africa up into a series of colonies, mandates, and protectorates (various forms of foreign administration). When America became the most powerful country on earth, it became fiercely interested in the region, and although most of those countries gained their independence from the European powers in this period, America exerted significant influence and control. 

As America is still interested in the region, it is in need of allies there, and Israel is a strong ally to have. They have a powerful military, and some cultural similarity to the US. Obviously, they are not Americas only ally in the Middle East; Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait at the very least can be counted as US allies too. In terms of influence on Americas foreign policy, the ""national interest"" motivation is probably the weaker motivator. The US has other allies in the region, and if it came down to those allies forcing the US to choose between their collective support and continuing to aid Israel, then the rational calculus of national interest ought to lead the US to end or at least curtail their support for Israel. However, the situation is more complicated, due to the second reason stated above.

The domestic political pressure within the US to support Israel comes from several groups, and is a very powerful influence on US foreign policy. Basically, because foreign policy in America (and most democracies) is enacted and controlled by politicians who need to worry about the next election, politically important voting blocs can have an out-sized influence on foreign policy. Pressure to support Israel comes from two politically important groups; Jews and evangelical Christians. There are about as many Jews in the United States as in Israel, and many have either personal connections with Israel, or a romantic, cultural sympathy. It is very important to a significant number of Jewish voters (though by no means all, as needs to be emphasized) that Israel continue to be a safe-haven for the Jews, a people who have been historically oppressed in nearly every nation that they didn't control themselves. Many are political donors, and are very active in politics. There are large concentrations of Jewish voters in some electorally important states, especially Florida. So, there is a big influence there.

Of course, even millions of Jewish voters are ultimately insignificant in a country the size of the US, so there must be domestic political support coming from other groups. Many, many ordinary Americans are familiar with the narrative of the creation of Israel, and feel a responsibility to protect the country, or support it for other reasons. But perhaps the most important non-Jewish group in the US influencing policy on Israel are conservative Christians. There is a belief among many of this group (which is *far* larger than the Jewish population of the US, and more electorally important) that it is a necessary precondition for some sort of important religious event that the Jewish people have reestablished their ancient nation in Israel. Don't ask me about the specific belief system, I am not knowledgeable enough to answer questions about it. But it is not so important *why* they believe that Israel needs to be supported unconditionally, it is mainly important that they *do* believe that, and they have mobilized their political power in the US (which is considerable) to influence the government in this direction.

So, there you go. Two factors influence American policy on Israel: What policy best serves Americas international interests? And, what policy is dictated by American domestic politics?

I know that this post is incomplete, and I am sure that I will receive a flood of corrections, arguments and additions, but it is the best that I could do. I am sorry that it isn't very ELI5ish. 

One other thing, you may be a little surprised that in my entire post I didn't once mention the Palestinians. I'm sorry about that. The fact is though, that I do not believe that their experiences or interests play a hugely significant role shaping the United States policy on Israel. They also have some domestic political support in the US, and even some lobbying power and a few advocates in Congress, but their support and influence is pretty minuscule in comparison to the political power of the supporters of Israel. Their plight probably has more impact on the other factor, the national interest factor, than the domestic political factor. It is pretty obvious that being seen to support the oppression of a people is, while tolerable, not in the long term interests of the US unless there is some factor that outweighs it. Also, many of Americas other allies in the region are powerfully motivated by the plight of the Palestinians, and they no doubt attempt to exert some influence on American policy in this area. But so far, the downsides to supporting Israel have been more than outweighed for the US by the value of Israel as a regional ally, and even more-so by domestic political considerations.","1341102026"

Without even thinking about it, I ended up reaching down, putting a hand on the back of her neck, thrusting into her mouth pretty forcefully, and ultimately coming hard, pushing her head down onto me.

Now, I didn't really mean to do all that, and usually wouldn't, but she kind of caught me by surprise and I wasn't really thinking straight. I can also guarantee that my own technique, on her, was not the best while this was going on. She, however, was pretty submissive, and apparently it did it for her, because as I finished and let up so she could raise her head, she did so with a gasp and I was suddenly soaked from the neck up (she was a gusher).

If you have a 23mm pen HE shell, that hits for 70, and a 60mm pen AP that hits for 60, your HE shell not only does more damage, but has, to my understanding, much higher chances of crippling the enemy tank, causing him to do less damage to you. Especially, if you have a general philosophy of aiming for the rear or the turret, so as to try and set on fire or damage the main gun/injure the gun crew. 

This isn't something I STARTED doing with the UE 57. I just notice that it seems uniquely resistant to it. If one T-46 pours HE into the other T-46, the penetration rate seems to be well above 80%, with my highly unscientific guesstimates At any rate, I would never load AP if I knew I was going to face a rival 15mm tank. 

However, unlike most of the 15mm armor club, the Renault has much less armor and seems to be much more resistant to it. It could be hitbox related, with perhaps high shots on the crew shield somehow doing full damage with AP but not hitting anything with HE, but a 24mm pen HE shell, hitting 9mm armor plate, would have a 75% penetration (penetration is randomized) of about 18.

The angle required to get an effective armor of 18mm out of a 9mm armor plate would be huge. And these aren't glances. They do damage. They just don't do any reasonable quantity. 

And I do understand armor facing. I am restarting. Not starting for the first time. My AP shells behave pretty much exactly as I expect them to, and this HE problem seems so far to be unique to the UE 57, and works fine for The BT, T-46, and crappy panzer crowd. 

it's possible that it is simply a set of highly unlikely coincidences, but I thought I would ask and see if anyone had noticed similar.","1341102047"

Ghost Recon: Future Soldier: The teamwork in this title could be more fleshed out, and the story is lacking (though I kind of expected that). The mechanics feel solid enough and I haven't played multiplayer yet. Decent game. 

Skyrim: Not a fan. 

Arkham City: My favorite game this year. The challenge modes and open world have me coming back over and over. People complain a lot about cramming characters in, but I still enjoyed the story. It's Batman, give a little leeway on the realism. 

Max Payne 3: solid shooting but suffers from a disconnect between gameplay and cut scenes. I still thought the shooting itself felt great though.

my biggest problem with what is said is that ""we don't have the right to question it"", maybe its the difference between having a strong faith and a weak faith, but at least for me it is important to **understand** what I believe in/agree with, I can't pick what I want from islam and leave the parts that I don't like, thus I need to be okay with all of it. 

as you said those two marriages are the most controversial, don't you think them being this huge there should be a clearer reasons behind it? more than a dream?? wouldn't you understand why it sounds too vague for people are do not have the ""don't question it attitude""? my point is, no offence, but *he should've known better* 

I honestly did listen to all of it hoping I will be convinced at the end of it, however I think it all connects to what you said of having that strong faith, otherwise you will question it. so this is the sad point, I myself my dad is religious and I do wish i can be more religious but those parts i really struggle with, I can't get to (B) having strong faith without having peace with (a) the things I don't understand, so its from A to B, not the opposite, and it seems like it should be the opposite..

Besides, Feast and Dance are like 2 sides of the same coin; they take place kind of simultaneously but they're divided by characters. Half of the usual characters are in AFFC and the other half in ADWD (except for its last quarter, where the division ends).

I'd put Gideon's Lawkeepers in the SB. 

Gather the Townsfolk is a must. 

Hanweir Lancer seems good, but in my testing I found out he really isn't, especially if you are using Silverblade Paladin - and you should have 3-4 of them. 

Conscripts should be side board cards. 

Inquisitor is OK, there are better options. 

I'd add in some spot removal, like Pillar of Flame, Oblivion Ring. Pillar of Flame is actually better than Galvanic Blast, since it actually exiles stuff. It kills annoying undying creatures, and triggers that happen when a creature dies (Even Doomed Traveler loses to this). 

Hero of Oxid Ridge is barely an OK substitution for Hero of Bladehold. If you have Bladehold, I'd go with those instead. 

Accorder Paladin is a good early threat, and Doomed Traveler is great since he's resistant to removal. 

I really like Angelic Overseer in this deck. She'll be hexproof and indestructible most of the time, and will swing for 5. If your opponent isn't dead on the 6th turn, this should help them become that way. 

I have had a lot of luck playing this deck without swords, as they can slow down the swarm tempo of this deck. This is a hyper aggro super fast deck. If you have time to equip and play a sword, something has gone terribly wrong.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Depends on whether you recognize violating an individual's desires/interests/agency as a wrong. You'd also be killing people who had very happy lives - I'm sure there are at least a few.

However there may be an argument that bringing individuals into existence is a wrong, given the asymmetry we generally give potential gods and potential evils. Are you familiar with David Benetar's book *Better Never to Have Been*? It does not make sense to talk about the wants or pleasures that a potential individual might experience, because they do not exist to have an interest in it. However, if you consider the scenario of bringing an individual into an existence where you know they will experience enormous suffering, you probably would agree with me that this would be immoral.  
So there is an asymmetry between a potential individual's interests/pleasure and suffering.

Summary of the central point from the author: *According to this deeper asymmetry, the presence of pain is bad and the absence of pain is good, but whereas the presence of pleasure is good, the absence of pleasure is bad only if somebody is deprived of that pleasure. If nobody is deprived of an absent pleasure – because the person who would have experienced the pleasure never existed – then the absence of that pleasure is not bad.*

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","Well the fetus at that stage is uncontroversially not a person. In fact, Warren's essays are a bit dated for the reason that we've sorted out personhood so much that in fact, many infants aren't considered to be people by philosophers nowadays. Whether it has moral status though might be a bit more open ended. The key problem seems to be that the fetus just doesn't have perceptual experience of anything aside from a womb, and very primitive experience of that. There is nothing the fetus could possibly be *interested in*. It can hardly be said to care about whether it lives or dies, and it can hardly be said to be interested in making any sort of deals or interested in what its mother does to it. It just doesn't have the linguistic capacity for these sorts of thoughts. 

Noting this, as I said, the general strategy seems to be to say ""none of this matters, the fetus is still valuable because X"", where X will be ""human vegetables are valuable"", or similar sorts of entities are valuable. You might try to make a comparison argument as well. Infants are taken to have moral status even though there is little difference between their lingusitic capacities and those of late trimester fetuses, aside from perhaps a bit more object processing. 

Most people, as I mentioned, shy away from using warren's direct approach to proving abortion is permissible, and instead show it indirectly by using thomsonian murkiness arguments, or else fortified personhood arguments where they say ""alright the conscious aspect is an open question, but definitely abortions *before then* are fine"".

He moved into the basement and everything was fine until Denver got hit with a week of monsoon like rain. The basement flooded the entire basement including his room. Instead of him moving his stuff to a spare bedroom while I was calling my landlord he decided to tell me what a piece of shit I am and that our landlord is stupid for letting this happen. When i got off the phone my fiancé and I moved everything out of the spare bedroom that we were using as a office into our already cramped living room and moved all of his stuff into the room upstairs. The landlord had a company in the house less then an hour after the flooding happened cleaning everything up. He lived in the spare room for a month after that and continued to bitch and moan.

&gt; Yes! Thank you for reminding me. ""Armor"" includes chest armors, helms and shields.

I just don't think it's a good choice to learn with even if it's easier to conceal. I think stepping up to something a bit larger teaches you more about how to properly shoot, and how to conceal larger firearms. Just my two cents. I have no problem with either gun, I have an LCP and have actually been considering picking up a bodyguard, but I can't really justify it with the LCP and a little kahr 9 in the stable.","1341102093"

With that one even the questions and results are online, so the only thing you go in for is the actual blood draw / cheek and anal swabs / urine sample done by a lab tech. They contract with a chain of labs for that, so as far as the rest of the world is concerned you're just another lab customer who could be there for anything. 

Funny story: just went in for testing and took a young friend with me who doesn't consider himself gay even though we've had some fun times together. He even told his girlfriend he was going to get checked ""just to be sure"" (last time for him was something like 4 years ago) going along with me.

"science","t5_mouw","There's likely another component to this, which is that inhibitory mechanisms don't perform as they should because the neurotransmitters responsible become depleted. As a result it becomes more difficult to resolve competition between competing external stimuli and internal thoughts and as a consequence attention span, memory formation and concentration suffer significantly. 

Edit: To expand a little, there's a very fine balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Inhibition is incredibly important because your brain has to be able to select and attend to individual stimuli separating them out from the deluge of sensory information it is bombarded with. The point they make is that during the day while are experiencing and learning things, new synaptic connections are formed, while during sleep a process starts by which ""important"" memories are reinforced and less important ones pruned. Sleep deprivation therefore results in a double whammy, inhibitory neurotransmitters are depleted and excess connections start to build up. This can result in the inhibitory/excitatory balance to go from a state of criticality to run away excitation, which can exacerbate conditions like Epilepsy and bring about seizures, the ultimate form of runaway excitation.","1341102110"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Look at it this way.  When your baby nurses prolactin and oxytocin are released.  The prolactin tells your body to make milk.  The oxytocin is the same hormone released after an orgasm.  So once you get over the first week or so, and you can relax into the nursing, the person who said this dog is at a 10 is pretty accurate.  I don't find it a turn on, but the results afterward are both a very relaxed and content mama.

As someone who had to endure the pregnancy from hell, and earnestly cried over the loss of our baby at least 3 times (obviously she stuck around, thank FSM!), being grossed out over your pregnant wife sounds incredibly petty. In fact, that was probably my *favourite* part, knowing that this amazing body was growing our baby. I actually found the whole thing incredibly attractive (not in some weird preggo fetish way, just her).

Is it a responsible thing to do to bring a child into a world full of starvation, misery and death?'

Though my thoughts really don't pertain mostly to anything that the OP was talking about, just more like ramblings on how shitty this world could be become.  Though this probably isn't the place to have these future disaster discussions.

But lets say some huge natural catastrophe struck earth and food stocks were destroyed.  It wouldn't be a very smart thing to bring more life into the earth then it can support for us.  It doesn't really apply now, but under harsh circumstances, I don't think reproduction can be considered a right, and would more likely be a hazard.

Occupy Foreclosure is my inspiration as they are [America's Unsung Heros](http://boston67.blog.com/americass-unsung-heroes-92511/). This link mentions that 

&gt; With the $13-plus trillion we are estimated to ultimately spend on the bailouts, we could not only have bought and paid off every single subprime mortgage in the country (that would only have cost $1.4 trillion), **we could have paid off every remaining mortgage of any kind in this country – and still have had enough money left over to buy a new house for every American who does not already have one.** (emphasis mine)

2) Welk, TKL, Poker sized or Noppoo choc mini/Race sized boards all fit that

3) Well, nothing should break really, the Poker uses all standard size keycaps, whereas something like a choc mini/race has some non standard, TKL are pretty much all standard

4) Most mechanicals (that I've used certainly) have had n-key rollover I think, worth double checking though.

5) A lot of people say the Poker is 'poor quality', but I wouldn't agree, I think it's fantastic, especially for the money. If you want something a little higher end, might be worth looking at a HHKB, uses topre switches, and costs a bomb, but overall quality is probably slightly higher. If I'm honest, if you take care of it, I don't see any reasons as to why the Poker wouldn't be working until the day you decide to stop using it :)

They sell your personal information to the same companies you file complaints on, they have been proven to downgrade ratings of businesses who cancel their memberships, they have refused to resolve filed complaints if you don't pay them a 'mediation fee,' they artificially inflate the rankings of businesses who buy memberships (starting them at an established A+ business). Don't want to play into the BBB's game? They rate your company as an F if you don't respond to their requests. If you publicly criticize the methods of the BBB, they'll pull your accreditation. 

Ironically, there's one company the BBB won't list - the BBB itself.

If you distribute *x*, you get *( x* * *2^6 )* + *( x* * *2^5 )* + *( x* * *2^2 )*.  Working in base2, the individual multiplications can be performed by simply shifting the value to the left (like adding a zero when multiplying by 10).  The results of these multiplications are completely independent of each other, and thus can be done in parallel.

Division, on the other hand, does not have the distributive quality multiplication has.  Thus, it can't be broken down into sub-problems (as best I know).

There are tricks to speed up division for special cases though.","1341102173"

Hah!  No, I mean more get out of the US stock market, the USD, and US treasuries when you know it's a sucker's game.

&gt;As a result, we get less violence than would be produced in a free market, which is a good thing.

One of the fascinating things about the Anarchy vs. State debate is the way in which it is framed.

All social order is *emergent*.  What this means is every day we wake up to ""anarchy,"" and the world we observe is what has emerged.  Stated differently, there is no ""anarchy"" or ""state""; there is only reality and the values a social group holds.

Anarcho-capitalists don't offer our solution as an ""experiment.""  Many don't believe that's the way revolutions take place.  Short-term violence at best temporarily changes a system.

The movement is currently divided between those who seek change through education until the amount of sympathizers reaches critical mass and, for some, even through the political process and those who feel the only way some will ever become free from the State's predations is if, through technological progress, the costs of controlling that individual exceeds the benefit derived--thus, it wouldn't be in the oligarchy's self-interest to pursue the subjugation of that particular individual.  This latter group are known as Agorists.

The final thing I want to ask you is if you're willing to be thoroughly challenged (through long PM exchanges) on your theory that monopolistic law and security produces more desirable (as perceived by someone like you or me who, for the most part do not appreciate chaos and disorder) results than a system which allows individuals to opt out of such systems and pursue competing providers or if you really dismiss anarcho-capitalism merely out of disinterest.","1341102192"

"keto","t5_2rske","&gt; If you base your morality on law then your own morality is pretty fucked up. I at least have to wonder if you're even aware of what morality is, haha.

It's nothing to do with law. Just because sexual harassment is pertained in law does not make it ONLY lawful; it is mainly moral to me.

&gt; If you repeatedly went up to someone I know (e.g. my best male friend--you don't seem to understand that sexual harassment is genderless) and they rejected you and felt uncomfortable about it, then I'd consider it sexual harassment. That's incidentally what sexual harassment is, and why I'm pointing out that you're wrong in this case.

Of course I know it is genderless, but in this example it is female based so I am using the example of a female in your life. That's not really hard to understand...

You haven't proven I'm wrong at all. Sexual harassment does not need to be repeated, it can occur once and still be sexual harassment. While the technical definition of harassment requires persistence/repetition, the *socially accepted definition* of ""sexual harassment"" does not.

&gt; What would cause you to be fired from a job doesn't dictate what sexual harassment means.

It entirely does, because you will be fired for *sexual harassment in the workplace*.

After googling for a while, I seem to have found the source of our confusion. Aus/NZ law stipulates that one-off incidents are definitely sexual harassment:

&gt;The law that prohibits sexual harassment is the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Act 1991. **Sexual harassment doesn’t have to be deliberate or repeated to be illegal.**

[link](http://www.adcq.qld.gov.au/Brochures07/sex_harass.html) (And look at the examples in that link, they are definitely very similar to what we have here)



&gt; Does behaviour need to be repeated to be sexual harassment?

&gt;Sexual harassment does not have to be repeated or continuous to be against the law. It can be a one-off incident.

[link](http://www.nfpcompliance.vic.gov.au/common-questions/questions/managing-people/does-behaviour-need-to-be-repeated-to-be-sexual-harassment)

&gt; Sexual harassment does not have to be repeated 
or continuous to be against the law. It can be a 
one-off incident.

[link](http://www.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/files/Employers%20Toolkits/Sexual%20harassment%20-%20FAQs.pdf)

Whereas in America (where I assume you're from) says that it has to be either severe *or* repeated.

&gt; Generally, occurrences must be significant or repeated or both for substantial interference to be established

[link](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+harassment)

&gt; Some forms of sexual behavior are so offensive that the first time they occur they are considered deliberate, inappropriate, and sometimes even illegal actions.  Other behaviors must be repeated over and over again before they become harassment.Whether a particular behavior is defined as sexual harassment depends largely on whether the behavior is unwelcome to the target, along with the circumstances surrounding those evens.  Unwelcome behaviors, which are considered sexual harassment, can be of verbal, non-verbal, physical, or visual nature.

[link](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/svaw/harassment/explore/1whatis.htm)

So it seems American law is far more relaxed regarding sexual harassment.

However we are a website of many nations, I was speaking from what **I** know personally, and where I live that *would* have been considered sexual harassment, so no I am not wrong.","1341102192"

Conrad Schumann was a border guard that jumped over the barbed wire at the wall in 1961 prior to it's heavy construction and was caught in a picture that became infamous with the times [here](http://www.saberhistoria.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Conrad-saltando-el-Muro-de-Berl%C3%ADn-en-el-cruce-de-Ruppinerstra%C3%9Fe-con-Bernauerstra%C3%9Fe.jpg).

The heartbreaking case of [Peter Fechter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fechter) was another interesting story that I have studied in the past that changed how the media viewed the wall and the Soviet engagement of those trying to get across.

I read some of Frederick Taylor's *Exorcising Hitler* which is a study of the post war Germany and denazification (I enjoyed the writing style) and I know he has a book on the wall so based on that I would recommend [*The Berlin Wall* by Frederick Taylor](http://www.amazon.com/The-Berlin-Wall-Divided-1961-1989/dp/0060786140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341101772&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+berlin+wall) as I have been told it is a comprehensive and well constructed study of the timeline.","1341102200"

"programming","t5_2fwo","C and C++ require a 1-to-1 correspondence of functions to function addresses.  If you have 2 copies of an inline function in 2 different files, it's still considered the same function.  This means that when your program links, the linker has to resolve all of the duplicated inline functions and give them the same address.  Making the function static gives it file scope, which means that those 2 copies of the function are considered 2 different functions, so your program links faster because it doesn't have to consolidate the function addresses.  99.9% of the time you're not comparing the addresses of inlined functions, so whether those functions have the same address doesn't matter.  In fact, you're usually not taking the address of an inlined function at all, and so if that function is static and the compiler determines that it can be inlined at every call site it might not even put the raw function in your code at all.  The compiler can't determine if a non-static function can be inlined at every call site because those call sites might lie outside the file it's compiling.

In addition, the linker doesn't compare 2 function bodies to check if they're the same, it only compares the names.  If you have 2 different inlined functions with the same name, the linker will pick one of them and make all calls go to that function.  This is already pretty bad, but if it's a C function it gets worse, since those 2 functions might take different argument lists, so you'll be corrupting the stack without knowing it, and inspecting the code where the corruption happens won't bring you closer to the answer, since the source itself is fine.  If those functions are static, all the calls will go to the right function since their addresses won't get consolidated.","1341102213"

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","While this might be strictly true, part of the reason it's become the safest option is that everyone is resorting to it.  Nowadays, you can be fairly confident that another player will probably take you out if given the chance since you can be fairly confident that he or she is thinking the same about you.  

On the other hand, there are elements of the game which seem to lead people towards PvP as well.  The fact that item acquisition is currently the only advancement, making loot the only thing worth keeping/taking and people simply mobile loot spawns.  For players with high end gear, there's not a lot of challenge in survival anymore, so they tend to drift into PvP for entertainment purposes.  Zombies become increasingly irrelevant as you build up knowledge of how to avoid them, leaving you with an excess of ammo and a big ass rifle.  The list goes on.

I agree with you that the choice needs to be more interesting.  Ideally, it should be driven by in game imperatives like hunger, fear and desperation, and it should be a tough choice to make not an easy one.  You might think twice about killing another player if you feared zombies more, or if two people had abilities that one person did not, as they do in real life.  

Right now, if the choice to shoot another player is made before you even meet, and the shooter doesn't even have any feelings about it, it seems far less interesting than DayZ could be.  Personally I choose not to shoot on sight only because it makes the game more compelling and intense than constantly gunning people down and never taking risks.","1341102215"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The point you are missing is this: the number one main reason why healthcare costs are so bloody outrageous (a point we both agree on) is because so many uninsured freeloaders like you abuse the system. oh sure, you ""pay your fucking bills"" now, wait until you spend some time in the ER over something unavoidable, like a genetic disease. You wouldn't usually be in the ER, but you don't have a choice because you haven't got insurance. All of a sudden, you owe $25k +.

We don't agree on that at all. There's a cost to doing business in every business. Sometimes people steal. Sometimes they're just unable to come through with payments. Every business accounts for these in their business model. You want everybody to believe a certain propaganda that says the reason medical costs go up at 3 to 5 times the rate of inflation **per year** is because some people aren't paying up. That's absolute nonsense. 

The reason you pay half a million dollars for cancer treatments is because the oncologist that treats you thinks he or she is a demi-god and they want to live life in the lap of luxury. Most ANYONE can become a solid, competent doctor. All it takes is education. Why are we paying these asshole nearly a quarter million dollars in annual salaries? That's outrageous. We need medical salaries to come back down to Earth. All this law does is guarantee their ridiculous fees. Much like all student loans do is guarantee increased tuition costs. 

Every industry where the government steps in to subsidize the costs sees it's prices exceed inflation by leaps and bounds. Of course you're thinking, ""well it's only costing me $500 a year, so it's no big deal"". But the economy doesn't work on just what things cost you. It's in the aggregate. The only way we can pay these assholes now is by borrowing trillions of dollars from our great grand children.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Thank you. I always used to have the problem that I expected people to be rational, and it was incredibly frustrating because people made no sense to me. I think a lot of geeks are that way, especially when younger...

Here's two book recommendations that pretty much encompass what every lay person ought to know about social psychology, and that are at once incredibly scary (because they go into a lot of detail about just how predictably irrational we are, even when life and death is involved) and funny/tragical/comical (for the same reasons):

""The happiness hypothesis"" by Jonathan Haidt: Starts with the premise that there must be ""something"" that classic religions and philosophy got right about human nature to have been so successful, and then proceeds to pick apart how various aspects of their teachings fit (or doesn't) with results from modern psychology, especially in terms of what makes us happy.  This one is mostly on a positive note throughout, but drives home how different we need to look at ""self"" than what most people do and some things about how to gain more control over yourself or at least understand why you act the way you do.. 

Key insight: Consider yourself a ""rider"" struggling to keep control of an intransigent elephant (the elephant being your sub-conscious / instincts) - many times you get taken for a ride (trying to counteract basic instincts, like strong hunger, basically doesn't work - the primitive parts of your brain will eventually just override your conscious thought processes). But if you're mindful of the needs of the beast you can coax it into doing what you want (eat that carrot before the urges get strong enough to make you gorge on a tub of ice cream; buying your lunch when you're full and your conscious gets to decide what to buy, so that when you're hungry and the instincts run amok there's only healthy food around you, etc.). 

""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini: Effectively a survey of methods used by sales people, religious cults, con artists, politicians and a range of others to influence us. Cialdini even went ""under cover"" in lots of situations to pick up the tricks and then subjected the methods to tests or dug up research to explain why the various methods worked the way they did. 

The book is like watching a car crash in motion. Scenario by scenario it cites research that demonstrates how we predictably gets taken in by ludicrously simply methods, or will act in depressingly counter-productive ways in response to external stimuli even sometimes when we *know* people are playing us, and how what in the grand scheme of things are useful rules of thumbs in an evolutionary and social sense can backfire spectacularly in specific scenarios. It then ties that back to various broader principles.

E.g. reciprocity. Do something to someone, and on average people will feel a strong urge to return the favour. Easy to exploit: The magnitudes of the favours doesn't need to match, for example. Indeed the original ""favour"" can be unsolicited and unwanted *and people can even know that you're doing it to get something back* and still they will on average give more with the ""gift"" or ""favour"" than without.

For me at least, reading both books was experience after experience of things suddenly ""clicking"" where I recognized various behaviour that had frustrated me in myself or others that suddenly made sense when viewing them in the sense of psychological drivers instead of judging them based on rationality.

"frugalmalefashion","t5_2s8e9","C'mon man. You should know the basics as to what you should get. If needed, ask your manager/hiring manager or an HR person what a person typically wears to work.

Just check out some polos, one-colored dress shirts, patterned dress shirts, etc. Are you in IB or a large company in NYC? If so, I'd recommend for you to stay away from polos. I have some friends in IB and they tend to be a bit dressier. 

Although some may recommend chinos to work, it depends on your environment. It might look tacky if everybody else is wearing slacks. For whatever professional business environment, I would at least get a pair of slacks in beige, grey and black. 

Your comment history tells me that you're Asian and into weightlifting. Because you're Asian, stay away from yellow shirts. That color looks disgusting on me. Dark colors like green and brown (think dark) look nice.

Get a nice belt. Don't be frugal on one.

Get 2 pairs of nice shoes. These are especially important because anyone with some sense of fashion can tell if you're wearing cheap shoes

It was pretty much the main reason for me get excited about the game. What's worse is that the coop mode they gave us as DLC later on is a somewhat nerfed version of what they had planned. The original game was supposed to be a four player coop action rpg. The campaign would have been a blast to go through if they had implemented those features, even if it was still single player. The two biggest hits the game took during development was the axing of the coop mode and the swap from the Blood Marines to the fluff marines to seal the deal for another GoW clone.","1341102250"

"AgainstAllArchons","t5_2u7oz","I raised the same objections as you do here and we discussed them at length before formulating this definition. But I think the idea of implied consent is not adequately explained here, and it continues to raise the hairs on the back of my neck in a way I can't quite express.

&gt; Reasonably inferred that the person would consent given the opportunity seems to play on not what is right or wrong but what is culturally normal, or what is believed to be true in the majority.

Here is the example I offered for this objection:

Imagine a situation where a person (adult) is endangering himself and is considered according to the criteria of modern medical science to be mentally disabled in some way. Therefore his doctors consider him incapable of informed consent for the operation that will restore his normal brain function. The patient insists that he understands his circumstances and refuses the operation. If the doctors go ahead and perform the operation regardless, I'd call this a clear and obvious act of aggression.

In the list of examples of applying this principle, we find

&gt; Forcing an operation against someone who is informed about the facts, can reason about the facts, and clearly declines the operation, qualifies as violence, and since forcing the operation is the initiation of violence, it is an aggression. It is a violation of the NAP.

However, I worry that this formulation of the NAP does not protect the autonomy of the patient in this situation, because the definitions of consent are such that explicit nonconsent does not preclude implied consent. Throwaway-o argues that this approach to consent is not only beneficial but necessary in order to handle cases such as vaccinating an unwilling child. I would prefer a slightly modified formulation which better guarantees the autonomy of adults, and makes an exception for custodianship of a child insufficiently developed to understand and accept the NAP.

To your other point,

&gt; Implied consent seems to be a gamble, a calculated risk. Act as you believe is right in the moment and throw yourself to the mercy of your victim should they later not give consent?

With this formulation of the NAP, revenge is considered immoral, so your victim may not respond with violence toward you if this occurs. He must take the case to an arbitrator, whose decision would hopefully take into account your good intentions and limited knowledge of the situation, and not leave you at the mercy of your victim, so to speak. But regardless, inferring consent is inherently risky, because you are making an assumption about someone else's preferences. ","1341102270"

What Andy did on that stage (attacking so far from the finish) took courage and was inspiring to watch. Trying to limit the damage caused by someone else's attack takes strength, but it's not the same as going out there trying to win. Cadel was riding that day to not lose the tour, whereas Andy was riding to win it. I totally get why Cadel rode the way he did and it was (clearly) the right tactical decision, but I guess I'd just rather watch riders who are willing to take the chance and attack to try to win the race on the road against their rivals rather than just waiting for the TT.","1341102273"

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","I think I know what that is.  I got screwed by a tenant who was growing pot in a house I rented to him and never paid a dime of rent.  Even though he was arrested it still took me 3 months to get rid of him and in the meantime he did $8500 of deliberate damage to the place that I was never able to recover.  Apparently he had done this to previous landlords as well.  So I joined a co-op that protects landlords from such things.  Here's how it works:

If your tenant is late, misses a payment, or engages in shenanigans you report it to the co-op.  The co-op keeps these reports in a database kind of like a credit bureau.  

When you get a new tenant application, you have them fill in a form provided by the co-op like the one mentioned by OP...it asks for bank account info, SIN, photocopy of drivers license, etc.  If the tenant doesn't fill it out completely you're supposed to reject the application.  Completed applications go to the co-op to be vetted against their database.  If something shows up in the database under the prospective tenants name/SIN number they send you a report.  The landlord can then decide whether to take the risk or decline the tenant.  

The co-op also provides advice/assistance on going after tenants for damages, etc. and that is another use of this information.  You need their bank account info to cease funds from their bank account after you get a judgement against them, etc.

Unfortunately there are a lot of really bad tenants who repeatedly rip off landlords..they move from place to place never paying rent, trashing people's property, etc. and there is little landlords can do about it.  Systems like this are becoming really popular with landlords and are definitely worth the annual membership fee.","1341102297"

Again, no Army guy who's reaching for a ""badass"" as a yardstick is going to land on ""Marine"", **regardless** of whether they have that reputation among civilians.

&gt;And as any Marine can tell you, this is certainly not accurate. I don't know about you, but I'd say that the more time either of us spend in the military, the less we truly care about such things.

I am an Army vet and have many friends in the Corps. We would all concur... but that's sort of my *point*, right there. Either the guy was Army and still takes his military shit seriously, or he realizes it's all bullshit. Either way, he's simply not likely to reach for ""Marine"" as a measuring point for badassery, because *neither* starting point leads to ""Marine = badass"".

&gt;But of course I'm always down for some friendly shit-talking.

One thing I always loved about Marines is that we could always agree to pick on the Air Force. You can sometimes agree to pick on the Navy, but then after a few beers some Army guy always says:

People have also said this multiple times so far, but drop the alcohol and the almonds until you start losing weight. Keep your carbs below 20g and eat your green vegetables. Drink massive amounts of water. 

Don't worry about coffee, you can still keep that with no problems as you don't add anything to it anyway.

Once you lost weight consistently for a few weeks, then you can start reintroducing more carbs into the diet and see how they may affect your ketosis. 

Best of luck to you! Don't give up change **will** happen if you stick to it.","1341102359"

On paper anyway, but fuck the grand kids everything is fine now...

&gt;According to calculations by Reuters Insider credit analyst Ed Rombach two weeks ago, the average duration of the Fed's new portfolio of bonds is just under 5 years, and every 1-basis-point rise in 5-year to 6-year Treasury yields results in a loss of about $65 million.
The Fed is sitting on paper losses of about $2.3 billion on the purchases of U.S. Treasuries it made from November 12 until late last week, according to an analysis by Reuters Insider.
The Fed is also vulnerable to losses through its so-called Maiden Lane portfolios, a collection of investments it acquired when it brokered J.P. Morgan Chase's takeover of a floundering Bear Stearns and bailed out failed insurer AIG.
The portfolio will likely generate losses, according to many analysts. Still, the total Maiden Lane portfolio amounts to just $66 billion, a small slice of the Fed's growing pie of securities.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Unfortunately you don't trend your data over time, most of it is only a snap shot.

You cannot determine anything without long term trending analysis.

For example, wait times. Are they increasing or decreasing over time? How about debt? How about spending on health care.  Is spending on medical services increasing faster or slower then the US. If it's increasing at the same rate, they are still headed for bankruptcy, it will just take longer.

Your life expectancy data is worthless. It tells us nothing about the cause of death. You cannot compare the US, to Canada because the murder rate and obesity rates are so dissimilar. You can't compare the US to the European countries because people in the US tend to drive a lot more, and it is a major cause of death. You would need to study individuals, who eat the same foods and have similar genetics and who die of disease for a valid analysis.

You don't take into account the accuracy of the data you provide. It's like the people who still use the WHO health-care rankings, they don't even bother to read the methodology, or the criticisms - even when listed at the bottom of Wikipedia (see dmareddit's post). 

There is huge pressure for governments and the workers in public health systems to manipulate the data. If they don't, they will get in trouble have their funding cut and could lose their jobs. The data they provide cannot be trusted, you must find an unbiased source outside of the government or health care systems, with no stake in the system to get valid data. 

You don't mention the biggest problem among all the socialize medicine countries with massive social safety nets. They are all failing. How do we know this? Look at their birth rates. Their birth rates are all falling and they are aging. They are not having enough children to replace people who die and support their massive governments over time. When this happens to a society, it fails. 

Many European countries attempt to compensate through immigration, but it's a two edged sword. Often, the new immigrants take a generation or two to move up the socio-economic ladder to produce the same kind of wealth native inhabitants do. So when someone retires,who used to make $75,000 per year, is replaced by a new immigrant who earns $35,000, the system is strained even further.

 Many Europeans countries birth rates are so low, they would have to bring in millions of immigrants to make up the short fall. It would change their societies in massive ways and in a short time, they would no longer be the same society. Ask the North and South American Indians about this one. 

Mind you, the US is doing the same thing regarding immigration, with both positive and negative effects, but we are a much larger country with far greater natural resources and a history of immigration.

The percentage of non-native citizens is another factor you completely ignore. If a man is born in Kenya and immigrates to the US, his life expectancy may be lower because of poor diet and disease prior to coming to the US. Something completely out of control our the US medical system.

Making things worse, many of the young people in heavy socialized countries are leaving. 

One other thing you should trend, the portion of GDP government consumes.

So I think you made a decent effort, but I don't find your conclusions valid, since your data isn't.

Does it make a difference whether its a lone business in a competitive environment or a cartel? Well, depends. 

It depends on what principles you want to put above others. On a pure property rights libertarian framework, its easy to say, well fuck it who gives a shit. But there is a difference between 3 apple vendors competing on price and 3 apple vendors fixing price. It goes into the freedom as a choice set model; its [Apple price $A, Apple Price $B, Apple Price $C] vs. [Apple Price $X]. See this model doesn't give a shit whether you choose to consume or not. It assumes there is a loss of freedom regardless whether you give a shit about apples or not. 

This model also doesn't necessarily support or fight property rights inherently. There are situations where property rights enhance choice sets. There are situations where they reduce choice sets. Same with government or whatever. I'm going with this, it still makes the most sense to me at this moment. Otherwise its hard to balance how net neutrality or safe harbors works to enchance free flow of information while at the same time your pushing hard for first and fourth amendment rights. Traditional frameworks of big or small government don't work. Its a policy by policy thing. 

I guess if you want to keep this conversation interesting and stop this turning into a situation where we're just talking over each other's heads. You'll need to attack the fact that i'm putting the free flow of information above property rights. 

And see with net neutrality; with this framework its easier. Its easier to see that it brings in new entrants more easily. So the network ends up with more information. Likewise on the consumption end its easy to see that consumers end up being able to access all choices with equal speed, so they should end up with more information flow. 

And its also easy to see, that net neutrality has a limit. If it gets to the point where it retards investment in new infrastructure, thats bad for free flow of information.

But here we have a better framework for working out where to find the balance. Taking a property rights or overly user rights to everything approach overlooks the tension and likely to lead to bias in one direction or the other.

There's a lot wrong with this idea. While something strange may have happened here (there's [some evidence that Roberts may have switched his views](http://www.volokh.com/2012/06/28/was-scalias-dissent-originally-a-majority-opinion/)) this hypothesis would require that Roberts had decided to make such a sacrifice for the most important case of his career. It also ignores the fact that Roberts has in many respects been a moderate and has broken with the right-wing of the court before (such as in [Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_v._Flowers)). Roberts has generally advocated judicial restraint, and this decision is not inconsistent with that philosophy.

I have no idea how the ICD process works, but the DSM criteria are getting a huge - and in my opinion hugely *beneficial* - update in the next edition of the manual. For starters, the diagnosis's name is being changed to ""Gender Dysphoria"" - which is considered to be the ""disordered"" part of the condition (not being trans itself). (The APA [agrees with this](http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx#) - see #11 (APA site, why you no give permalinks?!).) Additionally, the actual criteria themselves are much better, and center on the distress and problems gender dysphoria creates in people's lives. Finally, the creation of a separate diagnosis for children and adolescents helps to address the whole ""But they're just kids, what if they don't know?"" idea - and actually with both sets of criteria, they provide a much more concrete set of things.

&gt; EDIT: Although, personally, I don't see it as being a disorder or sickness.

To be honest, the way he explained it to me was that they were fuckbuddies and I was like ""Yeah I don't care, go ahead. Maybe we can have a threesome,"" and things seemed pretty uplifting and positive.

Until she actually came.

If you read my other comment, the first time this happened, the girl turned out to be a nutcase and to this day still thinks my bf and her are together despite it being obvious they're not. This new girl clearly has some huge mental/anger issues (she blows up and starts screaming at EVERYTHING) so I believe my bf when he says she's not dating material, but on the other hand, he certainly took his sweet time in telling her they weren't dating. And I know he probably never would've told her either -- ""to avoid drama"" -- If I hadn't have been so pissed about it.

I'm open(ha) to trying again, to just be monogamous without marriage, but unfortunately due to timing, it's going to end up being an LDR. And I don't know if either of us could handle just waiting around for 2 years being celibate because we decided to be monogamous. That's why I wanted to marry him. So the ""effort"" would be worth it. You know, so I'd get some sort of ""guarantee"" that if he fucked up, he done fucked up good (and vice versa). 

I also had a feeling that since he'd been fucked over by a fiance in the past, he'd try harder to be monogamous if we were engaged.
So again, I don't know. If he wasn't leaving next month for 2 years this is probably what we would've done.","1341102430"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","As a long-time (pre-1.03) tank demon hunter, nicely done. I like it when other people ""see the light"" and go toe-to-toe with stuff on their DH :)

Now for some criticism: IMHO you're overdoing the tanking concept for this boss: you are overgearing Ghom's damage by a lot, so you should probably focus on dealing more, much more damage.

First, against inferno Ghom, you don't need sentry, you don't need gloom and you don't need to use a shield. Just go for two one-handed crossbows for more (much more) life on hit through faster grenades and better healing throughput on your caltrops.

Second, since you don't use neither gloom nor sentry, you don't need night stalker anymore. You'll have plenty of discipline available for all your caltrops, just pick a dps talent. I'm currently itching towards sharpshooter because caltrops crits don't reset it, but cull the weak is also a great choice and depending on the rest of your gear, archery or vengeance or even grenadier might even be decent picks (see below).

Third, you now have two available skill slots. Go for cluster arrow/cluster bomb or cluster arrow/Loaded for bear, and fan of knives/assassin knives. The 5 knives all hit the same target if it's the only one around, so it's essentially a big hitting melee attack every 10 seconds. Hungering Arrow is more for questing and elite killing in act3, to build up hatred for cluster arrow downtime. You can also achieve great results with a bat companion and either grenadier or vengeance here.

I personally hate dying, that's why I play my DH as a tank. What I hate even more is having no effective offensive options - having only caltrops and grenades as offensive skills against a ranged champion pack in act3-4 makes me punch my screen out of rage, repeatedly, so I urge any DH tank to save themselves some stress and play without any defensive skills - at least you'll have fun testing new combos to destroy everything in your path.

As a result, the money is accumulating at the top with not enough economy to reinvest it. If you really think the rich-poor disparity is a problem, economically, the solution is to decrease the size of the money supply. That means the government stops spending on debt and stop laws promoting increase of the money supply. If that happens, you will see the gap between the rich and poor decrease very dramatically and quickly.","1341102450"
"keto","t5_2rske","""Heavy lifting"" means different things to different people, nobody expects you to start doing 50lb dumbell curls or benchpress 250lbs to start. ""Heavy"" is based around your own capabilities and nobody else's, you'll need to start off with exercises at weights/resistances suited to your current physical condition.

Strength/resistance training for older people (even the elderly) has become far more common over the past decade or so and will only become moreso, as it helps combat the degradation that occurs as we all age.

The goal is to start at an intensity your body can handle, and over time progress to slightly higher weights as your body adapts. Even using resistance bands can be a great starting point for those without prior experience, as theres no risk of overextending or dropping weights, and elastic bands aren't nearly as intimidating

Weight machines also have less of a learning curve than freeweights, and can be a good place to start as your able to isolate and work specific movements/muscle groups rather than relying on full body strength and balance. ","1341102450"

I could probably find tens of thousands of examples to illustrate how wrong you are on this.

Same goes for force, citizens are able to own firearms, there are private security guards, mercenary outfits, militias, bodyguards, bouncers, repo men, debt collectors, etc.  

The state can curtail rights, but it can also protect them.

The problem with the NAP is that humans are naturally aggressive.  Capitalism is build on aggression, allocation of wealth, property and resource are determined by aggression.  We kill to eat.  We fight for sport.  It's a part of humanity.  And right wing libertarians are some of the most aggressive people I know.

Linking to a person's user page isn't incentive to downvote them. People are responsible for what is on their user page. If people see his and decide he should be downvoted on the basis of his comments there, then the onus is on him, not whoever linked it.

To me, circumcised penises look just ridiculous. Most of the world doesn't circumcise babies, without any problems, aestetic or otherwise.

Circumcising babies is really just a cosmetic surgery. It has no medical benefit for a baby, and even if it did, those are justifications after the fact to try to hide the real reason, which like you said is purely cosmetic. I can't really see how you could possibly justify such a surgery on infants, it just isn't right. It's like if you wanted to tattoo your baby. It should not be allowed.","1341102484"

Valve's **Left 4 Dead** explored this concept in a limited manner, with it's 'director' which controlled the pacing of the zombie encounters within otherwise scripted scenarios.

**Dwarf Fortress** explores the use of generating history in a simulated world. It's not for everyone, but for some players the simulation has enough depth to be engaging it's own right.

The old school text adventure format looks like the easiest way to experiment with procedural narrative due to the simplicity of presentation. However other forms of abstraction that remove the need for human quality voice synthesis, etc, would work. We might envisage a cute isometric world inhabited by thoughtful blobs that communicate with smileys, or something more polished but more limited that might resemble **Spore**.

2. I was the top student in the class.

3. We were friendly (but not friends) with each other, so we would occasionally make small talk in class (in french of course) and greet each other in the hallways.

4. She was unmarried and had never told any of the students whether she had a boyfriend or not, so her pregnancy was completely unexplained.

5. We had bumped into each other during the summer at a small concert, so when the school year started she said something along the lines of ""It's so great to see you all of again after such a long summer but some of you I saw a little earlier than expected (*gesture towards me*)"".

Travis Tygart, CEO of USADA (yes, CEO) has had a hard-on for Lance for *years*, including offering Floyd Landis slap-on-the-wrist deals if he would help bring Lance down, after Landis tested positive following his 2006 Tour win.  (Landis refused, and was adamant at the time that he had zero knowledge of Lance using any prohibited substances, even though he would have saved his own skin by doing so.)

The thing is, in order for doping agencies to justify their budgets, they have to catch people.  Although USADA is a private organization, it receives most of its funding from your tax dollars.  So they need to look ""effective"", and the bigger the names Travis can bring down, the more power he can justify claiming in the name of ""stopping doping"".

*All* the evidence is circumstantial.  And to top it off, the Department of Justice spent TWO YEARS investigating Lance, convened a grand jury and forced a bunch of cyclists and managers to testify, and then *dropped the case* in February.

So, Travis Tygart has *nothing*, and the charges would never stick in a court of law.  But the way USADA works is that you don't get a judge and jury of your peers; you get an arbitration panel which is NOT meant to be unbiased.

It doesn't matter that you pass all the tests, it gives you no protection; they can just *decide* you're guilty.  The by-laws of cycling (and triathlons) are so fucked at the moment that you aren't allowed to compete if they are merely *investigating*.  The anti-doping organizations are *so* political, they can ""investigate"" anyone at any time for no reason at all and thus prevent them from competing.  It's basically a ""someone doesn't like you"" penalty.

This is basically one guy with a grudge on a crusade, and he can both offer reprieves and threaten penalties to other riders to get them to testify the way he wants.  ""Oh, you won't testify against Lance?  I hope we won't have to investigate *you* next.""

If you want to talk rumors, rumor has it this is why Hincapie announced he was going to retire; he will compete in the Tour and then be done before the hearings, and Tygart won't be able to blackmail him into testifying against Lance.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Last time I checked, people aren't emigrating to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland *en masse* to attend their universities. The United States has by far the highest rate of international enrollment in its universities, with nearly ~700,000 foreign students in the U.S. every year.  If there is one thing that this country has going for it, it's our higher education. We have, quite simply, the best universities (and a shitload of them) in the world. [Out of the top 400 universities in the world, 78 - or about 20 percent - are in the U.S.](http://www.usnews.com/education/worlds-best-universities-rankings/top-400-universities-in-the-world). Yet the U.S. makes up only 5 percent of the world's population.   

With high quality comes high cost. The student loan system is fucked up, admittedly, but many students take out more in loans than they should. It's great if you're passionate about your degree in comparative British literature (with a minor in women's studies), but you have to be realistic about what sort of job opportunities you can expect with that degree. And it would be hard for me to feel sorry for you if you took out $50,000+ in loans to get that degree. 

And guess what? Not everyone needs to go to college. If this economic downturn has taught my generation anything, it's that a college degree won't automatically grant you a job. And there a lot of good paying jobs out there - electrician, plumber, mechanic, etc. - that don't require a college degree. 

And everyone complains about the rising cost of attending college, but no one stops to think that the costs have been rising because demand has increased - more people than ever in the U.S. are enrolling in universities. 

I can't stand these comparisons to European countries for things like this, because it's much easier for them to socialize the costs of their education. They have small, quite homogenous populations - the total population for all of the Nordic countries is ~25 million, or about the same population as Texas. They have stricter laws concerning immigration. Their economies are more reliant on a college-educated workforce, so their college-educated citizens are more likely to find jobs. Oh, and it's more than fucking misleading to say that their educations are ""free."" There is no such thing, as economists say, as a free lunch. The Nordic countries have the highest rates of taxation in the world. And you know what? It works for them, sure. But their system could never work in the United States.

This guy seemed cool, and he even told me he was planning on transferring to a university which was on my list of grad schools, so I figured we'd make good roommates. But there was a red flag, he asked if it'd be alright to smoke pot in the apartment. I told him I don't care if he smokes, but just not in the apartment. This is university housing, and I'm in my last semester, so I didn't want that kind of distraction. He did it anyway. I can't stand that smell.

His first night there, he wanted a pizza, but didn't have any money. So I offered to pay for it as long as he paid me back. We also agreed to take turns buying groceries, because in my experience, sharing food and dishes has always worked better than having separate dishes and food. The problem is, he didn't pay me back, and he never bought groceries.

He would listen to his music and the tv very loudly. When I asked him to turn it down, he just flatout said, ""No."" This is my last semester, and I'm working on a couple of 20 page research papers. So obviously I need some quiet. He just refuses. He would often leave his tv or music on when he left the apartment, and would lock his door.

One last thing: I am a trusting person, so I would leave my car keys on the table near the door. I worked within walking distance so I did not take my car. Usually after I got home from work, I would go get something to eat. Once I noticed that my seat had been moved, the radio had been changed and the volume was turned all the way back, and the car smelled of pot. When I got back I asked him if he took my car while I was at work. He said he did. I told him he would have to ask permission to use my car and that he can't just take it. He said, ""You left your keys out."" He didn't apologize or say it would happen again, he just told me my keys were out. This was the last time I even talked to him, and I moved out mid-semester.

Late in the semester, he got in trouble by housing. I only heard about it from his RA. I never told her anything about him, but he may have assumed I did. I found a dent on my trunk that could only have been put there by someone punching it. I suspect it was him.

That's how I know this discussion is fair and balanced.

You just disrespected every person who has ever participated in a conflict or that has ever become a victim of a war.

Life results in people dying and often involves violence, but it's not war.  War is a special case of human conflict whereby people are officially ordered to be murdered by civil governments to gain a stronghold on geopolitical power.  And I'm not even a dove by most standards.

Murder is not part of a purported class stratification nor a campaign against women.  If you think differently, then you haven't experienced even a fraction of the pain and suffering of war.  Tell me how many friends you have lost, how many people who have killed, how much blood is on your hands both literally and figuratively.  Tell me how your spirit died many times over as shell shock set in and your world became disillusioned and completely disrupted as the reality of sheer reality overcame your psyche faster than you could distill your emotions into storage compartments within your mind to save for later instead of blowing your brains out through the pores upon your scalp.

War is **HELL**.  It is not a walk in the park.

There is no war on women and there is no war between the classes.

The only war that is commonplace in our vernacular that does actually exist is the drug war because it is just as violent, indiscriminate in nature, and pervasive across society enough to warrant the descriptor ""war"".  It is not quite to the extreme degree that real war exhibits in the sheer number, depth, and breadth of actual armed warring conflict, but it is definitely not a cakewalk.","1341102557"

You are not really a part of the game, as a character OR a player. They don't respect your input or your time. My advice is still to leave the game, and find players who want to use their imaginations in the same way you do, and a GM who will help you do that.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","If the Earth is millions of years old, then what use was the listing of all the generations from Adam until now? What was the use of listing all the generations in Genesis, in Chronicles, in Matthew?

Genesis 5:5  And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 

If God created man on the sixth day, and we know how long Adam lived and all of the subsequent generations, which add up to roughly 6,000 years, how can we reconcile that with the theory that the Earth is millions of years old? It simply cannot be done. Either the earth is 6,000 years old or it is millions of years old. God is not the author of confusion. There is no unspoken, magical gap in between the verses in Genesis chapter 1. Almost no other chapter in the Bible is more simple and clear than Genesis chapter 1. 

___

It's hard to imagine something that has a world-wide consensus and billions of dollars in research could ever possibly be untrue. But time and time again in history that has been the case, where the majority has been wrong, where the silenced and ridiculed have ultimately proven to have been correct. It is strange and unsettling to accept, but true science is true science and the truth is the truth. We see this time and time again. I believe in fifty years we will look back to our medical practices and our understanding of medicine today and find that it was archaic and even barbaric in some cases, that we still knew so little and understood so little about the mysteries of the human body and of nature. Scientists have recently uncovered oceans underground, and this is in harmony with the Flood when  ""...all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."" - Genesis 7:11. 

It seems almost everyday scientists discover something new and shocking that we would have never believed before. It is strange to see that scientifically, the majority have had a track record of being wrong. From germ theory to medical practice, the majority have been wrong. And how did they take it? Scientists, who tend to be proud people who would take dissent and opposition extremely hard and personal, have in the past when been confronted or just even innocently had their views questioned have blacklisted and barred scientists. They are painted with a scarlet letter, they are threatened and ridiculed mercilessly so that no one else dares to question, even though inside they know the generally accepted view has discrepancies or is wrong. And so history repeats itself. The emperor wears no clothes but no one has the courage to speak up. And those who do are silenced and ridiculed. 

I believed in evolution. I started to uncover political truths especially during the Bush Administration that made me question everything and gave me a thirst for the truth. And by accident I stumbled upon this. I watched a creationist video one day out of morbid curiosity, out of wanting to listen to their fairy tale and wanting to laugh at their insanity of wanting to teach this unscientific nonsense in our schools. But I judged the defendant without hearing his case. So this is his case:

http://amazingdiscoveries.tv/c/10/The_Genesis_Conflict_-_English/

I was an atheist for many years until I stumbled upon these strange truths. Try and test these truths. Because if those prophecies did not come true, if the science of the flood is false, if the historical figures and histories of the Old and New Testament cannot be accounted for, then reject it. But do not reject it until you have heard the other side of the story. Without two sides, there is no choice. So look for the truth without fear of ridicule and with an open mind, and you will find it. 

""And Elijah came unto all the people, and said... if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word."" - 1 Kings 18:21

Think about dogs, foxes, wolves, coyotes, dingos, and the hundreds of different species of dogs from poodles to pit-bulls. Does it take millions of years to have such a great genetic variation? Consider white and black and asian people and even little people/dwarves. Is that the result of millions of years, or could those genetic variations in a genetic gene pool luck of the draw lottery occur quite quickly?

We all have the same human DNA - the same perfect and beautiful blueprint that creates this marvelously complex body of ours that holds secrets we will never fully unravel; the secrets and mysteries and marvels of this magnificent human form. But each and every person that ever lived on this earth has been different. We have all been a genetic lottery off of the same numbers off the same DNA. Think of it like a piano and all of us as different songs from the same notes. There are no new notes added to the piano. We are all different songs from the same exact human piano, the same exact human DNA blueprint. There cannot be birth to new information. There are no positive mutations. Sickle-cell anemia is listed as a positive mutation because it prevents the contraction of malaria, but you still have sickle-cell anemia, a debilitating disease. Countless mechanisms are irreducibly complex, and can only exist in its entirety or it cannot work at all. There is no evolutionary in-between.

So do millions of years separate dogs, coyotes, foxes, and wolves? When a dog gives birth, many times it gives birth to dogs with different furs and colors and features and sizes - all a genetic lottery. Dominant and recessive alleles and genotypes sort themselves out. What if you mate different dog breeds together to form a new breed and new crosses? Is that evolution? Or is that just genetic variation, how there can be different pups in a litter and every single one of them be different colors. 

Think about this: if all the dogs in the world were extinct and all scientists had were their fossils, how would they classify them? One might order them from smallest to biggest and say that this was evolution and that millions of years separated each fossil until the species gradually increased in size. But obviously, they would be wrong. Dogs, just through natural mating, through a roll of the dice in their genetic lottery, also have an infinite possibility of creating different kinds of dogs. A Great Dane is simply a cross between a Wolfhound and an old English Mastiff. There was no evolution, and it did not take millions of years for this change.

So many times in history it is the minority, the written off, the outsiders, the ones who dared to stand up, who were mocked and scorned and ridiculed for their scientific ideas, that later turned out to be true. Was not the world once believed to be flat? Just a hundred years ago operations were done without even washing hands and blood-letting was common practice. And now today, any scientist who even dares to innocently question the theory of evolution is violently ostracized. Doing so is career suicide and persecution and ridicule. Do people still have courage to question, even at the cost of their careers, at the cost of their reputations, at the cost of ridicule, to stand for the truth. We may flatter ourselves and think that we are wise and that we are different, when we are no different than those who once laughed and ridiculed the very scientists that many so admire and revere today. Without fear, without prejudice, with open minds, let us reason together.

""The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall. "" - Ellen White

1Timothy 6:20  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: 

1Ti 6:21  Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

In the beginning, God created the world perfect. Adam and Eve were naked, and they were not ashamed. The lion and the lamb dwelt together, and there was no sin, suffering, or death. If Adam and Eve had not sinned, they would have been permitted to eat of the Tree of Life, and would have had eternal life. But sin entered into the world, and all became subject to death, decay, and disease, and ""...the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."" Romans 8:22. Some say fossils that are 'millions of years old' prove that there was sin and suffering before Adam and Eve and before the rendering of the 6,000 year generations and timeline. But God did not create sin and death. An enemy has done this, and sin is an intruder into this world. God created the heavens and the earth in perfect harmony. The two cannot be reconciled. We cannot spiritualise and metaphorise away and call it poetic or allegorical what God has made so simple and plain and clear in His word. To say that ""a day"" everywhere else in the Bible means a day, but ""a day"" in the first chapter of Genesis actually means millions of years holds no sense or reason. Was Adam 930 years old? Or was that too, poetic and allegorical? Surely today no man can live to be 930 years old. Do we then make God a liar? God forbid. 

Matthew 6:24  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 

1 Kings 18:21  And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

Travelers checks are cashable but annoying. I've only done this once through Bank of China. They DID charge me a processing fee, and it took maybe 15 minutes or so. Note I had to find a ""second level"" branch, that is, a relatively big branch to have them processed.

My suggestion: use ATMs! There of course is a processing fee, but it's comparable with other options. You can go to any bank such as Bank of China, ICBC, or Construction Bank and use your foreign bank cards to withdraw money in RMB directly. The cost of this varies by home bank and bank here, but not by much, I find Bank of China is fine for this. Note, if you're American, Bank of America has a deal with China Construction Bank that will allow you to do this with no processing fee, which would definitely make it your best option.

EDIT: I just noticed your main question was how to get the best exchange rate. In that case I'm not entirely sure, my suggestions are based on what I've found to be the most efficient way to take out money here in general.

When I started getting away from nintendo around the gamecube years, I really wanted a fun platformer to play and games 'like' mario weren't cutting it (Jak and Daxter, VexX). It wasn't until I popped in Ratchet and Clank and had such a wonderful time with it.

I still remember how smooth the camera and everything felt after you start controlling ratchet in the first little world. It felt fantastic. I don't remember how the game played anymore as it's been SOO many years of RPG-style 'use gun, level it up' that I can't quite remember how the first Ratchet played out.

The obstacle course fat lady and the story twist still stick with me though. Loved every moment of the games, and A Crack in Time was nothing short of amazing.","1341102591"

&gt; If anything, this provides a useful way to dispose of the millions of tonnes of old tires that build up annually.  

By throwing them in your yard???  Wtf?  How about recycling them BACK into more tires?  No, trees are a renewable resource, its less green because rubber is a petroleum based product that does not decompose.  That means when it starts to look like shit and the person just dumps barkdust over the top of it, it will just sit in the ground for hundreds of years.  Barkdust is generally a byproduct of the lumber industry anyway.  Trees can be grown, managed and replanted, thus restarting the cycle.  You dont have to ""collect"" the bark afterwards and take it in for recycling, the earth does it for you, rubber is a different story completely.  


&gt;It might not be your preferred method, but your argument is garbage. Just because you don't like something doesn't make it stupid.  

HAHA!  It has NOTHING to do with my personal preference or not, i said it was wasteful, i never said i didnt like it aesthetically.  My argument is totally valid!  This person is dumping trash into their front yard which will likely get destroyed due to the weather and then either thrown in the garbage or covered over in a few years instead of being recycled again.  Where as a wood product would break down naturally and become dirt.   This isnt a playground where safety is the reason for placing this on the ground, this is just someone being lazy because they dont wanna weed their yard.  Its wasteful pure and simple.","1341102595"

Back story time: Our landlord will not allow use to have dogs in the house, therefor I grew up with cats. In 8th grade a teacher I had always joked about this as his wife was allergic to cat fur so they were a casebook definition of dog lovers. This lead to many arguments on which are better. One day the school library were giving away old magazines. I walk in and see a pile of Cat Lovers Fancy (or something like that). I grab all of them and after school walk into the teachers room and throw them on his desk. We laughed about it but somehow this turned into me fucking cats. 

update:

Today I learned that there in fact more than one person was was rumored to fuck cats in high school. I have also learned that I am moving to mexico. Pictures are below.

I'm always the one breaking up with him, and he always comes back. And it's not like a crawling back, either. After our emotions have settled down and we're all rational (1-2 hours later), he'll comeback and say ""You know, you were right, that was stupid, we'll work on this, let's try again.""

So we're back together within the same day. And he really does seem like he's working on it, he just sucks at it. So I don't know what to do anymore.

So, say that AES with 256-bit keys is advertised to be unbreakable without performing 2^256 operations on average (I don't know the actual number, it could be less as it is with RSA and ECDSA, this is just an example).  When cryptologists find a way to break an AES message in 2^224 operations, AES is said to be broken.

I don't think in the history of time *any*[1] cryptographic method has been proven unbreakable.  But cryptographic methods are broken all the time, with MD5 being an obvious recent example.

"aww","t5_2qh1o","Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and maybe, just MAYBE it's possible to get a wolf who's not aggressive around anyone, but I doubt it. There was a woman here a few months ago who had 3 wolf dogs and lived on someone's property. When she signed the lease she guaranteed that they weren't aggressive, and wouldn't hurt a fly. They were walking past a bush when the owner's cat ran out, and the wolfdog pulled on its leash and snapped the cat's neck in an instant. All that fucking woman could do is make excuses and complain that she might have to move or lose her precious wolfdog, when the other woman's pet was fucking DEAD because of the OP's negligence.

It also annoys me that people will buy them without any evidence whether or not it will be aggressive, just so they can have an ""interesting"" pet, and that's not what owning an animal is about. Breeds that are &gt;25% wolf are illegal almost anywhere, and in general are highly likely to be aggressive and easily provoked, at least to people other than their owner (alpha). There is no reason to get a wolf dog instead of any number of large dogs who are just as playful/active, but actually f*ing domesticated and docile. ","1341102638"

I would wager that the majority of the LGBT Community was not directly affected by Don't Ask:Don't Tell, at least in the sense that most of us weren't exactly lining up outside the recruitment offices the next morning. The GLBT community fought strongly against DADT. Why was it so important?
Well... 

* It sucked for those who wanted to serve

* It made everybody in the GLBT community second-class citizens

* Most community leaders have studied the Civil Rights movement, and know that it was helped significantly by Truman's mandate against discrimination in the ranks.  If it worked once...

So, how is that related? 
Well, DOMA sucks for those who want to be married, it makes us second-class citizens, and if the MM - FF - TT - MT - FT relationships can be recognized as legal commitments by the country, then that does begin to change a few minds. Again, if it worked once...

No, it won't magically change the minds of those who are deeply set in their ways, but it will influence those who are not so deeply entrenched.  It will make it more and more difficult to pass or uphold prejudicial laws.  It will make it more and more difficult for people to view GLBT people as *less than*.

If you are worried about special status/anti-discrimination laws, it helps to remember what another poster mentioned - these cases are difficult to prove.  They also do not have a central rallying point, and are less effective in changing day-to-day attitudes of discrimination, since most are ignored and/or seen negatively as ""Affirmative Action"" or ""PC-BS"".  

Finally, married citizens enjoy a special class.  This is just the way it is.  They can both contribute to a mortgage, and if one person passes away, the other person does not have to purchase that person's half of the property and/or pay inheritance tax on it and/or lose their home; if one person is an immigrant, they can be married and achieve citizenship; if one person is incarcerated, they can have visiting rights; if one person is incapacitated, the other can make medical decisions...

**Federal** marriage grants many rights that most same-sex couples do not have access to.  Even if you are not in this stage of life yet, even if you see it as *oppressive* or *heteronormative* or outside of your life plan, repealing DOMA once and for all normalizes LGBT relationships (and yes, I'm including B and T because Bi friends in committed same-sex relationships and Trans friends in relationships where their federally recognized sex is the same as their partners are also affected by these issues). 

Once you see something as normal, it becomes very difficult to formally discriminate against it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not sure I follow your logic. I think the simplest explanation, *especially* if ""nobody has ever lost an election for being to hard on drugs,"" is that our representatives are dependent on other forces than the people to get elected. They are not representing the people alone, as the constitution instructed.

I think the article comes close to getting it right.

&gt;The half of Americans who favor marijuana legalization are not an organized voting bloc

What he's close to figuring out, there, is that the people are not lobbying Washington effectively. Washington doesn't support legalization *not because the people disagree with it*, nor even because they're afraid The People will be against it, but because in the event that monied lobbyists exist who are *against* it—and those organizations most certainly do exist—the people, unorganized, wouldn't provide those representatives with as many campaign contributions to make up for the lost contributions and attack ads from those organizations.

&gt;The reason, of course, is **fear**, the force that governs so many decisions politicians make. At the moment, there remains a strong incentive to support the status quo, lest you be targeted in your next race as some kind of hippie-lover ... And if those Democrats have nothing to fear from the left, there's no reason for them to step out. 

Targeted by whom? Step out in front of what? I don't think the author would disagree with me: Step out and risk losing contributions from lobbyists. Step out and risk an onslaught of attack ads—not funded by ""the People"" but funded by corporations and billionaires with profit motives.

Our representatives are addicted to campaign cash. It's the only way they can stay in power. And the campaign cash they're worried about isn't the small $ donations from you or me. But it should be.","1341102641"

* Gradients are far more intuitive in FW. Use the pointer tool (press V) on a shape with a gradient fill to see its gradient handle(s). No more need for a separate gradient transform tool. Try elliptical gradients for a guaranteed fuck yeah moment.

* Use groups instead of layer folders. While you can mirror typical PS layer structures it's easier to manage layers in nested groups. (I still name layers and use the 'Group: ***' naming convention)

* Set up your guides and universal design elements in a master page. Then have one page for each template/page you're designing. Bonus points for interlinking them with slices/hotspots so you have basic prototypes in your browser.

* If designing buttons is part of your work - convert to symbols and enable 9-slice scaling.

And yes, the truth is, there is no way to make a mythic creature good versus the titans. It is such a shame that the Preators lost to them as well. WoTC made a mistake reprinting them, and corrected it by not doing so for m13. The titans are some of the best high end mythics ever printed. And they overshadow all the other prints that came out since they have. 

And now every high end mythic has to pass the ""titan test"" of efficiency and effectiveness to be good. 

This card serves as an impressive mythic, and would be a tournament staple if not for titans. 

However, it is still a stronger mythic, and would see far far more play, than the original.

Needless to say it ended in some very embarrassing moments (either couldn't get it up or couldn't finish what I'd started on multiple occasions).  At that time I had no clue what was going on.  I was convinced I had ED or that I was somehow damaged.  Five years ago I got into a long term relationship...similar problems.  Recently I learned about NoFap, and after only 19 days I now know that the ED and listless libido are totally reversible.  Sex drive is up.  Relationship is better.  Had I known back then at age 23 what I know now, my time in Vegas would have been one of the best times of my life instead of a drain on my self esteem.  Thanks for your post.

The Chinese dude refused to acknowledge him at all, but was all friendly with the white bro. The white bro found out that the Chinese guy had 0 love for Asian people of all kinds and had the sole ambition of becoming a white American. 

My prof and the white bro were like, ""Yeah. But if you wanna be American, you have to be accepting and open to all races.""

And the Chinese dude was like, ""All right. I'll do that."" Then, he underwent eye surgery to make his eyes look less slanted.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Sure, an ideal treadmill isn't. If we define an ideal treadmill as, a treadmill that perfectly recreates what running on the ground is like, but real treadmills aren't like that. 

I would agree that a treadmill without a motor is perfectly equivalent to on the ground running. If the person has to push the belt the same way they have to push the ground, there's no difference, but having the belt moving underneath you changes the relation.","1341102732"
"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","I'm a gay guy, so perhaps I don't have a useful perspective on this, but I'd say this is very mild and not creepy at all. IMO minor physical contact is definitely OK even on a first date, but if the mood is not yet sensual, then you have to be careful that you do not bring it in a sexual or even sensual way. If you do it in a sensual way then some people, especially less experienced ones, will be taken by surprise and move their hand away even though they might like you. It's usually a better idea to do other things to ease into a sensual mood, like longer eye contact and a smile. You can also do physical contact in a friendly getting-comfortable-with-each-other kind of way. For example you can introduce physical contact in a semi functional way; if she has a watch or ring, you can say ""that's an interesting ring, can I see it"" and hold your hand face up. If she takes off the ring and hands it to you, bad luck, if she places her hand in yours, great.

As long as you ease into it, anything goes even on a first date (but this might be my bias showing). The problem is not high level moves but skipping levels, so to speak. If you make a move to kiss out of the blue, that's creepy. If the other person was okay with long eye contact and hands touching the moment before that, it's not a big step and not creepy.","1341102733"

The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

My good friend Army Sergeant Timothy Paul Martin was killed in Iraq years ago and I always wondered if he felt or knew what happened.  It is my understanding that he died right away, but I don't know if that is something they say to bring the family a modest amount of comfort.  I hope he died instantly and felt nothing, but wonder if the fact that he was inside a Humvee makes it more likely that he temporarily survived long enough to be aware of the bomb or his injuries?

Edit to add: Ditto on kissing. There's nothing wrong, per say, with saving that 1st kiss for your wife. In my experience, it's not realistic, but maybe you can make it work for you.

Valve did nothing to hype the video in any way; the ARG and the length from the last major update doesn't say anything about the video's ""quality"".

As many people point out in other places, Valve never intended the Pyro to be anything more than just blasting fire at everyone; the first flamethrower didn't even have compression blast to begin with, it was literally just W+M1 Pyros everywhere. Yes, he has a lot more uses and functions these days as a support character, but there's a reason he was classed as an Offense character in the first place; he runs at people and flames them.

Look, I'm not saying you can't have an opinion, but if you're let down in any way by the video, then you can't blame Valve since you're the one that chose to follow all the hype and speculation, and you're the one that placed expectations as to what *you* wanted the video to be. Valve gave you free cake, and you were ashamed to find out it was carrot rather than chocolate.","1341102763"

You must keep the refrigerant circuits pristine clean, and while I did not watch this procedure, I can't imagine how you cut stuff out without getting copper flakes into the system.

Knowing this, I'm going to recommend that you pull the charge, replace the drier and pull the liquid line feeding the TXV and snatch the screen out and clean it well. Then reverse of above. Weigh the charge in. With your modifications it will probably need to be tweaked but its a fantastic starting point.

No matter what the pen size is, they will still poop just as much (which is a lot, these things are eating and shitting machines). They have adequate space. When I keep layers/breeders they get a little more room and a couple more accessories in their pen as they have to stick around a while. The grow out pens dont need to be so big because the birds will only live 8 weeks before butchering.

If I had one or two birds, I would keep them on litter. It would be easier. Having a lot more than that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to put them on anything but wire. Quail don't roost like chickens so whatever their ""floor""is is where all their time will be spent. I don't have time the change the litter 4 or 5 times a day for a hundred birds so they can keep from getting covered in poo. There is also the risk of coccidiosis (as I mentioned) and several other things that could grow if given the chance that are reduced or eliminated by keeping the birds up off their litter.

I've spent a lot of time and effort researching this. I have several animals, both pets and food, and I take very seriously the wellbeing of the lives I take responsibility for.

My birds are happy and healthy. They are cared for in the same way many others do. If you go to backyardchickens.com or any of a dozen other sites I spent countless hours reading, you will find the overwhelming majority of people who own quail keep them just as I do and would reccomend the same for others.

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","One option is to look at the swimsuits [at Brastop.](http://brastop.com/swimwear-clearance-sale.aspx) This is just the clearance swimwear, since you said you were looking for something budget-friendly. Prices are in British pounds, so account for that. I ordered some bras from here recently and shipping to the US was prompt and didn't cost very much. (Unfortunately they didn't fit me, but I can say firsthand that they're very quick about refunds if you need to return things.) If you order before midnight this Saturday, they're also doing half-off on international delivery.

Brastop's suits are built like bras, and many even have underwires for support. They have sizes D-K... I'm not sure what size you are, but I'm hoping that something here will work for you. UK sizing on bras, especially in the larger cups is a little different than US sizing, so you might want to measure yourself using [this Redditor's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0). Bottoms are also sized differently in the UK than the US, so check the size charts.

I've heard from other Redditors that [Tommy Bahama's](http://www.tommybahama.com/TBG/Swim_Womens.jsp) swimsuits are a great option if you're busty or plus-sized. Unfortunately theirs are significantly more expensive. However, they're half-off if you spend $150, which doesn't seem difficult since most tops seem to be in the $70-90 range. They seem to have a good selection of colors and patterns, and have a whole selection of swimwear for D and DD cup sizes.

Good luck finding a swimsuit! I hope you find something that you love. :)","1341102785"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Fizz is strongest when played AP mid, with an emphasis on ganking. He has strong re-positioning skills; but since he needs to be in melee range to deal almost all of his damage, he requires good timing with these skills to stay alive and be effective. 

Lich Bane is generally considered to be a core item on him, since he needs to auto-attack as well as his Q applying on-hit effects. The movement speed is also nice, as mobility is one of Fizz's greatest assets. Rod of Ages used to be built often on him, but has fallen out of favor since it delays your lich bane - players now usually prefer 2-3 Doran's rings. Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap, and Guardian Angel are other items worth considering. 

His ultimate is a very strong ganking tool and is extremely effective at picking a target off - just take care to actually hit someone with it. 

He's not played as much because melee champions generally have trouble farming against ranged opponents, but he does well against mages that are reliant on skillshots or that can be assassinated quickly.

That isn't a fact at all. Many diseases and injuries are not at the fault of unhealthy lifestyles but rather just poor fortune.

&gt; Now I'm actively penalized for not buying a service I don't need. 

A strong argument could be made that you *do* need it. Preventative care is substantially less expensive than treating the sick. A fair debate could be made over the responsibility of the government making that mandate, but even healthy, young people need regular health care.","1341102805"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Thanks. The ""You got what you wanted"" line really throws me. I never wanted him to be 'miserable'. He threw it at me during the first time this happened, too.

He's never outright lied to me before now. The first time this happened, he thought he was single. Which, given the circumstances, was slightly believable. Okay. He said he was dating her upfront, it was just that when it came time to tell her we were still together, he refused because ""it would just cause drama.""

We've had MANY conversations about how that type of view just creates more drama, but he never gets it. Anyway, long story short is, after breaking up with the girl three times, the first girl turned out ot be a nutcase and she STILL thinks she's dating him, when it is clear to all parties (and onlookers) she's clearly not. We avoid her like the plague, now.

Because of that last situation, I'm like ""Well, he's been denying he's dating her this entire time, so.... Maybe she just got the wrong idea?"" Which is possible, but even so, ridiculous that it would take so much teeth pulling to get my bf to tell her we're together ""to avoid drama"".

Yeah, he eventually did it, and there was drama, but... I mean... C'mon...

To add insult to injury, I'm the one always breaking up with him, and he's the one who always comes back. After he goes through his little rage about losing a fuckbuddy, maybe an hour or two later (because we live together, it's not like we can actually be apart physically for too long) he'll come back and say, rationally, ""You know, you're right. That was really stupid. Let's fix this and try again.""

So we're back together in the same damn day. It seems like he's making an effort. I just really don't know anymore. =/

Rather, I'm simply saying that I find arguments against ""violence"" in general to be inadequate. Just because something is ""violent"" doesn't mean that it's bad or wrong, so I'm not sure what the big deal is with associating Islam with violence.

If the IPU told you that you need to kill people who try to hurt your children, would it be a valid criticism of the IPU to say that the IPU promotes violence? Of course not. And in this particular case, most people are in favor of using violence to defend children, so it seems a bit inane to try to associate violence with a sort of moral wrongness.

That's my point. The issue is *not* that Islam promotes violence, but rather the ways in which this violence is directed. But whether or not you agree with the ways in which the violence is directed... that really boils down to whether or not you are a Muslim, does it not?","1341102827"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","It looks like you've already updated your profile with a lot of the input which some people here have been providing, which from the sound of things is good.  I'll toss out a few of my thoughts on things as they stand, with the inevitable caveats that your mileage may vary, other people may well recommend the exact opposite, etc., etc.

I will agree with many people who say that, for most guys in the age range you're looking at, having a child will be an obstacle if not an outright deal-breaker.  That's not a universal, of course.  I personally wouldn't have much of a problem dating a woman with a kid.  I think that in your profile as it now is, you have about the right amount of mentioning that you have a child without it being an overbearing presence in your profile.  The exception is that having your daughter be almost the focal point of two of your three photos could come across as a bit much.  I know you already did some major overhauls of your photo selection according to boooobarella's suggestions, but in my opinion, you could stand to omit the third current picture and add one or two extra pictures with just you featured in them.

Also, I might beef up your self-summary with a couple of extra sentences.  What you have so far there seems good, but I get the sense that I could be getting a better sense of who you are as a person from something a little bit longer.  (That said, you probably don't need to mention that you ""don't smoke, rarely drink"", since the same information appears in your sidebar.)

Now, I see quite a few people have recommended that you strip out all the quotes from your favorites section.  Personally, I disagree.  I think they add some real character to the profile, and they offer a bit of a counterweight to the mention of having dropped out of high school (which you could consider just leaving blank at this juncture).  However, you could probably cut one of the Nietzsche quotes (I'd suggest clipping out the first, as it's less striking than the other, IMO), and you could compress the spacing a bit more so that it would seem to take up less space.  Your subsection on movies and shows is a bit long, especially for a list.  If you can, I'd recommend trying to cut out at least a third, and then separate the movies from the shows so that it won't seem so extreme.  In addition to the quotes, adding a mention of some of your other favorite books or authors would also go over well, I think.

If possible, you could also stand to slightly expand on your answer to ""I spend a lot of time thinking about"".  Other than that, things seem pretty good.  I'd also second the advice I've seen several people offer to make sure that your standards are well-suited for your situation in life right now.  Best of luck to you!","1341102851"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; You are intentionally ignoring the stark difference between a voluntary and an involuntary contract.

Absolutely not. While signing the contract is voluntary, following orders that have been sanctioned by Congress (after enlistment) is not voluntary in the least. Assume for example, that someone joined the miltary during a just war like WWII, and after the end of the war, Congress approved an operation like Vietnam or Iraq. The service-member has no choice. 

But leave aside all that. Your argument is simply a distraction because you have already stated that you are **willing to desert rather than be part of an unjust war**. What this means is you yourself stated that the involuntary or voluntary nature of the service **does not matter**. You are **willing to desert the military**.

Therefore if you are **willing to desert the military** (and face the consequences), why are you **not willing to stop paying taxes** (and face the consequences)?

That is, it's perfectly fine for you to say that a servicemember ""should just desert"" rather than fight the war, but a servicemember telling you to ""stop paying taxes"" rather than support the war is not ok.

The only way you will have a moral ground to stand on, is if you willingly decide to stop paying taxes and face the consequences. Then you're someone who sticks to their principles. Until then, you're simply a hypocrite who would hold others to a standard that you don't hold yourself to.","1341102927"

Similarly, instead of downtown, you'll want to call it the CBD (stands for central business district, means the same thing). There's a shuttle bus that runs every 6-12 minutes from Clayton campus to Huntingdale train station (I think it's called the 601), and trains run from Huntingdale to Flinders St Station (that's the main CBD station). The train you get on may go direct to Flinders St, or it may go through the city loop (and therefore stop at the rest of the CBD stations, including Melbourne Central)

For public transit, you will want to buy a Myki card, which is a little plastic card you can put money on to. Top it up with money at the big blue things that look like oversize bank machines at most train stations, touch on to get on the train (little yellow readers, you'll see them, if not ask) and then touch off when you get off the train so you are charged the right amount.

Don't ride the trains without being properly 'touched on' as the ticket inspectors will give you a ticket ($180 fine I think?). If in doubt just ask, pretty much everyone here speaks english to some extent.

Racism was (is depending on where you are and who you ask) is a real problem, so in response I feel they went too far the other way (keep in mind, the civil rights movement was only 50 years ago). They wanted to over compensate for negative racism through celebration of differences. Hopefully it dampens out. 

Some people feel you can never truly ""ignore your eyes"" so to speak, and therefore we have to have things to celebrate differing cultures (at this point, I would largely classify ""black"" American culture as differing greatly from ""white"" middle class American culture. It has its own subset of language, foods, and family rituals) to deflate negative feelings. I don't hold to this, but I'll be curious if Europe ends up going through race troubles if immigrants end up mostly assimilating, or if they can ""ignore their eyes"". ","1341102941"

Fast-forward again, and I get back to my room in the afternoon (I had a girlfriend at the time and was sleeping in her dorm at night.) to be greeted by my friends from across the hall.

"canada","t5_2qh68","why should government money go towards any sort of ""business"" ventures as well? both the arts and business drive economic activity in any nation, and governments who don't invest in arts are just as stupid as governments who don't invest in business.

we give billion dollar subsidies to the oil and gas industry in Canada, and they are one of the most profitable ventures in the country, we have a government owned bank who's primary purpose is to invest in small business.

it turns out that Foreign Affairs has millions and millions of dollars worth of art they had bought over the years and hung in Canadian missions all over the world as a way to promote those artists. in some cases pieces that are now worth millions were bought for mere hundreds of dollars years ago.

investments in art can be just a lucrative (or even more lucrative) as investments in business, so any argument you can make for government not investing in the arts can be made for the government not investing in business.

i would argue that just as it is no business of the government to decide *what* business they promote and invest in (as long as there is a solid return on investment,) it is not the government's place to decide what art gets invested in. part of the very purpose of art is to challenge societal norms, make people think, to foster controversy, or to promote discussion. if the government does not realize this, then they must b e run by people who are insecure. if the government is afraid that a piece of art will destroy or destabilize them, then that government must be weak and already unstable.

i think that the sign of a strong, confident government is one that is fully willing to fund controversy or even stuff contrary to their views and goals. this type of government would know they have a strong case in any debate that happens.","1341102980"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm not sure if you're trolling, or what. You don't seem to understand that Watchmen wasn't a superhero movie. The Owlman you link to isn't the person in the movie. That guy's name is Nite Owl. Watchmen does not take place in the DC Universe, it is in a universe parallel to our own. 

You are treating it as if it is just another Batman-esque movie, which it isn't. It isn't an action film, it's a study of the human psyche. It's a mature, dark, extremely-well written tale that took the comic book genre and turned it on its head. 

If you went into it looking for a Batman movie, that's why you are understandably disappointed. 

There was no main character in the story, and every character was extremely flawed in some way or another. That's the point. They were portraying realistic characters, characters that people can actually identify with and understand. You get why Nite Owl is the way he is, and you come to understand why Rorschach kills and hates crime as much as he does, you see what it's like for Manhattan to slowly lose his connection with humanity, you feel sorry for the Comedian in the end as he reveals why he is the way he is, and that's what the story's about. 

It tosses in these flaws, these completely despicable characters that do all these horrible things, including the 'villain' of the piece, and it makes you understand them, it makes you realize that, maybe they're not that different from you after all. And that's why I put villain in quotation marks, there is no direct villain of the story, Ozymandias does everything he does for the good of humanity, to stop nuclear war. If there is a villain in Watchmen, then that villain is ourselves.","1341103019"

However, you will get to a point of precision where the uncertainty of your equipment is comparable to your particle ie, very small.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You seem pretty aggravated with the statement, but it does seem that you do not quite know what the studies mean and show.  

But the majority of findings associated with marijuana use and mental illness, is that it does not cause it, but instead acts as a moderator for the relationship. If someone has a predisposition for a certain mental illness (such as schizophrenia), and they smoke marijuana, the chances for developing the disease increases, and often lowers the age of first symptoms. A lot of other factors increase the chances, such as the environment they are raised in, however, it seems as if marijuana use explains a good chunk of variance in the studies. Problem is that it is tough to infer causality in these studies, and it's difficult to study temporal precedence - are individuals with a predisposition more likely to smoke marijuana, or is the marijuana causing the disease.

Here's some studies for your interest, and may help you understand what correlations really are:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12111342

&gt;  Family history positive for psychosis was more frequent in consumers, especially when consumption started before onset of schizophrenia. Subjects whose onset of schizophrenia preceded the beginning of cannabis abuse had more positive symptoms than those who started abuse before the onset of schizophrenia.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19917142

&gt; The results indicate a strong association between use of cannabis and earlier age at first psychotic episode in male schizophrenia patients. Additional studies examining this possibly causal relationship are needed.


 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20370967

&gt; Cannabis use or a cannabis use disorder at a younger age in a group with an UHR for transition to psychosis is related to onset of high-risk symptoms for psychosis at a younger age.

the page I am seeing on itunes misses a logo for your company.

&gt;see the poet's vision through gorgeous high resolution imagery and wonderful typography

the things I can see in the itunes display are boring at best. 

Who is that poet? How does he look like? What kind of poetry? Where can I see examples? Why would I care? What is the story behind it. What is special about it? Where is the mini demo on youtube so I can get an impression of what is happening?

Just four pickups is ridiculous but speaks volumne about what is missing from the relase.

&gt;For the first time in an ebook

For somebody who writes blog posts and does reviews, this is the kind of text which makes me go *skip* right there.

Men's rights is **fucking absurd** and is more about validating hatred for women, invalidating a woman's experience with sexual assault and rape, getting karma for claiming to be a victim of evil women's agendas to ruin their lives and other cringe worthy things I've glanced at this past hour+. Men's rights isn't about anything on reddit expect vitriol and hate and posturing as male victims all over their front page today. 

&gt;I find the term karma-whoring to be related to someone who is needy for karma and attention from complete strangers

Seriously? Seriously? Women, many of them, enjoy sharing things with each other and posting images here is about SHARING or about showing off things we're proud of accomplishing regardless of if it's graduating top of our class or wearing a swim suit in an image on the internet. XX is a safe space where women CAN do this without being objectified or having our body dismantled by hordes of men. And so what if we/they/women/men or anyone wants a little attention or ""karma"" or what the fuck ever! It's fucking valid. You sound like a jealous little person whinging about karma or how ""oh me oh my, someone else is getting too much attention!"" 

Are you entitled to more attention than someone else? What do you think should be the basis for ""karma"" or popularity / attention anyhow? You sound like a right asshole complaining about karma-whoring or what someone else does in any space they inhabit. 

You're not a troll which is sad. It's sad because these are ""serious thoughts and serious posts"" you're making in XX about XXers who are sharing, posting images and talking -- in a way that makes you sound like a petty jealous asshole.

I can understand a lot of people thinking religion is by-definition-destructive, and I'd agree that pretty much anyone that tells you what to think may not be worse than Hitler, but they're certainly on their way. What I don't think is that the dogmatism of religion is the inexcisable essence of the thing.

De Boton has gone in with a hatchet, leaving great clumps of tumor in the lymph (faith as duty, truth as fixed), and placed a pig's heart at the center of it (Art is Awe is The Numinous \\{shallow shit right there}). He is presenting a still cancerous body, devoid of metaphysical lifeblood.

But I think we can still save the patient.

What if, once a week, people met up and shared their ideas about how to live. To make sure they lived that way, they kept a book, detailing what they thought was true, one that they would have to face if they did not live up to. Such are the weight of my ideals, that before them I am like a man unto God [this is the truth of religion].

What if, at each meeting, passages of the books of those assembled were read, with discussion afterward focused toward empathy, improvement and polite disagreement ('Why did you feel this?' 'what did you mean by__?' 'I'm sorry, but the fear of death cannot motivate all life'). 

The books might help them truly face up to their ideals- as books do for the religious- and to make them precise, tested in debate.

One might imagine a world where this 'Bookmaking' existed as a culture: where children were forced to learn from their parents' books, which they ceremonially burned on their sixteenth birthday (they would have to have compiled one of their own by their twenty-first): where marriage is marked by the ability to write in one another's books.

This is how we ought to behave:

2 Timothy 2:24-25  

&gt;*But a slave of the Lord ought not to quarrel, but to be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,* 

&gt;*in meekness teaching those who have opposed, if perhaps God may give them repentance for a full knowledge of the truth,*

My main problem with you is this: you cry about the problem, then you cry about every possible solution, insult everyone else, and fail to contribute any ideas of your own.

We could easily solve the inflation of medical costs by adopting a UK style NHS system where everyone pays 11% of their income to fund the basic human right of free and equal access to healthcare for all citizens (I'd gladly pay even more than that, the rate in the UK, for this system in America).  And you know what?  If the government is regulating the industry on a flat tax system, then they'll scale the medical field pay down proportionately.  All of this I already said, or at the very least alluded to.  But no, according to the guy who says ""herp derp I won't get sick so I shouldn't have to pay anything"" I'm too greedy for wanting universal, equal healthcare for all, funded by all, with proportional service payments for all.

Similar to Reddit, there should be a voting system to help determine relevant prior art. There are many amateurs out there and not everyone is going to submit sources that are helpful, so to help find the wheat in the tears, you should be able to emulate a reddit type system for the art submitted.

Additionally, there should be a way to make it accessible to individuals who have experience in the legal field. Badges or some sort of designation for those who have real legal training for this sort of thing. Determining and certifying if someone is actually a real legal practitioner  should be a priority in this sort of thing.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The main reason, and this is going to sound counter-intuitive, is Big Tobacco.

They had all neccesary production facilities and distro routes and advertising to manufacture pot, all that was needed was a little political arm wrestling.  Now however, the main problem is companies like InBev who have effectively choked off any talks pf legalization at the federal level.  

The canary in the coal mine for the alcoholic beverage co's was medical marijuania.  Profits in states with med marij laws have declined dramarically...and the reason should be fairly obvious...its alot cheaper, no hangover, etc.  So whats an average Joe to do?

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","The order of the attributes has no effect on how the page is rendered (unless the same key is duplicated, in which the last occurrence will overwrite previous occurrences). However, it is better to write css attributes in a consistent order for two reasons: because doing so makes compression algorithms like gzip more effective (= smaller files), and because it lets you read them faster once you get used to it.

Any approach that always has a consistent answer to which attribute comes first has the same benefits; probably the easiest is to order them alphabetically.

My habit is to order by my perception of importance - ie, ""float, display, position, width, height, margin, padding, background, border, font, color"", with other attributes fitting in where the feel intuitive, sides arranged like css does (top left corner going clockwise), and vendor prefixes arranged according to usage share (-webkit-, -moz-, -o-). This works for me because it feels intuitive, so I can read and write it faster than comparing positions in the alphabet, and it yields an equally consistent order. But I wouldn't recommend this approach for group projects, because you'll get inconsistent ordering when different people have different perceptions of importance. In that case it's probably best to use an alphabetical order. Either way, the important thing is that the order is consistent, not what the order is.","1341103136"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I don't think this has anything to do with culture but more with tradition. As tradition deals with beliefs, then what you're referring to is a Japanese tradition, not culture. Loyalty is not a culture, but a tradition.

Loyalty was great in the 60's - 80's when the economy was booming and the people's long hours were paying off. Families were rewarded with great prosperity. However, those long hours took a toll on Japanese families and created the present familial culture: wife stays home and focuses all her energy on the children while the husband puts all his energy into work to provide for them. You now have a group of amai people who no longer want to work full-time and a growing number who don't even want to get married. It's also created a rise in divorce amongst the retired generation as women who never saw their husbands are suddenly faced with having to spend an entire day with them. Japanese culture is changing, but the traditions aren't which is leading to problems.

Japanese business traditions have taken their toll on the country. Suicide rates have escalated as well as mental health and stress related diseases. Lifetime employment is no longer the norm, high salaries aren't the norm and companies are faced with trying compete against an increasing pool of global competition. Doing the same thing over and over expecting better results isn't tradition, it's insanity.

Japanese economy has been stagnant for almost 20 years and is quickly getting passed by China and possibly India. The population is aging faster than it is being replaced. The fact that they have [a clock](http://mega.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/Children/) that basically counts down the days until the culture because extinct would tell anyone that something has to change. Strenuous work circumstances may have helped the country for the first 20 - 30 years, but it no longer seems to be working for Japan. 

It has nothing to do with whether or not they're better off than China or the US, and everything to do with whether or not they are doing what it takes to adequately care for their own people. I love living in this country and it would be devastating to see it go the way of the US or Europe for the sheer fact that people in charge stubbornly cling to traditions that no longer serve their purpose and the rest of the population can do no more than say,""shoganai."" Cultural or not, something's got to give and maybe this case, however small, is the first step.","1341103141"

Take the train, then, once in the city, find the red light district. It is seriously cool. I have never seen anything remotely similar. Have sex with a guaranteed clean prostitute. If you are interested, also go see the lesser known blue light district. 
The coffeeshops are a must. I went to Barney's and Abraxas. Barney's SUCKED. We had just gotten off of the plane, so no lighter, and they charged us 3 euros for one. Anyway, we bought a gram for 16 bucks, then they had no pieces to smoke out of. Bring your own cheap dollar store type pipe if you cannot roll (like myself). Plus if you are mediocre, the europeans laugh at you. They never visited the table, not even once. Also, NO PICTURES ALLOWED. (Which you would think they would post somewhere considering the tourist traffic there.) We got yelled at by the owner.
Abraxas was AMAZING. I bought three pre rolled joints, and a hot chocolate (which I did not know had weed in it). I went upstairs and chilled for about an hour. Someone checked my table every fifteen minutes to see if I needed anything. Then on my way out I bought 2 space cakes and was on my way.
I did the canal tour, skip it. Boring as fuck. Hit up the Anne Frank house instead. Something I wish I would have done. 
Get a bike, and ride everywhere. Don't forget how cold it will be there. I was wearing shorts (on a trip from Florida to Kenya) and I froze my ass off at the beginning of May. It was 50F outside.

And Yeah, you see some begging on the street with signs bearing ""Vietnam Vet"" who are willing to tell their stories, or men in bars stoically recounting their military careers.

If I wanted to make a flavorful Doctor, I would have a +1 be: Search your library for target non-basic land, and target creature. Reveal them and put them into your hand. Shuffle. (some many people to see, places to go aspect)

-1: Target artifact loses all abilities and, if an artifact creature, cannot attack or block. (the sonic screwdriver)

-4: Take another turn. Exile ~. Search your library for 11 and put it into your hand. (time travel, and regeneration.)


The Jesus card was a joke entry (I'm Jewish), and a collab with a super-christian friend of mine. The idea is that Jesus, while wholly good is also wholly badass.

I think I can lower the cmc on Tranquility easily.
Just so you know, I have cards for each of the other characters, and a few of them interact with Tranquility (serenity) (Like Wash and Kaylee) (Kaylee even helps repair the failing Serenity)","1341110100"

The main focus behind punitive damages is that, not only did someone fuck up, but it was a fuck up that should NOT have happened, and if we don't make them pay some high sum, it will continue to happen because they are profiting off the activity (in some way/shape/form). By making them pay significantly more than the harm they caused, the belief is that it will change their behavior, as well as their competitors behavior.

That being said, the money has to go somewhere.

Of note, the amount of cases that involve punitive damages is truly microscopic (I believe its something like 1% of all cases that make it to trial, which is already a tiny fraction of cases actually filed)","1341110110"

TW: Rape

Rape: Through Accepting Sexist Cliches, Society is an Accomplice
Interview: The Feminist Collective Against Rape (CFCV) is launching a new poster campaign. Three images, for three situations where rape frequently occurs: at work, at home, and in night clubs. Commentary from Dr. Emmanuelle Piet, president of the CFCV.

""A woman doesn't dress sexy for nothing"", ""A woman who doesn't want to must clearly refuse"", ""A woman must always satisfy her husband"". This is what we read as halos circling the heads of three rapists, images designed for a poster campaign by the CFCV. Phrases often heard, meant to denounce the misogynistic cliches that blame the victim...and take blame away from the rapist. The CFCV has also put in place a green number (1) to collect the words of the victims.

According to Insee, over 75,000 women have filed charges for rape, but the collective estimates that this number could be doubled due numerous obstacles to filing charges which lessen the number. The Collective also estimates that more than one in six women has been a victim of a rape or attempted rape over the course of their lifetime. And for the collective, ""nothing should allow a rapist to go free"". Its president, gynecologist Dr. Emmaneulle Piet, answers our questions.

**Why this campaign now?**

For over six or seven years we have regularly launched campaigns. Today we are attacking sexist stereotypes like ""She was asking for it"", ""She didn't say no"", ""She was dressed to revealingly"" that penalize the victims. It's too much to manage. Some say that the victims are ""young, sexy, women who work the streets"", but there is no age, no socio-cultural milieu that prevents a woman from being raped. And society is implicitly complicit in this, when it permits the normalization of sexist cliches. With these posters we wanted to denounce this ""stamp of good conscience"" for the rapist that this sexism provokes: in reality, rapists know very well what they're doing.

We also wanted to combat the idea that a rape ""lasts three minutes and it's done"". No, it affects the woman's life in horrible ways. It can lead to severe depression, they may lose their job. We receive calls from 90 year old women who were raped at 15, and it affected their whole lives. It's not just three minutes. It affects women's lives in terrible ways. And that's enough.

**Your campaign focuses on daily situations: married life, life at work, and in a night club...**

In effect, it is very common for rape to occur during situations like these. Being raped by a stranger, remember, accounts for barely 15% of all cases of rape. Thirty percent involve a spouse or partner! And when they end up in front of the court, they see that it's their wife, so there is no rape. At work as well, a place where one is supposed to be safe, rape is not rare.

**Are you trying to change the mentality that allows rapists to feel innocent...**

Yes. Because society essentially says that, without necessarily realizing it. During the DSK affair, we heard the expressions ""just sex with a servant"", ""it's not the end of the world"". With the Polanski affair there was maximum tolerance, it was an outcry of clear consciences! And with the firefighter that was raped, there was talk of a conspiracy, that he was asking for it! It's all backwards.

We want to stop that. We have already participated in a campaign that said that ""The shame should switch sides"". Because of this shame, the victim often doesn't want to press charges. The victims' families must also change. Some parents yell at their daughters, think that since they came home late they were asking for it. It happens more often than you think, and it obviously doesn't help.

**Do the mentalities of women also have to change?**

We consistent have women call and start by saying ""You're going to tell me if it was rape or not"". They are paralyzed, they can't think straight anymore. A woman called the other day, she said that a colleague with whom she got along well passed by her office when all the other offices were empty and put himself behind her, transforming right away. She was so shocked she couldn't react.  She wasn't distrustful, and it happened suddenly. It's a total trap, even more so since immediately after the fact he started spreading rumors that was a wild woman.

We must not underestimate the state of shock, an immediate psychosomatic response. The victims blame themselves for how they reacted, they question it (""I yelled"", ""I didn't move"", ""I hit him twice and that's why he became violent""). But you never react to an attack the way you thought you would. It is important to consider this state of shock.

**You say too few victims dare to press charges. Is this linked to the fact that most rape occurs within close circles?**

It is also because they have begun the process of guilt. Rape is often accompanied by threats, ""if you talk I'll kill you"". The victims of rape feel like dying on the spot, they are terrorized, and these threats are intimidating. We would love for the protection, dating from July 2010, that concerns women who were beaten and those forced into marriage extend to rape as well. When your neighbor has raped you, when a young girl is raped during a university orientation weekend, she finds herself among her attackers in the same class, all year long.

We are fed up with the fact that rape is treated as a minor crime. And when we know that less than 2% of rapists are convicted, it's not surprising that their victims are afraid that the police won't believe them, that their complaint will be closed. Only 10% of victims of rape press charges. This is not acceptable.","1341110128"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I love this. A few of my thoughts after having a few of my own:

&gt;Things that don't wake a sleeping newborn: loud noises and bright lights. Things that do wake a sleeping newborn: sitting down to eat dinner.

This is so incredibly true. Also, sitting down to pee. It's okay to let them cry, though. But it will probably break your heart to hear (it's kind of supposed to)

&gt;You will discover that there must have been something very, very tricky about composing a melody for ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,"" The ABC's,"" and ""Baa Baa Black Sheep.""

I have taken to singing the three songs mixed up. ""A B C D E F G... How I wonder what you are...""

&gt;Make sure you learn all the noises that farm animals make. Even though most people no longer live on farms, the sounds that sheep, pigs and cows make are priority number one when teaching your little one to talk.

My 21 month old doesn't know many though we're trying so hard. However, she does know that a cat says ""MAO"" a lion says ""ROAR"" and a pirate says ""*holds one hand over eye* YARRR"" (does this surprise anyone?)

&gt;If she is wearing a nice outfit, it is likely that your baby will poop. If you are wearing a nice outfit, it is likely that your baby will poop.

But not *just* poop. Explosive poop. Explosive, escaping poop. That stinks and gets everywhere. Most poops aren't like this, but when you *don't* want it to be, it *will* be.

&gt;One of the surprise perks of having a baby? When you're with one, you can talk to yourself out loud and people don't look at you like you're crazy.

""We"" talk about supper, what ""we"" are buying, what ""we"" should buy special for daddy and the big kids. From the day they are born ""we"" have many conversations. This does not make you crazy... it's great for your baby to talk to them like an adult... it helps them learn!

&gt;Everyone tells you to ""sleep when the baby's sleeping."" It's good advice. But, remember, it's ""sleep when the baby's sleeping... unless the baby fell asleep in the car and you're driving.""

OMG I have never heard this but I am so using it from now on.

&gt;Don't beat yourself up over every little thing. Babies have really low expectations.

As long as they are fed and comfortable, they really don't care for the first few months. After that, it's fed, comfortable and entertained.

&gt;No matter how much you love your child, naptime is never long enough.

When you feel it's too long and you're freaking out about why baby is sleeping so long, you stupidly peek in on them. Instantly ending nap time. Then you realize it wasn't long enough.

&gt;The secret to being a good parent? There isn't one. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.

There really are no secrets. I mean... if you care about your kid, you're automatically going to do pretty darn good.","1341110163"

That's my gripe with Islam, and religion in general. I'm paraphrasing here, but there's something that many Muslims repeat, how Islam is perfect and it's meant to suit all generations. With the passage of time, mores are constantly changing. What was suitable during Muhammad's time (such as marriage to a 10 y/o girl), should not be suitable now. But in a proper Islamic court, how can a judge deny a marriage between a man in today's society and a girl of 10, when that man can use Muhammad as an example? But then again they can also argue that there certain exceptions to be made for Muhammad; such as his marriage to 9 women at one time, when the Muslim male is only allotted 4. ","1341110175"

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Hey, I really appreciate the feedback. I believe this is my fourth day doing just 5mg twice a day; I start 10mg twice a day tomorrow as my normal dosage (doctor wanted me to ramp up).

Today was interesting because I had kinda been avoiding caffeine because I was afraid of mixing it with the Adderral, but I ignored that today and had a cup of coffee in the morning and a couple Cokes around my second dose.

Not long after, I felt a weird ball-like thing move in the vein at the top of my right hand. I then worried I had a clot that was going to go to my brain and kill me and started really panicking; phantom chest pain and numbness.

After talking to my S.O. who has a bit of a medical background and told me Adderall can't cause clots and mixing that with caffeine probably heightened my anxiety, I settled a bit. But man that was scary.

I think I'll avoid caffeine for a while...

Haven't noticed a ""take over the world"" feeling yet. Maybe a tiny bit more focused... but I certainly don't feel life-changing yet. Maybe once I go up tomorrow.","1341110202"

This isn't always an option, in fact a lot of times it isn't an option they can even consider.

If I can't pay for food, how am I going to be able to afford to move to Arkansas (which under this scenario actively promotes welfare programs heavily)? I don't think that letting the states making decisions on life-saving policies. Especially since my state happens to have vested interests in corporations and not citizens.

One month of a drug means nothing. How many times a day are they taking it? How many pills are they taking per time they take it? You have to judge price based off of the quantity of pills. 

Also, some pharmacies have a ""discount program"" where you pay them a fee every month and you get money off of prescriptions. For some people, this works out great and they get loads of money off, for others it barely takes anything off of the price of the medication. ","1341110220"

I get your point now (thank you for clarifying, BTW!), but it isn't germane to mine. Few would argue that the Coreys would've risen to acting excellence, given the opportunities.

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","That is the thing - I do not see how that statement is diminishing the responsibility of the perpetrators. I do think there are a lot of problems with what the Constable said. I think the use of ""slut"" shows that the Constable personally looks down on women who dress provocatively. I think that the advice is faulty, in that it implies dressing in less revealing clothing would protect women from being raped. However, I do not see any shifting of blame. Nowhere in that statement did Sanguinetti attempt to forgive rapists at all or say rape victims share responsibility for the crime. The reporters who wrote that Sanguinetti was blaming the victim have deviated from the available facts. It is simply bad journalism, and should be called out as such.","1341110250"

"writingpromptoftheday","t5_2u8x8","One day I'll get the hang of endings, then i'll end the world.

Every cult is the same when you're an ancient ritual dagger. I mean really what else can a shaped chunk of obsidian be used for? So since the old days when some snake man shaped me for sacrificing some snake woman to Yig I've been being used for the same darn thing. First they find a dark room and light candles, I've been at this for thousands of years and never figured out why they can't use a nice airy room with some natural sunlight. I like to think the sunlight glinting off me would really strike some fear into the hearts of victims but I can't exactly tell anyone this. Then they always start chanting and whoever is holding me starts swaying around, I have no clue why horrible and unspeakable gods like chanting and swaying but I'm just a knife. The whole time some girl is tied down to some giant stone dais screaming, I'm about 90 percent sure that's what ancient and horrible gods like. I still haven't figured out why they always insist on using an attractive blond woman, I mean sometimes they'll change it up and use a man or even an animal. Truth be told the animals are my favorites, after getting stabbed through countless humans an auroch or even a stray dog is a nice change of pace. To be honest the stabbing is the fastest part, after what seems like hours of chanting in a room that's getting increasingly full of smoke (I have no clue how most of them don't suffocate) the stabbing just takes a second and then there's blood going everywhere. Sometimes there's grooves to catch it in for cultist reasons. I really don't know what they use it for after the sacrifice is done I normally go back into the sheath or box or hand of a giant evil statue. But sometimes I get lucky and someone breaks up the sacrifice. It's usually the cops these days and they just leave me in the bottom of an evidence locker until a court date then I get shown off as evidence then sold at auction and passed around until I get into the hands of yet another cult leader and the cycle begins anew. But in the old days sometimes I got lucky and some plucky hero would storm the sacrifice, fight the cultists, and save the world. Once in a blue moon the hero would also notice me and find out I make a splendid backup weapon. I like being a hero's weapon the best, I mean you wouldn't believe the things I got to cut through back then. But that was thousands of years ago. Now I just rot at the bottom of this locker telling my story to a gun forged out of a magic ring.","1341110265"

I may try and find a cheapish LoH 1h and see where that takes me.

As for your build, I feel like Nightstalker is a wasted passive. Your crit chance is so low and NS doesn't proc from AoE effects. Personally I swap the sentry out for cluster bomb and take Grenadier. With your setup, I think archery or cull of the weak would be a better alternative to make fights go quicker.

How does this build do with champ packs? My biggest problem with using sentry is that it was hard to stay inside the shield if I was facing a mob with AoE effects.","1341110305"

So I've tried contacting you once or twice, but odds are that you didn't see my reply or you didn't take it seriously.

It's one of my side-dreams (a better term is evading me) to get involved in e-sports somehow, and as a photographer I feel like I can help you both the cinematography/framing of your interviews and provide high quality pictures for your non-video ventures (blogs, extra Reddit karma, etc.).

I'm currently in Taiwan, but my attempts to do anything with the Garena IPL league were thwarted by my lack of understanding Chinese league terms (health pots are ""water""? wat).  I would cover my own travel costs to Korea as well as living, because I have to leave Taiwan for visa reasons anyways.

I know it's hard to believe/trust a random guy on the internet, but if you want to take the chance, I think I can make all of your ventures of even higher quality :)

Now to answer your question more directly. You are claiming that, regarding ethical issues, a scientist can maintain a belief regardless of their experience. Your example being ""killing is wrong"". Because their scientific problems lie with normative and repeatable questions like ""What is a particle's position as a function of time?"".

I agree a scientist is only expected to talk about their specialization, but I disagree with the view that ethical questions cannot be normative. More specifically it is possible to disagree with somebodies ethical perspective, and actually have a discussion.

In the previous story if an individual, scientist or otherwise, told one of the members of this culture that killing was wrong, and this citizen responded ""We tried letting them live, but more people died in the end!"" Assuming the individual is telling the truth, saying they are sinning, or committing a crime, doesn't solve their problem or change their experience. I feel a scientist should acknowledge this experience, and if they are willing to claim they're doing it wrong, should be able to suggest alternative plans of action, which would ideally have some empirical basis. 

I do feel scientists do not contribute enough in this regard, but will acknowledge that they don't have to.","1341110349"

The only real actions people take would be (excluding more serious matters like rape, a topic which I think should be saved for another conversation) an obnoxious whistle or 'hey pretty lady', but that's just the scum of the man bucket, the type of person that has nothing better to do than go around and be scheevy. The normal people are home, or at the park or eating a burger or in an office or school or something, not wandering the streets. Really, I'd think most of the pressure comes from advertisers and such, and the average person has no control over what they do. When you see a giant poster of some modle blowing a hotdog, that doesn't mean people support that bilboard. One person decided it was a good idea and now we're all forced to see it. When someone makes a movie advert with male strippers it's the same thing. When people go to see the movie or people start going to the hotdog stand it's different. That represents the general population. 

Sorry, I have difficulty staying on a topic, I'm really just ranting. New point: The reason most men watch porn (Has a lot to do with objectifying women and the Magic Mike topic) is

 A) masturbation is a good way to kill time and feels nice

B) they *have to* masturbate. It's a desire that builds up and never goes away. A primal urge. It's not like it's just for fun, there's a constant build up of chemicals in their head that make them mad and macho and insecure and stupid and all the things guys are and masturbation is a way of releasing those chemicals, for a while. There's an addiction to it that never goes away.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It was the culmination of a series of riskier and riskier adventures by me and a couple of friends, like rattlesnake rangling, repelling without a harness, and spelunking.  I am still stupid with a thirst for adrenaline but at that time I was younger and more stupid.

On this particular night we decided to explore Timpanogos cave.  They have tours during the summer, but we wanted the to the explore the parts beyond the metal pathway.  It was winter so the cave was closed for the season.  We packed a lock pick kit, pair of pliers and a screw driver and up the canyon to the trailhead, arriving there around midnight.  The hike is about 3.5 miles to the entrance of the cave.  On the way we encountered a tunnel with a locked gate and so we had to side climb the cliff around it, but this didn't deter us.  While there was no snow at the bottom of the trail by the time we made it to the cave it was about thigh deep.  

After about a half hour of working the lock we gave up in defeat.  There was a way to bypass the door via a ten foot drop in the ceiling of the room the door let to, but we could see another door beyond, and if the deadbolt required a key on both sides we would be stuck between locked doors since we didn't bring any rope climb back through the hole.  After wandering around a bit I found a service entrance which had the hinges on the outside of the door. I removed the pins to the hinges.  Right before I popped the door off I turned to my friends and asked if we should do it.  They consented with a doubtful yes, since that was why we came.  After I slid the door out we heard a beep...beep...beep...beep.  This soon became a WHAHOOO!...WHAHOOO!...WHAHOOO!.  Along with the noise it seemed like the entire mountain was lit up with red flashing lights.  I hastily stuck the door back in place and pounded the pins halfway in place then chased after my friends who had run away. 

Eventually we stopped and decided to come up with a plan.  Timpanogos cave is a national monument and we had just commited a felony breaking and entering.  We figued that either rangers would be coming up the trail or waiting at our car.  To avoid the first we elected to cross country it down the mountain instead of following the winding trail.  When the snow was about an inch deep and we were half running, half skiing down the slope I suddenly saw my two friends stopped as I flew by them and noticed that there wasn't any more ground.  It was somewhere around 3am so I couldn't see my landing.  It felt like I flew for a very long time, but I was surprisingly complacent about my impending death.  The words I mentioned earlier went through my head.  Finally I landed flat on my back on a shale slope.  Five feet to either side and I would have landed on boulders.  The wind was knocked out of me and I couldn't make a noise, so my friends assumed I was dead or dying.

After a while of trying to skirt around the cliff they finally saw me walking around at the bottom of it intact.  The rest of the way down we were very careful and when we finally made it to the car there was nobody to be seen.  I still expected during the week to get a call from a police officer with our license plate number but nothing happened.  After that we tempered the intensity of our adventures.","1341110398"

The VAT rate in the EU varies from between 15% and 27%, which is a 12% variance.  In the US, sales tax varies from 0% to 13%, so the variance is only slightly larger than the EU.

But more importantly, in the EU, VAT varies only by country (correct me if I'm wrong about that), whereas sales tax in the US is generally a combination of state and local taxes, so there are about as many different tax rates as there are *cities* in the US.

But in the end, I think this all comes down to tradition.  US culture is such that we tend to want to know exactly how much we're being taxed by the government.  This is made more obvious by having sales tax listed separately from prices.","1341110410"

On one occasion, my brother had me in an arm bar, and the only item I could reach on our kitchen counter to bash him with was a container of Nesquick. I grabbed it, and swung it directly at his head. The cover flew off, and my brother was coated in chocolate Nesquick powder.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;Wars are a form of large scale political violence.

And we are claiming that large scale violence (""political"" or not) *can be legitimate* under the circumstance of defense.  That is war.  Your doublespeak to hide the issue is not helping.

&gt;There's no such thing as a war of self-defense. Show me a war where not one civilian has ever suffered.

Irrelevant.  War can be in self-defense and still have civilians suffer.  Nor has war run by the state, and not voluntary organizations seeking *only* to protect their communities, been solely for defense. The blame for that lays at the feet of the aggressor for forcing a choice between hurting someone else and *extermination*.

&gt;It could be a bystander on my land and the bystander has no warning.

Then he is a victim because of the ones that brought violence to your land.  Further, precision weapons used in *defensive* action have virtually no chance of hurting such an innocent party.  Even better, guerrilla warfare will not hurt anyone that is not standing pretty much right next to the aggressive force.  (Human shields and voluntary assistance.)

&gt;But you aren't defending yourself. You're defending the guy next to you by shooting the guy next to the guy he's shooting at.

Right.  Because invading armies are only trying to kill that one guy, in the forward trench, third over from the left.  He dies, and they will go home.  You are devolving into the absurd.","1341110425"

I come to find out one of the days in which my father and I were working, he had killed someone with multiple stab wounds. He was in the coffee shop earlier that day - and according to the police he told them he had planned on killing us as well.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Slave/owner is a meh analogy specifically because the dog doesn't see it this way. Depending on how good you are with dogs a dog will see you as alpha, meaning you protect it and make sure it stays alive, or as a sub that it must protect and dominate.

The NAP applies to sentient animals which pretty much excludes anything that can't speak or understand a language (no dogs don't understand language but they do recognize consistent sounds).

A dog doesn't bite either because you are alpha or you don't piss it off if it thinks you are sub. Trust me get the dog equivalent of uppity with your dog, most people are actually sub to their dogs in a dog's mind, see if it doesn't growl/bark/scratch or otherwise try and put you in your place.

A domesticated animal can survive without a human, it might be harder but dogs and cats are especially capable of surviving on their own. That being said I'm not sure why a domesticated animal requiring humans to survive means we should boycott them.

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","This submission has been automatically removed by the AutoModerator Bot.

Listentothis follows [strict submission guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q0x6q/meta_the_listentothis_rule_review_a_restatement/) decided by the community. If you don't feel like reading this entire post, then take a look at the titles of the submissions in listentothis right now and ask yourself what you did differently.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] *anything*
* You *must* include the artist, the name of the track or album, and at least one genre tag.
* You *must* use a delimiter such as - or 'by' between the artist and the track name.
* There are no exceptions even if this is your own music or a friend's band.
* If this music is *NEW,* *LIVE,* or *RARE* please include those tags in your title.
* Try to use [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/), [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/), [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/), &amp; [Grooveshark.](http://listen.grooveshark.com/)
* Do not spam your music blog. Link *directly* to media. 
* Leave your opinions and links to your blog in the comments if you like.
* Gushing about the artist or begging for attention *WILL* get you downvoted.

Delete your submission and try again. If your new title matches the rules it will be auto-approved by this bot within ten minutes. If your title does follow these rules and this was still blocked, double check that you didn't make a self-post! This happens often particularly with new submitters. You can submit a link, or submit a text post (self post), but not both. If you saw this message in your inbox, then this is the mistake you made. Pay closer attention to the submission screen.

If that wasn't the problem, then there was a problem with the genre tags you used - either there weren't any, they were too vague, they appeared somewhere other than at the *end* of your submission title, or you used tags this bot doesn't recognize yet. Read on.

---

This bot will not honor these genre tags *on their own:*

* indie alternative remix mashup cover soundtrack score singer songwriter band

If your music is 'indie' then it is actually 'indie rock', 'indie pop', 'indie folk', or 'indie electronic.' Indie by itself tells us nothing useful about the sound. Tags like indie and alternative are ignored for vagueness and won't get a submission through on their own. Meaningful tags are *essential* for scrapers syndicating our content, and for priming the reddit search engine. 

The list of valid genre tags is below. Partial matches are allowed. For example, when you see 'rock' below, it will match post-rock, rockabilly, rock'n'roll, and progrock. We aren't checking to make sure your tags are correct. We're just checking to make sure that meaningful tags are present. If you can think of any tags that are not on the list below but should be, please message the moderators of this subreddit and they will have them added to the list.

The *NEW* *LIVE* *RARE* tags are not parsed by this bot. They are for the human moderators, to help new, live, and rare music survive in spite of the rules against popular music.

So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death. A slow death has something comforting about it. The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.","1341110485"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Coming back to this... I seem to have generated quite a controversy.

Physics and running are probably two of my areas of expertise, so I'm quite happy to revisit this. 

The argument that I am making can be understood in terms of collisions and momentum transfer. When running outside, the way you accelerate and move forwards is by pushing against the ground, which, by Newton's Third law, leads to the ground pushing against you, and propelling you forwards. What you are attempting to overcome in doing this is your own inertia, and in order to do that you want the greatest force possible.

On a treadmill, you are attempting to stay stationary, and the belt of the treadmill is trying to pull you backwards. The analogy to running on the ground is that you have to push off of the treadmill in the opposite direction in order to stay in the same position. So far so good.

For a perfect collision with a treadmill whose speed is totally unaffected by your footfall, these situations are completely identical.
For a treadmill without a motor, where the belts movement (like the ground's movement relative to you) is determined simply by how hard you push, they're totally identical. But a treadmill with a motor, I believe, can break the symmetry. 

If when I put my foot down, if the belt of the treadmill **does not** transfer all of it's momentum to my foot, then I'm not feeling the full speed of the treadmill. Now I can't nail down the cause of the failure of complete momentum transfer, though I postulated some degree of slipping. What is happening, is that because of the slipping, **I am effectively running slower than the treadmill belt is moving.**  

Now I can't guarantee that this slipping occurs. It feels like it occurs, but I haven't set up a treadmill and a fast motion camera to check. 

I will bring up another example though, which is perhaps more illustrative. Now, I actually ran track in college, and when you were nearing a stress injury they would have you run on an underwater treadmill. Now I don't think anyone would argue that running in chest high water on the ground is the same as running on an underwater treadmill. The air resistance point brought up by many other people is significantly amplified. The experience I had, is that I could run quite quickly on the underwater treadmill by using the water to float, and by minimizing the amount of time my feet spent on the treadmill. If you assume the treadmill has some maximum frictional coefficient, the greatest force it can exert on you is m*g*u_s, and the impulse you feel from each footfall is the time integral of this. Now, what you're working against on a treadmill is the treadmill attempting to change your momentum, and so by minimizing dt you effectively have to do less work. Before I set u_s to zero to get the same effect of minimizing impulse, but lim(dt-&gt;0) works as well.

Now, the more I've thought about this, the more I think it's possible that my argument reduces to the air resistance argument. If the air is also pushing you backwards, then floating above the treadmill will not allow you to maintain position in the same way, since you are experiencing significant forces while airborne. In order to overcome these forces, you will have to push off the treadmill harder (i.e. in the way you would have to push off the ground). I haven't tried setting up a large fan and an anemometer in front of a treadmill and seeing how it affects my stride. I'll give it a try and report back.

I think the change in medium is an illustrative example... I've enjoyed thinking through this. 

Tl;dr Underwater treadmill is definitely different than running in chest high water. Same must be true for treadmill in air.

More often than not you just don't create a piece of art without there being some sort of intentional meaning behind it. 

I feel like this is a big problem with the whole idea behind ""art gaming"", in that, everyone is so obsessed with the idea of creating some great piece of gaming art that they try to be as ambiguous as possible in some attempt to appear ""deep"". I think what gaming needs is developers who are unafraid to make an actual statement. If the creator of TBoI went out of his way to confirm that theory, then you could take this game and say, this is a solid piece of video game art and this is what it means. Instead you just have a game, without any sort of specific meaning, and I think that starts to strip it of its perceived artistic depth. ","1341110507"

Other little things that might improve the look are to use gradients instead of solid colors.  For instance, your menu bar looks to be solid black.  Twitter actually uses a black-to-gray gradient for their menu bar  and you might be surprised at how much difference that simple change can make.  Also, your headings (""Upcoming Quotes"" and ""Upcoming Authors"") could use a little more styling.   That's all I've got for now, but overall I think you are on the right track!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Last year, my sophomore year of college, I lived in a dorm room with 4 people, 2 bedrooms, and 1 bathroom. I chose my room early, and I didn't have any roommates in mind, so I simply chose the highest room of the building on the most secluded side. My logic was that because this was the best room for toking discreetly, some like-minded people would probably join me.

Two of my roommates that fall were freshmen. They also chose our room based on its ability to conceal smoking, and we ended up smoking a lot together (but never in our room; I'll get to that later).

The third roommate, the one sharing the bedroom with me (I'll call him Ethan), introduced himself to us with ""I'm a chill guy, not hard to get along with. I'm 23 and a 5th year junior.""

When I read that, I went back into the room selector (this was something new) and looked for somewhere else to live, but the building was already full, so I had to stick it out.

---

We moved in, and we introduced ourselves. They all had meal plans, and I didn't, so I asked them how much beer they planned to keep in the fridge. Ethan immediately replied:

**""You guys are all underage. I think it's wrong to drink underage, and if I see any of your booze in this room, I'll let the RA know. And you better not have anything else or I'll call the cops.""**

Warning sign number 4. I set out to find a new room again, and again without success. But I met some cool neighbors in the process, so fortunately I had a place to keep my beer and weed. Ethan, meanwhile, made friends with some like-minded neighbors (one of whom I'll call Ben).

With this, the year progressed. I partied as hard as I had planned to, but I kept it outside our room, never returning until I had sobered up. Meanwhile, Ethan brought his own friends to our room, and their parties left our place trashed.

One night towards the end of the fall, I came home from a party, still a bit buzzed. Ethan came up to me and asked ""LurkingGrue, have you been drinking?"" I replied by telling him that what I did outside was my own concern, and that there was nothing illegal anywhere in our room. And two weeks after this is where my story begins.

---

One peaceful, sunny Saturday afternoon, two weeks after Ethan had I was sitting in my room, playing Minecraft. The window was open, and the room was full of fresh air. My roommate got home from a tailgate -- the last football game of the season -- tossed his keys on his desk, and left.

A couple minutes later, I heard some voices talking in the living room. They weren't clear, but I definitely heard my name, so I stepped out.

There were four people in the living room: Ethan, Ben, and two campus cops -- the young woman who helped me file a report when my calculator was stolen (I'll call her Kallman), and a stocky man who was well known around campus for busting underage parties (Donaldson). They all turned to face me.

&gt; **Kallman:** LurkingGrue, your roommate here is telling me that you've been selling marijuana out of this room. What is going on here?

&gt; **Me:** I haven't been selling any drugs, officers. I haven't been smoking. I haven't even been drinking here.

&gt; **Donaldson:** Well, your roommate tells me he saw you make several deals this fall. Do you have anything in your room that you're trying to hide from us?

&gt; **Me:** I have nothing illegal.

&gt; **Ethan:** Bullshit, I saw you! You sold some weed to Steven!

Steven was a guy who had lived on my floor earlier that fall. About 1 month before, he was caught smoking and kicked out of the dorms.

&gt; **Kallman:** We caught that guy recently. Do you know him?

&gt; **Me:** Officer, I already told you, I have nothing illegal. Do I need to call my lawyer?

Donaldson was infuriated by this.

&gt; **Donaldson:** You can call your lawyer later. Now tell me, how much marijuana are you hiding in your room?

&gt; **Me:** None at all, officer.

&gt; **Kallman:** Let's get this over with. Do you mind if we take a look in your room?

&gt; **Me:** I have nothing to hide, but I don't consent to searches, and I need to see a search warrant before I can let you in.

&gt; **Kallman:** If you have nothing to hide, then why aren't you letting us in? We're just trying to make this quick.

&gt; **Me:** I can't let you in without a warrant.

&gt; **Donaldson:** Sorry, Ethan, he isn't letting us in, so we can't search his side, only yours. Call us again if he tries anything.

At this point, **Ben jumped up and went to my room in a hurry. He started pulling my drawers open and shuffling through their contents.**

&gt; **Me:** What are you doing, Ben? I never said you could go into my bedroom!

&gt; **Ben:** But you've got pot! It's got to be in here somewhere!

&gt; **Kallman:** He said you weren't allowed in his bedroom. Now get out.

&gt; **Ben:** It must be in here!

He had opened the top drawer of my desk, and at this point he opened the middle one.

&gt; **Kallman:** Get out or we're taking you to jail. You can be charged with burglary for this.

Ben stepped out.

&gt; **Kallman:** Ethan, you can't invite Ben in here anymore. LurkingGrue, if you see Ben in your room again, call us.

---

The following Monday, I went to the central dorm office. At this point, there were a few empty spaces in the building, but assignments were locked. Fortunately, I had gotten to know the building director by then, and she cleared me for an emergency room change. As I was packing up, I noticed, in the bottom drawer of my desk, a box of Ziploc bags, a pocket-sized scale, and about 1/2 oz. of low-grade weed.

The bags went into my new kitchen, the scale I gave to a friend who was into herbal medicines (but not weed), and the weed I used to make some brownies.

---

**TL;DR: A roommate and one of his friends put some weed, baggies, and a scale in my desk, then called the police and tried to get me charged with drug dealing.**

---

**Update:** Some people asked what became of Ethan and Ben. Ethan got what was coming, but unfortunately this is coupled with a sad story of how drugs ruined a great student.

The following spring, the dorm office did spring assignments to fill the empty spaces, and it turns out the guy who replaced me in Ethan's room was an actual drug dealer (I'll call him Tom). At the start of the spring, Tom was a good student -- he had made a 3.5 the previous fall and held a job on campus. As far as drugs went, he only smoked weed and took the occasional trip, and he sold both of these for extra income. Ethan couldn't do anything about it because the cops wouldn't believe him anymore after what happened with me.

Then, in mid-February, Tom decided to try benzodiazepines, and he asked if I wanted any. I declined and warned Tom that these were addictive and had brutal withdrawal symptoms (a pharmacy student I know told me this), but he decided to use them anyway on his own.

The next I heard of Tom was in late March. He was failing all of his classes because he wouldn't study anymore, and he had lost his job because he showed up to work on benzos.

In late April, Tom was arrested for robbing a pharmacy at gunpoint. He had already **sold Ethan's TV and stereo for more benzo money** and was desparate for more drugs. This time, the cops came to Tom and Ethan's room, and they had a search warrant. They found at least 3 different benzodiazepines, some mushrooms, LSD, DMT, a few grams of cocaine, and over a pound of weed. This was so much that **they closed the room down and brought in a hazmat team. For the rest of that spring, Ethan had no access to his belongings,** although they did assign him to an empty room in a freshman-only dorm.

---

**Update 2:** Some people are arguing about the applicability of my 4th Amendment rights in this situation.

First, refusing consent is never harmful, as long as one is not physically resisting. If the cops had the right to search, they'd just walk in and start looking around.

Second, dorm contracts vary. My school allowed RAs to enter and inspect the room, but not open or move anything. They could call the cops if they saw something illegal in plain sight (in fact, they were required to unless it was just booze). The contract did not include any implied consent clause or anything else to do with privacy.

Third, as far as the ""school owns it, so school can search it"", the policy follows that of any other rental agreement. A landlord can enter your apartment as the lease provides but cannot search your property within the apartment. And the landlord certainly cannot consent to a search of your apartment by police.

---

**Update 3:** Some people complained that this is hard to follow with letters instead of actual names. I replaced the letters with fake names. The letter I used previously is the first letter of each new name.

---

**Update 4:** Some people ask why Ethan did this. Unfortunately, I don't really know.

I made it clear at the beginning that we would have to openly discuss issues with each other when they came around. My other two roommates and I kept good communication, and we resolved our troubles as they emerged. But Ethan didn't talk to us at all and became very distant. Most likely he'd been holding something back, and late in the fall, he finally ~~snapped~~ decided to get rid of me in this way.","1341110530"

My mana regen meant its low mana cost didn't help me any. It's damage per second, while on paper is higher than Acid Rain, actually slowed down my killing and survivability because an Acid Cloud's Instant 100% damage was able to remove many mobs from the battlefield, reducing potential incoming damage. It also can't compete with the huge radius of Acid Rain's up front damage. You drop it on the screen anywhere and it'll hit something. Phantasm must be placed in a good spot each time. I was also unable to find great use of Phantasm's last and best feature - It's collision detection. I was testing in Act3 which I feel was gave the spell it's best chance to perform with all the small corridors. It definitely works as a door blocker but for the majority of the mobs, I simply didn't need to block doorways with it. Grasp and Wall were keeping the mobs in place. Even on champion mobs, it was either that I didn't need to use it as a pathing block, or that it wasn't good enough to make an annoying fight noticeable easier.

As I said, It may perform better for a lesser geared character. Especially one that can really use the door blocking aspect of the spell.","1341110534"

Now, true hermaphroditism I think is rarer but when you have something you are born with it's ""not rare to you.""

Even if we can usually tell what sex is dominant, it does lead to questions. If I had a son or daughter who was a perfect hermaphrodite I think I would after prayer and consideration raise him or her as one gender but be open to the possibility that I may be wrong and always make it clear that he or she can change genders if they choose. 

After all, I could be wrong in that situation. I'm very much a traditionalist when it comes to Christianity's teachings on sexuality but intersexed individuals create an ambiguity other situations, simply, don't. ","1341110538"

So one night he brings this guy back at 4AM on a Wednesday. They immediately wake me up being loud and on drugs, and went into his bed and started having sex. The bed is banging, they're moaning, etc. And I'm just curled up in the fetal position telling myself ""I'll fall back to sleep any moment now...""
SO my roommate ended up ontop of him and came on his face (and I know this because they felt the need to say what they were doing out loud). Once the deed was done, his friend started moaning ""aww yeah"" and then proceeded to SNORT my roommates cum up his nose.

If English isn't your interviewer's first language, speak slower than you normally would and make sure you enunciate all your words clearly. You should probably do this regardless because the connection might cut in and out and speaking clearly/slowly will help the other person follow you better.

They're really just like any other interview, except that it's over the computer. It's probably going to feel a little awkward. Make sure you try and stare at your webcam the whole time. With my first Skype interview, I kept averting my eyes and fidgeting and focusing on something to the left of my computer, which I'm sure made me look like a lunatic. Just treat it like any other interview.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;Thanks! Here's a follow-up question: why is Social Security so expensive to the federal gov't?

It's expensive because it's a social program affecting a huge chunk of the nation's population.  It's not cheap to help supplement retirement for so many millions of people.

&gt; I was under the impression that it essentially worked like insurance that you pay into with every paycheck. Is it the fact that that money is set aside and not being used as capital that makes it costly? Thanks again!

It's not insurance.  It's not set aside in a bank account.  It's a different kind of fund.

A portion of your paycheck is set aside to pay for Social Security (it was 6.2%, but Obama's tax cut made it 4.2%).  Up until the last few years, this money was then all used to fund existing checks to those on on Social Security.  All leftover money was used to buy up US bonds.  These US bonds basically say ""X years from now, give the US government this bond back, and they'll pay you even more money than you gave the US government"".  

You know how you hear about the phrase ""interest on the debt""?  Well a huge chunk of that interest on the debt is paid directly to Social Security.  This means that for decades, Social Security subsidized US yearly deficits.  All extra money that Social Security got paid went and covered some US debt spending.  This was actually a very smart move.  It gives Social Security trillions of dollars of extra interest money to help fund it for a few more decades.  

With Obama's Social Security tax cut, SS is now no longer able to feed money into US bonds like it used to.  It's starting to instead do the reverse, use those US bonds to help fund the missing money it needs to write out monthly checks.  

Also, I included Social Security in the overall budget because of all this.  Social Security's surplus in the past made our budget deficit seem smaller than it was.  Because Social Security money was being used to plug deficits via US bonds.  Now that Social Security can't run surpluses, our deficit now is bigger.  This is just one of a handful of big factors that's contributing to our big deficits.","1341110623"

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","My fourth review THREAD that is, have a done a few community reviews that I don't count. Was planning on reviewing the Aberlour 12 DBL Cask but I had a long rough day at work so I needed a smokey friend. Week before the fourth of July at the liquor store is ridiculous, another 10hr stocking day, phew. Dropped 12 gallons of Carlo Rossi Chianti on my feet in the first half of the day so I needed to do relieve some stress and some Islay is my prescription!
 
 
 
First Islay I had was Ardbeg 10 and it blew my mind. Had the Laphroaig 10 at a bar and I lost my shit again. I bought a bottle of Triple Wood when we got a small supply for about $10 more than the 10. Since then I have also gotten a cask strength 10 that is yet to be open for the same price as this.
 
 
**LAPHROAIG TRIPLE WOOD, 48%, Sherry,Bourbon, &amp; Quarter Cask, Around $60, 60% of the bottle gone**
 
 
**Ambience**
80 degree room watching Final Destination 5 (classy) with a Steel Head Double IPA and water as my helpers after eating two Jimmy Johns subs.
 
 
**Color**
3/5 Amber
 
 
**Nose**
Sweet oak with a hint of the sherry cask making an appearance. Not as full as the 10 to me but there's a lot going on here. Much ""sharper"" than the 10, no age statement so guessing its younger from them using a quarter cask.
 
 **Taste** Very present oily texture. Numbing sugar that reminds me of Talisker 10 but with a unique bite. Peat sits shotgun as the wood starts this out, just a lot going on. I use this as my excuse to drink a lot of it, have enjoyed it a few times by the fire this summer.
 
 
**After Taste**Smoke slowly waves goodbye, would love an older expression of this but this is still way above average. Leaves you with a reminder that lingers reminiscent of Lagavulin 16. 
 
 
**90/100**
 
 
Initially I was let down with this dram but it has grown on me. There is just so many levels working for it, makes me 2nd guess myself a lot. I would not buy this again but would gladly welcome it as a present. ","1341110623"

Don't worry about sexual labels, sexuality is a hard thing to label. I say I'm gay, but does that tell you that I'm sexually attracted to furry art? Or that I like light bondage? No, because simple vague labels cannot describe one's sexuality. If you're straight when it comes to humans, but bi when it comes to anthropomorphic animals, then whatever. If a non-fur asks, say you're straight. If a fellow fur asks, explain how you're only bi when it comes to furry. It's no big deal and nothing to worry about. ","1341110632"

I don't disagree that at the time Steve was pissed off at Adobe. But that wasn't the reason Apple didn't support flash. There technical reasons for that.  

The anger was based on Adobes reaction to not having flash on the iphone- they started a stupid marketing campaign based on false premises.

Let me make it simple ==&gt; Before the industrial revolution, societies had a very simple policy: **puberty=maturity=marriage**. In those pre-industrial societies, when you reached puberty, you were considered an adult. When, 'Ayesha's marriage was consummated, she had reached puberty, and was thus considered an adult. 

**No one had a problem with this. Not her parents, not his enemies, not the pagans nor the Romans or Persians. Not the Jews or Christians.** Know why? Because it was the norm. 

Take a look at Western history of marriage around the time of Muhammad pbuh and long after his death:

* ""...In 1889, a girl could legally consent to sex at 10, 11, or 12 in half the states, and in Delaware the age of consent was 7...."" ~New York Times, Feb. 18, 2006
* Until 1753 In England and Wales,  people could be married as early as 7 years of age. Until the Marriage Act 1753, also called Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act, that increased it to  changed the age to 12 for female and 14 for male. (citation 26 Geo. II. c. 33)
* Princess Margaret-Maria (d. 1673) of Hungary who married at age 9, 
* King Edward V's son (d. 1483) betrothed Francis II's daughter, Anne, age 4. 
* King Haakon VI (d. 1380) of Norway married a Queen Margaret who was age 10, 
* King Richard II (d.1377) who married French princess Isabella, age of 6, 
* Stefan Uros II (d. 1321), King of Serbia, married Simonida, the daughter of Emperor Andronikos II, age 5, 
* Romanos II (d. 963) married a princess from Italy, age 4, 

p.s. Royal marriages were all conducted with Papal consent.","1341110656"

Basically, you send a very, very short pulse down the cable (a couple ns or less) and count the time till you get a reflection of the signal back. Knowing the velocity factor of the cable you can calculate the distance to the disruption.

With very long cables dispersion might broaden the pulse and make this harder. [edit] It looks like this *is* used for undersea cables too, http://gizmodo.com/353230/how-to-fix-a-mysteriously-ruptured-undersea-cable","1341110681"

I could sell grown birds, chicks or hatching eggs. I could also sell eating eggs pretty easily, but the hassle to sell dressed out birds for consumption is too much to justify at my level.

2) Again, helmets should do more than supply air- they also protect the noggin from a floggin'. Slip and fall with the helmet on against rock? Probably going to be shaken but fine. Slip and fall with the helmet off? Alien bait.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I mostly agree with your assessments. 

Regarding Schweinsteiger, I don't actually blame him for his performance -- he just didn't seem a 100% fit. It was Löw's job to realise this, and replace him adequately. A similar issue with Rooney in the English team -- it's the manager's, not the player's fault if they have to play not being fully fit.

Regarding Özil, I think it's unfair to compare him to Messi. First, it's unfair to compare anybody to Messi, and second, Özil plays a very different role to Messi. Özil is a creator and passer, but not somebody who shoots the goals himself. He's more comparable to, say, Pirlo, and found him convincing in that role.

Regarding Podolski, I agree that he wasn't that good. On the other hand, a good left winger always seems to have been a vexing problem for Germany. The truth is that Podolski is mostly on the team not because he is extremely good, but because there is/has been little competition for his position.

Regarding Gomez, I also agree. He is clearly the best striker Germany will have after Klose retires, and it would be madness not to take him onto the team. I have a feeling that much of the future performance of the German team will depend on how well Gomez is integrated. In the Italy game, he felt like deadweight; in the Portugal and Holland games, this was sometimes the case, but sometimes he felt like the threatening focus of our entire attack. ","1341110708"

It's possible that some form of life could exist (though how, I can't fathom).  Hume talked about billiard balls passing through each other, or things falling up instead of down.  If that kind of thing is uncertain, I doubt there would be much of a universe at all.

So, for those reasons, I don't consider it ""controversial"".  The consistency is a) essential to the way we view the world, and b) while inconclusively established, established to the point that (even as Hume acknowledged) it's unreasonable to doubt it.

In fact, in my opinion, the existence of a god makes the universe less consistent than without one.  The idea of some self-willed agency that can alter the nature of existence is not, in my opinion, a comforting thought.","1341110712"

So... if we find a house in the next 2 months we need to go with FHA.

Going for a walk on shrooms is fun, but things can turn pear shaped pretty quickly, so make sure you have a comfortable house to retreat to. In all honesty, my favorite shroom trips have been with a bunch of friends just chillin out in a room listening to music and watching Trippy movies.

The keyboard and mouse ARE useable, but I recommend a gamepad if possible.

Felghana is short, depending on how you play (around 15 hours); Origin, with its 3 paths, has about 30-35 hours of play. I'm not including Boss Rush or higher difficulty play-through in this number.

"batman","t5_2qqt8","Don't know why you're being downvoted, but you aren't wrong. I think the difference with Marvel and these Nolan Batman's are incredibly vast, despite the source material being so close. They're trying to accomplish completely different things, and because of that Marvel has more of a license to goof off and do fun things like that. 

These Batman movies are taken much more seriously (not to say they're better) and I think viewers expect the movie to ""act accordingly"". They've set a certain precedent and it would be silly to break it now just so we can get some tongue-in-cheek line so that some people can be satisfied for a useless nod. These are proud movies in a sense, and I think it's great they don't settle for compromise like that. This is why he won't mention Joker in TDKR, and it's a completely classy respectable move. Yes TDK happened, it was great, and Ledger was fantastic, but let's not get so sidetracked by TDK, that this new movie that has the potential to have a great stamp on the series, the character, and film making in general has to forever live in the last movie's shadow. 

I may lose some supporters here, but I believe that TDKR can easily be just as good as TDK. Yes TDK was great, but it is only just a movie, and having a third movie to wrap things up gives an impressive amount of area to speak to characters we know and love, and have us learn much more about them.

The same teacher would also go over math homework by having us ""play basketball"". He had a small hoop in the room and he'd go around the room to each student for each question. If the student got the right answer, they could take a shot. One kid was chosen by random for the class to play against, and that kid would shoot every time someone got the answer wrong, if the kid got the highest score, they'd get a homework pass, but if the class won, we'd get extra free time.

It can get a bit overwhelming at first because there is a lot to take in, both in terms of actual knowledge of chemistry as well as day to day running of the labs - looking after stills, running the rotevaps, not annoying people by running 13C NMRs during the day etc. 

If you're looking for reading material I picked up a new copy of Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Reaction Mechanisms by Jack Jie Li for about 20 AUD. It has every named organic reaction in there, with mechanisms, usually a total synthesis and about 10 + papers as references. It's uh-mazing.

It completely changed my mind on fighters. They're as cerebral as RTS condensed into a minute instead of 15.

I didn't stop there. No sir, I've been immensely bored. So I decided to head out into the world and try to join a corp, and maybe convince them to do something silly like mine Crokite in Tama or Amamake. (Yes, I know there's no Crokite there - that's the point.)

Trying to join these hisec corps was an interesting experience, [to say the least.](http://i.imgur.com/2uAEa.jpg)

I finally joined one of those silly hisec mining corps, and I got an idea. A very delicious idea. One of the noobs was bragging about his 10mil/hr ice mining operation in Kamio. I decided to head out there in my ship and pay them a visit. I saw an Orca/Mackinaw combination, so I set up 2 warp scramblers and locked them down, and began to fire - gently - upon the Mackinaw.

*DON'T MOVE - this is a ransom. Do not engage your engines or you'll be destroyed. REPEAT: if you attempt to pull away I will destroy you!*

*I want 150mil for the Mack and 500mil for the Orca. Pay up or pop!*

*Remain stationary - DO NOT MOVE. Remain calm - NO HEROES. I am counting to 30. Whoever doesn't pay by then gets popped. Repeat: PAY UP, OR DIE.*

Unfortuantely, the [Mackinaw pilot was a bit too slow to realize what was happening](http://i.imgur.com/AuTMc.jpg), and went POP at around the 18 count mark. The Orca, surprisingly, begged for his life, and said he would send me all he had, but he was poor. I admit, I panicked a bit. I was nervous, having never done this ""live"" before. I asked for 350. He sent it. I decided it wasn't enough, and began firing again. I wanted another 150. He sent it. I dropped my scram... he began to align to station... I decided to blow him up after all. But, he was already in warp, and made it out with 1% structure. Sad days. Corp chat was uneventful for a ""help im been attackd"".

I decided after making 500 mil off that guy that this could be a way of life. Unfortunately, I was a bit to gung ho about the whole thing, and not quite as patient and crafty as I should have been. When you've been in a few corps for only a few days/hours, people get suspicious. Oh, but there's no limit to hydrogen, nor stupidity, in the Universe, and I found another mark who quickly accepted me in. I told them I was a Hulk pilot.

Well they had a mining op up, but their Orca pilot wasn't on yet. They were bragging some crap about how their logistics drones made them invincible from ganks, or something. I fit 3 warp scramblers and waited in a safe spot 500,000 km off the belt. When Mr. Orca was online and in the belt, I asked for a fleet invite... and once I was fleeted, I warped straight to the Orca at 0. Scrams on 2 Hulks and the Orca before anyone realized I wasn't in a mining ship.

*DON'T MOVE - this is a ransom. Do not engage your engines or you'll be destroyed. REPEAT: if you attempt to pull away I will destroy you!*

*I want 150mil per Hulk and 500mil for the Orca. Pay up or pop!*

*Remain stationary - DO NOT MOVE. Remain calm - NO HEROES. I am counting to 30. Whoever doesn't pay by then gets popped. Repeat: PAY UP, OR DIE.*

But instead of paying, they asked ""is he f-cking serious?"" and began to try burning out of scram range.

You're f-cking kidding me, right?

These guys were a bit smarter than the previous marks - but not by much- and set drones on me. Unfortunately their T1 Hobgoblinsdidn't save them, and the [first Hulk](http://i.imgur.com/vOcYm.png) went pop before even getting 4km away. That small shield booster sure came in handy, didn't it folks? The [pod](http://i.imgur.com/ThGC4.png) followed shortly after - because losing pods in hisec is pro.

The [second Hulk](http://i.imgur.com/lL41Q.png) did some fighter pilot sh-t and ejected. Unfortunately he we warped before I could get a scram on him. While I was busy killing the Orca, I didn't notice a Pilgrim warp in (how do noobs come to fly this shit without even learning about API keys?). I died shortly after. Corp chat was full of lols:

[We can't afford new ships!](http://i.imgur.com/WHLw2.jpg)

[Don't worry - you can make that ISK back in no time!](http://i.imgur.com/Nixbe.jpg)

Today was slim pickings. Corps catch on pretty quick, and butthurt self-entitled noobs try to ""get revenge"" by blowing the whistle whenever I joined a new corp, which cost me a Harbinger today. It was expected. But unlike some fools, I fly what I can afford to lose.

All in all, with the ransom and all the killmails tallied properly, that's 6 billion ISK removed from the hands of total f-cking noobynoobs in less than 36 hours. And it all could have been avoided by practicing the most rudimentary of safety measures:

1) Do not go AFK in expensive ships at a POS.

2) If you really really must go AFK in expensive ships at a POS, orbit the tower.

3) Stacks of BPOs have no business in a ship that aligns as slow as an Orca. They should be in station, transproted in a cloaky, in research, or in production. Period.

4) If the system you're in has a friendly outpost, put your expensive T2 ships in your hangar - not in your big blingy AFK Orca at a POS.

5) Don't recruit ""TEST pilots"". Norly.

6) Check killboards before recruiting people. Norly.

7) L2API.

Your language only discredits yourself. Besides, Voltaire is one of my favorite philosophers; contrary opinions rarely offend me. But, I am not ""mentally disabled"" or illiterate, I'm replying to you from my inbox, not the thread. I'm replying based solely on what you've said to ME, not anyone else. If you haven't made your stance clear, that's not my fault. 

But! I'm glad to hear that you have a very reasonable stance on economics. Tax loopholes that allow for the rich to avoid paying nearly as much as middle class members are certainly unethical and should be closed. I disagree that we should make things ""Fair"", or that by taxing the rich more we would be helping the economy, but at least you're right in that it would help chisel away at the debt at least a bit. Best way to do that, though, would be to limit spending. 

Anyways, I did not say that I'm republican. I refuse to align myself with a party that is so blatantly illogical (their foreign policies are just... astounding). So when you're becoming frustrated that others are putting words in your mouth, remember not to do the same.","1341110814"

1.Magic Kingdom - To me Magic Kingdom is the perfect park.. rides,shows and the atmosphere to me is amazing. I really could not think of a better themed place. Just walking around makes me happy.

2. Hollywood Studios- While I do agree with some people that the park is lacking a few rides.. I still really like the ones that are currently there. TOT, RNR, And Toy Story Mania are really great rides and the shows are very fun to watch.. I however do not like the great movie ride because I am too young to have seen the movies and do not care to see them.

3. Epcot. I would rank this as #2 but to me there are no real ""rides"" at Epcot. Soarin' and Test Track along with the few others in Future World are the only real rides there. I think many people like to drink around the world in all the countries but since I am underage walking through the countries means nothing to me besides shops and restaurants. 

4. Animal Kingdom - Besides Everest, Dinosaur, Kali, and Kilimanjaro nothing really stands out. I am not much of an animal person so this park doesn't really appeal to me. I can be done in less than half a day and feel as if the park is small (even though its not). I don't really like the theme and it always seems too hot there. I probably won't visit AK again until AVATAR land is open.

* It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.

* If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer.

* If your contribution to Reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer.

* If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.

* If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. But we're serious about the ""not people you asked to go vote for you"" part.

* If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens.

If you'd like access to the google docs let me know in PM form and you're more than welcome to complete or expand upon both studies.

The TL repost shows only the first study.  The second assertion was more solidified math-wise, and even more ""inflammatory"" to the TL LoL people.  You're welcome to both datasets.

I began the study as an experiment to just how snowbally and predetermined LoL as an observer sport is at the highest levels.  No effort has been made to study lower level games (and that's impossible without replays... thanks Riot).  

The incredibly time consuming process of collecting information was cancelled due to personal reasons.  You're welcome to read more about them on TL.

I've played 4 Leaks in the deck, I really didn't like it. It's not the right deck for 4 Leaks. You want to be aggressive and you want to tap out a lot on your turn to be playing cards. The initial list at Honolulu had two, and they later ended up cutting one. Believe me, I was thinking at first ""why aren't there leaks"", but it's really not worth a spot in the deck.

"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","However, the ultimate question is about maximizing utility. Since the Green Revolution capacity for food production has not been the operating factor in quality of life. Instead you have wealth and power gradients that allow and encourage the manipulation of food supply as a tool for further consolidation of influence and power.

Even if building irrigation networks strictly increased the quantity of arable land, it would be unlikely to decrease suffering. Arable land is still part of nature and yields will still be volatile. You could increase the carrying capacity of a large plain, but as population booms from bumper crops, a 5% decrease in a bad year entails a larger number of people starving.

If you want to have fewer children dying of starvation, you could increase the cost of clothing so the controlling factor is how many children parents can afford to clothe. Or, as in developed countries, make education rather than labor an expected part of childhood. The conditions necessary for that to work though are of course the ability to manage fertility, and assurances that children aren't likely to die by vaccinating them, protecting them from malaria, and giving them access to water that won't kill them.

tl;dr Capacity of food production increases population; factors that facilitate and encourage the development of human capital increase quality of life. OP may have asked about arable land specifically, but I highly suspect it was for the purpose for making people's lives better.","1341110829"

I find both parker and essien wonderful in the CM position, but sometimes Mikel (from Chelsea) is as good.

Personally, i would replace Luiz (he is to aggressive, and easy to get past IMO), with someone such as Terry/Ferdinand or someone 'beast.

How do you find Taiwo? In game etc..

Also what about a fast pace winger? on the right inside of Nasri (use him as a power-sub in main games), someone like Valencia, Nani, Walcott? (or reverse with the subbing) 

Because i use baines/Evra and they both work wonderfully in the position. ","1341110847"

"autism","t5_2qhs6","I feel for you.  Just know that you are not alone.  It may not make you feel better, but at least you aren't alone.  Hopefully some of the stuff I learned can make your life a little easier in the meantime.

My son at 3 years old broke windows, doors off of their hinges, climbed on everything, destroyed everything else, etc...  He is 6 now and currently drawing in his sketch book after returning from a 3 mile walk with his dad.  Have you tried taking him out hiking?  Or get him an exercise trampoline for his room?  Try to exert some of that extra energy so he's more physically tired for bed.  If he has his own room, there are childproof doorknobs that you can invest in so he can't let himself out.  you may need to replace the ones there now, but it's easy enough to do.  This should keep him safe and give you some extra shuteye.

Melatonin has been a lifesaver, but for us it requires regular breaks in usage to remain effective.  So, for everyone's sanity we try to schedule these breaks during school breaks.  Otherwise, it would probably be 6-8 weeks on; 1 week off.  During the week he doesn't have
his melatonin he's still up til 2am, falls asleep and wakes up ready for the day at 5... but while he's on the melatonin we can expect him to sleep from 8ish-6ish if he's given his pill before 7:30pm.

As for hiding toys/treats etc... consider a lock box.  Or a suitcase.  Something sturdy that you can lock with a key or combination.  My son could climb to the top of the refrigerator at 3.  We have found it much easier to keep things out of reach by putting them in a locked trunk we found at the goodwill.  He can bang on it all he likes but its too heavy for him to pick up and toss around even at 6.

Meltdowns happen.  If you haven't yet, look into making a visual schedule/choice board.  Show him that it's time to clean up toys and that after toys are cleaned up he gets a treat.  Make sure to follow through.  It's bribery at first, but when he learns the routine and tantrums less, you require more work from him to get the reward and are eventually able to phase out the reward for simple praise.  Sort of like rewarding potty training.

Similar approach to getting him to eat better.  If my son knows he can hold out and get candy, he will do that.  If candy is not around, it's simply not an option.  So don't buy anything you don't want him to eat.  Period.  Surround him with healthy options that he CAN eat and eventually he will.  We went months with no treats in the house to make him try new foods.  Fruits became the new candy.  I would suggest starting out by getting fruit leather to make the transition easier:  http://www.amazon.com/Stretch-Island-Original-Strawberry-0-5-Ounce/dp/B000HG84EQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341103652&amp;sr=1-1    They are quite flavorful while still being fruit, so it should make him more open minded to trying fruit in other forms.  Today my son prefers grapes to skittles; though he is allowed either one as a treat.  Fruits should also help a bit with the constipation problem naturally.

Destroying things; I am going to assume he is a thrower.  He needs to know there is nothing wrong with throwing, but it needs to be done at the right time and place.  A basketball hoop outside helps my son with that.  We also have bean bags and foam balls that he is allowed to throw in the house.  But that's it.  Replace what he can't do with things he can do and you should have fewer melt downs.

As for the DS, don't kick yourself.  You need respite and you deserve it.  A couple hours of DS is worth some sanity.  It is not going to hurt you or him to let him play with it every so often.  My kids are now both currently playing with the ipad at my feet while I type this (part of why it's taking so long since I have been interrupted a few times in writing this to help them find words ;)  

It sounds like a lot of his frustration comes from boredom, yet I assume he is overstimulated by or simply uninterested in new activities.  Are there specific DS games he likes?  Is he open to trying new DS games?  If so, try to find one with a recognizable character, say Mario, and find other types on media that Mario is in.  Maybe listen to an orchestral version of a Mario Brothers soundtrack that he would recognize the melody of.  Build off of what he does like to find other familiar yet new things that he will also like :) 

Also, if you haven't started already:  start taking notes.  Make sure to have a papertrail of what he likes, what he doesn't like, what frustrates him, what calms him, which doctors you talked to on what dates, etc... if you have the mindset to keep a journal all the better; but if not at least have a good folder of all the medical and educational info you recieve.

Sorry if this is a wall of text, I've just been there and remember that if anyone could have told me any of this I would have been extremely grateful.  It does get better.  You just have to take it one step at a time to better position him (and yourself) to get there.

39 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”

40 But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”

42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.[a]”

"autism","t5_2qhs6","We tried a stimulant before clonodine and it acted like stimulant with him.  Not fun at all.  They have him on Tenex during the day (forgot to mention that) and that seems to help a bit.

He's getting speech and occupational therapy at summer school.  TouchPoint, which a service for autistic kids in this area, is supposed to help us get him set up for OT and such at home as the psychologist recommended at least 20 to 30 hours of therapy each week.  I'll look into ABA.

Fiber gummies won't work.  He has some sort of sensory issue against gummy foods.  He likes crunchy things so we get him to eat some high fiber granola bars when we can.  We can get him to take flintstone type vitamins regularly at least.  Most of his food issues seem to have as much to do with the tactile sensitivity of his mouth as his sense of taste.  Before the DS thing we had finally gotten him to (grudgingly) let us brush his teeth.

He likes music and all things that make noise.  He sings along with his shows.  One of the battles over the DS is convincing him to turn the volume down during the night.

He climbs over baby gates like they aren't even there.  The saving grace is that he can't quite unlock doors yet.

Finding someone to take care of him for us to have a little time for ourselves is pretty difficult sometimes.  Back when my wife was by herself she was lucky to have a social worker friend to take of him when she had to go to work.  The friend had to move away for job related reasons and none of the daycares in the area have the required training (he was kicked out of two daycares before we found out what was going on).  My parents have volunteered to get the training and watch him when they can so things will hopefully get better on that end soon.

I know it'll get better but thanks for reminding me.  I'm not giving up.  I love him to death even if he does give me a full body ache most days.

The literalism is especially cute.  One of the conversations we've had:

Him:  Look!  *shows me his new Cars 2 DS game*  VROOM!

Me:  Awesome!  Is that a cool game?

Him:  No, it's Cars 2!","1341110886"

    #define MACRO() if (something) dothis();
    if (somethingelse)
        MACRO();

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My roommate and I (we were randomly placed together because we were both freshman) got along great for the first half of the year.  Then, one day I got back to the room (at 8am mind you- I had practice that morning at 6) and I walk in on her fucking some guy on my rug.  She was one of those ""I'm an innocent Christian and would never have sex"" types, so the fact that I knew this about her made her kind of go crazy (none of her friends new that she had even had sex yet).  I didn't care though- its her lifestyle and I told her that I didn't care what she did as long as I didn't have to be there when she did it.  She started hating me, wouldn't clean up the semen from the rug, and started hiding her used condoms in my desk/bookshelf.

She stopped cleaning the room, stopped taking out her trash (we each had our own trash cans), would stay up late watching movies while eating tubs of ice cream, and kept spraying her perfume (which I was allergic to) everywhere.

On the day that she moved out, I was really mad that I had to take out her fucking trash because she just took everything and left the trash bag on MY FUCKING DESK.

Actually it really is a capricious choice because if you want to go strictly by the bible, masturbation is murder as well. Onan was killed for pulling out and wasting his seed. Shall we punish those who masturbate next? You are entitled to your beliefs, but when you live in a society, you follow the laws of that society. Religious groups who do not feel that they can withdraw into their own communities as the Amish and the Mormons have done. But you cannot have it both ways, and you certainly cannot ever abuse the power entrusted in your by society to force a minority belief on others. If giving her a pill is an issue for him, he needs to get someone who can. It is no different than my having to tolerate meat counters and slaughter houses, even though according to my religion cows are sacred and slaughtering and eating animals wrong. If I have to live in a society that supports that to get by, then I will need to move to a place where that is the majority rule. The fact that it is murder in my eyes does not pave the way for me to slap the barbecue sandwich out of your hand. I agree with you that he feels he is saving a life, but Christians cannot expect to have more lateral in forcing their beliefs on others than do Americans of other beliefs. That is where the essential difference lies in my opinion.","1341110933"

Do they get turned down? Of course, not everyone is compatible and a few people do want to get on with their day. But the women almost always smile and leave feeling better. Many guys make *much* better progress in the day over bars and clubs. It's a great environment.

The duration of the conversation is dictated by you. It usually is better to keep it short but there have been tons of situations where guys go on insta-dates right then. Either way, if these conversations lead to more (like dating and relationship) it still means it's real and effective.

I'm not using Hollywood romances as a complete reference to base your dating mentality. I'm saying the examples of a guy walking up and talking to a girl is how many women would love to be swept off their feet.","1341110942"

I own a bath and body company, and basically shop for essential oils for a living.

And the first movie was fun, but they gotta do something new (like when the green ranger became the white ranger). It's not necessarily about changing the tone, just bringing something fresh to the table.

- Shade it

Questions for you folks:

- Should I pull her neck mane in front of the cloak? It's not ""canon"" but I think it'll flow better.

- Hat or no hat? I like the casualness of no-hat; this is less boastful Trixie and more playful.

Discriminating against men based on their height is encouraged within society (not just by women), whereas discriminating against women based on breast size for instance is (quite rightly) rallied against as being very shallow. Breast size is even changeable to a much greater degree than height (not that any woman should feel the need to do so outside of medical necessity).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Once, I had parked my car at Target, and when I got back in, it wasn't starting. I realized that one of the doors hadn't shut all the way, and the battery was dead. At the time my parents were out of the country, and the only family in town was my brother. I called him about 15 times before he answered, getting more and more panicked each time (I was 18 and have never done well in those kind of situations) and when he finally answered, scolded me for thinking that his phone would ""always be on him"" (...it was) and he was busy and basically told me, well that sucks.  

All of my close friends either lived over fifty miles away or at work and couldn't help. I have never been good with strangers or asking for help, it had been a horrible week, and I don't think I ever felt so alone, sitting in my sweltering hot car with no one to help me, and I started crying. Like, ugly, fluids coming out of orifices crying.  

After maybe an hour and a half, a young woman knocked on my window and said she'd seen me crying, and did I need help? She had an out of town accent and a husband and infant daughter in her car. I tearfully explained the problem and that I had no family or friends in the area that could help. Her and her husband immediately set up a pair of jumper cables. Their daughter was still in her car seat, watching me, and her husband kept rubbing my back and telling me that it was okay, that this happened to everyone, and tomorrow would be a better day.  

When I told them that I didn't have family here, they looked concerned but said they understood because they had just moved here a couple months ago from Joplin, Missouri because their home had been destroyed in a tornado. They followed me home to make sure I got there safe, and I think I just went in and cried even more because I couldn't believe someone could lose everything they had and still have enough love left to help a random girl in a Target parking lot.

As a woman, I have to say I'd be shattered if I found out my husband was doing something like this. Not because of who he's doing it with, but because of how he is doing it, which appears to be by lying to and manipulating someone online who has a disability. It would be like you never knew him, for the entire 20 years you were married.

Think about it, he's pretending to be disabled to a disabled person on the internet, this is predatory behavior. Granted we don't know the exact scenario - could be that he's role playing (with someone able bodied)? Regardless, I think you should mention it to your dad, hopefully he's a reasonable person... you'll probably have to give him an ultimatum, but who's to say his 17 year old child will stop him from being this way? That's where your mother comes in, she is his wife and if anyone is going to get him through this, then she is the one - not you.

I'm quite sure your family could survive without him if worst comes to worse - your family deserves to be happy.

I just think that you may regret not saying anything, things could fall apart at a later date and he will be exposed for who he is, your world may come tumbling down regardless. Now would you rather your mother be kept in the dark for a few more years so your family is ""comfortable""? Or would you rather she gets to keep her self respect and handle things on her terms?

Personally, I'd want to know so I could think about whether I want to stay with him and work things out or move on, my way in my time.","1341110980"

I see the logic behind it and I'm sorry for the pessimistic point of view, but you get to a point where you basically give up and live the zombie life with no hope and unfortunately I believe there's alot of people like that lurk on this sub reddit (including myself)

I think once the bowls are finalized as far as which ones will fill out the Big 6 (seems like Rose, Orange &amp; whoever gets B12/SEC game are in for sure) then there would be the opportunity for other conferences to secure similar deals, but that seems like a long shot. No offense, but the Big East just doesn't seem to have the firepower in terms of membership to make a strong case. This is my least favorite part of the new deal.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I am no expert by any means, but pre-planning works the best for me. When I have things in order, I can just grab what I need and go. It can be a chore at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature.
When you do have some down time, cook some larger meals to freeze for later use. I also use my crockpot. Judging by your busy schedule, the crockpot might be a life saver for healthy meals at home. 

One example of a crock pot meal I made while I was at work. It only took me 10 minutes or so to prepare. I took one pound of ground turkey, one cup of brown rice, a few of huge green peppers I had sliced up, a large can of tomatoes with juice, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, onion flakes, and garlic powder and threw it into the crockpot. 8 hours later, I scooped up the goodness after work. When I was done with one serving, I dumped the rest into single serve containers and froze for another day. Look up some recipes online, you’d be surprised what you can cook in a crockpot.

Another tip is to bulk up on veggies in these homemade meals, and you won't be as hungry as you would be eating a frozen ""healthy"" meal. I usually have some time during my weekend to at least make one meal, if not a few. I cook using recipes for 4 servings and I rotate the dinners so I have something different to pop in the microwave throughout the week.

I'm not a big fan of meal replacement shakes, but they do work in a pinch. When you know you won't be home or are unable to reheat something, throw a can in your backpack. It might not fill you up, but it will keep you from gnawing your arm off before you can get to a healthier food source.

Snack on veggies or fruits. Some keep better than others without refrigeration. Apples and carrots come to mind. I also bring fiber one bars in case a chocolate craving hits me.

And as always, make sure you drink lots of water. It really does help. Sometimes thirst is masked by hunger.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","This is where media bias and a lack of ideological diversity comes into play.  Most people in the media are Democrats, most are liberal.  Thus, they're predisposed to believing that their side is better than the opposite side.  So when the Supreme Court rules 5-4 in favor of something that conservatives and/or Republicans approve of, it's easy to say that the Republican appointees are ideological, since they all voted the same way and it worked because there are more of them.  It ignores the reality that the liberal bloc on the Court also tend to vote the same, of course, but they're on the proper side.

An honest accounting would note that *all* justices are ideological - each one has their own ideological point of view regarding judicial interpretation, Constitutional reading, and the power of the SCOTUS.  ","1341111027"

Here, let me try. Think about actual five year olds.

Basically, we're friends with Israel because we have been for a long time, and because they've helped us in the past, and because you tend to stay friends with people. They're a democracy, mostly, which makes them sort of unique in their region, and frankly, there are also religious and cultural constituencies that make supporting them popular. They also look more like us than most of their neighbors, which shouldn't matter, but it probably does, and their religion is more like ours than Islam is.

There are going to be people who tell you that they're not that friendly, or that this friendship and aid are hurting us, and those are really important discussions for which there's some evidence.

Last thing, remember costs do not count towards Dark World. 

Example: You play Lightning Vortex. You must discard 1 card. That is a cost and therefore you don't get Snoww's effect.

"dragonquest","t5_2sbty","It broke the chain of what I thought was going to be an amazing Playstation-based series. DQ7 was on the PS, DQ8 was on PS2, and the PS3 was rising in popularity when DQ9 was going to be released. I saw no reason not to put it on that platform, but they instead put it on the much weaker DS.
What I took from that is that SquareEnix was targeting the younger demographic, and I respect that decision in a sense considering you can't just run on the same group of people for years and years, but a little part of me died inside because I knew if it was on the DS that it would not become popular overseas. Same goes with DQX being on the Wii.
Gaming wise, I believe DQ9 ruined the single player aspect of the game that had, for so long, made DQ so awesome since its start. Instead of playing for hours and enjoying my time playing it, I could just get a friend to use WiFi with me and Bulldoze through the game. It barely took a day for us to finish the game, and it made me feel a bit empty inside. The fact that they added professions again was great, and I felt like I was back in DQ7, but it just didn't feel the same. Graphics weren't the best, storyline wasn't as compelling as the other games in the series, and the end-game dungeons felt boring after a while. Same dungeon schemes, different bosses.

I respect the fact that DQ9 was SquareEnix trying new things out, but to me, I'm waiting for DQX, hoping that it'll be better.","1341111039"

&gt; 1) the department of education is pressuring the schools to drop the standards of allegations and making it easier to cry rape. it's all coming from the top level, otherwise schools would handle the problems how they see fit. by withholding money from schools that do not make the changes the government desires, the government is essentially running the show.
&gt; 
&gt; read more about how the obama administration is interpreting the law and the overall debate here:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/23/title-ix-anniversary-prom_n_1445298.html
&gt; 
&gt; 2) you may have a point if we are just looking at the face of the law. here's a [great article on how v.a.w.a. criminalizes behavior that is not considered to be violence, and how it hurts men.](http://www.humanevents.com/2006/05/15/violence-against-women-act-abuses-rights-of-men/) like title ix, the law in its face is not discriminatory, but how the government officials apply it is most definitely discriminatory. 
&gt; 
&gt; 4) i don't why you are saying ""facepalm,"" because it is evident that the e.e.o.c. is hunting down on companies with lawsuits because they are not hiring enough women according to them.

The reason that it wasn't passed is that everyone got together to fight it. We proclaimed loudly to anyone that would listen that this was not ok. 

It still doesn't fix the problem with government because the politicians are not representing our interests. We had to protest loudly en masse not just to our own representatives (which is supposed to be what our representatives are for) but to everyone in power. 

We cannot do that for every single issue that comes up. Unlike politicians we have real jobs that take up a large portions of our days. We cannot spend 100% of our energy on fighting the policies we don't agree with.

For the current government to work our representatives need to listen to their constituents. Or we need to switch to a government where we vote on everything. 

Right now people have little to no say in what our government is doing and that is why so many are disillusioned and resentful. ","1341111069"

After downing the entire thing he says the he doesn't remember much but he is fairly sure that the guy gave him a lot of other drugs while he was messed up.

Next thing A knows he wakes up in a hospital for supposedly trying to commit suicide by overdosing. It had been five days since the party.

Ingredients

    Pastry for a Double-Crust Pie:
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2/3 cup shortening, chilled
    6 tablespoons cold water
     
    Three-Berry Filling:
    1 cup fresh strawberries, halved
    1 cup fresh raspberries
    1 cup fresh blueberries
    1 cup fresh blackberries
    1/2 cup white sugar
    3 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions

    Combine the flour and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the pieces are the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the water over part of the mixture, then gently toss with a fork. Push moistened portion to the side of the bowl. Repeat, using 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until all is moistened. Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
    Transfer one piece of dough to a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap the crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease the crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator.
    In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries; gently toss until berries are coated. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes.
    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat.
    Roll out the remaining pastry for the top crust. Stir the berry mixture and pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place the top crust over the pie and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges of the crust and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edge of the pie with foil.
    Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil.
    Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

Which is not to mention the main problem in that this is purely imagination.  I could similarly imagine a universe not fine tuned could still allow for ghosts with intelligent minds, but I haven't really made much of an argument unless I'm describing things that are physically possible according to know physics that would allow for this.

A friend of mine suggested we try D&amp;D, so we picked up the basic set and tried it out. We didn't really know what we were doing and his family moved out of town soon after, but then a little while later I started picking up all the AD&amp;D 2nd ed core books that I could get my hands on. I spent a lot more time making characters than actually playing. ...That and talking about Planescape mythology online.

As the above comment stated, marriage was at that time considered allowable upon a person when they had reached puberty and if they both consented to it. We find it weird because of our cultures being influenced by other forces over time and then this makes us question Islam. The Islamis ruling is still that marriage is allowable once you hit puberty, but because of the way most of our societies are structured it is not practical to get married at such young ages.","1341111084"

Well, not by choice.  Everything I learned, I learned from my parents and reading books I bought.  I didn't learn a damn thing I didn't personally pay for myself - I was merely forced to sit in public ~~schools~~ *indoctrination centers* while some bastard ranted about how Columbus wanted to kill all the Indians (which no one was aware of) because white people are always murderous racists.

You have fallen upon the fallacy that none of these benefits you mention could be provided without the magical government stealing from people to pay for it.  And that is incredibly false.  If people can pay for it through taxes, they can pay for it through the market.  And then they would do it voluntarily.  Plus, it would be more efficient, as there would be indicators of where people most need roads, schools, etc. instead of just building them wherever is most politically expedient.","1341111085"

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","&gt;It doesn't allow me to easily create 30 friggin tabs and then ignore them forever. 

Uh, the default browser in Android does allow you to create multiple tabs or windows (depending on which version you are running).  I sometimes have up to 16 tabs in each of the three browsers I use on my android phone.  

However, I'm going to seriously ruin this for you:  Check out Chrome on Android.  If you have a proper tablet interface (big bar on the bottom, not the small notification bar on the top), then you'll have a nearly identical experience to desktop Chrome.

&gt;You want to take a quick break from what you're looking at to entertain some random thought that just punched you in the mind balls? Have fun starting from scratch when you get back.

This should not happen unless your device manufacturer REALLY messed with things or you have a severe lack of RAM in the device.  Leaving an android application does not close it initially, it will only put it in a mode of ""sleep,"" for lack of a better word.  The state of the application is saved and when you come back to the application, it will bring you back to where you are.  

This is true for all applications.  Pressing the home button, or long pressing the home button to switch to another app directly will _not_ close your current application.

**The point is**:  Android actually has fairly decent multitasking built in.","1341111091"

Quinoa can be your standard ""carb"" (even though it's protein heavy).  If you can have stock, it will be even tastier that way.  Heck, even a garbanzo bean salad with quinoa and broccoli would probably be decent.  With an olive oil/vinaigrette.  Or do the quinoa with some caramelized onions.

I have since moved away from that small town, and into another. Around here there are no Jehovah's Witnesses, but there are several Mormons around here. I've seen them going door-to-door two or three times while I've been out driving or biking, but haven't actually spoken to them yet. They do frequently shop at the local grocery store but they just stick to their shopping when they are there.

So basically, this hasn't happened to me yet. But whenever it does (I'm sure it will) I'm just going to be honest about it and let them know my views and experiences. I'm not going to be a dick about it like others I've seen.

Yes and no. The higher end models are always the larger ones. Higher end means better components, more durable bodies (metal frames usually), and better features.

&gt; Not much over 46"" but if you're spending over $2000 on a tv you're probably not shopping at Walmart.

The Brick. You shop around and see who's carrying what. Costco has a good selection usually.

&gt; what store have you been in recently that stocks only high end stuff and none of the mass produced Chinese stuff that everyone sells these days?

None. But some stock more than others. Surprisingly, I've found more stuff at Winners not made in China than anywhere else. They have a hodgepodge of random products from everywhere. Still 90% Chinese shit.

&gt; Walmart sells a decent selection of stuff, buys Canadian goods whenever available, and has excellent hours.

If it's just hiding comments, I don't give a crap, but not letting somebody speak just because he's unpopular is.. well I'd call it unethical.

Also, you can probably tell that I don't downvote anybody's comment (unless they're spamming). I don't think that makes me better than a downvoter, but I do believe it is more ethical to encourage dissenting opinion.

One day I told him that on Youtube there's documentary's on his ship. I think we got a minute through it when the fire started and he started to tear and not say one word. I decided to end the video short right there and said ""maybe another time"". He went to the bathroom and wiped his tears and came back to his normal self. To this day I won't talk about the fire and just about what he did in Vietnam on his ship and only the good times. He still thinks his best time of his life was in the navy.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","No. Not OEM lenses (Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.). Each different brand uses it's own lens mount configuration (where the lens and the camera body actually meet), with a few possible exceptions.

As for brands like Sigma and Tamron, they typically make the same lens setup (focal length, zoom, and max aperture) for many different brands of camera. They do this by changing the mount configuration to meet the needs of that brand of camera. But no, you **CAN NOT** put a, say, Canon lens on a Nikon Body.

I recommend purchasing Nikon gear over others solely because Nikon has not changed their SLR lens mount in a really long time. With certain functionality issues, you can put *almost* any Nikon SLR lens made from 1959 onwards on *almost* any modern Nikon body (I recommend checking out Ken Rockwell's site (one of the **very** rare times I would even consider doing such a thing), as he's compiled a very thorough list of what lens is compatible with which camera, and functionality issues of said combos). With the cheaper bodies, you often can lose things like AF and metering. With the more pro-level bodies (like my D700), you can tell the camera which non-CPU lens you have mounted, via a menu item where you put in focal length and max aperture, and have most functions still available to you.

Like I said, check out The Great Douchebag's website; for while his photos are kinda really super *meh*, the dude has spent a ***shitload*** of time figuring out all these compatibility issues, and has laid them out for all of us in a very handy way. Just remember that, when it comes to **anything** he says that's not cold hard fact, it should be taken with a LARGE pinch of salt.","1341111149"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","I'm not being an ass trying to accuse you of victim blaming, or anything else.  In fact, I understand (at least conceptually - even if you might well make a case that I'm not properly taking it into account) - the cybersecurity principle of *this is the way the world works whether you like it or not and if you screw up you cannot prosecute every potential offender who will take advantage of it*.  (I am not deluded enough to think the theory of victim blaming is relevant to cybersecurity the same way it is in offline interactions.) 

I realize that, if you have a vulnerability, there's some guy in Eastern Europe who can make you hurt and there's absolutely nothing that can be done about it.  If a company who holds my personal info gets hacked because of their bad security, I am going to blame their ass 100% no holds barred without question, and in most cases I care about the hacker not at all.  After all, it could have and would have been one of a million others; it was inevitable. 

BUT.

How does that apply to this case?  

There is always going to be a significant danger from posting any personal info online.  Educating everyone on this matter is critical, because there is no way to ""fix"" this.  However, I think we have a second problem: it's not just a tiny proportion of ""creeps"" who are making life hell for women online, but rather a striking percentage of the population.  It's the difference between always knowing there might be a mugger outside and having fifty of them lining up outside your front door. 

Why not work to fix this?  Some men get doxxed, some men get harassed, but nowhere near the extent woman do, *even though the possibility exists for every man who posts any picture or personal info*.   We can't make it safe for anyone online, but we can and should work to make it **safer** for everyone.","1341111151"

Sometimes it's nice out but a lot of wind so I need gloves. Well, I did a 7 mile (total) out and back run with my team, and was the only one wearing just a t-shirt and no windbreaker or long sleeved shirt or sweater. Hands down the worst run of my life. I could not feel my arms. I couldn't move them. Then they started hurting because of how cold it was. Like, not just numbness but actually hurting, like they were being squeezed or something. When we finally got back to the school (xc practice), I went to the bathroom and used the automatic hand dryer (it blasts hot air). That was pretty stupid because the shock from cold to hot made them hurt even more, even after pulling them out. 

Me underestimating how cold it is like this has happened 3 times, but on shorter runs. This one felt like forever.

The point people have to understand is that the USSR, and other states like it, had virtually *zero* socialism, let alone communism. If socialism means worker-owned and a controlled production, in the US labor has had much more pull that in any of those places, before it was utterly decimated by neoliberal policy.

Communism sounds like a pretty good idea, but that's all it is. The places that [have come closest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6RFro3dk78) to implementing it are the ones you don't hear about.","1341111176"

One night I was out on a date and didn't get home until the bar closed, around 4am. I come home to find a couple I'd never met before naked in my bed.

"deaf","t5_2qi0j","Hi there, I'm Kristin. When I first started getting feedback after the Daily Dot article, I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of comments. Especially after receiving a few messages that included credible threats of violence from people, I was unsure how to respond to any individual comment. I spoke to my literary agent, and she recommended specifically not responding until we were able to talk together, which wasn't until yesterday morning.

I posted a broad statement on the Facebook page yesterday morning after getting to speak with my agent, and I am still working to message everyone individually to address their unique concerns as well. I understand people are upset and feel very strongly about this issue, so I wanted to wait until things got a bit cooler to respond.

I apologize that I have not yet gotten to your email or message. Your message **is** important to me, and I am taking as much feedback as possible to make changes to my videos (i.e. adding CC to more videos, making the disclaimer in the video instead of just the description, finding a native signer instead of an Interpreter to help work on the phrases for the videos, etc). I hope this helps clarify things.","1341111177"

For reference, the neck is 2 1/8"" thick at the heel, 21 1/2"" from nut to heel and 30 5/8"" from nut to bridge.

My plan is to convert this to a guitar by replacing the neck and dropping a dogear P90 on the pickguard – although, the body is pre-routed, so if I wanted to put in a humbucker instead I could do so without much difficulty.

Thanks to anyone who can tell me more about my purchase. If you just want to comment on my plan to convert it, I appreciate that too!","1341111182"

The physical activities that the younger kids will do, that he may miss out on, *will harm him in the future.*

At this point I would ensure that he develops physically and socially  normally in school. Give him all the resources he requires; stock up bookshelves with books much more advanced than you think he can handle right now. Inspire him. 

If you can, place him in classes in middle school and high school (if relevant/possible). Let him mingle with those older and younger than him. Maybe he'll take math at the middle school, science at the high school. Once he's at least two years ahead of his current grade, then skip him a grade.

Ingredients

    Pastry for a Double-Crust Pie:
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    2/3 cup shortening, chilled
    6 tablespoons cold water
     
    Three-Berry Filling:
    1 cup fresh strawberries, halved
    1 cup fresh raspberries
    1 cup fresh blueberries
    1 cup fresh blackberries
    1/2 cup white sugar
    3 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions

    Combine the flour and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the pieces are the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the water over part of the mixture, then gently toss with a fork. Push moistened portion to the side of the bowl. Repeat, using 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until all is moistened. Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
    Transfer one piece of dough to a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap the crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease the crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator.
    In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries; gently toss until berries are coated. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes.
    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat.
    Roll out the remaining pastry for the top crust. Stir the berry mixture and pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place the top crust over the pie and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges of the crust and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edge of the pie with foil.
    Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil.
    Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

,
damn, i have somehow forgotten about that. Your right. 
destroy, however, still does buy into the synthetics against organics thing, so its still insane or illogical i guess.

this brings up so many questions about the DEM though ( i refer to star child as Deus Ex Machima kid). Not sure if this makes the ending better or worse. But still thanks for pointing that out, I had forgotten about that line.

&gt;The catalyst states that these options have only just opened up to it, so it probably had been aware of these plans but wasn't able to carry them out.

i find this, however, hard to believe on several fronts. First, the crucible is just a ""crude effective power source"".

It makes you appear both disingenuous and illiterate for not understanding a counter proposal.

&gt;We could easily solve the inflation of medical costs by adopting a UK style NHS system where everyone pays 11% of their income to fund the basic human right of free and equal access to healthcare for all citizens

Ah.. And there we have it. It went from a 2% tax on income to a 10% tax in the long run. Where does it stop? And if it takes 10% to cover it what makes you think 2% is going to cover a damn thing? This program is running off the wealth of future generations that aren't even born yet. You're peddling the same economic schemes my generation used to bilk this generation and the next. 

Like I already said, this bill will save me money. But I'm not a self-interested thief like you, willing to take whatever he can get his little grubby hands on.

(eta: its not mtf exclusive there are certainly trans guys and ftm spectrum folks it's just that some other groups, like BATS and BAGLY, are VERY ftm dominated.) some of its members also occasionally attend BATS but its a very different atmosphere. i haven't really heard good things about BAGLY from more than one social group.

 if you're FTM spectrum/FAAB, i attend Compass and recommend it but it's definitely a lot of very masculine/butch/binary men, more adults than GLASS or BATS, it's very much a YMMV thing. never been to tiffany club or sisters of boston because i'm male identified not my space etc.

also if you're willing to travel, there's a new all-genders all-ages group in leominster, i believe, that meets the second thursday of each month and has not been around very long. i think aids project worcester also has a fairly active trans group, although the information on their website isn't accurate last i heard so call for dates. there's also a group in worcester called Safe Homes for youth that meets on either thursdays or fridays that is GLBT-general but does have a number of trans kids there.

In the end though, it's really about opening up player choice.  There's nothing preventing you from staying the same shotgun vanguard as always.  In fact, with biotic charge and the bonus to shotgun damage in the vanguard's tree, you probably are still the most effective Vanguard build available.

Do Republicans not have sex? Are Republicans supposed to be asexual in their private lives? I don't get how going to a private person going to a strip club has anything to do with news or politics.

&gt; When right wingers put their families on stage and pretend that only liberals have teens that get pregnant, When their kid gets pregnant, IT IS NEWS AND POLITICS and not just a petty unfair attack on some candidates kids.

What does going to strip clubs have to do with teens getting pregnant? ","1341111230"

As far as all hemp being ruderalis, i have to disagree. C. Sativa is most commonly used for hemp production. No strain is exclusively ""hemp"". hemp is a term used to describe any strain that has such low thc its considered more useful to use for its fiber and oil.

The only way to improve is to keep inviting change, to dive into new concepts and possibilities for an MMO, sort of like GW2 is doing. Blizzard is obviously trying to change and adapt with the gamers of today.

"iaido","t5_2qo5t","Folks, I know this is an old thread, but here's my advice.... or at least the advice I was given.

1. Koji oil on your habaki will stretch the saya's opening.  Be very careful NOT to oil the habaki, just oil the sword itself.  Do not over oil, as drip can cause the same problem.  Koki will soften and let wood stretch.

2. The advice to not fully rest the sword in the saya is important when storing your sword.  I am not commenting on during practice, but when packing up, many practitioners keep a cut leather circle the shape of their tsuba approx 1/8"" thick between the saya and tsuba.  This helps prevent the habaki from stretching the koiguichi.

3. When storing your sword, do not store it with the tsuka against the ground.  This will cause oil to run down from the tip to the habaki and cause issues with the opening of the saya or worse.

4. Most practitioners only need to shim their saya to correct a problem with their noto, or after very long extended practice.  Noto when the alignment of saya and sword is off causes wear, as does a twist of the wrist as you continue the noto further into the saya.  You will see wear dominant on one side or another just past the saya's opening, and you will see the blade wobble as your insert it into the saya resting on the mune softly and slowly with a loose grip -- this shows the ""groove"" you create when doing noto with too much tension and mis-alignment.

-- your sword when properly fitted should not fall out when turned at a down angle , but should be loose enough to be released with one finger.

New swords often are too tight and need to be shaven down to open them up a bit. (or just practice!)

To fix, shim, but also correct the root of the problem.

My first Iaito needed to be shimmed twice over a few years, but following the advice above, no sword after ever needed it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So my house has terrible cell phone reception. If my phone is above the height of the book shelf, it gets service. If not, then no service. So to do this I put my phone up on my computer, which has a slanted top. I often forget to take my phone off vibrate, and this leads to it vibrating and falling off the computer. I've trained myself to quickly respond to this, however, and now my hand shoots out as soon as I see something slipping out of the corner of my eye.

Not that weird at first, but it can cause some interesting circumstances. At one point, I was in language lab at school, and set the big headphones we use on the hook on the wall. But I didn't set them properly, so they slid into place after a few moment. My hand shoots out and literally destroys one of the ears of the headphones by smashing it against the wall as I yell ""SHIT"" at the top of the lungs.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Duels of the Planeswalker is the second best way to learn how to get into it. I'll go over what's good about it in a second, but the best way to get into Magic is to find someone to teach you.

If you have a friend that plays, they're the best source. They can explain things when you have questions and it's much more fun to play in real life. Assuming this isn't an option, Duels of the Planeswalkers is a great way to learn. Here's why:

1. It costs $10, which is very cheap for a game.

2. It has a tutorial and shows tips and such throughout the game.

3. It gives you a coupon you can redeem at a store for a free set of 6 cards, which will definitely get you more excited about playing.

4. It will teach you how to play the game. It won't go in depth, but it'll get your foot in the door.

5. It has prebuilt decks, so you don't need to worry about building it properly. It lets you unlock up to 30 cards for that deck that you can use to customize the deck.

Also, your local store will be a great place to learn. People always hang around and you can go there and watch them, see what's going on. Someone might offer to teach you as well, perhaps a store employee. I know the Magic expert at my store offers to teach people if they come in during a slow time of the week (say a Monday night when there's no events going on). It's a lot better to learn in person, and I've taught many people in person. While the game is certainly good at teaching, it's ultimately not better than real life. Like I said, they can explain things very easily and answer any questions you have, which makes things very nice.","1341111268"

This was before I read the other books, but I remember reading about how he wanted to kill the direwolf pups, how he seemed to enjoy killing the wildlings who attacked Bran, etc. So it felt to me as if he would gladly use any reason to partake in violence. Not as a sociopath, mind you, but just because he thought it was righteous and also fun. So any excuse to cut down some Lannisters would be fine by him.

I am also not convinced that Theon had a mind to turncloak when he first went to his father. He expected that he would be accepted back with open arms, and that his father would appreciate and accept King Robb's offer. His father's cold greeting/rejection and the Ironmen's ridicule of him sent him over the edge. So I wouldn't think that this situation would be a threat towards House Stark because he wasn't really thinking that way at the time.

Eventually I got to the point where I jiggled the keys in the door like that scene in Ace Ventura so he would know to remove hand from cock and stop roughing up the suspect long enough for me to swap out books and GTFO.

Luckily, my girlfriend's roommate had an older boyfriend who lived off campus and she was never there, so I spent a lot of time in her dorm.

and

So activists say that 190 were killed across Syria and more than 50 of those in Douma? Or nearly 200 were massacred in Douma, 190 across Syria, and 50 more in Douma again? Am I on drugs or the editors of that article?

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt; I mean, if I knew I was going to have the same benefits no matter what I did, I'd probably sit on my ass all day, or get the easiest job possible. 

This is what Adam Smith thought about human nature--that everyone has a natural inclination to do as little work as possible, while trying to accumulate as much property as possible.

But think of all the pleasures you'd be deprived of if you did this: the pleasure of creatively collaborating with people you know and respect; the pleasure of developing your talents; the pleasure of discovering what you are capable of achieving; the pleasure of seeing your talents at work improving the lives of the people you love.

Capitalism develops this side of our personality to an incredible extent, but it also makes us kind of hate it. We divide our lives into work, which we do even though we hate it, and play. The more impoverished our real life becomes, the greater our alienated life--the more time we spend at jobs we hate, the more abstract ""wealth"" we accumulate on our account, which we can spend in a big rush on ""playing"" if we get a chance. Capitalism makes us workshy. 

Communism is not about ""removing incentives to work"", but about abolishing the distinction between work and play, between leisure and labour, between self-development and altruism. These divisions are artefacts of an alienated form of social labour.

Overcoming this will require both immense material abundance (creation of which is the historical mission of capitalism) and a transformation of the social form of labour (which is the historical mission of... you and me!)

Randomly placed in an apartment with three guys who were High School Football all-stars still living in their glory days (they were all seniors in College at this point.) They were all reasonably nice guys but one of them was the dirtiest human being I have ever met. He never did laundry and just threw clothes, books, and trash on his floor. At first it was limited to his room which I could care less about, but eventually it started to spread. To make it worse he got a puppy which he kept in his room and let it sleep on the bed. He would leave the dog alone in his room during the day. Eventually the smell got bad enough that I started staying at a friends house. Most of the dishes and pots in the kitchen were mine that I brought from home. I would still stop by the apartment to get clothes etc so one day I stop by and he has paid two friends $100 apiece to clean his room for him. They found some sort of plant/mildew hybrid literally growing out of his toilet bowl, and a good 5 lbs of dog shit buried under all the junk that was covering his floor.

As an added bonus when I went to pack up my room the last day of the lease I found out he had moved out two days before. All of my pots pans and dishes that he had been using and not cleaning were stacked in my closet complete with old food, mold and mildew.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","[Cold Turkey](http://getcoldturkey.com/) is good, lightweight, and super easy to use. I've been using it for about a month now and have hardly noticed it. You can select from popular time wasting websites(such as reddit, facebook, etc.) or make your own list of sites to block. You just set it and forget it. 

If you're going to use it make sure you're serious about it, cause there's no going back. The free version allows you to block sites anywhere from 10 minutes to a week, but you can fire it up for another seven days indefinitely. With the paid version you can do up to a month of blocking. 

Edit: One possible downside/positive(depending at how you look at it) about Cold Turkey versus the others is that you have to make your own list whereas I imagine the others filter out all the naughty stuff on their own. New sites can be added to the list on the fly though, so it's not a major downside.","1341111308"

2. Police - The use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision of another. Therefore When a man is a victim of a criminal, when his rights are violated, the use of retaliatory force must be delegated by proxy to government, an organized force that is bound by due process and the scope of object law.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","*EDIT: The now-deleted post that I responded to said that Ebonics (formally called African-American Vernacular English, or AAVE, by the way) is not a dialect and was ""lazy English.""*

It is a dialect.  Ask any linguist or linguistic anthropologist.

It's not ""lazy English.""  This is a common misconception.  It has rules and nuances just like standard English does.

I understand where you're coming from, I really do.  I think ebonics is an interesting dialect of English that has very cool facets to it, but I also think that the fact that most people who speak it aren't functionally bilingual (in standard English) that it handicaps them.  The answer is not ""they shouldn't speak that way,"" because they should be free to speak any fucking way they want.  The answer is better education so they understand the different options they have when speaking and so they can more effectively code switch.

Code switching is when a person changes from using one language or dialect to another based on the needs of a given situation.  For instance, if Friend 1 is not fluent in Spanish and Friend 2 only speaks Spanish and is trying to explain something to Friend 1, Bilingual Friend 3 might come in and try to help Friend 1 understand what Friend 2 is saying.

Additionally, in my EMT classes, I always heard the Jamaican instructors talking in exceptionally heavy accents and using Jamaican-culture-specific words with each other and then switching to a more standard and easily understood (by the students) English when lecturing or addressing us.  Simple stuff like that.  Would you say the same thing about Jamaicans that you would about those who speak Ebonics?  Probably not.  Their code switching was socially acceptable even though their standard English was still very heavily accented.  There's a lot of deep-rooted prejudices that have shaped the way we look at Ebonics and the population who speaks it.  It's something you should read more about if this post has at all intrigued you.","1341111316"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","The defense is the weak link for this team. Seems odd to say because we're talking about fucking Germany, but there were too many moments (including that semifinal against Italy) where position was poor and reaction time was too slow. 

Badstuber wasn't called for a penalty in the game against Denmark. He got away with lollygagging. Otherwise, Denmark and Portugal winning would have meant Germany goes home along with the Netherlands. 

Hummels had a good tournament overall, but against Greece he was a bit slow on defense. Thankfully, his technique and talent are such that he could make up for it. 

Both Hummels and Badstuber are at fault for the second Italian goal. Neither of them pay attention to Balotelli making his run in between them, and once the ball is played through they are in no position to effectively close down and contest the shot. That's a defensive lapse that cannot happen if you are going to be a championship team.

Of all the defenders, Boateng had the shakiest tournament in terms of consistency (which you exactly point out).  

All that said, these guys are still young (Lahm being the exception, but he's not going anywhere). The only way is up. They'll get better with more experience, both with their clubs and the national team. And once the defense solidifies, well... Neuer is a beast, the midfield is an embarrassment of riches, and there are young guys who can play up top once Klose decides to hang up the boots and hopefully make an effective tandem with Gomez. 

This tournament did not end as expected, but there's still good reason to be excited for this team down the road. Brazil 2014 should be a thrilling one (assuming they qualify, of course). ","1341111324"

Well my roommate was a Phoenix native and because her parents are cheap and were also paying her bills, they told her to keep the A/C off as much as possible and didn't even take my comfort into consideration.

Your pattern of drinking sounds a lot like mine. I also didn't realize how much I'd been drinking until I started recording it. I couldn't deny the fact that I was drinking too much, not with the numbers in front of me.

A lot of people report feeling less depressed and anxious after they quit drinking, after you get past the initial transition. That was the case for me as well. I get some social anxiety so I would often drink in order to feel comfortable in social situations. I was really worried about how I would handle those without alcohol as a crutch, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected. In fact I surprised myself how comfortable I could be if I put myself in the right frame of mind, that I could actually enjoy those situations.

Starting a new school sounds like a great opportunity for a fresh start. You can make friends who don't drink or at least don't center their lives around alcohol. New habits can be easier to develop in new environments.","1341111334"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","While your point is certainly a valid one, I'm going to disagree here.  I like it when a game allows you to play your class whichever way you want to.  For example, it bothered me significantly in ME2 when, as an Infiltrator, I was forced to use only a pistol/SMG in addition to my sniper rifle.  I am a man who values high accuracy and powerful shots.  While the Carnifex does technically fit the bill there, I wanted an automatic weapon to use.  I loved having the option to use an assault rifle in ME3.  It suited the way I wanted to play the game.

You want to play Vanguard with a shotgun.  Power to you.  I imagine there are those out there who want to play Infiltrator with a shotgun.  Going invisible then shooting the enemy in the face would be quite satisfying, I imagine.

Since Mass Effect is (primarily) a single-player experience, balance isn't really an issue.  I seriously doubt anyone is brokenly overpowered.  I play the game to have fun and wreck the forces of evil my way, and I think everyone should have the opportunity to do so.","1341111345"

Currently, I have it handled by layer (only foreground objects can be touched). Each object has its own enum type, which I was going to use to handle the resolution.

For OnPlayerCollision() of each world object, I would need to pass in a PlayerObject, correct? That would currently create a circular dependency since my Player class relies on knowing what a world object is to check if the player is colliding against any.

To resolve that, I would need to make it so only world objects check for collision against the player as opposed to the player checking for collision. Hm. Actually, that sounds like a better idea now that I think about it.

I was in Louisiana's program and it was great. It was run by people between the ages of 18-30. A few old veterans were just kind of there watching. They let us do our own thing. All of the counselors and staff were really fun and nice, and they goofed off with us a lot. They also let us have our phones and iPods. We just couldn't use them at certain times. There were a lot of fun activities and no boring lectures. We had plenty of time to goof off and to do our work. They actually encouraged us to be funny. Also the girls state program took place at the same time as ours so there was a dance at the end of the week, which was pretty cool.

Overall it was a great experience in which I learned a lot about politics, leadership, and brotherhood. I would definitely do it again. I'm sorry that your experience wasn't that great.   ","1341111368"

That processor is not going to be put to use at all whilst gaming, unless you were streaming in HD at the same time. This would be a good set up for someone who worked in multi-media, such as in Photoshop, AfterEffects, etc, where proccessing power is the bottle neck. They would also probably opt for 16 or more gb of ram.

For gaming, drop down to an i5 3570k or an i5 2500k. It will still be ridiculously powerful, especially when OCd (you can get 4.5 ghz on air on the 2500k) and then pump up the graphics card to a 7850 at least.

I'd go with an RCBS Rock Chucker Master Supreme Kit. Grab a shellholder, kinetic bullet puller, set of calipers (dial or digital), case trimmer (for rifle brass), and a set of dies for your calibers.

All in all you'll drop about 450 bucks, maybe a bit more with shipping. Palmetto State Armory is still having a sale with 20% off of reloading equipment and I think free shipping too. Unfortunately, they're still out of Rock Chucker kits.

RCBS also has a mail-in rebate coupon valid for purchases made this current year: http://www.rcbs.com/pdf/RC249_RebateCoupon.pdf

You can save 50 dollars on orders of RCBS products over 300 bucks. Worth it.

Do you have a source for that? There IS some sense that it means testicles in a couple of places, but I would think those are mistakes. I think I previously had thought sweetmeats were these two organ meats; maybe the people who think they are testicles think something similar? ","1341111383"

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt; This study pretty much proves us both wrong, you in thinking that conventional is always best for the environment and me in thinking that organic is always best for the environment.

While there is no definitive evidence to show whether conventional or organic farming is better for the environment, it's a fact that most organic farming supports animal farming and slaughterhouses. Given that, I do not support organic.

&gt; there is no right or wrong reason for being vegan. Vegan is about animal rights and health equally. And yes it is a health diet

The tern ""vegan"" was coined by the Vegan Society to specifically refer to the animal rights movement to stop animal exploitation. It has nothing to do with health. 

Vegan Society still owns the copyright on the term ""vegan"". So yes, there is a ""right"" definition of the term ""vegan"" and no it is not a health diet. 

There is no health benefits to not wearing leather or not wearing wool. Yet not wearing animal products is as much a part of veganism as not eating animal products. That right there should tell you that vegan is not about health.","1341111383"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","I can't help but think of the Scottish independence movement when I read this. There, Cameron argued that the uncertainty needed to end, but that it would have to be an ""in or out"" vote, not one about a renegotiation of the terms.

So far, the UK has managed to either preserve the status quo or to negotiate an exception. Administrative challenges aside, exceptions increasingly smell of ""more equal than others"" in a union of 27, and soon 28. Now it looks as if a large step towards integration will happen, it's only a question of how far and whether or not it will be for the EU as a whole or if there will be a Europe of two speeds, something the UK has historically been very opposed to but that even Cameron himself recently said was necessary.

Even if the Tories hadn't explicitly promised a referendum about any further steps towards integration, Cameron can't ignore public opinion and that of a large share of his own party for much longer. He doesn't have a mandate that would permit him to go further, and he can't block the process because, for the Eurozone, this has become a question of economic survival and the political cost of losing the UK pales in comparison.  
This puts him in a bad negotiating position. He must be careful not to raise too high expectations about those new terms in a referendum if it happens, because even though the UK could block changes to the EU or even of individual new policy decisions, there is no way to change the existing contracts without the others not only all agreeing to his demands, but also being willing to go through a new ratification process just because Cameron is such a nice guy, with all the domestic political problems this would cause in the other member states with their own Euroskeptics coming up with their own list of demands. The EU can't give the UK preferred treatment or it would risk a string of similar pick-and-choose negotiations with one country after another, beginning with the Czechs. It would be much easier to just say ""no"" and leave Cameron to deal with what is then a domestic policy problem for him.

The problem with an ""in or out"" vote obviously would be that, the way thinks are looking now, an ""out"" seems like a very real possibility. Business leaders would tear him a new one if he'd risk that, and hop from talk show to talk show to explain the difference between free trade and a single market. This would even put the City at risk; while I'm sure that they're relieved about the upcoming banking union in the Eurozone, they can't be happy about the financial markets there integrating with them on the outside. A British exit from the EU would be even worse.

Of course there are alternatives to a membership that would still ensure full market access, the remaining members of the UK's old free trade area that they co-founded demonstrates that. But having to accept regulations and directives without being represented in the negotiations can't possibly be what the people have in mind when they claim that the UK should have more independence from Brussels.  
The other alternative would be to try and come up with a new construct within the ""Anglosphere"" and hope that the Americans will treat the UK as an equal partner, or go with a Commonwealth based solution because India's billion citizens can't wait to give their old colonial lords a say over their rapidly growing economy. Or maybe the UK could go it alone and hope that China will meet them with a lot of understanding when they complain about what Chinese protectionist measures mean for British businesses.

So, he's in a difficult situation with no possible good outcome, but not much of a choice about how to go about it, either. I almost feel sorry for him, but as far as European heads of governments in difficult situations go, he's far from the worst off, theses days. He seems to be playing for time, raising the possibility of a referendum while keeping the option open to just leave it as a topic in the next elections. This is probably the best he can do in this situation.","1341111384"

What Sagan means by this is that by us being the first intelligent life that we even know, through the process of abiogenesis we have become the first known creature to ponder about and catalogue studies on the universe around it. Pantheists believe in a unifying spirituality. Sagan might have believed this, but this message has no relevance to that.

The 'origin' of consciousness is cerebral evolution. Like everything else, it came from a gradual process leading up to the complexity to assess the environment. Creatures as intelligent as us, are also very good hunters because of our intellect. We wouldn't be at the top of the food chain without it.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Hopping in here to give the opposite perspective, restore balance to the force, and so on.

Coercion is held to be morally bad, yes, but the argument is that if you can prevent morally worse outcomes by resorting to coercion, then its use is justified. Additionally, there are degrees of coercion, and they are not necessarily equivalent.

This means that while it may not be moral to literally point a gun at someone and demand that they dance the hula, it may well be moral to raise taxes with a threat of fines if it means feeding desperately hungry orphan children with polio.

The problem with this, and the reason that a lot of anarchists (especially AnCaps) don't accept it, is that it makes things very messy. All of a sudden what is and isn't moral becomes a judgement call, rather than something that can be easily predicted from theory.

Well, thinking beyond any OP's specific question asked to provide solid, practical, usable advice is just one of the many services I provide here at r/realestate.

&gt; Why would you advise him to get into an adjustable rate mortgage again?

I didn't actually advise him to get an adjustable.  I said that even if he kept a 7/1on a refi it would be better than sitting in his current loan.  A 7/1 was absolutely the right loan for me when I refi'd a couple months ago.  I've posted in another thread a longer version of the reasons.  

- I got a 3.125 rate when the rate for fixed 30 was around 4.  Given  the adjustment periods, even if rates go to 15% tomorrow, I'm 7/8 point ahead for 7 years.  

- I didn't plan to be in the house more than 1-3 years.

- I can easily afford the fully indexed rate today in today's dollars.  Throw in a bit of inflation, I feel even better.

- The lower rate provides better cash flow if I decide to rent.

- Adjustable rate loans are generally assumable.  In a higher rate environment, that may be a selling feature.","1341111406"

Avoid the dining courts, I've heard nothing good about working for them. Go around Chauncey Hill mid-July to beginning of August and apply anywhere you wouldn't hate with a passion.

If you're close to any professors in your department ask them if they need help with projects or research. It's a great way to build up your resume and future employers love it. I work in a lab in the Lilly building under one of my professors and the experience I've gotten from it will definitely help me in the future.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;1) This has been disproven by medical studies. This is the same crap that pro-religious types throw out for circumcision. How about some actual valid data? How about some sources, rather than conjecture?

[Heres an article about how it decreases infection rates.] (http://www.circinfo.net/why_the_foreskin_increases_infection_risk.html) There's a lot of other stuff on that website which discusses other benefits as well. It seems fairly objective to me. I wouldn't even describe myself as being pro circumcision. I just don't understand why people treat it like one of our societies most pressing issues. All I have to go on is my personal experience which has been nothing but positive. There seems to be a decent amount of evidence for why it might be convenient and hygienic. 

&gt;2) What other surgical modifications for babies that have alleged medical benefits are you advocating for? Just this one? I bet.

What does that have to do with anything? No, I'm not for surgical modifications on babies. I said before that the concept of surgical modification is inherently troubling to me whether or not it is on babies if it is purely for cosmetic reasons. I do, however, think there is a big distinction between things like clitorodectomies and circumcision, which I listed before. Banning it is similar to banning the burkha in France for me, though. Good intentions which ultimately end up marginalizing people. If they ban Islamic head scarves, then why are nuns exempt? If we ban circumcision because the child has no say, then should we ban baptism and baby ear piercing? Circumcision rates are also on the decline. We should just let it phase out naturally over the next century rather than just get all up in arms and spark a big conflict.","1341111471"

So far, it's a few classics that I've just never gotten around to covering--like *Anna Karenina* and *The Fountainhead*--and some more leisure reads like the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series and *My Sister's Keeper* (I hesitate to admit it, but Picoult is somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me).

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","I accept that what you say is plausible, although I disagree. I will argue plausibility below. However, if what you state is correct, and it's not critical thinking, but value undermining that is the actual plank intent, it would not take much to reword a rather confusing sentence. Something along the lines of: 

&gt; We oppose educational programs that challenge the student's religious beliefs and/or undermine parental authority. We argue that [HOTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_order_thinking_skills) programs and [OBE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-based_education) programs are designed to challenge student's religious beliefs and undermine parental authority and we therefore oppose them on this principle. We support the notion of critical thinking in general, provided it is not applied to religious beliefs and parental authority, which we hold to be inviolate.  

The things is.... I don't actually believe that's what Republicans in Texas want. They are uninterested in teaching children to arrive at their own conclusions. Note the first part of the plank: ""Knowledge-Based Education"". This can be more adequately rephrased as ""memorize and repeat"", or as I like to call it ""slurp and burp"". What Republicans actually want are children who do as they are told, exactly as they are told to do it. 

This form of education results invariably in stagnation. People do simply because that's what they've always done and they never think outside what they're supposed to do. Change dries up and innovation dies. ","1341111487"

Really what it comes down to is not removing from a language (that's some scary 1984 shit), but rather adding new non-gendered ways of saying things.

For example if I'm talking about someone thinking I am stuck choosing between the 3 sentences:

""He's thinking""
""She's thinking'
""Its thinking""

All three have problems, namely I didn't say if it was man or women.  Moreover the third denotes non-personhood.  I suppose one can say this:

""One's thinking""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is no way to eliminate the possibility of MAD. There are 3 parts to the Nuclear Triad for a reason. ICBMs can be detected long enough before detonation for a counterattack to be fired before the EMP takes effect. Nuclear-armed Submarines are patrolling the world, and surface at set times. If they do not receive a message that all is well in the world within a certain amount of time, they launch their nuclear missiles at the likely attackers. And being underwater they would be much less affected by the EMP. The only part of the nuclear triad to be completely eliminated by an EMP attack of sufficient magnitude would be the bombers that carry nuclear weapons.

Theres no additional problems with an anonymous transaction ID over current paper voting systems. They have all the same benefits and drawbacks essentially. You must trust a third party to properly design the software and then count them this changes the scale of fraud and prevention. Properly designed systems that are not fraudulent will be vastly improved over having humans count, poorly designed or fraudulent ones are going to make an individual case of fraud a national problem anywhere those machines are used.

 One of the best suggestions I've seen for electronic voting is a standard e-voting booth where you cast a ballot and it prints your choice on a piece of paper behind a glass window so you can verify it was properly recorded without having access to that paper record. That's the voting machine I want in use. The individual does not receive a 'proof of vote for candidate' they can use as a receipt for vote buying payment. The individual may verify that their vote was recorded correctly. Any investigators can use this to validate the accuracy of the electronic tabulation if necessary without having access to individually identifiable votes.

It's not my idea but it's been floating around for a decade since electronic voting concepts began and naturally nobody in power wanted a verifiable paper trail. Somehow that makes me wary that they prefer the possibility of institutionalized fraud.","1341111506"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","It sounds like no one told you, but spitzes are prone to dog aggression, especially same-sex. Fixing him will definitely help, but it won't be enough. Yelling at him is only going to make the situation more stressful for both of you. You're on the right track with the treats. Teach him a good ""watch"" command – that is, train him to to look at you on command. You're also going to want to try and lower the distance between upset, and not upset. Right now there's a distance where he's okay with other dogs. Try and close the gap slowly by treating him and having him focus on you instead of the other dog. If he's okay at 50 feet but not at 35, try and get him okay at 45 feet, 40 feet, 39, etc. But seriously, fix him first. Unless you're planning on breeding (and if you're not knowledgable about breed traits like DA, you really shouldn't be), there's really no reason for him to be left intact. You'll both be happy, and he'll be healthier if he's neutered.","1341111521"

They didn't know better. Lastly, if God has forgiveness, why can't he forgive all good people, not just the Christians? There are many good people out there who are non-Christian. Also, God killed millions of people in the bible, while Satan killed about a dozen. Satan accepts God's unwanted children unconditionally, all of whom have been punished for a 6,000 year old crime they didn't commit. He is the hero this world deserves, but not the one it needs.

She went to Fordham in NY and I believe had a quad or a triple as her freshman living arrangements. Out of the 2 or 3 girls in this setup, only one was basically a dirt-bag, and just basically an all around big-sloppy-C. She would come home during the week, like Tuesday nights, absolutely shitfaced at 3 or 4 AM and be very, very loud. That may not sound bad, but these other girls had quite a bit of school work and this biddy wouldn't do school like a normal person.
Anyway, fast-forward about 4 months into the school year and this B brings home a guy, no problem right? 
No mother-f'er, no. Problem. 
Lord knows how this happened, as he wasn't foreign, but she ended up demanding to be pooped on. Yes. Pooped On.
He pooped.
On. Her. Chest. And. Neck.
And now she is forever names, ShitTits.
_____________________________________
My story wasn't nearly as dirty *wink* as her's, but my freshman roommate was a pretty nice guy until he started dating thsi girl on campus. I was happy for him, because at the time we were very close and I was in a relationship with a girl who went to a different college, and am still with her now. (I'm going to be a Junior next fall) He basically lives with her and her roommate, but left everything he had in our dorm. He maybe showed up once or twice every two weeks to shower, change, and leave dirty cloths on the floor and left. He made up lies about me and my friends (who he hung out with..?) It was weird, because I went through a phase of blaming him for everything (very childish, got over it after a week), and then realized his chosen major and drive never would and or could overtake mine, and all of his friends left him and left campus because they either couldn't afford it or keep up, so he wears the same cloths for about three days and then changes them. I've yet to see him with a group of more than three other people.

I disagree with this part.  There has been (and continues to be) PLENTY of movement in both the left and right directions, and this widening gap is tearing the country apart.  

Both camps are getting more extreme.  Each one in turn, as it occasionally and briefly gains majority voting power in DC, passes more and more authoritarianism catering to its own political wing's dogma.  The law books keep getting crammed with more extremism, of both the left and right varieties, to the point that almost everything is dictated to us, and at least half of it most people disagree with.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Exercise is using what you have; training is about pushing the limit.

The utterly nonsensical ""no grunting"" policy at Planet Fitness is symptomatic of their ""no training attitude. Grunting is normal when you're pushing (and expanding) the limits of your capability. PF has no interest in helping you to reach your fitness goals; some gym owners are honest, and no one wants to see you fail, per se, but they mostly want you to keep paying the membership dues and not make their unfit clients uncomfortable.

If you're serious about adding muscle, you will need to lift heavy enough that you will sometimes grunt, you will need to do it outside of Cybex/Nautilus/Smith machines, and you will need the freedom to do a wide range of activities (squats, one of the most important exercises, are banned at some PF locations). If you put money down and make a commitment to a PF, where will you be in six months when you're lifting seriously and you need a real weight room?

This is from someone who is 6 months into a 14 month commitment at a shitty gym, by the way. If you can go month to month, nothing down, then play around in a PF until you're ready to hit it hard. If you stick with it, invest in a real gym.","1341111550"

"japan","t5_2qh2u","TL,DR:

-Japanese homes only last an average of 30 years, and lose all of their value after 15. As a result, rather than being an investment that a family can build equity in, Japanese homewoners scrimp and save only to see what is often their life’s biggest investment lose 1/15th of its value each year. How did this come to be?

-Land prices skyrocketed after Japan’s economic recovery. As a result, homes could continue to shoot up in value after they were bought even if the construction of the homes themselves was worse, because the land underneath it was becoming more and more valuable as Japan’s economy and population grew, and suitable land became scarcer and scarcer.

-Expensive land prices meant homeowners were left with little money to spend on the house itself, encouraging cost-cutting.

-Since the end of the bubble however,  land prices have been falling back to earth, and are now back to where they were in the mid ‘80s. This is a double-loss: the building qualities are so poor that the house is worth less and less with every year…and at a less dramatic rate, so too is the land. 

-""Sunshine laws"" restrict the amount of floor space built on a lot. As a result, the average of building height is only 2 ½ stories. This makes it necessary to buy more land to build a big house, which makes land even more expensive. This in turn leaves homebuyers with even less money to spend on the quality of their home.

-the law does not require structural calculations for 1-2 story wood-framed dwellings, and many are not built to withstand earthquakes. This contributes to the disposability of many houses, because they must be built to withstand earthquakes to have real long-term value

Yes.

I was going to suggest using acetone to dissolve each in whatever amounts the ratio needs to be and then combining. 

I believe if done at the correct ratio of freebase to acid to anhydrous acetone it will cause all of the salts to precipitate out of the acetone. ","1341111555"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","FINALLY A THREAD I AM USEFUL IN.

I lived in an apartment with 4 guys last semester, and it was the worst fucking semester I've ever had. All of these men lived in their rooms at all times. Nobody ever hung out in the kitchen, and as much as I tried and be out in the kitchen, they would just walk in and out and just go back to their rooms. All 4 of us were never in the same place at the same time. One guy was so foreign that I'd ask him questions where you needed to respond elaborately but he'd just look at me and say: ""Yeah."" 

Guy 2 was a very awkward nerdy guy. I had a friend stay at my apartment when I wasn't there because he was going to an event that took place in the city where I lived in. My friend starts making macaroni and cheese in the kitchen and guy #2 comes out into the kitchen and looks at my friend. My friend says ""Hey man, what's up?"" but my roommate simply looks at him, then straight down, goes to the fridge, fills out two water bottles and goes back to his room. He didn't say a word. 

Guy #3 was simply the worst. He was just plain ol' *weird.* This guy would eat peanut butter sandwiches all the time. But when he used the knife to scoop the peanut butter, he'd use the **WHOLE THING.** As in the HANDLE would get dirty, and then leave the knives either in the sink in quantities of 7-8 or around the counter. Peanut butter is such a pain in the ass to clean. 

The fridge had dead fruit flies in it, and once I opened a cabinet that had rotten vegetables and an amount of easily *thirty* fruit flies or more started flying out. I almost vommited.

I moved out ASAP.","1341111561"

They have all built a shrine

And do a strange wail and

Worship.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I guess the problem is, based on normal uses of satire(since apparently I'm not the only one confused) the joke suggest homosexuality IS a choice. The video explores the silliness that one might fix Christianity, as though it were genetic, to seemingly satirize the absurdity that Homosexuality were genetic. 

Now I understand this is a complicated switched satire where they mock treating Homosexuality as if it were a choice, like Christianity, by proposing treating Christians as though their religiousness were genetic, like homosexuality. I see what they're doing, it's just that their joke, even if it's not the intention, implies something entirely counterproductive for those who don't know better: that homosexuality isn't genetic.

edit: age seems most likely between 12 and 18 from these explanations, with the traditional answer of  9 being somewhat suspect and the age of 21 being on the extreme end of the possible. I suspect the traditional understanding of 6 at betrothal and 9 for consummation is because it is the only tradition that explicitly says the age and because the in the pre-industrial time it was acceptable, they saw no reason to question it since it was rated an authentic chain of transmittance.

"steampunk","t5_2qhz8","a good first try.  But ill give you some pointers for your next set

First:  Before you do any painting project, you need to prime,  from your mid process shot it looks like you went right to color, priming is vital to quality.  It gives you a even blank slate, it adds depth to the colors over it, and primer is designed to hold paint, so your paint job will last longer.  Primer is different from spray paint chemically, so make sure your buying Primer, not just black/white spray paint

Second: Do not use spray paint for your brass color.  it always looks to uniform, and ruins the look, it lacks depth and character.  Look up a technique called ""Dry Brushing""  And when you do dry brush, know that brass has a grain to it, so you need to do all your brush strokes in one direction.

Third: Mix and match your color schemes.  All one color washes out any detail and makes things look boring.  Make the body one color, makes the lens holders look like make form a different medium &lt; be it metal or wood or leather, all can be made easily with paint, and some tutorials on YouTube &gt;

Last: Similar to above, Steampunk is all about personalizing, and accessorizing.  One poster joked you didn't glue gears on, but to some extent he/she is correct.  add gears, or wiring, or tubing, use leather or ribbon as the straps.  The key is to know when to stop.  now much to to much, or what is not enough - and that comes form having a good eye ... which comes form experience.

Keep at it, no one hits a home run the first time :D","1341111587"

See if he can come up with something to reassure you.  Just make sure he knows ""I trust you, it's a me thing.""  Just, don't expect/ask him to change his behavior, he shouldn't, he's done nothing wrong.  Just he can help by coming up with ways to reassure you.  Come up with some yourself.  Little things like ""Can you send me a sweet text or email out of the blue just time to time"".  Things like that can go a LONG way to squashing jealousy.  

Also, a little jealousy (not a destructive amount of it, just a little) isn't a bad thing.  I get a little jealous when my g/f is around some guys.  But she likes it, it makes her feel wanted.  She feels jealous when i'm around some women.  I like it, it makes me feel ""Hey, she values me and still sees me as a great catch"".  Just as I do her.

"running","t5_2qlit","I live in the desert so I'm used to running in 100+ degree heat. Wednesday I kicked ass on my cycling commute home and then decided I'd go right back out for a 4 mile run. Even though I drank some (but probably not enough) on the bike and chugged 30 ounces of water between the two the heat still caught up to me. I never even really felt hot, but I had zero energy and I think maybe I had even stopped sweating by the end of it which is a bad sign.

Real nasty things I can think of... concentrated hydrofluoric acid is a common one, HF is lipid-soluble so it will dissolve deep into your tissues and you don't immediately feel a ""burn"". The fluoride ions react with the calcium in your bones and melt them. Supposedly one of our profs had to work with conc HF for a long time and had a syringe of calcium gluconate nearby at all times in case of a burn; if injected quickly, the calcium will sequester the F- before it gets to your bones.

"aww","t5_2qh1o","Having worked with wolves, wolf mixes, and dogs in decidedly equal parts and I just wanted to pop in to say that - they're all different.  For every person that swears by their ""pure bred wolf"" being the best and most loyal pet they ever had, theres another saying they'll kill you in your sleep.

I find that it's part genetics, part training, and they're both important, but very subtle.  Because wolves are genetically predisposed to having high prey drive, and relatively low defense drive, they don't make great pets.  Excellent survivalists, but not so great as companions.  Because most of the dogs that are crossed with wolves (Shepherds, 'Mutes, and the like) have relatively low prey drive* and high defense drive - they make more stable companions, but don't generally do so well surviving in the wild on their own.  When you cross these two things together you can get all sorts of outputs.  

The asterisk on prey drive re: dogs, indicates extreme variables.  Drive in dogs is a big topic to cover.

My point is, as a rule, people shouldn't consider wolves or wolf-hybrids as pets, because that's what dogs are for.  People expended a great amount of time and energy breeding dogs that would best acclimate to living with people - and dogs evolved well because of it, in terms of their past-times, trainability, motivation, and drives.  Wolves spent the latter amount of their time evolving to avoid people, and the mixture of what you can get when you cross the two is too extreme to generalize.  There are good and bad examples of dogs, wolves, and hybrids, but I don't feel that people can provide well enough for the average wolf or wolf hybrid, so I strongly advocate dogs as pets and wolves left as they are.

I thought it was AWFUL. jeffrey dean morgan was a horrible person just to be horrible, the owl man and the girl had a hilariously bad sex scene that just went on and on, rosharch was probably the best, even though he was cynical at least he was interesting.

the graphics and the acting were pretty good. it's the characters I didn't give a shit about. I hope in the novel they were better crafted because there was no motivation for me to like any of them.

I apologize that the disclaimer isn't that visible, so I'm working on adding it in as a pop-up to the videos themselves that explains things.

I'd also like to point out that part of the humor of my videos is that a lot of these phrases just don't translate. Some of the phrases are English idioms to start with, so they don't make literal sense, and then attempting to put that into ASL just fails miserably. They're not the same language, they don't have the same structure, and that's somewhat the point. I think my hearing viewers understand that this is word salad, and it's not supposed to be very effective but it's still entertaining. I'd like to compare it to Engrish. Do we feel like the English language is being compromised when the Japanese (or even a translation website like Google Translate or Babelfish) incorrectly translates a sentence?

Um, no.

Health insurance (depending on the plan, obvs) also covers preventative care - check-ups and the like - more often than not with co-pays, but still, it ends up being far more affordable than paying cash for that same check-up visit.

Part of the whole everyone-have-insurance thing is to do with reducing the amount of uninsured people going to the ER for treatment, in two ways: 1) If they go to the ER for normal ER-related issues, they're covered, reducing the amount of hospital costs that the rest of us, collectively, have to cover; and 2) Having insurance means people are more likely to go to the doctor for check-ups (because it's cheaper with coverage), and to get *earlier* treatment illnesses, decreasing the amount of people with illnesses getting worse and worse until they can't take it anymore and go to the ER. 

There's also the trickle-down benefit of an overall healthier population, or more specifically, *workforce* leading to fewer days of folks taking off due to illnesses, which means increased productivity, GDP, yadda yadda.","1341111609"

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","I'm struggling to accept you're an artist with opinions such as yours.  If you're not an artist then I'm not sure what you're doing criticising how people build up their knowledge and artistic repertoire when reference art is one of the absolute staples in learning art in a traditional medium. 

A good number of artists rely on references for drawing, that's why life study is so important to them.  That's why they spend hours drawing life art models, why they have wooden mannequins on their desk that they can put into various poses to reference off, why they may also have anatomy, muscle tissue and bone mannequins also adorning their desk for reference. 

You do these things so that in time, you're able to carry on without them.  However, that should absolutely not discredit referenced work in the least.  Putting something to paper and having it look very much like the referenced image can also be very difficult. 

I'm just not sure how you can blindly label it as ""copying"" and disregarding the blatant talent or hard work that's gone into it.","1341111613"

I have training myself, and have stuck many people (including myself for 'practice' in class). It isn't really that difficult of a thing to do. I was the favorite 'practice dummy' in class since I have pretty HUGE veins really close to the surface and a fairly high tolerance to pain.  (I don't know if people still practice on each other in class, but this was about 25 years ago before realistic practice dummies, so we all got a good set of track marks before the class was over!) 

The last time I donated, the person there fished around for minutes before hitting a vein, using what felt like a needle that had been dulled on sandpaper first. :( When she finally got it in, it hurt like hell. At several points during the ordeal, I just wanted to grab the needle from her and do it myself.  

I know, this was a 'one time' thing, but my inclination to donate was pretty weak already, and after this I just couldn't bring myself to go any more. ","1341111615"

(Kingsbury Agreement) What about when the government partially nationalized AT&amp;T (which was welcomed warmly by executives) during WWI resulting in AT&amp;T being free to utilize massive price increases? Nevermind that the FCC was given the power to regulate the prices and competition of the entire telecommunications industry in the 30s. It just so happened that in the the 30s the attitude was that the industry is most efficient as a monopoly, so the FCC DENIED new competitors to the industry, effectively sealing the deal of AT&amp;T being a monoply. By then the telecommunications industry had become a political tool. 

Yes, in US v. AT&amp;T the US Federal Gov. broke up the monopoly. Now people like you point to the case as if it has some sort of significance in validating the 'valiant' efforts of the government. But AT&amp;T only achieved it's market position through decades of consistent government intervention and favoritism. So no. Try again. ","1341111616"

""In Plain English: The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.""","1341111635"

When the Bible came along, while it was reforming many things, it reformed the sexual act as being mainly utilitarian, of a male-female family. He calls it ""Judaism's sexual revolution"".

I've seen many GS500's on Craigslist in my area. 

Since you've got a couple months before you take your test, you don't need to rush out and buy the first bike you see. Keep your ear to the ground, when the right bike comes by, you'll know it. That's how I got my R6. I looked for 3 weeks at every 600 for sale, finally late one night the seller posted it on Craigslist. I called him at 8 the next morning and arranged a viewing. When I saw it I could just tell it was a perfect fit for me. It still is. ","1341111667"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Firstly - thanks heaps for your concern. I really appreciate it as I wasn't quite sure if this was a good idea myself.

My therapist did say to do this along with mindfulness meditation. 

Now I'm quite worried. My problem has been that I used to never, EVER get triggers and ever since an incident about six months ago where someone betrayed my trust in the bedroom, it's begun happening and slowly getting worse. Do you know if there's a source I can look up for more information about this?

I google stalked him and he seemed like a legitimate psychologist, but I'm not sure if sexual abuse is his forte. His focus tends to be in marriage counselling, eating disorders, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. When I told him I was abused he immediately asked me if I had body image issues - I guess maybe he was hoping it would dovetail more into one of his specialities?

I'm not sure how easy it would be for me to change psychologists as I'm getting access to him for free through my work (he usually costs $150 a session!). ","1341111668"

That said, all of the arguments regarding police and prison space still stand and it obviously should be. I'm just not as hopeful as most other people seem to be about the right thing happening in a nation controlled by money.

That's why I said ""Militant *here* (meaning *in this case*) denotes very strongly held beliefs.  That doesn't mean that militant can't have other meanings.  I don't call that having a double standard, I call that language comprehension.  I think the reason why some people object to the bloggers usage of the term ""militant atheist"" is because they feel he was somehow implying that r/atheism is some type of secular equivalent to Al-Qaida.

"keto","t5_2rske","Yes, I did say, because that is what the research says. Did you even bother to read the abstract posted? Simply working a muscle to failure promotes hypertrophy, not just the amount of weight on it. If you have an issue with the science, explain that, don't just throw out completely anecdotal quips that you think support your views.

Theoretically, a bodybuilder COULD get that big using low weight/high reps, but it isn't efficient at their level. The time it would take to work a muscle to failure using a low weight would get longer and longer as muscle efficiency increased. Im not sure why this is so difficult to understand and people are downvoting it. The research is plain as day, not difficult to understand, and recent ... as in a few month's recent. What is so hard about this? FAILURE causes muscle growth. Whether it is 10 lbs bar or 110 lbs. Muscle breaks down, rebuilds bigger and stronger, repeat.

I've just graduated from a UK pharmacy school and have spent six months so far in community pharmacy, where we already have a class of medicines called [P] medicines (they may only be sold in a pharmacy). Some of these are available after extremely basic questions on potential interactions and the like from counter staff, while others such as levonorgestrel, simvastatin, sumatriptan or tamsulosin are only available after a consultation and questionnaire by a pharmacist. The suggestion that you would get paid for said consultation for any one of those medications is slightly bewildering to me: it is part of a UK community pharmacist's job and therefore part of their salary, paid by their employer. The employer (or the pharmacist if they own the pharmacy) benefits from the fact that the drugs attract a higher direct profit to the pharmacy (between £4 and £15 or so) than comparable items on prescription (generally £0.90 per item). 


If nothing else...how can you get paid for a consultation when there's no authority to bill except the customer? Isn't the price of the item supposed to cover whatever you have to do to sell it?","1341111698"

The supply of oil is no where close to the bottom of the barrel, despite what mainstream media believes.  
As for the major itself.  I find it to be incredibly interesting.  I will not lie that the money you make when you graduate will be more than all other majors off the bat [My university has a 95% job placement rate, and the bottom 10% have 90k salaries].

He just figured if he made me do it, I'd ""get over it"".

Clearly I didn't get over it, and his attitude prevented me from going to therapy for a long time since I figured that I just needed to deal with it. Thankfully he is more understanding now.

That being said, isn't it obvious that a religion major in college is clearly not brainwashing? In you're writing a paper on this, first think about what you think brainwashing is and then say how religious education may or may not meet the criteria you outline for brainwashing. It would be very untenable to say that *all* religious education is brainwashing, but Jesus Camp is a different story. Also, you could even outline some criteria for what counts as education (which may end up revealing that education ""proper"" never brainwashes). Then you could ask whether Jesus Camp even counts as religious education.

Also, losing 500ml of blood, if you're a 130 pound person, that could mean losing 15% of your blood volume, which is definitely not a small amount.

The thing is, when you're healthy and young, and male, losing 500ml of blood usually isn't a big deal because your body can handle the loss and compensate by increasing vasoconstriction, heart rate, heart contractility, etc. But when you're older and/or female, and/or drunk, it gets much harder to compensate for a significant loss of blood volume.

I certainly don't like the court's decision that, ahem, ""corporations are people"", but the constitution gives the court the power to make those decisions. So for all intents and purposes, the healthcare bill has been upheld as constitutional, and was voted in legally in the first place. 

Now, if we're going to get into things the fed shouldn't have the power to do, we might start with revoking civil liberties, enforcing morals and compulsory religious practices.

3. I've asked my parents if there has been depression running through our family and got vague answers from my mother like she was trying to keep me away from it / cover it up. So I think there is a slight hereditary aspect to my case maybe. More likely it is the environment I grew up and the perspectives I learn from living in such situations that cause we to grow up like this. 

4. It's pretty hard, I always knew I was sensitive at an early age. My attention was hyper in that I could analyse things very rapidly and think. I embraced thinking as I saw it as a positive trait to have, taught from my father. Little did I know, this thinking became obsessive and my championing of it left an imbalance to the rest of my life (socialising.) I used it as a defense mechanism to make myself seem smarter than others and saw socialising as a waste of time when we could be using our intelligence to make the world a better place. Once or twice I got my ears pulled for being naughty and though this was in no way near as abusive as other people's case, my sensitivity to things exaggerates and emphasizes feelings of hurt, hapiness, whatever - thinking too much really.

"law","t5_2qh9k","I am not a lawyer, no attorney-client relationship between us exists. Everything here is a recitation of general principles of law and is not meant to apply to any specific situation.

Nobody can tell you if it's a breach (not breech) of contract without knowing the specific contract terms. 

That being said, it'd be a pretty unusual contract where one party attempts to repudiate future performance and the OTHER party is in breach.

Breach does not make a contract void. Material breach CAN discharge one parties' duty to perform. A temporary outage at a call center when someone is attempting to repudiate the contract isn't likely to be a material breach, though it might under some certain set of facts.

All of that being said, please read the sidebar. If you want actual legal advice that pertains to your situation, this is not the place for it.

"Epilepsy","t5_2s1h9","You might also consider asking your doctors if the pregnancy hormones might also be impacting your seizure frequency at this stage. It's possible that after delivery, the changes in your body might help return things to something more like you were experiencing 33 weeks ago.

While I was going through rough periods with sorting out my seizures, I worked part time as a substitute teacher. I set my own schedule and only worked days when I felt healthy enough to do that. I think to some extent, that helped me feel like I had more control over my own life. Overall, feeling like I'm in as much control over my life and health as possible really does help mitigate the helpless feelings of not knowing when/if I'll have another seizure. I'm also lucky to have a very supportive husband and family.

As far as talking to your daughter about it, I don't really have any experience in explaining it to kids, I'm afraid. Maybe when she's old enough to learn about calling 911, explain that she could do that if you start having a seizure and she's alone with you in the house though.","1341111733"

Find a goal with your life/career and work towards that. Every minute spent PMO or gaming is a minute wasted and makes it longer for you to reach your goal.

I still waste a lot of time just doing nothing, but nowhere near as close to when i was gaming.

Only told one where he met some kind of combat. Kamikaze planes were coming in and in the rush to battle stations he came to a narrow corridor and two higher officers were coming down the way, and the only place for him to get out of the way was into a bathroom stall....saved his life as the place hit right then and close enough that he got some shrapnel to his ass and one leg. Think everyone in my family can tell his stories verbatem. However on the other side of the family, my other grandfather was in Korea and he has never said a word about it. I even asked my dad and his siblings and they all said with straight looks that 'no, Dad doesn't talk about it.'

"breastfeeding","t5_2rdj4","Yeah the lack of time makes anything difficult. Getting a good cookbook like [Paleo Comfort Foods](http://paleocomfortfoods.com/blog/) is a good place to start. Start small. Eat a paleo breakfast. That is a simple meal to make. This is what I had this morning and it took me 10 minuted to prepare. Bacon, scrambled eggs, an avocado, frozen blueberries with coconut milk on top (straight from the can. It freezes on them and is delicious). Then for a snack have some nuts, fruit and veggie sticks. That takes care of the first portion of the day. Do a paleo breakfast and snack for a few week until you get the hang of it. Then make lunch paleo. After you are comfortable with those two meals then the last is dinner. I don't have much time to cook so I do a lot of things like pot roast. I get a some beef put salt and pepper on it, stick it in the oven set the timer (that way if I am busy with the kids my hubby will know to get it out of the oven). Boil some frozen veggies. Serious minimal cooking. It doesn't have to be complicated (from scratch) to be healthy. Crock pot meals are great (30 nights of [crock pot](http://hollywouldifshecould.net/2011/11/a-month-of-paleo-crockpot-recipes/) meals). If I know that I am going to be out all day and will be to tired to cook dinner when I get home I will throw what ever meat we have in the crock pot (frozen or not) some chicken stock, veggies, some spices and 9 times out of 10 its great. You can get healthy hot dogs, and sausages. Eggs are great, for any meal. Lunch, a couple hard boiled eggs (I hard boil a dozen or two when I get home from the store and have them ready in the frig.) some salad mix, and a can of tuna. No cooking involved. 

**I DON'T EXERCISE!** I'm not saying that like I'm proud of it. I just don't have the time. I got one of those pedometer apps on my phone and just doing things with my kids and staying on my feet all day with house work I am walking 2-5 miles a day. I'm ok with that. One every week or two I get a burst of energy and do sit ups or push ups. I don't stress over it. If it happens, it happens. I concentrate on eating healthy food. It sets up healthy eating habits for my kids and keeps me feeling good. 

As far as the drinks go....I drink, water, coconut milk, coconut water, tea (I don't like coffee). During the summers when it gets hot and I want something fizzy I get seltzer water and add sliced frozen fruits/berries. A refreshing light summery drink. What do you drink? ","1341111759"
"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","It can also depend on whether you are clearly identified as a woman, and discussing women-oriented issues. I almost never see this unless my gender is specifically mentioned or the thread is about access to birth control, sexual assault, etc.","1341111759"
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I still dont think she'll be a top pick. That by no means that she is a bad champion, but the top picks usually bring something unique to teamfights. Karthus has immense AoE dmg, Morgana has one of the best AoE CC's to protect your AD carry, Ryze does ridiculous damage while being tanky, etc. Lux brings nothing special (except ult to steal buffs/dragon/baron) that other top mages cannot. As Jatt put it, she is risky, dependent on landing a full combo. For a top pick, there is no reason to risk missing a combo with Lux while you can click and hit all your spells with Ryze.","1341111759"
"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","If you want the best experience, play through them in order.  That's Prophecies -&gt; Factions -&gt; Nightfall -&gt; Eye of the North.  Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall are all standalone campaigns.  You can start characters in each of them, and transfer foreign characters to them (they each take place on a different continent).  The foreign characters start the storyline slightly ahead of the natives, but the story doesn't suffer for it for the most part.  Factions is the only campaign where you can create Assassins and Ritualists, and Nightfall gives you Dervishes and Paragons.  Eye of the North is a more traditional expansion, which you can go to upon reaching level 10 and require at least one of the other three campaigns to play.

If you start with Prophecies and play through in order, the story will make the most sense as the games are basically sequential, although mostly independent.  Also, Prophecies levels you up at a much slower pace than the other two--you'll hit level 20 about 2/3 through that campaign, wheras in Factions and Nightfall you're level 20 before the ""main"" plotline (where foreigners enter), which is fairly early on.  Personally, I feel the slower leveling speed makes it easier to get the hang of things.

However, if you're playing just to grind out Hall of Monuments rewards, you may want to find a guide for that, which will usually suggest you start in Nightfall or Factions.","1341111759"
"skyrim","t5_2s837","Well, for one thing, they claim to desire the wiping out of beings who are non-mer and/or have philosophies differing from there own. Now, this in and of itself might be reason enough to hate the Aldmeri Dominion, but in reality their goal is far, far worse than that . . . 

[***THEY WANT TO UNCREATE FUCKING MUNDAS.***](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/v8q3p/what_is_the_goal_of_aldmeri_dominion/) The goal of the Aldmeri Dominion is to uncreate all of Mundas, which is the realm of existence where the planet Nirn, the continent of Tamriel, and the province of Skyrim are located. If the goal of destroying a realm of existence isn't enough reason to hate an organization of great power, then what is?

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I'm assuming you don't itemize deductions, or you'd probably have already encountered this problem. In my spreadsheet, I've got it structured so that there's a column that says whether the expense is deductible. I also show taxes. It sort of looks like (mine is laid out as columns instead of rows like yours):

* GROSS
* TAXES
* PAYCHECK DEDUCTIONS (insurance, etc.)
* MORTGAGE
* ELECTRIC
* etc.

I wouldn't worry about how it ""looks"" in terms of seeming like a pay cut -- you're the only consumer of this report, right? So you know the reasons for weird blips in the trends. (I actually have a column where I can leave a note when there is a blip so I remember what happened that month.)

One other thing: you mention that anything you *spend* from your HSA is tax-deducted from your paycheck. Not sure how your HSA is administered, but the way it works is that HSA contributions are tax-deductible like an IRA. When you spend money from your HSA on qualified medical expenses the withdrawal is tax free. I've never heard of HSA expenses (i.e. payments you make to providers) hitting your pay stub -- only the contributions.

1. S wants to avoid consequence Y.  

?. S should avoid the cause X.  

I have no problem with something like this, but this isn't what you're limiting yourself to:

1. X is something that causes Y.  (premise)  
2. Y is something S wants to avoid. (premise)  
3. X is something that causes something S wants to avoid. (substitution 1,2)  
4. If S avoids X, S avoids something that causes something S wants to avoid. (follows from 3)  

You have to show how we get should from want.  I don't think you can, as I've been saying, and that's because should relationships are a kind of relationship that don't fit in a naturalistic world.  If you can show otherwise, please do.  One way of doing that would be by providing a step by step going from a ""want"" premise to a ""should"" premise.  And for simplicity sake, feel free to ignore the consequence and effect if you like, and just go from wants X to should seek/do X or something like that.

And apart from the problem of demonstrating the existence of should relationships, your idea of should is going to essentially get us if you want it, you should do it.  If someone wants to avoid equal marriage rights, they should avoid voting for equal marriage rights?  If a slave-owner wants to keep his slaves, he shouldn't let them free?

I think they would by design and intention be specific to a machine (and therefore OS) and irrelevant to applications. An application just needs the file.. so it would get the hidden absolute path.. the OS would handle setting up and browsing virtual folders, and it could expose this to developers to use in apps if they wanted, but it wouldn't be necessary.

If I e-mail you a picture, I don't want you to know which virtual folders I have it in.. I just want you to have the file.

There are of course issues if the virtual folder info is stored in the file's meta data.. which I don't think makes sense. It makes more sense for the OS to maintain a database of that information. Which I'm sure poses other problems.. but.. since virtual folders would just be maintained on a single machine (maybe with additional import/export features) I think it would work.","1341111798"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Okay, first you need to make a distinction between character cohesion and player cohesion. A bunch of squabbling, petty, bickering and backstabbing *characters* can be good fun, if that's what the *players* want- but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

While the character's actions are ultimately only the player's call, everyone takes cues from the DM and if the player's aren't having fun it's his job to find some way to fix it. It sounds like everyone needs to gather together and discuss what exactly they want out of the game- and if there's big differences in player maturity level or expectations, or personal grudges, it may be best to split up the group.

I know that the dirty words are the first thing people tend to learn in a new language, so that's where I started. I also feel that being able to learn dirty sign language as opposed to regular conversational ASL helps to make the Deaf community more relatable, not bastardize or oppress them. By seeing that the Deaf also have vulgar things in their language, it gives something that hearing people can relate to. There's common ground that was unexpected. I know it's thinking outside the box a bit, but I still think it's effective. I've gotten a lot of comments from people that my videos are short and simple, but they still convey that this language is more complex than most hearing people think, especially when the ASL gloss is so different from the English phrase. That's exactly what I want to show people.","1341111809"
"Health","t5_2qh9z","If a hospital, say, quadrupled their prices, insurance companies would threaten to revoke their in-network status.  That would cost the hospital a considerable number of patients--especially if every major insurance provider did so.  In-network pricing lists are negotiated between insurance companies and the healthcare facility, which is why the same service costs different amounts depending on your insurance plan.  No insurance company would tolerate what you're suggesting.    
  
Medicare reimbursements are, of course, determined by the government, not the hospital.  
  
In the single case you mentioned below, I don't have a retort, but do not believe that such a circumstance constitutes a very large portion of the nation's healthcare infrastructure.  It sounds like they wouldn't keep clients very long if they were raising costs of care for their own insurance subscribers.... the patients could just go to BCBS, Aetna, or any one of the many other providers in the country.","1341111809"

That said, a common critique of feminism (not women's rights) is that it treats gendered rights as a zero sum game.  The position you come off as holding here is that we can't deal with circumcision because FGM is worse, is more important, and/or is more pressing.  No one is asking you to divert resources from fighting FGM.  What people do wonder, and this is why circumcision is such a rallying cry for the MRM, is why people are instantly revolted at the thought of performing surgery on an infant girl's genitals (even the analogous removal of the clitoral hood), but most have never considered not circumcising their sons.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I agree. Conservatism is being distorted by outlets like FOX. It's a shame, there are a lot of conservative principles that I think even some on the left might find appealing if there wasn't such hateful rhetoric coming from certain groups. In the end, most liberals choose to throw the baby out with the bath water because they are rightfully turned off by idiots on the far right that really are preaching for a despotic world that nobody in the vast middle wants to live in. 

If we could try to talk to each other without clinging to our preconceived notions about the other side, we might actually be able to craft a way forward that would allow people more freedom and would also account for many of the externalities that a free market system inherently creates. Things like environmental issues, education and poverty are issues that shouldn't be purely political, but I think people on the left believe that the only way to deal with these issues is through punitive legislation. 

In my experience, government regulations are really good at creating an expansive purview for the government and they are less than ideal when it comes to actually solving the problems that they were setting out to tackle in the first place. For example, do you know that there are more people working for the USDA than there are people working for farms? Or that there are already more than 82,000 pages of Federal banking regulations?

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I'm not sure I follow your logic. I think the simplest explanation, especially if ""nobody has ever lost an election for being to hard on drugs,"" is that our representatives are dependent on other forces than the people to get elected. 

It should be obvious that ""our representatives are dependent on the forces that get them elected"" requires less assumptions than ""Our representatives are dependent on the forces **other** than the ones that get them elected"". And that first one, the one that the author gets behind, is entirely plausible on its face. 

&gt; wouldn't provide those representatives with as many campaign contributions to make up for the lost contributions and attack ads from those organizations.

I'd need some reeeeaaaaally good convincing that PACs and such really care so much about pot. I mean, it really doesn't have much to do with a lot of established business interests that I can see. Maybe legalizing pot would make less people drink booze, maybe they'd take less- I dunno- Zoloft. Is that really enough for virtually no congressman to come out pro-pot? 

Think about how much astronomical dough oil companies, insurance companies, banks, whatever are willing to drench politicians with. Other politicians still oppose them regularly and can still afford to campaign. 

&gt; Targeted by whom? Step out in front of what?

Targeted by their electoral opponent. The fear of being labeled ""soft on drugs"", exactly like the author says. I thought that was obvious. 

To me, it's like your trying really hard to avoid the obvious so the story can fit your biased framing. The story you're telling probably happens sometimes, but I can't imagine that so many firms are going to lose so much by pot that they buy literally every politician in the country.

My step-grandmother got cancer just prior to medicare and it bankrupted the family. Literally lost the farm. Nowadays, regular people can be spared that tragedy and can keep contributing to society, I believe, outweighing the marginal loss that the wealthy have to pay in higher taxes. So the doctor may not be 'free' in what's come to be known as the 'financial liberty' sense, but is more economically 'free' from more volatile business cycles caused by the endemic financial problems of the middle class.

Sadly they were graduating, so I decided to start my own group with my classmates. I've never been one for large social gatherings that rest of my school was into, so getting together on the weekends with a few friends and playing for hours was amazing. These people that I hung out with became my closest friends (And, as a bonus, because of D&amp;D I actually got to meet back up with all my senior friends from freshman year), so D&amp;D means a lot to me, it really made who I am today.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In my first year of university, I lived in a double room (a room with 2 people in it). My roommate was a really nice guy and we had absolutely no problems with each other but he had this one little thing. Before we get to that we need some backstory. My roommate never slept in the room. He was either with his girlfriend or in another friend's room. He maybe slept in our room for 5 nights out of the 8 months I lived with him. So anyways, his one little thing. Every morning, between 3 and 4 am, he would come into the room collect a few things and then leave. Every time  he woke me up, although I usually fell right back asleep. I have no clue why he always came back at this time, but without fail, every morning he would come in, turn the light on (that one pissed me off, told him off a few times too with that), and rifle through his stuff and then leave. Really nice guy though.

I also love the design of the Nexus 7. Here's the issue, at $250, I might as well  save the promotion for a more expensive device in the future; however, the Asus Transformer Infinity, at $500, could be reduced to the same price as the Nexus 7 with twice the internal storage, and a heap of other features.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","The Raimi spider-mans were good for what they were. However I have a huge list on why they weren't good Spider-man movies. 

Toby Maguire is a great Peter Parker, but he is a terribly boring and unfunny Spider-Man. So much of that character is about Spider-man cracking jokes and being loud and obnoxious druing fights, and the Spider-Man movies completely lost that.

Jumping into the MJ lovefest that was in the original trilogy betrayed the character. Gwen Stacy is so important to the character, and what happens to Gwen and her father greatly affects the character. 

The Green Goblin outfit looked fucking retarded.

""Hey Look, it's Macy Grey in this scene. This totally isn't a Sony movie.""

Inconsistency: Spider-man can stop a moving train, or hold up a giant brick wall, but Doctor Octopus somehow doesn't have multiple concussions and a caved in skull by taking full punches from Spider-Man.

Spider-man 2's ""I lost my powers because of psychology"". No. That story arc was so great in the comics because he made a conscious decision to stop being Spider-Man. It was such an annoying and blatant rip-off of Superman 2's loss of powers, to simply make a statement. Spider-man doesn't just lose his powers because he secretly doesn't want them. That is dumb.

Some other stuff too. Killing off Doc Oc is also a huge annoyance to me, right up there with Tim Burton killing off the joker in Batman. Just somethign you should never do. Spider-man 3 mishandled all of the villains in their own way. ","1341111852"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; It's a laziness

I fail to see how writing a realloc container is lazier than using std::vector, or even rolling your own new+delete container. Placement new + calling destructors directly is trickier (or at least more obscure) than a for-loop copy.

&gt; and in fact when it fails will crash your code

Most things that fail will crash your code. realloc's gotcha is manual construction and destruction of objects. Outside of that, the same extreme caveats apply to eg new, such as running out of memory.

&gt; If you need X size, allocate X size. If you need Y size later, deallocate X Size, and allocate Y.

What if you only need one extra Y, and Size is absolutely massive, and the copy constructor is very complex? Yes, this is *very* rarely a concern. But that doesn't mean it's never useful. Google, for instance, tends to use a lot of non-standard algorithms because of the massive scale of their applications. Being able to specialize when you need to (and perhaps more importantly to know when you should) are hallmarks of a true expert.

&gt; Reallocate isn't horrible, but there's only a very small amount of time you want to use it.

I agree completely. Outside of very specialized containers for very specific purposes, it isn't too useful.","1341111857"

I've looked on care.com and local parenting email lists. Boston is an expensive place to live; even nannies need to earn enough money to pay rent. And of course, if you're paying the nanny legally, you need to pay payroll taxes in addition to salary.

If you want to talk expensive, I know a family that hired a nanny through a nanny search service -- and they eventually switched to a $2300/month daycare because the nanny was too expensive. And that was for *one* baby.","1341111865"

Not only will it save your life from potential ganks, but will give you a huge advantage over the other team if they aren't paying attention to it.  It can set you up for ganks, allow you to push an empty lane (ex: if their whole team is pushing mid, put pressure on side lane), and help other teammates by calling out mias or important objectives (i.e. gold fury, fire giant).  Speaking of the mini map, you should also get in the habit of buying wards and placing them at main jungle conjunctions and objectives.  If everyone on your team does these things, then you are likely to win.","1341111873"

"networking","t5_2qkaf","Since you're discussing spending money, I'm assuming you're buying a VM from a company and not running a hypervisor yourself.  Both pieces of software are free (unless you buy vendor supported Virtuozzo/XenServer).

Xen is true virtualization; unless you're running a paravirtualized OS your machine is completely isolated from the host and any other VM's.  It is impossiable to oversell physical RAM with xen so when you buy 512MB of RAM on a VM, you're getting 512MB of physical RAM.  It is somewhat possible to oversell CPU time although Xen has a pretty fair scheduler and it's fairly rare that every VM will be using 100% CPU allocation 100% of the time. 

OpenVZ on the other hand is more of an elaborate chroot/freebsd jail type 'container' (as they call them).  You use whatever kernel is on the host and effectively run all the processes on such, with OpenVZ there to limit which containers have access to which processes.  While your RAM can grow with a balloon driver on OpenVZ as needed, physical RAM on an OpenVZ box is often *highly* oversold so you may find yourself reliant on host swap without really knowing such.  If your neighbors are running a highly CPU intensive task for several hours, you'll notice it.  Also depending on the version of OpenVZ you may be running on it may be fairly trivial to escape out of your container for full host access.

Xen is your better bet.","1341111888"

His room is next to mine and his bed always hits the wall and wakes me up/disturbs me. He has gone as far to say to get earplugs because it is his house and all that jazz. 

Normally I am the perfect room mate, but I decided that if he is going to be inconsiderate, so will I. However, I wish I could tell that to his face when we argue but I am afraid he will kick me out and I don't know anyone else in town :( 

I am extremely clean. Once he asked me to clean the bathroom and I did a half assed job at it (which is still pretty clean at my standards) and then later rants at me for doing a poor job.

You realize that the nationalization of natural resources in the past, land and mineral rights specifically, is what makes land/home ownership so expensive right? It also puts people with political connections in a better footing instead of those providing legitimate services or those that owned the land first.

Look at corruption with the homesteading act not to mention that people couldn't just go out and improve the land but instead had to have permission first to improve the land and therefore own it.

&gt;State systems are more effective than markets in the management of natural resources and benefit the citizens of the state more.

I'd like to refer you to [this](http://www.thefreemanonline.org/headline/property-rights-arent-always-the-libertarian-solution/). Markets might not be the best option, although then again maybe they are in some cases, but the state is never a good option. Voluntary trumps force.

Yet, within capitalist systems, you see all sorts of forms of labor that have little to no market value yet are filled with people making a life-time commitment out of it, such as what you see in education. 

The idea that people only act out of motivation for material profit doesn't hold up to the evidence (see video), and if you think it through, you can imagine a world were you worked because you believed in what you were doing.

The plan the tories have described is a black box (maybe directly under google's control?) which returns the message headers and not the content. The ISP is then required to log them and turn them over given a legal request. I imagine google would consider this request a lot more palatable. 

I've not seen anything officially mention SSL at all in regard to having private keys in the box. The ISP's logger could just request all headers for any messages sent from certain IPs on a daily basis. They know the IPs of their subscriber base, the black box would just phone home to google HQ and authenticate itself, if it's allowed to know about that IP range's messages then it gets the data. Secure, efficient in a batch operation and no need to do any messing around giving people private SSL keys.","1341111911"

I understood some things weren't meant to be handled by free markets, and that some things only came about because of ""wasted spending by the public sector"".

I find market socialism to be the closest to my beliefs in terms of economics. Public goods(healthcare, national defense, roads, power grids etc) are all subject to socialist rules. While private goods are on a free market, that is one that allows supply and demand set prices, there would always be pollution regulation, because the air and water is a public good. In basic function(not idealistic terms mind you, idealism never works) its how China has created such huge growth. They opened up some markets and took ownership of others, and made the right public investments. Now, they're not good on civil liberties or the like, so don't go thinking, ""I want China"", but I wouldn't mind ""First World Freedoms"" applied to a system like China's economy.

Cie'th:  Shambling monsters that were L'cie who failed their focus.

Battle system:  Commandos do more damage than Ravagers, but Ravagers are able to hit enemy weaknesses.   There is also a bar in the upper right corner of the screen for every monster.  Filling this up will cause the Break effect, and monsters will take more damage, can be launched/juggled in the air so they cannot attack, or will remove defenses.  It decreases as the battle goes along and is refilled when the enemy is hit.  Ravagers increase the size of the bar and Commandos decrease the rate and which it decreases, so the standard battle setup is going to be 1 Commando with 1 or 2 Ravagers.

That said, the show also ended with a whole bunch of spinning sequel plates (or, as the ANN link notes, movie) in the air, starting with the previous revelation, Quartz getting away, and the fact that the system's pirates have now demonstrated that they can function together again as a unified fighting force.

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","My fiancé never had pets growing up, just a dog, a fish, and his current dog. I had just about everything as my dad brought them home after summer camps were over (he was a teacher). My fiancé's first interaction with a rat was when he was 3, seeing one come up from the sewer. So he was pretty freaked out by them when he met me. The way it stands now is that he doesn't like the way they feel on him but he loves how much I love them and respects how much they mean to me. The rats are in the bedroom which is OK (so long as I don't let the cage get too dirty- pe-u!) and I've gotten through many difficult conversations with him by interacting with my rats simultaneously. I don't try to change his view on rats and he never says or thinks anything negative about them. It's just not his cup of tea. But he's very supportive and when we were told absolutely no small animals in the apartment we're dreaming of, he immediately told me of some plans to sneak them in. In a way, I like that they're just my special little darlings although I would never be upset if he one day just started playing with them. 

Sorry for the rant, it's a subject on two of the most important things to me. Plus, I seem to have a different opinion. In the end, my fluffy poop machines are always welcome, even if he can't understand the simple pleasure of a rat chattering in your ear while you read a good book. ^.^

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; I don't see why the truth of a proposition has anything to do with the expression of the proposition.

It isn't the mere expression of the problem.  If you are engaging in a performative contradiction, then you have falsified your statement already.  If all objections to the original statement falsify themselves, there are two options - declare that it is false anyway (for some unknown reason that cannot be defined) or accept it as true.  The former, while possible, is not logical.

&gt;I don't know to what extent this formal, logical, mathematical result applies to ""real life"" logic

Virtually not at all.  For one, the first is basically a mathematical version of the liar paradox - the statement is ""Theorem G cannot be proved in theory T"".  Thus, T is ""incomplete"" - it cannot prove this statement, and yet the statement is thus true.  (If the theory were complete, this statement would be a performative contradiction.)

The second is basically the statement that Theory A cannot prove itself to be consistent without actually being inconsistent.

Both are limited to theories based upon the set of natural numbers.  These have no bearing on the question.

It can be easily parallelized on the GPU. This is an alternative to simple triangle rasterization, which is what OpenGL and Direct3D do.

Raytracing involves raycasting, but does so in multiple forms (primary rays, shadow rays, reflection, refraction, etc.), and it uses the information obtained via raycasting to determine accurate lighting and color. This is much more expensive, since it cannot be easily parallelized.

TL;DR raycasting calculates distance, raytracing calculates color.","1341111982"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The very end of Chinatown.

Chinatown, up until this point, was a pretty straight noir story.  Jack Nicholson perfectly played the wisecracking private detective with loose morals but a heart of gold deep down to perfection.  There were villainous powers above, beautiful women in need of saving, a mystery that was unraveled *just* in time!  Everything leads you to believe it will end as all noir films ultimately end- despite the darkness of the setting, the hero figures out the mystery, saves the girl, and goes back to his hardboiled life.  And he does figure out the mystery, in the nick of time.  And up until the end, I wasn't really sure why people call Chinatown one of the best movies ever made.

It takes a lot to really surprise me in a movie.  I've seen a lot of inversions of tropes, twist endings, so-called shocking finales.  I was not prepared for Chinatown.  I don't think I've seen a movie since that dares make a protagonist that fails so completely at saving the day, and is left staring catatonically into space.","1341111986"

It's still perfectly possible to have perfect CS, and the solo queue games don't move fast enough for 0.15 seconds to make a difference except in maybe a few rare situations in which case somebody with low ping might have screwed up anyway.","1341112003"

So they are a *little* more cautious than the states now. Because they don't want to end up like the arab spring leaders.

While gov money ain't real, a broken system with starving people on the other hand is real. And will cause small issues like revolutions.

I think that's the difference between us Europeans and the states. We try to avoid the wall while we still can. You, for your part, run ahead hoping it will hold till your old/dead, and fuck off the next generation. It's not viable, even in the short term :/ Your country IS gonna explode, sooner rather than latter(15/20y ?). Brutally, when most people won't be able to eat and pay their mortgage/rent simultaneously. 

Just look at Greece : The only reason the riots stopped was because the other european states paid a big chunk of their most absurd debts. Enough so everyone can eat and stay at home.

The smushIt page seems to be down, but I'll try that too. Maybe I'll just decrease the dimensions, since it is blurry anyways and it will be streched to the width of the viewport.

The mobile css query is a good call, I'll do that.
I've tried to optimize some of the images (just to try out TinyPNG) and I plan to make sprites (I'll see how IE plays with them, If I recall correctly there are some problems with the background-position)

This, in turn, leads to the treatment of acute issues (say, diabetes or heart disease) rather than the mitigation of chronic ones (obesity, hypertension.)

As a Canadian this seems to be the biggest issue: short-term cost-controls lead to long-term cost overruns. But that's a small price to pay for decency and health care as a fundamental right, IMHO.","1341112024"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Actually, f-stops are geometrical - determined as the ratio of the entrance pupil diameter and the focal length.  However, each air/glass interface in a lens will reflect some light back instead of passing it through, and some light actually gets lost inside the glass.  As a result, the actual amount of light that makes it through a lens will depend to significant extent on the number of elements in its design (more elements, more air/glass interfaces) as well as the type of glass and coatings used, but will *always* be less than 100%, and not necessarily match between lenses even at the same focal length and aperture.  This has nothing to do with bad manufacturing - it's a limitation of physics - more elements means more light lost, even in the most expensive lenses, especially zooms, which often have to use more elements to correct various aberrations, at the tradeoff of ultimately passing through significantly less total light.

In cases where the exact amount of light and exposure matching between lenses is important - for example movie shooting where you might shoot the same scene with 2 different cameras and lenses that will be cut together - a different measure is used called [t-stop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number#T-stop).  Cine lenses are therefore usually marked in t-stops (or both)

F-stops however give you consistent depth of field - any two lenses at the same focal length and same f-stop will have the same depth of field - which is not true for lenses at the same t-stops.","1341112025"

Monsters arent dumb. They wont sit around waiting to die and they damn sure dont die without a fight. Morle goes both ways. If half the monsters are dead and the PC's are in good health you best believe morale checks will be made to see if the remainder of monsters run or not. 

Monsters will also realize after the first encounter that a headon rush into swords isnt the best way to defeat the PC's. The next encounter may very well involve fire, pits and missile weapons.

- Frequently masturbated while I was in the room day or night even after I said something to him. His food habits carried over to the stench of his... material.

- Would stay up until 7 am playing online video games while on skype shouting at his teammates.

- Would store three month old open hot dogs in my fridge (had not been refrigerated since opening for the three month period) which made it smell worse than anything I have smelled in a long time

- Would have his parents/friends visit unnanounced. (More of an annoyance than anything)

- Didn't pay rent on time for the month of finals and almost got our internet shut down.

- Ate ALL the time. It wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't eaten like a cow after dental surgery.

- Smelled like shit. Didn't own deodorant or body wash.

- Whenever his parents visited his dad would shit on the toilet seat. (Made him clean it up)

- Was an extremely sensitive moron who just couldn't understand why he was failing even though he was studying *so hard* (mind you he didn't attend half of his lectures or close to two thirds of his labs)

Did I mention that this dorm was one room to two people? Either way, I think I have made my point. He didn't attack me or take my blood but it was certainly an experience that made it so that I would be living alone from then on.","1341112033"

&gt;Religion is neutral. It can be good, bad, whatever. Islam especially. I've heard Muslims profess some of the most beautiful, inspiring, ideas I've ever heard and at the same time I've seen other Muslims say shit that would have been barbaric and insane even for the bronze age.

I think you might be making the same mistake here as the one you feel the other guy made: you're putting the blame entirely on religion instead of assuming there are a number of other sources. Unless all the quotes from Muslims you're thinking about were drawn verbatim from the Qu'ran, which I would find plausible (a general commentary on books written over 1000 years ago, not the Qu'ran in specific). Anyway, other influences from the rest of society/environment the person is in could have been formative influences on the beautiful/inspiring ideas and all the trash could have come from religion. I'm not proposing this is what happened because I haven't got any evidence to back it up, it just seems like a hole in your argument that religion is neutral. I don't understand how you can isolate religion as a particular cause for everything you heard from members of that religion. ","1341112049"

I still have questions though, like how can you so confidently say that what she's doing 'isn't her voice'? Even if it's derivative of other work in the mumblecore 'genre' (or whatever you want to call it), why can't she honestly contribute to it in her own way? And further, why is it that much of a stretch to call Girls groundbreaking? I think that is a bit of an overdramatic label for the show but I think some aspects of it are groundbreaking, illustrated by the fact that I really enjoy it and I am a 24 year old male that hasn't made a habit of watching shows with all (predominantly) female casts in the past. I guess I just don't like the fact that people are so quick to shit on this 25 year old girl behind this hip new show just because it feels like it's more hip to put it down than jump on the bandwagon and support it. I'm not saying you're doing that, as you clearly have put some thought into your analysis, but I've heard that knee-jerk reaction from others and it's just irritating.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","During my freshmen year of college my roommate sent several long emails to a director at Residential Life who was also the coordinator of a small program we're both in, and CCed her parents. The last one ended with this.

&gt;I honestly believe that what I just told you (along with Christa's rendition) allows you to see both sides of the story, you can come to your conclusion on who was right and who was wrong. I would like to note that it's extremely wrong of her to place the blame solely on me, and that is exactly what her previous email does. I wanted to just clear that up with you, we can talk about it more later, because this is something I really need to address with you all. Again, I'm concerned with the way in which she approached me. As we all know, Christa does drugs. If she can address me this way sober, I have real concerns for future events in which she may not be. I believe it would be extremely wrong to move me when I'm not the one with the drug issues, and I'm not the one to aggressively approach someone in a way that threatens his or her safety. People that wish to behave like that should have singles.

Varus is strong but i really dislike his Q.  the only thing that makes varus unique compared to other ADs is his ultimate which has high utility but besides that I believe he cannot hyper carry. Another downside of varus is that he has no escape mechanic whether its a movespeed buff, dash, or slow on hit mechanic which makes killing him in team fights too easy.  Until they give varus one of those utilities, he wont be high tier level ad.

For dogs, nature is very powerful: that's why labs love water, why cattle dogs herd furniture, why terriers dig, etc.  They're bred for those characteristics.  If you look at a wolf, it's the same species as a dog, but dogs have been bred for thousands of years to be friendly to humans and more childlike.  

That's why most anyone people can train dogs, but only really skilled people can train wolves.  That's also why dogs are on average far safer than wolves.  If you were to look at the bell curves, there would be only a small overlap.

In the case of Black Duck specifically, the Boycott Novell people think that the purpose of Black Duck's service (which helps companies audit the software they are using so they can make sure they are complying with licenses) is so that Black Duck can tell companies they are using GPL software and warn them they could get sued or be forced to open source all their proprietary software, and this is supposed to scare the companies away from open source (and presumably back to Black Duck's masters--Microsoft).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh, it wasn't over-testing.  It was the same tests my American doctor had run.  The Japanese hospital couldn't get records for them (obviously), so they re-ran them.  They didn't really need to since I knew the results from the American tests, but it was the right call for the doctor to make.

As for the drugs being weak, it's because drug dosage is ideally based on weight.  The average Japanese person weighs a LOT less than the average American, so the doses for OTC drugs here are a lot lower.  Japanese people aren't ""different,"" they're just not huge lard-asses.  Whenever I buy something OTC, I take whatever the American dose is no matter how many tablets that works out to (3-4 for most ibuprofen brands).","1341112076"

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","I've tried the commercial anti-fog solutions.  They all work to a point, as in they are better than nothing, but your best bet is to do he following.

1.Remove all foam from your mask.  The reason for this is that foam absorbs water and once the foam is wet it will take ages to dry.

2.Use an anti-fog solution.  I use cat crap.  It will give you a little extra time before your vision fogs.  It is by no means a cure all.

3.Get Thermal lenses.  Some airsoft goggles have what are called thermal lenses.  These will help you with fogging problems.  

4.Install a fan.  

I also use glasses.  My glasses fog up ages after my mask is fully fogged up, so i don't really worry about them.  I just cat crap them at the start of the day and go from there.
