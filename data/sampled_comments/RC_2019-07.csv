"quittingphenibut","t5_3g2ly","The ceiling of Pregabalin is not exactly at 600mg, some take 1200mg and with tolerance do some dose even higher, but Pregabalin is generally more potent, especially for common doses and it´s true that if someone doses insane Phenibut amounts the effects intensify (also up to a ceiling) but those doses would be +10gpd and with tolerance even much further.

Withdrawal off normal doses of Pregabalin is very harsh tho, much harsher than what is to be expected from Phenibut and especially 600mg Phenibut that you took as an example to come off is such a low dose that you might get some anxiety and sleeplessness but not even much. It´s relatively easy to reduce Phenibut by taper generally (many here been there and done it) but lowering a daily dose of Pregabalin by even a small percentage (10-15%) can get really dramatic.",1561939200

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","You can blame everything on porn, but you still made the conscious decision to masturbate (more than ""just once"") to abused children. In top of that you ""seriously considered"" raping children. What you did is not only wrong and bad, it is illegal and by watching these kind of child rape videos (it is nothing else. Porn is acted. Raping a child in front of a camera is not.) you contributed to the production of them by being a ""consumer"". You would have earned my respect if you tried to look for help BEFORE making bad decisions. You didn't. And now you act like you are the victim of the evil evil pornography industry that lured you into watching this kind of shit.
Yes porn is bad. But no, porn does not make you watch children getting raped. And it also does not give you a free pass to do so. If you are truly sorry for what you have done (Which I doubt. You even seem to be pretty proud of yourself for not actually raping a child personally.) ,go to the police and tell them about everything.

And I find it alarming to say the least, how everyone seems to respect this person so much for not actually go out and raping a child. 

Your self hate does not change anything. If you won't report yourself to the police and also tell them about where you found the videos you watched, AT LEAST seek psychological help to make sure children around you are safe.",1561939200

"NorthKoreaNews","t5_2wlaq","The deep state is very real. It happens in countries when government institutions develop lasting relationships with business interests and establish an operating culture defined as a ""status quo"". Countries most prone to developing internal states are those with limited government accountability and lack of cohesive values.

In the USA, the deep state emerged post WW2 as a combination of Military Industrial Complex influence taking over forigen policy to promote rollback politics and continue abusrd defense spending. The Deep state continues to this day; and it's been very apperent that in the post cod war era, the USA is constantly trying to imagine up new enemies to preserve the status quo of ""Us vs Them""  by undermining otherwise positive trade relations for the premises of ""national security"" or existential threats. Barking up the North Korea tree is normal if you look at history; none of it is meant to start a war, but it's mean to inflate threats, boost defense spending, alter public opinion to pass new security laws, and routinely purge the NSA/CIA/DOD of idealists, replaced with yes men and career politicians.

Now, moving trolleys around a construction site is a hassle, as is getting them up and down multiple floors of a building under construction, so the stuff is generally only sold in these bags - you just can't get them in bigger amounts basically, because bigger bags would require different tools on site, which simply aren't used.

It has had cold water run in it after searing steak, overheated every day, not cleaned properly. It was once left on high burn all night and had to be completely reseasoned. I was not the most responsible twenty-something. Despite that, the cooking surface is perfect, and I was lothe to strip a funtionally working pan. Lodge gets a 5/5 for tankyness.

Now I am in my mid thirties, and I thought I would try a lye restoration to get these years of crud off. After 4 days, there were still blotches of carbon that I had to sand off with an orbital sander. I ended up completely sanding the cooking surface so that is much smoother than it was before. I got a little lazy in my re-seasoning and left a bit too much Kremelta on the pan, so there is some leopard spotting. But after two weeks of use the pan is darkening. In a couple of months it will look just like its 30cm brother. I also have a 26cm carbon steel pan for quick eggs in the mornings.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","yes:

Never unplug the PS4 while the LED light is still on. When the PS4 is in Rest Mode, it is meant to stay powered. Sudden power loss can result in data corruption. That said, the PS4 consumes very little power while in Rest Mode, so it's not like it's bad to leave it like that. In fact, many people do regularly put their PS4s into rest mode so they can charge controllers, have save data backup automatically, automatically download updates, and quickly resume their game session without having to close it.

If you want to ***fully*** power off your PS4:

* Select **(Power) &gt; \[Turn Off PS4\]** from either the home screen or quick menu
* Press and hold the power button for at least 7 seconds (until the system beeps twice). Letting go after only the first beep puts the PS4 into Rest Mode.

The white light will blink for some time, once it is off entirely and no longer blinking, then you can unplug your PS4 if you like.

So yeah, be mindful of Power Off vs. Rest Mode. If you never ever want your PS4 to be able to enter Rest Mode, go to  **(Settings) &gt; \[Power Save Settings\] &gt; \[Set Features Available in Rest Mode\]** and make sure every setting is off. If this happens, the PS4 cannot enter Rest Mode, and simply will power off instead in all scenarios.",1561939205

My vet would tell me no rush in picking up Charliy when I boarded him there. Seems the techs found that Charley had a calming effect on all the other animals, especially when feeding the kennel the first thing in the a.m. 

He'd ride slung over their shoulder, looking out, and the animal would stop barking/sqwaking/wallering, whatever, as soon as he appeared in front of their cage.

He spent his days in the waiting room sprawled across the reception desk bringing calm instilling peace to any stressed out pupper and/or kitteh, even the biggest growler on a leash

And when one was freaking out in the exam room the call would go out Bring Charlie in here, and he'd sit sphinx-struck on the counter making the scene totally zen.

Sometimes I would drop him off on the way to work for the hell of it.  He was always welcome there

With a 31 IV and 4 EV, the calc from that article is [(31 + (4 ÷ 4)) ÷ 2] = (31 + 1)/2 = 16. The reason the HP is wasted in the Kyogre example is because it has a 30IV and doesn't add to an even number. In the current gen it matters less because Hyper Training exists so everything can be perfect, but it's the same mechanics even back then. To quote smogon, ""As you can see, it is important for the sum of every IV and four EVs to be an even number, otherwise you are wasting EVs."" With 31 IVs and 4 evs, you have 1 set of 4 so that adds to 32. With 31 IVs and 12 EVs, you have 3 sets of 4 and that adds to 34. You have to add 8 each time to add another stat point.

An IV calculator is about putting in your visible stats and getting the IVs from them, if you change the EVs there it's going to change the possible IVs not the actual stat, which calculates with different ranges. You'd use a stat calculator to calculate stats from given IVs and EVs.

Sure, you don't have to get your wallet out when you go to the general practitioner. Provided you pick one that works with the insurance company.

Want a specialist that costs more than public healthcare is willing to pay? Guess what, you're SOL. They'll either pay a fraction or nothing at all.

Same goes for meds, equipment ect.. You'll either get the cheapest stuff on the market or have to pay extra.

Socialized healthcare sounds great on paper, reality is that the entire system aims to provide the necessary minimum to *everyone* while a fraction of the population has to foot the bill whether they want to or not.

With that said she’s probably made it worse by working her abs to hard.

Again, lots of ad hominem in your comment. It’s pretty yikes but it’s also pretty funny seeing how mad you got. Also, i really don’t comment that much, and if I do it’s hardly ever trolling or mean, so I don’t get your point.

"boston","t5_2qh3r","&gt;You merge when it's least detrimental to traffic

That's another, and taken together *and* in context.

&gt;**Merging early is right up there** with yielding your right of way **for the dumbest fucking thing you can do on the road.**

Hyperbole aside, merging early is the best choice if there's room in the lane for that to happen. Think cars traveling 25 MPH with about 15 car lengths between them for an easy visual. In this case, one cannot merge early, and that creates a fine bottleneck up front that we can expect.

For a better weigh in we'll need footage of what happened before. It's reasonable for that person to drive all the way up and merge when indicated by barriers or by the paint. They should not have been blocked. At the same time, if they could have merged earlier and chose not to, they are wrong. That also depends if they knew, otherwise you can't call someone an asshole for not having specific knowledge of a turn.",1561939211

Not much to say about the show its self that hasn't been said, but I was reading the comments each episode and hoo boy it was a toxic wasteland full of ship wars and people missing the point.

I challenge anyone to change my mind on one thing: Ami was never a contender for a romantic interest. Right from her being introduced, she was antagonistic at worst and unhelpful at best. She started off only ""wanting"" Ryuuji to bother Taiga and even after she dropped that, it was established that all she wanted was friends. Her actions back that up, since after the group takes her in she acts more like a good friend, but still pretending to keep a distance, than a romantic interest for anyone. 

Rewatching didn't really change the experience all that much for me despite how long it's been since my first watch. Overall, I still say this is an **8/10**.",1561939211

"politics","t5_2cneq","I gotta say something, what happened to this term? I feel like it got co-opted really quickly. When I first heard it the friend who said it told me "" like, think Anthony Bourdain"". The way I saw it used after that seemed to line up with that idea. 

It seemed like the term was originally meant to refer to the things that were masculine/masterful without being ""toxic"". Like a guy with BDE is the sort of guy who respects women but also gets laid a lot cuase he's actually cool. has confidence backed up by knowledge and skills. Knows the difference between what's good and what's expensive/popular. He respects and understands people from all classes and endeavors to understand any new ideas he's confronted with. He gets discounts and things comped when he's out on the town (he is most certainly a cosmopolitan) without ever asking, becuase clerks and waiters feel his respect and genuine nature. He makes an entrance without making a scene, if you know what I mean. 

Last two weeks I keep on seeing it referring to classic rape-y Ferrari driving provide zero value or utility to society assholes. It really bugs me cuase I liked the old meaning, it felt like a step towards society becoming more aware of the signifier vs the signed, the whole ""don't listen to what men say, watch what they do"" thing",1561939213

"therapy","t5_2r76d","I like my parents. They do rely on me financially and it’s an odd situation. I don’t provide for them all the time but I need to be able to at a moments notice with rather large amounts, and not providing for them financially would have had very negative consequences at times. When I say I provide for them I mean my husband and I do. I don’t work because my husband doesn’t want me to, although he occasionally complains and demeans me for not having an income. I have worked on and off since I’ve been married but my husband doesn’t consider the amount I can bring in with my education and line of work to be worth my working. He will still say I don’t bring in money even when I’m working because it’s a small amount compared to him, and I still have to do the house work as though I’m not working. My husband makes a very good amount of money. 

My husband is alright but comes from a very male dominated culture and definitely believes women should serve men and the man is the head of the household and should be served. I knew him as friends for 5 years before we started dating but he didn’t show this side of himself (and always said how modern he was and how those older ideals weren’t right) until we were married. He does have quite a temper and doesn’t allow me to ever be unhappy with him,  basically. If I ever show disapproval or get mad at him it’s a screaming fight from him. If I say no to serving him (getting him drinks while he watches TV, massaging him, etc.) he ends up picking a fight about something else within minutes and screaming and then giving the silent treatment until I apologize. He basically treats me the way he treats servants in his country. He can be loving, fun, and cute, but there’s always the underpinning that there could be screaming  at any moment. I think he has NPD as well but he’s not diagnosed. 

I’m 31. Married 4 years. 

I own horses and go horseback riding. Typically my husband is ok with this but with occasionally complain that I’m not keeping up with my household duties and not being inside the house enough (even though the house is clean and 80% of the time I’m home when he’s home). I live in an area that I can’t do the horseback riding that I want though. I also like swimming in the ocean in summer and going to garage sales and thrift stores. My husband’s mother recently did my horoscopes again and his family isn’t allowing me to swim without my husband’s supervision or go to garage sales or thrift stores at all anymore due to increased risk of drowning death (somehow buying used things plays into this, I’m not sure how). I don’t actually believe that stuff though. 

I was a nanny for 10 years. I am a part time doula and I am also a midwife assistant, although I can’t find a position doing that near me. I want to become a certified professional midwife but unfortunately there aren’t any preceptors near where I currently live and that’s a requirement. 

My parents live on the other side of the country (USA) and I don’t really have any friends since moving out here 7 years ago. I have one horse friend I trail ride my horses with 1 - 2 times per week. 

Off to apologize to my husband for him screaming at me for saying he was treating me like a servant again as he bosses me around..

"electricvehicles","t5_2qwzm","&gt; EVs are simpler to produce than ICE cars with far fewer parts and and are less complex.

Completely disagree.  EVs would be easier to assemble, but only if the standard parts existed.  Unfortunately they don’t.

Big auto need to develop battery pack technology, which is new.  They have little to no expertise in this area.  

They need to develop power electronics, which they also have little to no expertise in.

A good example is the Audi etron.  The product is uncompetitive because Audi lacks EV drivetrain expertise.  Weight is high.  Efficiency is low.  Batteries are large but range is pretty short.  As a result it’s really expensive for what you get.",1561939214

I think there's a free demo - give it a shot.

What I am finding is that originally, I played it for like 2 minutes played through about 5 levels that all seemed the same, used one weapon, and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Every few levels there is a new enemy type, and  at some point you get comfortable switching weapons in it and it becomes really really fun (Switch both weapons to the laser, then aim both controllers at an enemy and make the laser's overlapp and you get a 'super laser' that blows up simple enemies instantly)

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","Using this [wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_by_country), I looked at each country's first-level administrative divisions (with a few exceptions, such as if the divisions listed primarily serve as statistical or geographic regions instead of governmental divisions) and determined which ones could be traced in such a way that you'd visit each one without visiting any twice. If separate entities of a country were large or significant enough they were considered separately, and those are listed on the image itself and indicated with an asterisk. Otherwise, noncontiguous exclaves or minor islands were not considered. Plenty of countries have special administrative districts designated for the capital and sometimes other cities (e.g., Washington DC or Australia's ACT); since these are clearly different than a traditional state or state-equivalent, I made a sub-category (light green) for the countries which can have a Hamiltonian path drawn so long as it's allowed to not visit these small one-city-only districts.

Going into this, I knew the US couldn't be done but I didn't how rare/common that would be. In the end, it looks like 18 full countries and 3 significant sub-portions of countries cannot create a Hamiltonian path.

It impeccably researched, not at all sci-fi and is deeply, deeply chilling. 

Robert Evans was actually at this protest livetweeting, but in the podcast (recorded in the last 6 months or so) he actually points out that Portland is a great microcosm for the conservative/liberal divide in America, being a highly liberal urban area surrounded by deeply conservative agricultural land, and says if anything major is going to kick off, it'll kick off there. 

Also in his scenario one of the main 'triggering' events for the second Civil War is a shooting at a protest against a set of mass deportations by the Trump administration (which is happening, like, next week).

Sexuality is about what gender you're attracted to, that sex and gender are linked doesn't make a straight guy gay for having sex with a woman who happens to be trans. That some gay men have sex with trans women doesn't change anyones sexuality either.

Sex is assigned at birth - sex assignment can be changed during transition as it's a label just as gender. Sex is not down to chromosomes alone - it's down to genitalia, reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics, hormones, chromosomes, and neurology.

You're question reads like you're pushing an agenda based on ignorance of biology and trans people, as well as prejudices, so I would point out that given as you can't even get basics such as language correct (re. 'a transgender') that maybe you shouldn't be so certain in yourself.",1561939218

&gt;Like were her injuries consistent with preexisting heart conditions and CPR; they are, this is a verifiable medical factPremeditation and intent

How is a femur fracture  consistent with CPR? 
How does DNA end up on the window of Fields car?

&gt;Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jennifer Bowers specified that Heyer’s autopsy report concluded her cause of death was blunt-force injury to the chest. That report also found that Heyer's aorta artery split into two parts, that she suffered a **distal femur fracture**, abrasions and contusions on her lower extremity, and a pulmonary (lung) contusion from rib fractures.

&gt;The commonwealth showed jurors the body-camera footage from University Police Officer Dean Dotts. The officer responded to the scene on Monticello Avenue, where Fields' Dodge Challenger was pulled over after the car attack. The footage depicted what was believed to be blood and flesh on Fields' car.

&gt;DNA analyst Kristin Van Itallie testified that a DNA sample found on the windshield of the Dodge Challenger likely belonged to Heyer: She specified that there is a 1-in-7.2 billion chance that the DNA profile is not Heyer’s.

https://www.nbc29.com/story/39577456/fields-trial-day-6



Hayer was morbidly obese but she was young it generally takes a while for morbid obesity to lead to heart attacks. I cant find any evidence to suggest a diagnosed preexisting heart condition. Even if she did have one, it seems illogical to assume that she would have had a heart attack from fright or stress at that moment which would debilitate her to the point she'd need to be given CPR. Also it wouldnt explain the fractured femur or the DNA on the windshield.

&gt;Don't know, but only because Heather Heyers COD is consistent with aortic dissection, causes of which can be natural, and CPR.

Even if this is your theory of the case, Fields would still be guilty of causing her death for creating the circumstances that led to the heart attack. 



&gt;Nothing. I just don't take people at their word just cause they're being self righteous.

Consider this - if this practice is so beneficial why are there no public campaigns for men to have circumcision performed when they are adults?

You have free speech on /pol/, you can say whatever garbage and white supremacist nazi bullshit you want.

But who do you think goes there?  You think /pol/ is more popular than reddit?  You think most people want to look at nazi propaganda in their spare time?

Voat?  That's barely in the top *million* websites in the world.  Nazi shit won't get censored there, you can be as hateful and bigoted as you want there, but *most people* don't want to be on a platform like that.

Most people don't feel comfortable speaking, or talking, when surrounded by fucking white supremacists.  That 'free speech' fosters a chilling effect on non-nazi's, who tend to *actually leave* instead of just talk about leaving.

Given white supremacists tend to be a rather particular demographic of angry white men, most companies tend to gain more by marginalizing them to the benefit of *all other voices*, than it is to protect that small demographic of crazy racists under the name of ""free speech"".

Voat is never going to be 'the new reddit'.  /Pol/ is never going to be 'the next big thing'.

"rugbyunion","t5_2qkbe","&gt;[In total, **Europe has 22 votes**; Oceania 10 votes; South America 5 votes; Africa 5 votes; North America 4 votes and Asia 4 votes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby#Governance)

Yeah, you are right, oh wait it's not EVERY other union, it's that they only need 3 extra votes, even if we take out the 4 votes from  Georgia, and Romania (one each) and the two general European Votes that's 18 needing only seven. Not hard to convince some of the other unions to 'fall in line'.

Not saying all of this is the Six Nations unions fault, what I'm trying to say is that for the good of the game the rich nations need to start considering letting more of that pie spread around.

Wasps had turnover of £33.4m (AU$60.3m) triple what the Aussie Super Rugby teams get in total around £11m (AU$20.5m) (+/-1m as this is the number form the ARU, but for example the Queensland Reds reported $21.6m)

And this is only Club -- the RFU had a turnover of £184.9m (AU$334.0m) double that of the ARU's £82.4m (AU$149.0) or NZ's £136.2m (AU$246.1m; NZ$246.1m). If Rugby is to survive; if the likes of England are going to continue to make that kind of money they need to consider that their opposition contributes to that. 

The problem facing the ARU and alike isn't the one off cash injection -- a one off payment of $70m isn't going to suddenly fix the ARU the problem is the inequity the player pillaging, the slow strangulation that the ARU and NZRU for example are suffering. What needs to happen is more of a profit sharing model. I'm not saying England hand over all their profits and Canada too and what's in the pot gets split 50/50, but some of the cream -- say 20% goes into the pot and gets spread around England does a little more than what they are currently doing and in return they get less foreign players watering down their comps, they get a better (more evenly matched) opposition. Why was no one at the Crusaders Semi-Final... because they are too good for their opposition everyone knew they were going to win (although it was much closer than most expected). Why will very few people go next week... because they are heavy favorites winning gets boring. Why don't I play in U12's (despite not being 12) because it's boring winning everything, why to hundreds of kids play up age groups (I know a few 15 year olds playing in Colts tier 2 club) because people want a challenge people want to support a challenge. England (and France and all the rest of the 'rich nations') can continue to strangle the ARU and NZRU but eventually it'll strangle the game as a whole.",1561939221

My idea is to tax all money that is sent out of the country by individuals and use that to fund border protection and increase immigration judges.  I dont like the idea of catch and release, but with it taking 3 to 5 years for immigration cases to be heard what to do?  Could change the laws and make immigration cases and asylum claims to be heard at US Embassies.  Dont like the idea of separating kids from families. Trump is going about it all wrong.  Obama deported far more illegals without all of the drama.  I like the idea of a national ID card.  Must have one to be able to work, attend school,  have utilities, rent a home or apt or hotel, or have a bank acct or use money transfer service.  No valid id no service.

The issue that people seem to have with the jumping back and fourth, was not much of an issue for me as I went in knowing about that. I think it was an interesting way to tell the ""nesting dolls"" of the story (which is why I assumed they chose to do it that way), but I think it could have served it to attach some dates or at least the year to the jump cards. ""3 months ago"" is harder to follow than something that says ""3 months ago (May 1990)."" Especially how it was jumping around pretty rapidly at times. 

The only minor gripes I had with the film was with some of the action sequences which were too video game like in that there seemed to be an enemy spawn nearby with waves and waves of bad guys. Fun action, but maybe a tad too much. Was everyone in the restaurant a bodyguard or hero?

Well one day at my factory job i formulated a plan to follow my dream of being an artist. I started making drawing my life. I quit my job and focused on art till I drained my savings and I tried to sell prints. Nobody wanted it. I ended up homeless and gave up for a few months till someone took me in where i immediately picked it back up. And finally after a year or 2 people started wanting my art. I sold 40 originals for dirt cheap and tried prints in cheap frames selling again. And I sold 5 the first day. I sold them for a year then raised the price, kept getting better and better and now i can make $50 in 3-4 hours average. I felt just like you now except I lived in a bush. If I had of just quit.

This is the key difference between the prequels and the sequels. 

The prequels can get just so damned silly at times, but it's hilarious because it's played so seriously. The prequels aren't great movies by most standards, but they're just on the other side of bad that makes them extremely entertaining and fun to watch. 

The sequels try to force the humor by making every character a quippy dialogue spouting Jar Jar Binks personality. As a wise man once said, there's nothing more painful than an unfunny comedian.

BM said it a few times that they want to move forward and being mature. I think this also means we don't get a few songs anymore. It is sad but you can see it at the shows. I miss songs like CMIYC, Onedari Daisakusen or IDZ and also i miss Yuimetal. But it is like it is.

I have another cric kit, and two more tourniquets, a few pressure dressings and combat gauze stuffed in my pockets as well.

For my other kit, everything else I have medical wise is in my bag, which usually for short term ops is a First Spear MTAP, similar to an M9 without the bottom pouch. Only other medical supplies on me are two tourniquets on my PC, and a soft litter in my hydration pouch on the back of my PC.

Do you fear the security guards at the mall? Of course not because they are private security, they want your money. Private police forces do an awesome job and unions often try to get rid of them because they can't compete (i.e. citizens prefer them). [San Francisco](https://reason.com/2015/07/21/san-franciscos-private-police) and New Orleans have private police and the people like them. 

Freedom works, and that includes the free to choose your protectors. If the politician choose the police force (even when private) then you get crony capitalism. That's why we have the military-industrial complex and the prison-industrial complex. Real capitalism (freedom of choice) gets rid of corruption and abuse.

"de","t5_22i0","Erklärungsversuch eines alten Sacks:

Man muss den Typen (den ich aus verschiedenen Gründen auch nicht ausstehen kann; gibt immer mal Gerüchte, dass er sich gegenüber dem Personal der Hotels, in denen er lebt, übergriffig benehmen soll, keine Ahnung, was daran ist) im Kontext seiner ersten Hochphase sehen: 

In den 70ern und 80ern war die in Deutschland zu hörende Musik echt schlecht, richtig schlecht - nix gegen vieles, was wir heute für 70er und 80er verkauft bekommen, darunter sind durchaus Perlen, allerdings lief das gute Zeug damals kaum oder gar nicht im Radio, und Schallplatten und Kassetten waren echt noch teuer, also war man aufs Radio angewiesen, und das war... ""würg"", um es mal mit Herbert Feuerstein auszudrücken, Schlager allenthalben, ziemlich rückständige Kacke, klebrig und seicht bis zum Erbrechen.

Udo Lindenberg war damals einer der wenigen deutschsprachigen Musiker, die _halbwegs_ intelligente und unterhaltsame Texte ablieferten, ausdrücklich _halbwegs_, und einige seiner Stücke hatten ja auch sozial schwierige Themen (auch wenn die Nähe zu Rockern abstoßend war, die waren damals schon widerliche Gewalttäter und haben ihn in seinem Suff vermutlich recht einfach vereinnahmen können), was damals eher eine Ausnahme war.

Kurz: Udo Lindenberg lieferte in einer von Plüschschlager ertränkten klebrigen Musikscheiße ein paar hörenswerte Ausnahmen. Dass der Typ sich bis heute halten kann, liegt schlicht daran, dass meine Generation (bin aus den 60ern) heute halt die größte und kaufkräftigste Konsumentengruppe dieses Landes ist - und man bleibt halt, das wird Euch Jungspunden auch noch aufgehen, sein Leben lang auf der Musik hängen, die man zwischen 15 und 25 gehört hat (lasst euch das eine Warnung sein).",1561939231

"MarvelStrikeForce","t5_4bjjb","Power creep is to be expected in these games, newer releases tend to overshadow the old roster.

But there must be a balance. Old teams most be redesigned to stay relevant or useful to some point.

This has not been happening often enough. We have had a balance patch every 6 months (in the summer we got defenders, spider-man, thanos and vision and early in the year we got groot and the kree).

The launch roster simply is not worth it no matter how you look at it.

Characters like Thor, Wolverine, Elektra, Nebula, Bullseye, Nobu, Winter Soldier have no place in the game anymore. For example, Winter Soldier used to have a signature turn one nuke. The trade-off was that he was extremely slow and could be debuffed. Now we have Captain Marvel that is much faster, with a much more powerful turn one nuke, while also dispelling herself and dealing aoe shockwave. These characters cannot survive such a powerjump.

One of my favorite games of all time, Dangerous Waters, is a game in which I have spent multiple hours just *slowly* creeping towards my objective with almost nothing of note actually happening in the game.

I also thought that getting around in RDR2 was way too tedious.  To me it boils down to the actual act of traversing the countryside in RDR2 just not being fun.  In the sim games usually the actual act of traveling is complex enough and has enough things that you need to consider that it's enjoyable on its own.  In RDR2 the only thing there really was to consider was how quickly to tap the gallop button.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed RDR2, but I once heard someone say something along the lines of ""Its a great story, but its a bad game"" and I feel like that describes it pretty well.",1561939234

So, while they have you in for a yearly pap smear, which has been shown is far too frequent, it should be once every 3-5 years once you have the all clear, they tend to do a full check up. It wasn't that long ago that even a yeast infection required a doctor visit and could not be got over the counter. So I would say that women's health care has been far too controlling and medicalised (no idea how to spell that). But it may have had the spin off effect of better health outcomes due to closer and more frequent monitoring. Alongside with better familiarity of navigating the health care system for themselves and their children. Edit - this is in response to your second edit.",1561939237

Third, the class sizes were smaller and they offered core classes (most importantly internship and capstone) during the summer so I wouldn’t have to wait even longer to begin those like I would have at other schools. Finally, there is a diverse professional background of the professors. There are both Ph.D’s and Psy.D’s in clinical psych and mental health counseling with various focuses, from children to geriatrics, so I was able to get a lot of different perspectives on practicing and treatment.",1561939240

I mean, I really centered the main plot of about four different movies around that of a game that was never even released in the US.

It's easier for men to over do it which I think you agree with in your post. For instance, I'm not really a necklace guy and I learned that the hard way.

&gt;pieces that hold meaning, and unconventional pieces subtly incorporated to add specks of intrigue to the overall look

Definitely cosign this over a misc trendy ring 4 pack from zara. Thankfully the thrift shops I frequent offer a wealth of this type of jewelry. I'd like to add more pieces to my humble collection but keep them relatively understated.

"arrow","t5_2u4js","yeah i would've preferred that myself. btw people always talk about how katie cassidy is too skinny despite how she worksout or say that she's not action material.

yet i don't really look at summer glau and see action hero.

and chloe bennet daisy from AOS doesn't have a background in MMA or any type of fighting before AOS but yet now she's completely badass of AOS,

cobie smulders agent maria hill also doesn't have a background on fighting either yet she manages just fine.

hell even katherine mcnamara before shadow hunters probably couldn't fight her way out of a paper bag but then she started training for the role and now she's badass.

i guess that's what really annoys the most is that everybody thinks just cause KC doesn't have the background that lotz has that she's not BC or action material so that's what really gets on my nerves.",1561939241

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Think of it like recording yourself at the movie theater.  The legality of it depends on the material in the video and your intended use.  If you use clips from a game / movie interspersed with original content, or you have an unrelated video that occasionally shows a glimpse of the movie screen, most courts would call that fair use.  If you have a video that consists of a recording of the movie screen, that is not fair use.


It's obviously more nuanced with video games, but the current landscape is that there is a ""gentleman's agreement"" that, while technically streaming video games *could* be infringing the publisher's rights, they aren't going to challenge it as long as you aren't charging people to watch it.  If you *are* selling it, now they have a claim that because your stream is largely composed of the video game that they own the rights to, they deserve some or all of the revenue you generate.  I am not sure whether this has been tested in court, because we haven't had a situation where people were really doing that on a large scale.


That being said, the argument that ""I made a video of me playing a game, I can do what I like with it"" will absolutely not hold up in court.  People have gotten in trouble for making videos with copyrighted music playing in the background - although a court likely wouldn't rule against them if the use was non-commercial, hence why Twitch's subscriber-only change is a big deal.",1561939242

But Muslims are 1.1% of the US population, and Right wing Christians are 6-35% of the population depending how you define them.  

At the low estimate of 6% that's about twice the attacks per person, and that's only right-wing Christians vs all Muslims, at the high end 35%, that's about 10 times more attacks per person by the Muslims.  

Then consider that in those attacks, the Muslims killed about the same number of people as their attacks were more violent, so for people killed per population, it's between about 5 times more and 30 times more.

So, depending how you measure it, in the USA, Muslims are between twice and 30 times more dangerous than right-wing Christians.",1561939242

4: so far none, but I guess since the game isn't out yet, i can't say for sure.

5: Not that I like or dislike it, but the changes that they made to the weapon triangle. I was watching a video that went more in depth of what this can mean, so I excited to see it in action once its out

6: gosh...I really can't say that I have any issues. the weapon triangle at first did surprise me, but I don't mind it as much.

7: i do. They don't seem as...tropey, as say fates, and I like the character designs (huge fan of the artist)

8: blue lions C:

9: It's nice. yeah there are some issues like how it doesnt look as...polished like zelda or mario, but I don't mind it. graphics aren't usually the most important thing to me

Similar goes for the R16. Haven't used any others but this thing suits us great - set your inputs so your max levels don't peak, and then just hit record.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in a hurry and stressed out. Probably 20 and I had never had my own bank account before. I chose a different bank from the ATMS I was used to using and it was the first time using a new banks ATM. 

I was trying to pull out cash and the screen said ""Please Enter your Personal Identification Number"" 

I was confused and it was hot and it didn't make sense to me. I was like... My password? My pass code? What? I don't have one. 

I wasnt reading it as PIN. It was spelled out, not the acronym so I was like WTF is that?!  I got so flustered and confused and pissed because nothing I entered was right. 

So I pulled through and was pissy (not with the teller) and I was like ""I don't have a Personal Identification Number!!!"" And she just stared... And she was like ""Your Pin number? The number you enter to use your debit card?""

So fucking stupid. Top 3 stupidest moments ever. Like how did that NOT compute? I felt so fucking dumb lol",1561939245

I'll just add that it's often reported now that taking the feeder down is not what encourages the birds to move on, that they know when it's time to go. I live in Western Washington were we have Anna's hummingbirds that do not migrate and I've known people even around here that take there feeders down because it's what they've heard they should do. When in fact our hummingbirds need food the most in the winter. I rig up my feeders with Christmas lights on a timer to keep the food from freezing and I get way more traffic in the winter months than I do any other time of year.

release finger 1 and put it on the next point.  
release finger 2 and put it on the next point.   


the screen basically registers that moved your finger across that line when really you just put it on 2 points to make a perfectly straight line.

i find myself attracted to more girls than guys, but i cant completely rule out being attracted to men because 1) i have/would have sex with either women or men again &amp; 2) i havent been in a long term relationship with anyone, but can see myself in a relationship with either.

Mainly it's just about trying to match the video to the script and praying for the video to match up timing because you never know with these anchors lmao. 

The stressful stuff is mostly when we go live. I double as a studio tech so after I finish editing I go up to the set and either work the cameras, audio board, or prompter. And like that's the real stress because one slip up there ruins the show. Especially on Audio. I have accidentally left mics open sometimes and oof that's never fun.

Not worth the risk.

 do not mentor or coach a woman ( or Visa versa)

Do not under any circumstances say anything at all to them about their appearance.

Do not ever compliment them. Appearance based compliments are an obvious nono, but even job performance related compliments can be misinterpreted as harrassment.

Do not engage in conversations about your private lives. Pretty obvious.

&gt; NEW YORK - Millions lined the streets of New York on Sunday to wave rainbow flags, celebrate the movement toward LGBTQ equality and renew calls for action in what organizers billed as the largest gay pride celebration in history.

&gt; ANTI-CORPORATE DISSIDENTS. The world&amp;#039;s marquee gay pride parade was preceded on Sunday by a protest march by thousands of anti-corporate dissidents who rejected a uniformed police presence and commercial sponsorship, while demanding LGBTQ equality.

&gt; New York was designated the site of World Pride this year, drawing an estimated 4 million people to the city, where straight allies joined LGBTQ people in defending civil rights.

I think it's common sense, and the old saying applies, ""everything in moderation.""

Trust yourself and your son here. Maybe pull in the help of a pediatrician.  

Edited to say: they may be shaming him about wetting the bed. I would try to get more information on this and shaming him over something he has no control over it could be seriously damaging. This may be what he is unable to verbalize.",1561939249

Breakdown:

Swapped in the R5 2600. The R5 2600X is slightly better, but the money saved can be put to better use.

Removed CPU cooler since the stock cooler will suffice.

Swapped in cheaper 3200MHz CL16 RAM.

Added a 500GB NVMe SSD. Please get an SSD, especially since you have a $1000+ budget. It will make your OS nice and speedy; games will also load much faster compared to just an HDD.

Swapped in a cheaper RX 580 8GB with a much better aftermarket cooler. The Pulse is much better than the Armor.

Swapped in a cheaper 550W Gold PSU, which is more than enough for this build.

Upgraded the 1080p 75Hz monitor to a 1080p 144Hz monitor. This has a curved screen; if you don't like that, we can swap in something else.",1561939253

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","We really don't know for sure yet. Blizzard was very vague about the itemization post. Basically we know that all items are in their 1.12 state. This means the r14 1handers do 60 dps instead of 50 they start out with, BRE is OP af and the https://classicdb.ch/?item=22234 I pressume you mean has the stats you see on the website. They have stated that items will come out when they should be, but they weren't that concrete about it. If this statement is true, then the blue pvp set should be lvl58 on launch as it's a different set than the lvl60, and it should first be released in patch 1.11 along with the various other Rank14 gear like the good caster/healer gear and the melee swiftblade. But we don't know for sure this is the case, but that's what their statements seem to imply. 

As for getting it before phase 3 well it takes min. 12 weeks and I heard about phase 2 only lasting 2 months, but we'll also have to see about that.",1561939253

Check your attic insulation, it is suggested that attics should have R-49 insulation performance or greater. Air sealing drafts and using solar shades on large windows will also reduce heat gain.

Just here to say that while I’m actually enjoying the Netflix English dub a fair bit so far (especially Shinji’s VA, who I think I prefer more than Spike Spencer and his JP VA), I really am not meshing with Asuka’s VA. The biggest problem with her is that she *sounds* like she’s acting. Even if she portrayed the character in a different way that I didn’t like, it would still be better than this, because at least I’d be able to buy the performance. But she sounds so stilted and it’s obvious that she’s trying really hard and failing to get Asuka’s characteristics into her voice.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","So the way I would look at it is this. If you took that money and invested would that investment gain more value faster than the house would rise in value. If you finance and get hypothetical 4% rate and the home value rises 4% per per year what comes out better mathematically.

Say you bought the $250k house for cash and in one year it gained 4% value to $260k. With cash that's a $10k gain. 

With financing you still have roughly the $250k to invest. After payments of piti you would have paid the house down to $245,597 in the first year. Equity plus value is a gain of around $14,403 in the first year. To make that same gain you would have to find an investment that yields 5.8% on the $250k, so if you do find that investment your gain of $28,903 in year 1. Investment plus home value.",1561939254

Also if you think Brexit is hard try splitting a nation that has been United for over 300 years with shared everything.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","*You Can't Take It With You* - 1938

This film won Best Picture, it's a Capra flick (and I've loved all the other Capra films I've seen), it stars Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur (the stars of *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington*). Should be great, right?

Well, it isn't really. A lot of people have accused Capra of being too sentimental, and this is the first movie where I can really see it. The heroes are indefatigably heroic. The villain harrumphs his way through almost the entire film-- he gets three lectures on the importance of selflessness from three different people throughout the film, and even then we're meant to treat his potential heel-turn as high drama instead of a foregone conclusion.

I'm also not sure if the group of misfits that Jean Arthur lives with are lovable or a bunch of exhausting assholes. It's weird to watch a movie with heroes and villains and not want to spend much time with either of them. (The large scenes with the misfits in Arthur's home impress with their staging but always play just *this* side of overbearing.)

There's a lot of easy sweetness in the film, especially in the romance scenes between Stewart and Arthur, and Edward Arnold impresses as Stewart's father, the aforementioned harrumphing banker. He underplays enough that you can look at his face and read him for clues to his actual feelings (everyone else declares their fundamental goodness with open-faced naivete).

It's not a terrible film, but the disappointment I felt by the end surprised me. It doesn't help that some of the big plot turns play like rehearsals for much better scenes in later Capra. There's a ""townspeople collection"" scene that anticipates *Wonderful Life*, a judge banging a gavel that anticipates *Mr. Smith*, the overall focus on family/friends over money and the strangling effect of institutional power (present in both later films).

It's a B- sort of a thing, somehow both worth your time and a damn shame.",1561939255

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Ok so let’s do the math on this one, since incels are too fucking dumb.

So people start being sexually active mostly around the age 14/15 depends who it is, 

So now we have to split it up

for high school lets be generous and say 4 years and for college 4 years and for work/higher PhD well give that 22 years (I’m not an expert just a 17 year old, this is a guesstimate)

So for high school kids have school all week so the average kid would have sex on the weekend now most kids have many SOs in high school, and maybe some random hookups here and there.  So say throughout high school someone has 8 relationships and 10 random hookups (another guesstimate) which is actually a lot for high school considering there’s hw and such.  That is :18: 

Now for college.  Again counting school and stuff there’s not much time for relationships.  Let’s say that someone has a sex with a different person every time their free (weekends of course bc of hw), I’ve never been to college but i know it’s harder than high school so you would have to factor out 3 weekends for studying for finals, another 5 for other tests/projects.  Now we need to factor in the chances of dating someone which would also subtract at least add up to 6 months (again being generous it’s prolly more) so now we have the equation 4(52-8)-24 which is :152: 

Now for after college, people going for more advanced degrees are usually spending weekends studying and really only have time for maybe like 20 random hookups (from dating apps and such) and maybe 9 serious relationships which would be :29:

Add all that together without talking about morals or whatever just facts about how much time and average person would have and you get :199:  this isn’t an exact estimate, but 1000 people isn’t possible considering people still have to deal with hw, jobs, school, relationships, parents, money, food, studying, etc.

&gt; Samsung, LG and other IT companies are keeping a close watch on possible Japanese economic sanctions amid a deepening diplomatic row between the two nations over forced labor during Japan&amp;#039;s 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea, officials said Sunday.

&gt; Japan&amp;#039;s conservative daily Sankei Shimbun reported earlier in the day that the Japanese government plans to impose economic sanctions on Korea beginning this month to protest the ruling of Korea&amp;#039;s Supreme Court last year that Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, must pay compensation to individual Korean victims of wartime forced labor.

&gt; Samsung Electronics, SK hynix, LG Electronics and other large companies here are expected to be affected if Japan implements the sanctions.

Also, I didn't ""appeal"" to religion, I used it as another way, of showing that it's frowned upon. As I first spoke about how ""Every culture on earth"" frowns upon it. religion, or no religion for the most part (I'd say 98% of cultures). There is a reason for that, indivdiuality and socially, why they do this. It's historical fact.

It's kind of a special case for some people like Idubbz, because he's a serious edgelord, but I don't think I've ever heard him getting in controversy for racism and the like.

It probably comes from his logic that ""either all humour is okay or none is"" and I think that's a cheap excuse for dumb offensive jokes for the sake of offense. Humor is born from human nature, and human nature is complex, thus humour is also complex, and you kinda do have to make guidelines for what isn't and is okay.",1561939256

The two have a lot in common, if you look at it.  They will eventually seek to destroy each other as enemies, but only after their common enemies are first destroyed.  So, for now, they are working together.

Now, if we're pitting the left against Islam - I mean, that's not much of a contest.  So, basically, the left is aiding Islam.

It only seems simple to you because you're failing to understand it. The proposition was that workers democratically running the company would give themselves better pay and such. So now you're saying they are going to hire experts, a CEO, CFO, COO, etc., to run the company - why would the outcome be any different than before, when the experts set wages at $30k?

Liar’s Handshake, Peregrine, Getaway Artist are all much more interesting to me as a player because they enhance specific aspects of your class, or in some cases CHANGE how you can play.  Even Khepri’s Sting is interesting to me despite how much people hate on it.  



Of course the problem with making these niche-enhancing exotics is that you run the risk of creating something mostly useless like the titan sword blocking exotic or (blech) the Aeon cult exotics.

- Going back in time created a branch reality. Hulk said that the infinity stones are their target, do not change anything else so they didn't create ""unnecessary"" branch reality. This is confirmed by The Ancient One (TAO). But since TAO's focus was protecting the reality using infinity stone, her focus was to make sure Hulk returned the stone in time so the possible alternate reality are ""restored"".

- Now to the second possibility. If Hulk (in this case, Cap) returned the stone in time. Everything is ""normal"" and the universe hasn't ""changed"". This has been said and explained by TAO's pptx.

- Now to the multiverse. The MCU we know (lets just say it the prime universe) is what already happened  in the past 22 movies (and half of Endgame). That's the rule, because that's what already happened and it's been stated that you can't change the past. The past you visited becomes your future. And that future becomes a branch reality of the past.

- Example: Cap said ""hail hydra"" to the Hydra Co. If Cap didn't resolve the issue, Hydra will still act as if Cap is part of Hydra. The Winter Soldier wouldn't make any sense. So this happens in an alternate reality, because The Winter Soldier is what happens in prime universe. We obviously don't know what happened between The Avengers and The Winter Soldier, but if Cap somehow cleared that ""misunderstanding"",  The Winter Soldier could've happened as is and thus the ""hail Hydra"" moment onwards is part of the prime universe.

- Same thing with Cap's retirement plan. If he (and Peggy) keeps things quiet (by quiet, I mean didn't disturb the rulebook which is the previous 22 movies), he can continue living a normal life with Peggy. Everything will be normal and the branch reality that Cap creates (by going back to dance) is the prime reality that we've been watching after all. But if he manages to do something that disturb the rulebook (killing Sitwell, meeting The Avengers before the supposed time, or as simple as walking and spotted by modern Shield) then that becomes alternate universe.

- TLDR1: the prime universe we've been watching could be the alternate timeline created by Cap going back to dance all along. Or it could be Russos' (if something happens that disturb the prime timeline which is very likely).

- TLDR2: The rulebook imo is the past 22 and a half movies. Does going back to past changed the rulebook? If ""yes"", then it's definitely happens in the alternate timeline. If ""no"", it could be happens in the alternate timeline, or it could happens in the prime timeline (in this case, the prime timeline is the alternate timeline all along created by going back to the past).",1561939263

Phil has as much integrity as I expect from a news source. The word integrity does not mean he's perfect, it means that I can look elsewhere on my own and still see the same info that Phil gave me. He's done that enough times that I don't instantly jump to conspiracies like half of this pathetic country every time he says something that runs counter to my beliefs. Cause guess what? Facts don't care how I feel about them or what my political views are, so if the facts prove my beliefs wrong then maybe it is time to challenge those beliefs instead of doubling down and coming up with a conspiracy to hide behind. Phil showed that Veritas had some valid claims but that we shouldn't be taking things at face value, cause there are other things such as context.

Perfect example, yes google disabled suggestions when searching for Hillary's emails. Phil proved Veritas right, and then showed that while google didn't give him suggestions they also didn't hide the ""bad"" results that those suggestions would have shown. Hillary is a dumb bitch, most people on both sides of the isle can agree on that. Can we move past assuming that every left leaning individual wanted that power hungry idiot in power?",1561939263
"Indiemakeupandmore","t5_2w8pb","This is my first review post! It's been slow at work, so I dressed up my notes recently and thought you all might appreciate it! I haven't gotten through all from this collection yet, obviously, but here's my transcriptions of the reviews for the ones in the picture (not including Illuminated, since I drew that one before I'd actually worn it, and I haven't gotten to it yet...) I'm not editing my notes, just transcribing from the picture, so please forgive the lack of nice sentence structure.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Finest Thing** *(Baklava soaked in amber honey, helicrysum, wild rosemayr, sun-warmed skin)* Wet: baklava (honey) most prominent with a little spicy warm. Dry-down: the slight floral/herbal wisps through, still very warm sweetness; with a few hours the sun/skin melts the other notes together and it feels like honeyed-just-barely-planty-skin - skin that's been in a sunny gardn - it blends so nicely from the more separate notes into a single scent. 9 hour day

**Full Moon (at the Temple)** *(Fragrant white rice, shiso leaf, bitter yuzu zest, hinoku wood, green tea, lakewater)* Wet: sweet rice &amp; some greeny/citrusy, and definitely some ""wet"" quality. Dry-down: still of lot of sweet rice, to me. Not sure if any of the greens/wood are adding to the swet, but it's a bit too much for me. Can pick out some green and wood and water, but they hide under the ricey pillow.

**Star to Star** *(Starfruit, raspberry, clementine, stargazer lily, peony, vanilla custard lashed with caramel)* Wet: Raspberry! very juicy fruity, touched by the sweet. Dry-down: the flowers float in and out, but don't last super long; the fruits stay consistently juicy and a little vanilla-sweet, but not too sweet. Raspberry stays most noticeable, but becomes more generic fruity with a few hours. 7-8 hour day

&amp;#x200B;

Other thoughts: I LOVED Finest Thing - it is definitely a ""skin, but better"" after the initial burst of bakalava settles and I'm almost certainly going to full-size it. I scrubbed Full Moon after about 2 hours, so I don't have longevity notes on that one - I think rice and I aren't very good friends; the particular type of sweet that is rice is very distinct and I just perfer pretty much any other sweet note. Star to Star gets points for the raspberry and the longevity, but I don't often reach for super fruity scents.",1561939263

*****
&gt; WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s decision to allow expanded sales of U.S. technology supplies to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei will only apply to products widely available around the world, and leave the most sensitive equipment off limits, a top White House aide said on Sunday.

&gt; The partial lifting of restrictions on Huawei was a key element of the agreement reached over the weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to reopen stalled trade negotiations between the two countries.

&gt; It has drawn bipartisan criticism from U.S. Senators concerned that Huawei has close ties to Chinese intelligence agencies that could exploit the global distribution of its technology.

"science","t5_mouw","Like I said, low fiber low residue diet. You can’t cure Crohn’s disease but you have flare ups and you can try for remission. I’m in remission right now because my inflamed portion of intestine was surgically removed. I’m on maintenance meds to try to retain my remission. When I was really sick in a flare they had me on prednisone which is a steroid to reduce inflammation but you can’t stay on steroids forever as it can be damaging to the body. They also had me on humira which is biologic given as an extremely painful shot. I got the shot once every ten days. I was also on a third maintenance medication. In the end, none of that worked. My intestine perforated and I had to have surgery. They removed the affected portion of bowel, this sent me into remission. I can always have another flare up and require more meds or surgery unfortunately. 

The in a nut shell guy is usually pretty good but I’ve never had any doctor recommend fecal transplant to me and I’ve never seen any IBD patient in any of the forums/support groups mention fecal transplant either. Maybe there are people out there studying the idea but as far as my experience goes, fecal transplant isn’t a common treatment for IBD. 

As for nutrition it’s recommended we eat things easy to digest, low fiber, no raw fruits or veggies, no seeds or nuts etc. you want to stay away from things that could cause a bowel obstruction. I’ve had a few and they’re painful. Chew food thoroughly and remember that you are not chewing food to make it small enough to swallow, you are chewing food to break it down as the first step in digestion. 

But you can pretty much eat anything if you blend it. Smoothies ftw.",1561939265

edit: just more info, his agent confirmed the clause after it was leaked.

Apparently my upstairs neighbors were going to use the WiFi of the guy across the hall from them, but it’s too far. I said no, now all my neighbors (including too far away WiFi guy) give me dirty looks like I’m evil. The upstairs people have began to throw their cigarette butts over the railing of their deck which makes them land on my patio plants, and I’m just sick of it. Why are they entitled to use it? The first time we’ve spoke was him ringing my doorbell to ask about the WiFi.

The main complaint people seem to have is Delirium = Inner Release, but this isn't really the case. Inner Release just halts expenditure, but Delirium regenerates mana. WAR also does not have a use for their gauge that is exempt from its effects, like LS. Also ""spamming"" Bloodspiller 5 times over 10 seconds once every 90 seconds is hardly job-defining. I feel like people are over-emphasizing this way too much. You push a button that does a lot of damage 5 times in a row every 90 seconds. Honestly I think its fun and feels powerful. As someone that also played WAR at level cap last expansion I see the appeal and also the challenges that come with it, learning a fight in such a way that you can guarantee those 5 GCDs hit their mark without any downtime. And we've got it easier now that its possible to continue a combo you started afterwards.

But then again, I also never saw a problem with DA and predicted people would complain the way they are now if it was taken away. You either like a job with high APM and speed or you don't. The job does feel a touch slower, but I also never liked using Skill Speed on DRK back when BW gave haste. I know it was argued to be optimal (?) but as someone without god-tier ping it felt bad to me. Hard to enjoy optimal DPS if it feels bad in the player's hands. Now, however, I've been intentionally melding it and it has definitely gone a good ways towards keeping that fast-paced nature alive.

**I also watched some Ex Clears/Farms including Xeno's and the DRK that was with him was pretty much matching him in DPS (*****specifically on clears where neither of them died*****), although you had to bust out a calculator to add the DRK+LS DPS together to get the complete picture. So DPS is definitely looking solid if nothing else.**",1561939269

I went to college in a different state than where I currently live. In college I got this cool job where the owner has a background in music and still plays with his band of 25 years. 

A week ago I told my SO the band was coming to town to play a late night show. Rare opportunity. They don’t travel a lot. I’ve been with my partner for 4+ years. We are very tight on cash. This means we can’t travel to where I went to college and visit there. 

In this case, it was about as feasible as it gets to meet my old friend and see his band play. It’s summer and she’s off school. 

My SO would not contribute any money towards the show. The tickets were $30 each and transportation (Lyft) was $30 each way. Normally I wouldn’t justify this in our current financial situation, but there’s no guarantee how long his band will keep touring! They’re getting into their 50s. I wanted my SO to be there to meet my old friend and see his band play.

She didn’t come and I’m upset. She insists this is money related. I didn’t feel it was fair for me to have to pay the every expense. I wanted help in one area, be it her getting her ticket or paying for one of the Lyft trips. I’m having a hard time with her rationalizing this with money because I see her purchase a $25 bottle of gin every 5 days. This could have happened at the cost of 1 bottle. She keeps saying how she is done talking about this and how we need to just drop it.

Where I will defend my partner is she has been doing some great things in paying off a credit card, and got medical tests done to make sure certain areas are good.

I drink quite a bit myself. This situation has me feeling there is a real dependency issue here. She knew how important this was to me and how much my old job meant to me. My feeling is she didn’t care enough and is guilting me using money. When I point to the bottle of gin example, it’s not really acknowledged and what really got to me is she reminded me of how many times I’ve failed at abstaining or quitting.

It doesn’t feel right to me. We could have gone and had a fun time. The turnout was small. I talked to my old friend after the show. He appreciated me making it. I fear they might not come back. It was an afterparty show to another show, so I’m not sure how big of a turnout they were expecting. 

I’m upset and fear our drinking is the bigger problem here. This was important to me. Can’t get the image of a bottle of gin out of my mind. I honestly feel using money as a guilt trip is a bit manipulative here.

"LCMS","t5_2szi0","The first step is to get reconnected with a congregation and participate in its spiritual life; if you haven't been to church in years, that's imperative if you're aspiring to be the pastor of a congregation someday. Any further seminary plans probably need to be after a couple of years of that.

But from what you've said, it doesn't seem it would automatically disqualify you - so long as you're honest with the seminary during the admissions process, and it's not an ongoing thing. Is this behavior entirely in the past, and has it been for some time? Did you ever receive any professional help for it? If it's still happening, please address that first, and I suspect that regardless the seminary might require you to meet with a counselor or other mental health professional as a part of seminary formation.

Depression is sadly not uncommon among clergy, and though I don't personally know any stories, I wouldn't be shocked if there are other pastors with similar issues in their background. But ministry can be extremely stressful sometimes, something to be aware of when approaching it with these things in mind - even for the men with most mental resilience and best coping mechanisms, it can become overwhelming.",1561939270

&gt; Syria said Israeli jets attacked several military sites near the capital Damascus and the central city of Homs early Monday, killing several people.

&gt; The report said several civilians, including a small child, were killed and several other injured in an explosion in Sahnaya, a neighborhood of Damascus.

&gt; The Israeli military has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria in recent years on targets linked to Iran, which is backing President Bashar Assad&amp;#039;s regime in the Syrian civil war.

Your sister will become easier with time - playing with her will be much more recreational and soon she may even be able to help you in small ways and eventually do chores.

My life went very differently, but also not quite easy, but things will get better and eventually this will just be millage that made you better at handling stress, be more empathetic, more capable of taking care of yourself. Stick with it - it's not forever, just make it past the next few years and you'll see. I probably won't be able to change the way you feel about your mother, but your sister 's innocent in all of this. Maybe that can be an anchor. From your other post, I'd keep contact with your father short and sweet, but enough to keep him away. My father ran away with another when his company failed and we were in great debt for all of my mother's working life. Sadly that's not all that unusual.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Yea, regardless of hopes and dreams, the hard reality is that this is hard.  

Whatever you decide let it b your decision.  Even if u decide it would b easier to present as male in order to get through life, no one can blame u for that or say that u didn't have the guts and courage to put it all our there, and risk all the judgement and ridicule and losses and hurdles and u went for it.  

I guess in a way it's kind of like art.  You create an image u enjoy doing it, it makes u happy on the inside and then u present it to the public and they rip it apart or ridicule it and shred it.    

So what do u do if your an artist?

some people give up

some people decide to just keep their art to themselves and do it as a form of therapy or for their own enjoyment, nothing wrong with that either.

Then there r those who self evaluate themselves, they go deep down and analyze themselves in order to see what the issues r.  Then they change their art style, they watch other artists, they change their color pallet.  

Derma rolling will help with the acne, look it up.  It's amazing and I have used it for my receding hair line, and it has helped alot.  It removes stretch marks helps with acne scars, etc. etc. 

If this is ur dream save up for some facial feminization surgery.

If your structure is large, hide it with clothing, big girls do it all the time

they dress to hide big shoulders and other things they consider not great traits.

&amp;#x200B;

You're life is yours, but hey, you choose ur own path.

find your courage friend and journey on.

I would offer this advice tho, whatever u do don't purge

even if u go back to presenting as male for a while until u get the female part right.

Hold onto who u know u r deep down inside.  

U r not crazy, ur beautiful, u were born the way u r, and if u try to bury that side of u

U will only torture ur self .  

Much much luv 

hope u find balance in life.  

don't worry about sisters and fathers, u worry about u",1561939276

"ashtanga","t5_2wacy","As another person of science and only early in my Ashtanga journey, I personally believe that Ashtanga ‘asana’ in itself is nothing more than exercise.

What makes it ‘yoga’ is the breathing and meditation. You could be running or swimming or walking or resting, but if you’re focusing, mindful and breathing, you’re doing ‘yoga’.

From your post, it seems like you want a more rounded physical exercise regime, but you’re hoping other people will convince you to stay in the regimented and comfortable exercise routine you’re used to. Why? Just take what’s useful to you from the practice and make it your own. If you feel it’s not enough for you, add some other exercise and cross-train.

I personally think Ashtanga asana is wonderful and gives us a logical structure to follow to make ourselves stronger and healthier, but I don’t believe it’s magical or divine. We are all generally passive learners by nature and it’s easier to follow a prescribed routine than work one out on our own. The benefit is that it also gives us freedom from the decision fatigue and stress we experience in our regular lives.

The greatest benefit of the more traditional forms of yoga is the importance placed on the meditation and cultural aspects, such as non-violence and self-reflection. I think that’s where yoga is unique and is the real reason you should still practice, because the exercise should lead to meditation, which should lead to the spiritual benefits. Even if it’s not what you’re after yet, it’s there when you’re ready to look for it.",1561939276

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","So are you wondering how to Super Jump or are you asking about tethering to a Pharah? 

When tethering to a Pharah use GA to fly to her, jump at the end of it to get a little extra height and then hold jump. This will activate Angelic Decent and let you float slowly down, when you feel like you’re getting too low start all over again. And you can go into Mercy’s controls and set GA to always fly to whoever beam is on, this lets you keep an eye on the rest of the team so you can go to them if needed. 

Super Jump is a bit higher level Mercy Play but REALLY useful for dodging a Flanker. (The number of times it’s saved me from a Nano’d Ulting Genji is too high to count.) Basically have your crouch on toggle. Crouch then GA to someone then at the end of GA Mercy will do a little bump animation (basically her standing from the crouch) when that happens hit Jump and you’ll go shooting up into the air. The timing takes some practice to get down but it’s helpful and can save your life in some situations.",1561939278

To turn CO2 back into pure carbon, yes, you need more energy than was released by burning the carbon in the first place. But that's not what carbon capture technology is trying to do. At least, not all that it's trying to do. Most are simply trying to bottle the CO2 for storage which does not require nearly as much energy. Those that are trying to convert it are exploring the use of catalysts to reduce the energy requirements of conversion into another useful form of carbon, or even more efficient artificial photosynthesis.",1561939280

A world where there are still unknown creatures, where humanity hasn't completely ground nature under our heels.

Horror's also the only genre I like where wrote formula is often abandoned. The movies have twists I never thought of, and keep me engaged to find out what happens next. It's an escape from the mundane horror of everyday life lol

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Being sleazy != rape.

I never said it was. But he's been accused of both on more than one occasion, and everything in between as well. My point isn't to establish that he's a rapist, but rather to show a clear pattern of behavior that gets ignored by his supporters, and Republican more broadly. Is this untrue?

&gt;Last time I checked Joe biden is still in the primaries, 

Sure, because he hasn't been formally accused of anything by anyone. If allegations came out against him, he would be out fairly quickly. 

&gt;and there was the entire ""Hilary being best buds with the KKK member"" thing.

That's pretty misleading. More like colleagues with a former KKK member. I see your point, and if there was some sort of pattern of Hillary trucking with the KKK, I might agree that it's relevant. 

&gt;Witness accounts are considered one of the worst kinds of evidence, and Circumstantial evidence is only used in addition to better evidence, not in lieu of.

Well, the first part of that sentence is debatable, and the second part is [categorically untrue](https://legaldictionary.net/circumstantial-evidence/#ftoc-heading-3). Circumstantial evidence can be used with other circumstantial evidence to create a fact pattern. And I actually misspoke. Testimony and eyewitness accounts would be direct evidence, which is what you seem to have a problem with. If you think that's unreliable (and it can be), and you don't like circumstantial evidence either, then you simply don't believe in evidence. Full stop. 

The reality is, circumstantial evidence is pretty important. A smoking gun, for instance, is literally circumstantial evidence. 

&gt;On a slight side topic, I'm of the opinion that simple allegation shouldn't be enough to stop someone's political career,

I agree. I didn't say it should end his political career. I'm saying that it should be seriously considered, rather than reflexively dismissed. 

This is only happening from one side, which is why I believe that by and large, the CMV is correct. 

Now you could make the argument that OP is treating Republicans and/or Trump supporters as a monolith, and not all Republicans feel this way. And I'd say you're probably right about that. But I think he's describing the majority opinions of these groups fairly, as far as I can tell. Skepticism is perfectly healthy, I have a problem when it's immediate denial and defensiveness. 

&gt;(Are you suggesting that the republican base couldn't find one person immoral enough to claim that whoever the Dems elect as their leader raped them?).

There are some more extreme right-wingers that have tried with their perceived enemies, like Jacob Wohl, and haven't been able to make it happen. I think it's more difficult than you may think. Not impossible certainly, but I don't think it would be very easy. 

&gt;In this internet age, we're hitting the point where we need to start demanding proof for this kind of thing when there's more then just the allegation on the line.

Rape is very difficult to prove under the most ideal circumstance. Sexual assault without a rape, even moreso. I keep seeing people say she should have reported more quickly, but when? Any evidence would have been gone pretty quickly. Whether she reported it a few weeks later, or 20 years, there likely wouldn't have been much evidence. She would have had to report it immediately, and most rape victims don't do that. 

What evidentiary bar is acceptable to you? 

Regardless, this isn't me accusing Trump of rape. It's not me saying he should be impeached because of the accusations. It's the fact that he's exhibited a pattern of behavior with women, and has had enough accusations against him, that they should be taken seriously. I don't see Republicans taking them seriously.",1561939281

* The optic is the new one as has been discussed at length - a one-piece ""tall"" Carclo clone. I requested the glass be shipped too, and got that, so I'll be swapping with a Carclo 10511 and the glass. Although the [UCL lens](https://www.flashlightlens.com/index.php?app=ecom&amp;ns=prodshow&amp;ref=ucl_lens) in 22.61 x 1.9mm has been highly recommended to me.

* The colour seems slightly different - a slight tinge more ""blue"" on the anodising. Only really noticeable in different light.

* Clip colour is silver, but that's perfectly fine

* The switch is a lot more firm, has a lot less ""throw"". This is meant to prevent accidental activation that people have been experiencing, but I've had no problem with that. I'll get used to it, I guess - though the tailcap does seem to be glued on, now.

All in all - I like it. Less of a powerhouse than the XPL HI 3A, but much nicer for CRI babies such as myself.

In one case we treat the mental condition that causes this conflict, in the other we ignore the objective and instead seek to change the patient’s physical appearance to conform with their subjective feelings about their body. 

Idc what Shapiro has or hasn’t said - but for the political pressure associated with transgender issues, science would have categorically rejected any treatment contrary to one which requires that the care provided to a patient match their objective condition. 

Institutions with known credibility such as Johns Hopkins faced this exact problem. Well known experts from Johns Hopkins all agreed that there is no way to change your gender, that your chromosomes dictate who you are and that the only appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria was to address the mental condition which causes the patient to believe that they are of a different gender than the one their chromosomes say they belong to. 

...then the whole “SJW” gang came in full force and shut all that “bigotry” down.

Now what happens when you don't pay the fine?

Well you get a crime stat.  Maybe it escalates?  Who knows.  But the big drawback is that NPC's come and kill you.


NPC's that, as we just established, don't work, and probably won't work in 3.6 (due to server issues that aren't getting fixed in 3.6).


Don't take it from me, though: Todd Papy agrees:

Until the ""security"" system (NPC's) are working, the law system isn't going to prevent bad behavior, only punish it financially (and you can ignore the punishment and not pay the fine if you are cool with running around with a crime stat).",1561939286

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;We are here because the world is facing a grave climate emergency,&amp;quot; Guterres told a two-day Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting to prepare for a Climate Action Summit in New York in September.

&gt; Guterres said destructive climate change was moving at an increasingly fast pace.

&gt; A landmark report last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said a safer cap of a 1.5 degree rise would see nations rapidly slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions via a sharp drawdown of fossil fuel use.

This controversy is mostly because they decided not to port over existing Pokemon despite them all having the same models, data and animations found with other Pokemon. This controversy is because in SW/SS they have thrown away a tradition that was started at the genesis of the very series, that Pokemon can be transferred from one game to another. This is because they are making a Pokemon game that doesn't have all the Pokemon in it.

The bar is so low for Gamefreak, but somehow the bare minimum of actually having all the Pokemon ported to this game is beyond them.",1561939287

Relying on a unit sticking, on the other hand, is more reasonable, because protecting one unit is a lot more reasonable than protecting more than one unit. Players can play cards to protect those important pieces, and later on it's easier to play a piece from hand.

The problem with that later case is that too often, you'll find one piece but not the other, either the unit that needs protecting without the protection or the protection without the protectee. This happens too often because of Eternal's abnormally large deck sizes, which increases variance for synergy-reliant decks to abnormally high degrees and reduces variance for low-synergy decks because low-synergy decks can afford to run a lot of redundancy.",1561939288

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","&gt; If your screen stops moving, nothing suddenly lurches forward right? This is exactly like the portal situation, minus the ability for objects to pass through the TV.

I don't understand how this is equivalent to the portal situation, portals aren't TV screens.  In this TV example the object in the other room never looks like it's moving according to anyone's frame of reference, it's the image of the object on the TV screen that looks like it's moving, or the TV itself.

If the TV approaches me at speed and then suddenly stops, I wouldn't expect the object in the other room to lurch forward because that object isn't actually there and was never actually moving, from anyone's POV.  I'd expect the TV to feel the inertia and to want to continue moving, though, and expect that it would fly forward off of its stand if it weren't bolted onto whatever contraption was moving it.

I don't see the portal situation as being equivalent because a portal isn't showing you an image of some object, it's literally showing you the object itself, it's a hole in space.  That's the real object behind it, right there for you to see or touch or whatever.  I'd expect a cube sitting just inside the portal to lurch forward when the portal stops moving for the same reason I'd expect the TV to lurch forward when it stops moving.",1561939289

Buddhists acknowledge that the past only lives on in our memories so the past as a concept is not real, our memories are. The future only exists through our imaginations. We infer and plan for what might happen in a moment that hasn't arrived. 
 The only truth is that there is a here and now. This moment and it alone. You may not always be conscious of it and so it may feel separated into different parts but your whole life has been one moment in where certain experiences take place.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","so you have an issue.. perhaps with the Accelerator pump discharge..

 lets check that.. engine off.. air cleaner off.. choke open..  flashing shining down the throat of the carb.. work the throttle lever once.. you should see a small stream of fuel shoot into the venturi and down at the throttle blade below the venturi.. 

 now.. release the throttle so it closes.. bump the throttle slightly.. just a touch.. you should see a tiny amount of squirt that happens instantly down the throat of the carb..  it should not begin after you have already started moving the throttle that will make it backfire..

 you could have an issue with the accelerator pump system.. but more than likely you have a idle transition issue.  i don't have one of that model carb to tear down and identify the idle transition circuits unfortunately.. 

 open this image in a new window.. so you can see my text and the image at the same time.. this is a completely different carb than you have.. but the circuits operate exactly the same.. idle, low speed, primary main..  (low speed circuit is also known as the IDLE transition circuit)

 https://i.imgur.com/jIyBrrs.jpg

 look at the left section of the image.. this is the carb at idle.. the only fuel coming into the engine is controlled by the tapered tip of the idle mixture screw (19)   the fuel is pulled thru the idle jet (14) but the fuel curve is controlled by the holes in the side of the idle jet.. known as the idle air bleeds.  you can see the idle air passage (13)  

 why air bleeds..  have you ever had a straw with a hole in the side.. the harder you pull on the straw the more soda you get.. yet there are still bubbles.. this gives you a proportional fuel curve. the faster the airflow the lower the vacuum the more fuel and air are pulled up from the float bowl. (4 &amp; 15)

 either your idle jet is clogged.. so there is NOT enough fuel passing thru to supply the engine during the off idle operation.. or the idle air bleed is too big and it can't pull enough fuel to feed the engine. 

 lets try a quick fix.. do you have access to compressed air.   do you have a can of carb spray...  cold engine.. slowly turn the idle mixture screw inwards counting half turns till you lightly bottom it out.. do NOT MASH IT TIGHT.   remember how many half turns.. so you can put it back in the same spot..

 blow 1 second of carb spray into the idle mixture screw hole.. followed instantly by a blast of compressed air.. do this 2 or 3 times.. you don't have to really use a lot of air.... your not blowing up a tire.. i don't want you blowing pressed in parts out of place.. you are just giving it a shot of air after the carb cleaner to clean the dirt out of the idle jet.. or idle feed restriction. .

 you will have to hold your foot down part way on the accelerator pedal to get it to restart likely.. as you will have some extra fuel down in the intake .. 

 do not do more than a 1 second blast of carb cleaner into the screw hole so you don't flood the intake manifold and cylinders.. 

 see if it works better..  i will search for a better book on that carb..  i so very rarely see that model carb.. and by the time i get to them they are so wasted they are junked..",1561939289

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","Imho it's not because you're ""drama free"" that men want to just be your friend, it's more likely that you're at a level of independence that most guys might look at you and think ""well, she doesn't really 'need' anyone"". A lot of guys, despite how much people are trying to change dating norms/expectations/roles, want to be seen as a ""provider"", though that doesn't necessarily mean money. Most guys just want to feel wanted and accomplished, to be looked at with a shine in your eye like they're the most amazing person. If you're at a level of independence to where they don't think they'll be able to provide anything to you then they'll look elsewhere.

Also, before I get the onslaught of ""I'm a guy and I love independent women!"" replies, yes, there are guys who value a 100% independent woman out there, however I feel that most fall into the aforementioned group. Nobody wants to feel expendable, especially to their partner.",1561939291
"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","There was tons of stuff for kids.   Yes, there was shopping, but there were some mellow rides, too.    A train ride that went through the mines and then you could pan for gold.    Burro rides - which I loved because I loved horses and always had fantasies about the old West.  

There was this haunted shack thing that was one of the manufactured rooms where one person would stand on one side and be taller than someone else and then they'd switch places and their heights would ""reverse"".    It was just an optical illusion, but I loved it.

"TheBlackList","t5_2whmr","&gt;Kate was playing some sick game when she left Ames body, all nicely wrapped in plastic, full of evidence, right where a known snitch could point the cops. Kate likely thought it would take down Tom, but Tom has a teflon cover, likely a government permanent scrub.

&gt;The plan backfired and Liz is hot water. I wonder if Kate was already thinking Liz was way too far gone. She left the bullet too.

Yes, I think that's true. At the very least, she was hoping to take Tom out of the equation. Kate had to know that Liz could be implicated in the Harbormaster's murder by leaving the body where Alecko could lead police. I'm not sure what her rationale was. Was Kate willing to have Liz go to prison to get her away from Red? She was in season 4.

&gt;
I also find interesting that the ship where Tom was kept was called the Phoenix. He went in half dead and emerged a different man.


That is a really cool find. I did not connect that.

ETA: that is a great parallel between Red and Tom. Both were kept on red boats, and then if Red is the man shot by Liz on the floor of the burning house, both men were near death. They both came out of their respective situations changed men. I love that the name of the boat was the Phoenix. All these little details are awesome.

The nerf from 4 to 3 was a direct buff to fire (praxis in particular) now that their damage could finally put her down. It also allowed aggro to finally deal with her, as aggro struggles to deal 4 damage. She now has a settled place in anti-aegis decks and lifesteal decks.

"TeslaLounge","t5_3j3bn","I'm a bit conflicted on nuclear because of the disposal process of spent fuel, but if I had to choose between it or fossil fuels, even natural gas, I'd prefer it.  We are still putting out way too goddamn much CO2 into the atmosphere.  Yeah, I know a single mega-volcano event could wipe out any reductions we made, but it's only going to be worse by several orders of magnitude if we DON'T reduce emissions and something like the Yellowstone Caldera blows up.  Like literally kiss any chances of humanity surviving as a dominate species goodbye.  I'm all for the advancement of fusion reactors, though.  If we can master sustained deuterium fusion we will advance to a level of clean and nearly limitless energy.  Even thorium salt fission reactors would be an advancement, but I understand why these aren't being built (because they don't produce the same profitable radio isotopes used in military, medical, and research sectors).  Renewables like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal are catching up though.  I'd prefer these of course.  Though there still is a real world impact of their production in both CO2 and toxic waste to produce.",1561939296

Also don't take them to the park and let them off. A dog should be obedient to you, not run around chasing squirrels and other dogs. This isn't dog walking, it's lazy. 
Dogs can be 100% great with each other just by sitting down with each other. Play fighting and a lack of obedience outside the home, will only lead to issues inside the home.

Legislation specifically around access to mental health services e.g. psychologists would be the biggest start. There should be NO gap for the unemployed/poor. 10 visits a calender year is nowhere near enough.

The next piece of legislation to change is accessibility to disability support pension (short-term use of it). The ""rorters"" are really the sufferers. Just portrayed as rorters.

Next piece of legislation change should be around social security and doing away with job notwork members and job craptive. They both serve a purpose for government but not for the people.

"moviescirclejerk","t5_2tfdo","To be honest it's always hard to put a finger on what goes wrong with any media.  We know that Ferrell and Riley have good chemistry as comedic actors (Though both of them can be very hit-or-miss despite their talent, but this is common in comedy), the supporting cast have a good track record, Etan Cohen, the director and writer, has written comedic gems since the mid 90's...

...The downside? Holmes and Watson was written with different actors or roles in mind;  Sacha Baron Cohen was planned to be Holmes, while Ferrell would be Watson. The movie had also been shelved several times since 2008.

My man there are definitely ways to curb population growth that don't involve genocide or eugenics. I'm sure someone way smarter than me could come up with some solutions. Developing nations would be the biggest challenge as developed nations could simply tax couples who have children to deter reproduction. That would be much more difficult in impoverished nations.

"Xcom","t5_2si6x","It's not that we invented it, far from it, it's that American culture spreads *everything*.

For example, one of the defining US pizza toppings is Pepperoni.

[But that itself *is* American.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni)

but then that goes from the ""Italian idea of Pizza"" to the ""American Idea of Pizza"", which Americans then film and put out culturally.

[Like, this is totally an American Pizza.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztwns5PkJY) Although naturally anybody in Italy would be completely aghast at the idea of eating a pizza like that.

But that's not actually relevant.

What *is* relevant is that every single other country sees that as Pizza, and then American companies move to those places. 

-------------------

Which is why we then have to take a little leap of logic. What's the difference between marketing an idea of a thing, and actually the thing?

[Well, in the case of Paris, quite a few Japanese tourists get sick. Simply because the idea of what it is, is vastly different to what it actually is.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome)

-----------------------------

So, what I'm trying to say is that due to the nature of resources, immigration and history, the US was the original fusion food. That then got sold to the rest of the world as the idea that food should actually look like. Which when people then visit the actual places, they get disappointed when the food inevitably doesn't look like that. Which convinces the locals that to get the stupid tourist dollars, they should make their food look like that and that then perpetuates the myth.",1561939303

I've worked all over the US, and I'll say that that is a myth, people can be driven anywhere, its not just LA and NYC.  Cutthroat corporate moves can occur in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  

Respect yourself always.  People tend to get upset, but if you work in a toxic workplace it can really take a toll on you.  If it's not just a one time thing, then look for another job, pack your stuff, and get out of there.  Don't let them treat you bad.  

I've dropped out of a certain liberal major grad school and got a degree in something I could use in corporate.  I had a stint where I was doing retail work and then adult work for money (was able to pay off my loans with that), but then over time I just went back to doing corporate work.  You're going to meet good and bad people in all fields, but what matters is that you respect yourself.  There is not a field in which I didn't encounter some of the best people I've ever met and some of the worst.

Because final damage is capped to the initial value, stacking armor penetration on high damage weapons can have diminishing returns. You can easily hit that cap with melee weapons, so max Incisor isn't always useful.

Also your numbers are slightly off, maybe using the wrong exponent. It's 0.365 in the ESM at least. Should work out at +29% for I2 and +66% for I3.",1561939303

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","All this is really solid advice, in a thread that is one of the saddest ones that I have seen in 6 months lurking this sub. I'm going to add just one more minor point.

&gt;Leaving does not make you the bad guy, and if your friends and family try to tell you that it does, just remember this, they’re wrong, and them saying that to you is a shitty thing to do. If they keep up with it cut them out of your life as much as possible.

I agree with all of this, but it is also important to try to cut some slack to people who are completely unaware about the existence of BPD. It is just natural, if also very unfortunate, that many people cannot fathom how relationships with pwBPDs are, and how exhausting and abusive they can be.

My brush with BPD was not nearly as long as Solomon's, but even I had trouble convincing mutual friends that what happened was *no ordinary relationship and no ordinary break-up*. I have had normal ones, and none of them messed me up even nearly as bad as my relationship with a pwBPD did. I'm a pretty calm dude, and people who I have known for almost 20 years saw me cry for the first time in their life.

I also noticed that I am slightly resentful about people just not getting it, but I try not to think that way or let it bother me. I know I can't expect that they should understand, and I've developed strategies to deal with this. It is often enough to say that my GF was abusive, which she really was, and the details are not important.

If the comments are unacceptable, I too recommend that you cut away people who are invalidating or don't have your best interest in heart.",1561939305

If they pass the exam with a 3 or higher (out of 5), they can receive college credits.

&amp;#x200B;

When you can take an AP class depends on the school. Some schools don't allow freshmen to take them, some do. For example, AP Physics is typically a junior-year course, although some may take it earlier or later, or not at all (like me!)

&amp;#x200B;

The criteria for who can take them can vary a little; most schools allow anyone who believes they can handle an AP class to take them, other schools may require a recommendation or pre-test of sorts.",1561939306

&gt; An extraordinary &amp;quot;Spygate&amp;quot; row has broken out at the Women&amp;#039;s World Cup after undercover US team officials were caught wandering into private rooms at England&amp;#039;s hotel while Phil Neville&amp;#039;s side were out training.

&gt; It is understood the US officials were not wearing official team uniforms when they were shown round the Fourvi&amp;egrave;re hotel, an exclusive resort located by Lyon&amp;#039;s Roman amphitheatre, by hotel staff.

&gt; Earlier in the tournament the US defender Ali Krieger claimed that the Americans &amp;quot;Have the best team in the world - and the second best team in the world&amp;quot;.

She probably didn’t like her partially for her appearance but also partially her performance in the tournament. Ginny def doesn’t like her because nobody’s really going to be perfect for Bill in her eyes. He’s her big brother and as the only sister, she’s assumed the judgmental role. 

They definitely judge her for her looks because they haven’t seen anything beyond that and idk if Fleur really gave them much of an opportunity. But I don’t necessarily think it’s insecurity completely. I think it’s the classic “dumb blonde” judgement. They really can’t believe someone they believe to be not as smart as them has managed to catch the eye and affection of Bill.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This isn’t true. 

I’m a therapist. We disclose limits to confidentiality in the first session. Those limits are: child abuse, elder abuse, danger to self, and danger to others. 

If you tell me a child or elderly person is being hurt I have a duty to protect by reporting it. If you make a specific threat toward a specific person, I have a duty to warn them. 

If you tell me you’re thinking about killing yourself, I have a duty to respond. I’m going to assess whether you’re safe. 

That means trying to figure out whether you have a *plan, means,* and *intent.* IF all three of those are true, I’ll talk to you about it and then contact an assessor to ask you the same things (because I can’t write a hold myself). IF you don’t want to go to the hospital voluntarily, and THEN you also tell both me and another assessor you have a plan to kill yourself, the means to do it, and you intend to go through with it, the assessor will put you on a 72-hour involuntarily hold. 

Because if you’re saying you intend to kill yourself *you need to go to the hospital.*

Passive thoughts about wishing you were dead, or intrusive thoughts like “I should just kill my self,” are not going to get you hospitalized. It’s *incredibly important* that you share honestly about those thoughts, or no one is going to be able to help you with them. 

I’m truly sorry you had a bad experience, but don’t discourage people from getting the help they need.",1561939312

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","1. TLJ destroyed any sense of importance or urgency in the story. ""The light rises to meet the dark."" Ok, cool, then why does any of this matter? If Rey dies/fails, the force will just roid up a new avatar until it inevitably wins. Nothing matters anymore, which leads me to my next point.

2. Going hand in hand with that, Luke was taken in the most boring and cookie cutter direction possible. A huge looming issue in the series is that there is a canonical afterlife for good people. Again, this begs the question; why does anything matter? Isolated Luke presented a great opportunity to explore this issue in the universe. Think Dr. Manhattan; someone so powerful and in-tune with the universe they were completely deaf to the suffering of the real world. Convincing this Luke that the real world still mattered would not only avoid regressing his character but tie up a loose end in universe. Instead we got..... disillusioned Yoda 2.0 that inevitably flip-flops on any ideological question Johnson tried to pose.


3. It has completely torpedoed E9. There is no rebellion and there is no logical reason for anyone to join the Rebellion. Period. Im sure there is going to be some hamfisted explanation in E9 as to why there are two armies fighting evenly again but it'll be fucking stupid. If you couldn't convince people to join when you had a small army and the potential of Luke Skywalker returning, you sure as shit aren't when you have no army and Luke is dead and there is no foreseeable path to victory.

The heat issue is an interesting one that I haven't tested yet. They suggest to introduce heat slowly to the shisha. For example, put 2 cubes on for 10 minutes and then add a 3rd cube after that.

What I mean by “basis” is that every main bender in the series has comparable reaction speed due to direct combat feats with each other where they all operate on a relatively even playing field. No character is even massively outspeeding another. So if Zuko or Katara or Iroh or anyone else is a lightning timer, then everyone else is similarly.

The reality is, you need to be lucky unless you’re born with a silver spoon in your mouth with a ton of connections. It’s possible you are successful by working hard, but you didn’t get there on your own. You might have had good support and needed other outside luck to get there. A lot of people are fucked the second they’re born just because of who they are. Working hard doesn’t mean you will be successful. It has never been like this and won’t be like this in our lifetime. Someone being born into a low income family, in a shitty neighborhood with increased crime, and goes into a shitty school has a very low chance at making it out even if they “get off of their ass” and work hard.

"manga","t5_2ql0i","It is a matter of preference in the end.  The official translation will translate so that it's easier to understand, but would also sacrificing some of the meaning behind the lines, or flat out change the lines.  I generally prefer to translate the full meaning at the cost of smoothness because it's nearly impossible to convey the full meaning without it.

There are lines that I disagree with the official translation, such as when Nariyuki said that they should do something together for 30 minutes.  The raw made it clear that they should do that one specific activity together, while not specifically stating what that is.  Another one would be the last page, where that whole passage is spoken by Rizu, but the official release changed the dialogue so that it made it seem like Fumino asked her again.  

I do like how the official release make some of the lines much less wordy while still convey similar meaning, and it is something I want to improve on if possible.  However, there just areas that I cannot agree with how they handled it, and I have listed a few examples above.

There are a few debates on the usage of ""hate"" that I've seen.  I will admit, I did use a pretty strong language, and could've use something like ""do you not like me anymore"" instead.  However, I feel that in order for Rizu to feel resentful of the event, it has to be something that is impactful that it would result in a long term regret.  That's why I chose ""hate"".  Also remember that Rizu is very literal minded that I felt that her using that term wouldn't feel off, either.  As for ""tired"", if the raw actually used ""tired (飽きる, for example)"", then that would've been the term I would had used.

Hopefully, this might give some insight on things are translated on my side, and I apologize if it sounded like I'm rambling.",1561939315

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","idk what the above guy is talking about, physical copies of games ignore home Xbox designation. 

what he was saying is that if you have multiple xbones, and you're trying to play a game offline on the console that isn't set as your ""home"" Xbox, you won't be able to play it unless you set that Xbox as your home Xbox, or you use the one that's already set as your home Xbox. which is true for **digital** games, but not true for physical copies. 

essentially, Xbox games when bought digitally have two licenses: one tied to account, and one tied to the Xbox itself, the one you set as your ""home"" Xbox. if your console is online, it checks the license tied to your account (which is why if you're online, you can play your digital games on anyone's Xbox). if you're offline, it checks the copy of that license on your home Xbox. if there's no license there (trying to play a digital game offline on an Xbox that isn't your home Xbox), it won't allow you to play it until it can verify that you own it. 

but physical copies of games bypass that license check since you have a physical license the Xbox can check. so idk what he's on about. I just tested it myself with borderlands 2, Skyrim, and fallout 4 a minute ago just to make sure I was correct, and I am (fiancee's Xbox is set as my home Xbox so she can use my digital games)",1561939316

Helps a little bit too that they have to start and stop between tunneling through, and they don't always pick a straight line when doing it, so sometimes they just trickle in slowly enough to pick them off individually.

Then, like others said, it's useful for repairs, and it's useful to burn them alive within your walls without necessarily risking what's behind your walls. I'll sometimes leave the roof *off* so I can mortar my own walls, but I also tend to have a mod for gas mortars that are more effective in those spaces.

Products which claims to hydrate your skin, or anti-age creams usally does not work (as far as I know, there a only one (medical) product which has has anti-age effect) I take good take of my skin, such as not touching my face (can cause pimples), only wash with water and don't use make up. I'm 27 and I still have soft ""baby-skin"" without to many wrincles and pimples.   
I often use ""two in one""products, for example shampoo and shower creme in one.  I do use a deodorant, but actually there is often no need for use, because I often don't smell (bad) when forgetting to use it, according to other people, other people I know for sure will let me know. Also, eating healthy and making sure I'm not having deficitity of vitamins and minerals makes my cheeks have their natural ""blush"" so I don't need rouge. My eye lashes are naturally black so I don't need mascara. When your hair is used to less frequent washing, the hair will be a lot healthier and easier to deal with. When it comes to sanitary products, for some people using the f.eg. the mini pill (contains only gestagen and is therefore safe for women who has risk of blod clots and strokes) can both protect against pregnancy but also reduce or make the periods disappears, for some.

When they finally did find something suitable, I didn't have time to get clean so I tried to cheat and got caught - automatic fail. 

After that, my options were either drop out and lose the mental health services, or get ""evaluated for chemical dependency.""

I will also probably end up looking for a non-UFS 80mm set up but having had an RB hard-shell boot as my first skate, I'm a little put off by hard shells if my only experience of an unresponsive lacing system is anything to go by.  Not sure if all hard shell boots struggle to tighten across the top of the liner but the laces on the RB Cruiser are nothing more than ornamental.

"The100","t5_2x5yb","You know what, you’re right. Murphy does get shit on often, but he’s usually forgiven by Clarke quite often. She did let him back into the camp in season 1. So his behavior towards Clarke this season is, I feel, something she should not forgive. But it’s true that Bellamy gets off easy all the time, he barely had a redemption arc after season 3. But I doubt the writers will hold him accountable to any of his fuck-ups after the way they treated the whole giving the Flame to Madi situation in season 5. He was so obviously in the wrong, I still can’t believe Clarke was the one apologizing in the end. Or when he poisoned his own sister and she put him in the pits. Suddenly, trying to kill your sibling is not acceptable anymore /s 

Same for Raven, she basically avoids blame by putting the hard choices on everyone else, like the list in season 4. And when she does take bad decisions, she just ignores it and it’s swept under the rug. I’m still waiting for someone to call these two out.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Another theory was that she was trying to use her clothes as a rope to snag something near the lid in an attempt to pull herself out.

Edit: The clogging of the drain and the clothes rope does not fully explain the underwear removal. Of the three scenarios I can believe she would remove everything in an attempt to get just a little bit higher towards the lid. Especially someone thinking they are about to die.

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

"sabres","t5_2raob","It's not entirely fair to compare defenseman by their total points. Risto has QB'ed the power play for the last few seasons, which is where most of his points come from. Being 20th among defenseman is essentially being 20th among the ~31 or so defenseman who get PP1 time.

edit: When you rank defenseman by their 5v5 points since 2016, Ristolainen is ranked 52nd. For context, Subban is ranked 10th, and Byfuglien 7th. Risto is no where near their league. And that doesn't even begin to compare their defensive stats.

edit2: For even more context, Risto has 49 5v5 points since 2016, Miller has 40 points, which is good enough to rank Miller at 87th among defenseman. Miller did this with nearly half the TOI that Risto had.

edit3: Accidentally got my stats sorted from 2015-2018. It doesn't make a big difference though, because when sorted from 2016-2019, Risto actually drops to 57th whereas Miller drops to 88th.

A book curse was a widely employed method of discouraging the thievery of manuscripts during the medieval period.  The use of book curses dates back much further, to pre-Christian times, when the wrath of gods was invoked to protect books and scrolls.

Usually invoking threat of excommunication, or anathema, the more creative and dramatic detail the better. Generally located in the first or last page of a volume as part of the colophon, these curses were often considered the only defense in protection of highly coveted books and manuscripts.

Veganism is noble and right; vegans, however, not so much. They're so hateful, it's ironic really. And many vegans have this toxic black-or-white thinking that makes them not really credible or likeable. For instance: ""if you are not vegan, you don't really care about the animals"".

"intermittentfasting","t5_2tluu","I don't have studies for you, but I can relay some personal experience. I had an eating disorder when I was younger, and the mindsets between ED and using IF as a dietary strategy are worlds apart. EDs are, first and foremost, mental health disorders. People think they happen just to young, affluent white girls who want to be thinner and prettier and then take it too far, but the reality is far more complex than that. By the time the disorder starts, it's gone *way* beyond wanting to look cuter in a bikini. It's a nasty cycle of guilt, shame, retribution, self-hate, and eventually breaking the relationship with food so severely that you no longer respond to hunger or satiety in a normal way.

Now, can those with EDs abuse IF in the process of harming themselves? Absolutely, just like addicts use their drug of choice to avoid whatever bad feelings they're trying to avoid. But will IF cause an ED for a psychologically healthy person? Nope, no more than moderate drinking always leads to alcoholism. With IF you're still eating a sufficient amount, only changing the time frames in which you eat. That's all. Severe calorie restriction and purging behaviors (like over-exercise) are not necessary, and definitely not encouraged.",1561939331

Recently I've fallen into monetary issues that have stalled that for a little bit, but it will happen in the next month or so. I've been keeping an eye on them, and i did have them seperated with a large piece of styrofoam but they would climb it and squish through the 1inch gap and then a mealworm escaped the dish and ate a chamber into it so i just threw it away. They've only been like this for a couple weeks, and they're both female incase anyone was wondering. Did i cover all my bases? Also i was thinking of putting in eco earth, yay or nay?",1561939332

This is not a deep enough reading of what happened. Gay people are perfectly capable of being homophobic towards others or acting out in ways of homophobia. Because of the sub-concious ways we discriminate against people, it is very likely the alleged gay perpetrator would have acted differently were it not a gay bar. Especially one he was just kicked out of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take Pulse for instance. It wasn't considered a hate crime. But the shooter showed up supposedly not knowing its a gay bar. He asks someone 'where are the women at' and is told it's a gay bar....then precedes to shoot up the place, killing 49 people and ISIS takes responsibility (and we all know how ISIS feels about gays). So the government said it wasn't a hate crime...but the shooter was ISIS affiliated, and knew the bar was a gay bar and went through with the attack anyways. And he knew how ISIS felt about gays.

"zelda","t5_2r61g","The games you can download from the eShop are the Virtual Console emulates what the games would have looked like the original system. For a regular 3DS or 2DS you can only download the following Virtual Console Zelda titles Legend of Zelda (NES), Zelda II (NES), Link's Awakening DX (GBC), Oracle of Seasons (GBC), or Oracle of Ages (GBC). The Virtual Console allows you to make a save state, and load up the game from a specific point. If you are heading into a difficult boss fight you can fight the boss and you lose the fight. You reload the save state at the exact spot you save it. Versus when you die in a Zelda game you have to start from the beginning of the dungeon.

If you have New 3DS or New 2DS, then you download the SNES version of A Link to the Past. Only the New versions allow you to access some of the SNES games.

If you are looking for decent Zelda games to play on your 3DS I would recommend the following Zelda games in no order:

1. Ocarina of Time 3D
2. A Link Between Worlds
3. A Link to the Past (Virtual Console) requires a New version
4. Link's Awakening DX

Younger gamers find the NES Zelda games to be pretty hard. The Oracle games work better with a real Gameboy Colors or a Gameboy Advance, since you have transfer information between both games to collect all of the stuff in those games. Triforce Heroes avoid unless you have two friends to play the game.  It is too difficult to beat the game solo and it can be very hit or miss with online players.",1561939334

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","Okay, see, rather than to pose it as ""did X went to become a hero"", therefore implying ""did X devote their life to their heroic acts"", you have to see it as ""did X commit a feat of great heroism or was their existence significant in some way?"". Because I feel like at times a lot of us get hung up on the **Heroic** bit of the title and that just a translation + Nasu not handling his english at the time thing. 

The requirements to become a Servant get fussy from one iteration of the franchise to the other, but  at the bottom of it the person needs to **have a wish** they want granted, and have committed acts that transcend humanity's limitations; that's why you have characters like Medusa, a fallen divinity/fallen goddess that was marked as an enemy of humanity, an anti-hero at best and yet still summonable as a Servant. Or characters like EMIYA himself, a guy who dedicated his life to become an ""ally of justice"" underground, with the most public coverage of his persona marking him as a terrorist. Characters like them will never be Heroes to the collective memory of humanity, but they have nonetheless performed acts that transcended the limits of the mundane, or because their very existence was some sort of mystery or divinity.   

Going back to your question, what happens with characters like Illya and Miyu? Well they may not be known to their universe public, but A) they have committed acts of bravery and sorcery, B) their lives are tied to magus society, and C) that very connection grants them a sort of authority as&gt;! iterations of the Einzbern's Grails.!&lt; 

Thus, even without them dedicating the rest of their lives to the whole Hero business, they still qualify as Servants, assuming they agree to enter a contract with The Throne of Heroes. In a proper Grail War their rarity would probably suffer quite a bit without a proper known record of their history, of course, and there are some cases where a person or creature who did tremendous things in life can only be summoned under very special circumstances (see Shiki as a Servants, the Accel event for Irisviel, etc.), and at the end of the day that's what Fate/Grand Order signifies for Type-Moon, among other things: the chance to mess and bend their own set of rules to bring forth money-maker new faces.

Elana, I don't see as a problem, since it can be beaten and there are ways to beat it.

Vengeance Blood is a problem since for now, it seemingly has no weaknesses. Early pressure normally works against Vengeance, but Yurius is a card. So, early pressure doesn't quite work if they get him. I guess if you are Forest, you can get rid of Yurius with a 2 PP card, but that's only if you are Forest.

Ah, I also ended up getting the weighted blankets. I have weird leg issues, like they constantly need to move sometimes, not sure if this is that restless leg syndrome, never asked a Dr. About it.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","I’m on that oxygen shit; it’s hard as fuck. Rusts metal. Why ask me what I’m on? I’m making a claim about music, and it’s not absurd. I’m somewhat surprised at your immediate vitriol and profanity. I’ve responded in kind because it may resonate more. 

For Eminem cuts like Remind Me and Heat he was being individually experimental, for the genre it was not. I never made a claim about the genre, but Eminem’s work. 

I can claim equally you’re extending my argument outside the premises to discredit it. I can also claim that there’s nothing experimental about trap beats. Yet I think both counterclaims are dumb as fuck. He’s not doing anything new, but incrementally expanding on areas he’s dabbled in throughout his career.

We may have different definitions of “experimentation.” I define, in my head, experimental as incremental extension of existing creative leaps. This is drawn from the field of science where experiments test the validity of existing theories. 

I think songs like Remind Me and Heat represent an experimental thread that started in the TES era with songs like “Sing for the Moment,” resurfaced with “Going through Changes” on Recovery, and really came into their own on MMLP2 and Revival.  

The risk in these songs comes from their honesty; I believe that’s exactly how Em feels, no bs, and he found people don’t vibe with it so he adapted on Kamikaze. 

To turn to the point about a misunderstanding of experimental music on your terms, I think you are absolutely correct. A defining character of Em’s career is his blunt, raw honesty going back to tracks like Rock Bottom, Cleaning’ Out My Closet, Halie’s Song, and Kim. 

Insecurity has been a theme since Stan/Sing for the Moment (about his effects on fans) and earlier back to infinite. Cuts like Deja Vu and Toy Soldiers are painfully honest.

The “experimental” part in my eyes is that he simultaneously combines honesty (45 year old horny single man shit) or controversial topics (racism) with aesthetically risky instrumentals (70s/80s) on Heat, Remind Me, and Untouchable. These are failed experiments for sure, but that does not mean they are not experimental unless it is a difference of terms, and I concede that. It is not creatively, ground-breakingly, successfully experimental. It’s a failed experiment. 

As a counterpoint, TPAB’s spoken word interludes are a fantastically successful experiment. Structurally it’s wonderful! But jazz instrumentals and hip-hop are anything but experimental. 

TL;DR I wish you’d asked why I believed it was experimental instead of being confrontational and swearing. I can play that game, but I don’t like to. I try to be a better man.

Edit: and I fuck up a lot, and if I do tell me, please! I’ll own up to it!

Edit2: Relative to the hip hop subgenre of experimental instrumental or lyrical music, this sure as hell isnt experimental. This isn’t Danny Brown or Death Grips or even more obscure things I’m unaware of existing. You are absolutely right on those grounds, and I apologize for choosing language that did not match my intentions, that’s a failure on my count to communicate what’s in my head effectively. I also presumed a particular, and less relevant, definition of experimental.",1561939336

"warriors","t5_2rtiv","Yeah, it's pretty clear now. Still doesn't excuse what Draymond did. Win or lose, KD was most likely gone because it perfectly timed with Kyrie leaving Boston. I guess I was looking at it from a bias standpoint, but for KD to let all the rumors and chatter permeate of him leaving and not just shutting it down pretty much was the writing on the wall. And even after getting cussed out by Draymond, he didn't do anything to silence the dialogue. So I'm on the side that's now pretty confident he was set to leave. I personally never thought he was retiring as a Warrior, but I thought there was a possibility he'd stay one more year. But there's no way he'd go through with another 1:1 deal with all the drama and Kyrie ready to go to New York. I'm just glad it's over.",1561939337

I tend to use a couple different parameters in deciding what to charge for individual images:

- what value does the image have to the client? If I’m shooting marketing material, the client might be able to take those photos and use them to make tens of thousands of dollars if they’re using them to sell a particular product/service. In your case, you have multiple “clients” so you have to estimate, on average, how important having those images are going to be to the parents. How serious is youth sports and little league baseball to the community and to the parents? 

- who is your client? What kind of community/socioeconomic status are the families who participate in little league? You don’t want to price yourself out of making any sales, but you also don’t want to go so low so as to devalue your skills and your labour.

Whenever I’m having trouble figuring out pricing, I ask friends who know nothing about photography/have never hired a photographer if $X sounds right to them. It’s kind of a rudimentary focus group that can help you dial in to a good figure.",1561939338

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I'm going to go against the grain here and write about my experience as a newbie to skincare--I used the sidebar when I first came here less than a year ago and actually found it INCREDIBLY helpful. Went to the section in the sidebar titled ""Start here"" and briefly read through the SCA routine. This put me on the right track immediately. Skipped to the ""holy grail product recs"" on moisturisers and read reviews there and picked out stuff that day. A few more holy grail recs later and I got more items for my routine. I did searches on SCA and some reading for everything else because I knew that probably seldom few questions would be unique to me.

Maybe I'm just an asshole but I find these issues endemic in all hobbies nowadays. If you start out wanting your hand held, I find you're always going to crave that desire for people to do your research for you or validate your opinions (is that a form of codependency?). My partner experiences it in his game dev groups (Hi, I'm new here, how do I go about making an entire game from start to finish?) and I experience it in my sewing groups (Hi, I'm new here, how do I start sewing?). Sometimes I just wish people would take a moment to compose themselves to shake off that initial ""Oh shit, I have no idea what I'm doing"", go forth, and try looking some stuff up on their own, then come back if they're really, really stuck and Google hath borne no fruit.

I'm not a jerk to people who do shout those questions into the vast void that is SCA, but after seeing my 12th ""recommend me a moisturiser"" thread in a week, I can totally see how ""good, honest questions"" can go unanswered. It takes a very kind, patient and unjaded person to answer those threads nowadays because they're here every day, and they probably wear the regulars down.",1561939339

Now if you fall in love with vaping and decide to take it up as a hobby that's great but different and usually comes later and involves rebuilda6bles and Sub-Ohm and DIY juice etc.... The worst part of a cigarette (other than bad health and eventual early death) is it's expensive you light it and subconsciously become programmed to smoke it until it's finished with vaping you only need to Vape what your craving needs when quitting.

Of course, the fact that this is Hegelian in spirit should suggest that it might not be as useful an insight on its own as suggested.

Troublingly, this argument isn’t going to be convincing to nearly anyone; in particular the antifa part of it doesn’t really follow from anything said. Our enemies undermine freedom so they must be stopped is not a particularly novel idea (and connecting freedom to society doesn’t really do much to make it more novel) and it quite clearly generalizes to anyone who is wrong about freedom whatsoever (against conservatives, soc dems, stalinists, mutualists, or individualist anarchists, and not just fascists). I can’t see why anyone who doesn’t already believe that violence is justified in some given case will suddenly think it is after this unless they really are as mystified about rights as right-libertarians or are totally unreflective pacifists. The former plausibly won’t agree with the argument given its talk of the social nature of freedom and the latter would change on being given almost any argument whatsoever.

Maybe I am wrong about the amount of people who would find this argument convincing, but I certainly don’t.",1561939340

I used my Canon Rebel and the Rokinon 14mm. 25 second and 30 second exposure, and a little bit of tuning in light room. 6400 ISO. I am well aware I should be doing a max of 23 seconds or so but the 30 second exposure gave me much more color. Star trailing wasn't the concern, I wanted the mass.  : ).

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt; Be a philosophy professor? Bad, very bad. That will never happen. Seriously, look very carefully at the job market. Studying philosophy with no plan outside of academia is unbelievably stupid -- unless you are independently wealthy, of course, and if that's the case, do whatever you want. 

This is...hyperbolic. If you get into a competitive PhD program, and you know that you're fairly good at writing, you can get a publication before the end of grad school and end up with a good chance at getting a job. You might need to bounce around, taking postdocs and temp jobs if necessary for several years. But chances are very realistic \*conditional on making it through a good PhD program\* that you will find gainful academic employment after two or three shots on the market.

If you ""look very carefully at the job market,"" you'll see that there are actually quite a lot of TT jobs at quality places hiring people fresh out of grad school. Like I said, it helps if you're from a top program (say, top 25). It also helps if you're willing to go on the market multiple times and willing to move around -- say, to Kansas or another country.

But ""that will never happen"" is a bit much. Half of my cohort got TT jobs after just 5 years in grad school. It happens.",1561939342

This has roughly been the set list (give or take a few substitutions here or there). The order may differ as well. Doing this list from memory.

Things have changed

It ain’t me babe 

Simple twist of fate 

Cry a while 

When I paint my masterpiece 

Honest with me 

Trying to get to heaven 

Thunder On the mountain 

Don’t think twice

 Like a Rolling Stone 

Early Roman Kings

Scarlet Town 

Make you feel my love 

Blowing in the wind 

Pay in blood 

Soon after midnight 

It takes a lot to laugh 

Serve somebody

Expect different arrangements that will wow you, don’t expect Bob’s vocal quality to be off the charts (although it is the best I have ever heard him in the ten years I have been going to shows) , the band and him play the hell out of their instruments and he more than likely will not say anything to the audience,

If the water in an aquarium goes sour quick (sudden spike of ammonia and nitrites) they go to the surface where there's more oxygen and some (like gourami) even start breathing the air instead. Gills and lungs are essentially the same structure just built differently to better suit their environments. The gills are in a medium where they have plenty of water but low oxygen, so they just have to worry about O2 and CO2 transfer efficiency and keeping certain solutes on either side of the membranes. Because of this the gills have evolved to just pass as much medium as possible across them to take up all the O2 they can. Lungs have the opposite circumstances where their medium is high in O2, but dry as a bone. So they were buried inside the body where they could better retain their moisture.",1561939345

In my experience, I have seen many people say that coming out is (always) “telling people about your sex life”. And that view drives me crazy. So I see I sort of read that into your comment where you didn’t intend it.

That said, I don’t think OP really caught your qualifiers— they didn’t indicate that they’re uninterested in a relationship with the same sex afaik, but they said they feel “gross” now. So I think OP may have misread it like I did.  But maybe they are in the same situation, who knows.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;The unarguable point I am making is all of these cities along the west coast have made this decline. Whether or not these are the only cities in the entire country like this is besides the point. 

You didn't say ""a handful of west coast cities are showing signs of decay and an increase in the homeless population"". Rather, you made a blanket statement about American cities as a whole. I'm responding to literally the exact thing you said. You don't have to get mad, you could have just clarified. 

&gt; Get the fuck out of my face. Dirty pseudo-intellectual, condescending ignorant piece of shit. I can say that with certainty because look where you are -- on reddit on the news sub

Isn't that...also...where...you are? (spidermanpointingatspiderman.jpg)

&gt; it doesn't exist unless you've seen it,

This was literally your argument, not mine. You said that your personal experience, not the data, is what matters.You also said ""I don't care if it's not a systematic problem greater than the west coast""

&gt;Because you ignore all of the normal American people.

And you're the one who defines ""normal American people""? I grew up in the middle of the middle class in a major American city. I couldn't possibly be more ""normal American"".

Here's some data on LA Homelessness: https://usc.data.socrata.com/stories/s/Homelessness-in-2018-A-Snapshot-of-Los-Angeles-Cou/g8ge-um6u/ 

Oh hey, look, it actually supports your claim about L.A. Will you ignore this data too? My only point is that blanket statements like ""our cities are decaying"" don't help anything. You're the one who's flipping out. ‾\_(ツ)_/‾

In the ps2 and psp era it didn't exist, you had to do the claw technique or mash L to keep the camera forward. In the 3DS era, it finally got one - but it was a camera snap, the same kind that Dauntless has now. Then in MHW it finally got a full lock-on (though technically, MHFU iOS had it some years earlier). You know... the game where MH finally came back to home consoles, so dual stick is the norm and longtime fans are already used to not having it. Hooray.

Now keep in mind that Dauntless was actually announced about a month before MHW and that's probably the reason why it wasn't released with a full lock-on system, at least.

Why it doesn't have one now, not sure. But I'm guessing they will add one at some point though, since they are going to port Dauntless to mobile eventually and it would be a nightmare to play on that without it.",1561939349

I have two ""best"" friends that I hang out with regularly and are my favorite people. I haven't seen them in a while so decided to set up a playdate playground and beach day with them. Susan asked me yesterday what I'm doing Sunday and invited me to go out with her and I explained I couldn't make it. The next morning when at a group event, she asked me if I knew of any fun play areas for her to take her kid. It was in front of me and one of my ""best"" friends. I didnt invite her, and neither did my other friend. We just made some recommendations of some other parks in the area that are pretty fun. 

I can tell that Susan really wanted to hang out but I didn't invite her. I seriously have seen Susan all day Saturday and in the morning Sunday. Is it really that bad that I want to hang out with my best friends without her? Am I not supposed to post photos of our playdate because I want to preserve her feelings even though I shouldn't invite her out of pity? Help me understand what is right.

Also, at what point did Craster become aware that the Others were taking his children if he was simply leaving them to die of exposure?

If you're okay with your size, and just want to look more defined, then cut. If you want to have more muscle, and get bigger, bulk a bit.  


The nice thing about bulking is when you gain muscle alongside some fat, it can contour your body to make you appear like you have a lower body fat %. Watch this and you'll get an idea what I'm talking about [https://youtu.be/tUBnGpe7Gd4?t=434](https://youtu.be/tUBnGpe7Gd4?t=434)",1561939352

My hand/eye coordination just isn't sensitive enough. My visual sensitivity is high, though. For example, I always play with v-sync on because I don't notice a difference as far as input lag goes but I *always* notice screen tearing no matter how small it may be and it drives me crazy. I also notice screen juddering caused by uneven pulldown when 24fps films are played on 60 fps TVs and bought a 120hz TV to get rid of that, but most people don't seem to notice that. I can spot a dead pixel from across the room and then can't ever ignore it. It's the reason why I got rid of my most recent monitor. My reaction time, though, isn't fast enough to notice input lag and that probably comes from not playing a lot of multi-player games that require those twitch responses many gamers have. I also didn't start gaming on PC until I was over 40, so my reflexes were already shot by then and wouldn't notice input lag no matter what I was playing on. Any game that relies on pure reflexes I'm pretty bad at, like online shooters. I'm good at Dark Souls games because I can fall back on strategy and perseverance, but Sekiro fucking kicks my ass because my reflexes just aren't there.

"streamentry","t5_3f7zb","They are indeed similar in purpose, both use our ""issues"" to find a sense of wholeness. I started with Core Transformation as that was before Wholeness Work was a thing.

Core Transformation uses the metaphor of ""parts"" as in ""part of me wants to do this, and part of me doesn't."" The method is basically having an experiential dialogue with parts of yourself, asking them ""what do you want?"" For instance if a part is angry, it might want respect. Then you invite it to step into having respect, feeling what that's like, and ask ""what do you want through having respect that's even deeper?"" You continue getting answers, stepping into them, and asking ""what do you want that's even deeper?"" until you get an answer that has nothing deeper. This is some sort of state of being like OKness, Joy, Universal Love, etc. Since you were doing the process experientially, this is not an intellectual exercise but an experience, often quite powerful, of this state at the ""core"" of what this part is wanting. Then you realize that you don't need to go through all those steps in that particular order to get that state of being, just step into it and claim it as your own, and then use it to reorient yourself towards the previous things this part was wanting, and finally change the original context (such as the context in which you were getting angry).

That alone is really useful, but there are also some additionally useful elements in the method. One is that since the model if of ""parts,"" you can work with multiple parts as in the example I gave before of part of me wants to do this, part of me doesn't, thus resolving inner conflict and creating the conditions for inner peace. This is one of the biggest benefits I experienced, as I had LOTS of inner objecting parts, which interfered with everything in my life including inner work and meditation.

Wholeness Work is similar in some ways, except instead of a ""parts"" metaphor, it uses the idea of self-inquiry, the ""who am I?"" kind of thing. But instead of ""who"" the question is ""where?"" Specifically, ""where is the 'I' that gets angry?"" or whatever it is you are working with. This is also a very experiential process, so you might for instance locate the ""I"" in the forehead, about an inch in diameter, with a pressure pushing inwards, dense, and with a black color. Then you either realize that this isn't who you truly are, because duh you aren't a 1"" diameter sensation of pressure in your forehead, so you can again ask ""where is the 'I' that is aware of this?"" and so on, until you get nothing else but a wide-open Awareness, or some very diffuse sensation that you can easily invite to dissolve into a wide-open Awareness. And then you can dissolve the previous ""I's"" as well as the original sensation (e.g. anger in the chest) and the real-life situation will also often change as a result. You can also use this method more as a meditation, so for instance working with an energetic sensation in the body, then looking for the ""I"" that is aware of that, etc.

Most people find Core Transformation is somewhat more challenging to self-facilitate, because it has more steps and specific wording, whereas Wholeness Work is easier to facilitate. I found CT relatively easy myself though. Both can also be facilitated with others, and I do that work with clients too. And both methods treat all ""obstacles"" as doorways to greater integration, rather than something to be ignored or pushed away or labeled as bad or wrong, etc. So they end up very kind and gentle processes.",1561939355

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","The small deliverables method is a good suggestion to figure out if this can work longterm. I'd also scrutinize the artist a bit to make sure they're legit. For example, if they have a history of finished paid work with clients, some sort of professional web presence, etc. Those freelance sites often attract people who go for quantity over quality, so be wary of any freelancers on those sites who seem like they take on too many projects at once.

Also, I think its much easier to work with artists whose existing portfolio looks similar to what you're looking for. Sure, artists can mimic other styles, but it's way less iteration time if you get someone who can do it right off the bat. It's worth taking the extra time to look for someone like that. With that in mind, if you still have a bunch of failed tests after testing people with similar styles to your ref...then you might need to consider if you're paying too little for what you're looking for.",1561939356

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","You don't want to be trying to create the slope with thinset. Or at least I wouldn't want to. Though if you are old school, you could do it with deck mud and screed it off to the proper slope; that would likely be workable and a lot easier if the plywood is in good shape. And then put the rest of the stuff on top of it. 

I'd use ditra and kerdi on the seams.

"musicians","t5_2qh2l","Yes, play! Why not? Wouldn’t it enrich your life [correct answer is yes]? 

Yes, absolutely, anxiety can get in the way of playing (or doing anything!) unselfconsciously. 

You’re right, animals don’t question themselves. (But it’s that very capacity for reflection that makes us slightly special animals!) 

There are people who are OBSESSED with music. (My SO is like that. Holy crap. All music talk all day.) That’s fine.  There are others with a broader range of interests and that’s great. 

You can have more than one interest, and be a musician at whatever level interests you. 

Depression, well. I hope you have good help available, it sucks. 

Instrument choice: you might feel more rewarded, sooner, by the guitar than the piano because I think it takes less work to get to a level where you’re no longer embarrassed to play in public. If you learn the guitar, you can probably also pick up bass at some point pretty easily. Or change your mind. This is opinion, but arguably, with (classical) piano you’re getting a more complete (physical) overview of the structures of music than with most other instruments because you’re playing all the parts, so that’s handy.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","The most important thing in the matchup that differs from other assassin matchups is his shadow. His shadow not only serves as his gapcloser, he can use it to dodge, apply a slow, and most importantly his double shirks. Zed's damage is extremely stunted when he can't hit the shirks and you should use that to your advantage. 

On Yasuo, look to take extended trades agaisnt him once his shadow is down. You can get multiple Q's and autos off easily in the space it takes him to get his Q back up for a second rotation of spells.Specifically on Yasuo, you can also utilize the enemy minion wave to very effectively dodge double shirks by waiting till after the ult, E'ing off to the side, and windwalling back towards the minion wave. It makes it difficult for him to hit double shirks, with the easiest one being a shirk coming from a followup W shadow. 

On Talon, baiting out the shadow is absolutely necessary since if you miss one part of the W, you will auto lose the trade. However, consider roaming on Talon instead. You have superior wave clear so look to grab the standard early Tiamat and Mobis, and just leave the lane.",1561939362

If you wouldn't say I'm a ""homosexualist,"" (and, honestly, of course you wouldn't), it may be easier to see why it's better to say a trans man, or a trans woman or a trans person - it's an adjective that describes a thing that's true about someone, in much the same way that I'm a gay man.

Now that we're in an upswing, its harder to answer because its a riskier bet.    It feels like a more sure thing because of all the excitement by people who are getting richer and richer, however actually it's the same gamble but with worse odds.

Buying when there's a pullback (like now) is better than buying when there's FOMO going on.    But we don't know how deep or how long the correction will cut, so you definitely need to not put any money in that you need in order to live on, otherwise you'll likely end up forced to sell at a loss.

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","The entire post is false and shows the mentality of people that play this game. 1 - listening to the community? I get it, you hate RG, it's the most complained thing, yet its balanced with it short range. A pekka or any high damage cards can attack it before it can hit the tower twice. 2 - they are continually adding so many more functions to make it easier for F2P players. There are wars, trophy road, increased chest opening boosts, tournaments/challenges, quests... 3 - What is proper matchmaking? Sorry you may be more skilled than someone else allowing you to be a higher trophy range with lower level cards compared to the average player. Clearly you are going to hit a wall with higher lvls that keeps you at a trophy range. Play challenges if card levels affect your gameplay so much, but I assume you'll complain that you don't get enough gems for free to play 5 challenges a day. Also, considering the game is played by kids and adults, an adult may understand card interactions quicker than kids and move up trophy range with lower level cards. 4 - What are no skills cards? A card that has a mechanic in the game that in not counter-able by you deck may seem unfair, but that it part of the game. Imagine you play Giant/witch/rage, but the opponent has bowler, baby dragon and tornado? I assume improper matchmaking forces this matchup 100% too... 5 - Nerfing the best tank killer in the game without touching its range or health, forces timing to be most important. Inferno dragon is still in the game, so you can work towards countering a golem with a positive elixir trade. Based on the amount of ""humor"" posts about SC, players would find something to complain about even if SC made everyone's cards maxed for free.",1561939367
"MMORPG","t5_2qlxw","I actually really like WoW's art style, especially some of the newer zones.

One of, if not my biggest gripe with ffxiv is how awful the environment textures are (grass, rocks, etc.), which makes a lot of the zones feel really bland to me.

[Example 1](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mdGTAVV77v0/VY4fNq7T24I/AAAAAAAAFnw/as0hRt2Xk4w/s1600/ffxiv_06272015_114952.png)

[Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/erEjTHB.jpg)

[Example 3](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/5/5b/FFXIV_The_Lochs_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170626113302)

[Example 4](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/2/20/FFXIV_The_Peaks_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20170624154808)

[Example 5](http://ff14angler.com/img/ss/ss090204_00.jpg)

So many of them have bland ground textures with little to no foliage then a backdrop of ctrl+v'd miscellaneous rock texture. Hell, they don't look too far off the sort of thing I might have made in RTS map editors 15 years ago.

There are certainly some exceptions but so many of these zones feel completely lifeless to me, which is a shame because the character models, armor, spell effects, objects, etc. are mostly pretty good looking.

For comparision, here are some of the newer zones from wow:

Kids ""reviewing"" toys, parents and kids going out and the parents are vlogging it, ""-kid- tries -food- for the first time!!!"" ""Kids react to -video-!""

Everything else I watch on Youtube has to do with cats, robots, video games or tarantulas, but I never get anything recommended to me for watching those topics it's only ever kid crap.",1561939370

Seriously though I challenge you to go back and watch something like Sequelitis and imagine it without swearing. Shit's just not as fuckin' funny yo.

One moment that has really stuck with me from Sequelitis, or anything for that matter, is when Arin is comparing Castlevania items to the whip and talks about the ""shrub seaweed whatevers that fall from the ceiling and crawl along the ground like a dumbass."" His use of the word ""dumbass"" and his delivery of it *makes* that whole little segment. Not only does his delivery make me laugh to this day, it actually helps me remember the point he was making about game design (the criticism of including superfluous items like the holy water when the whip kills the seaweed whatevers just as effectively). I can't imagine that joke working, or even being a joke at all, without that exact word choice.

Look at South Park. It has been and remains one of the smartest, funniest (probably *the* funniest and smartest) satirical cartoons ever made. It also happens to be the most vulgar, violent, and profane satirical cartoon ever made. Could South Park be just as smart and funny without the vulgarity and profanity...I highly doubt it, but maybe. But why would you alter what is so deeply ingrained in the show's identity? At any rate, it would certainly cease to be South Park.

"cyberpunk2020","t5_2w09w","It is implied you cannot use melee weapons with martial arts.  
That said, there are situations where having a weapon is better than having 10 years of Araska-Te under your belt.  
Specifically parrying. Using a weapon to parry puts it's ""life"" on the line as opposed to your own. As the weapon's damage output increases, the chance that it breaks does as well. Using a club or chair does collective damage to the it until it breaks guaranteeing a shield for a few turns, while a sword dealing 2d6 has a 1 in 5 chance of breaking each time it parries (without collecting damage.)  
Monoweapons then deal up to 4d6 damage, doubling on a nat 10 and bringing down armor to a third of it's former self, with a high chance of shattering on a parry. 

It all comes down to the situations you feel you may get into. Leather-wrapped gangers fall quickly to a solid choke or a monoblade, but can easily handle other attacks, while a martial arts master wouldn't stand a chance against a slippery duelist or a 10mm slug.

At the company I’m at (part of a statewide chain), I’m in a position where I’m on the phone, dealing with and helping customers. One of my coworkers, Hal, is 58 and has been with the company for 15 years; I have worked with him 4 of those years. He’s very close friends with our manager and is held in high respect due to his long time at the company and solid performance.

For the first two years I knew him, he was perfectly normal. But over the past two years, we all started to notice a change in his behavior/personality/performance. Conversations with him started to become very awkward and unusual; he started to become extremely forgetful, slow, and clumsy; he began to say things that were offensive/inappropriate without even realizing it; and just in general, it was clear there was something “off” with him that wasn’t off before.

A little under a year ago, it came out that Hal was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. He is super private about the whole thing and refuses to talk about it with anyone. He has a very strong work ethic, is very bent on keeping his job and making all the money he can until he’s absolutely unable to work anymore. My manager (who is very close friends with Hal) has been supportive of Hal’s continued employment. Corporate does **not** know about Hal’s condition as far as I’m aware, and he’s tried to keep it as much of a secret as possible.

I respect Hal’s devotion to his job, but in the past year, he has been racking up an unbelievable number of complaints from customers. I know because complaints circulate pretty quickly where I work, and many people have called to complain to me about him. He often won’t be able to answer basic questions or provide information to customers; he’ll forget people’s info and make them repeat it over and over; and just seems slow and out of it in general. Customers have been questioning “what’s wrong with that man” and some have used quite choice words to describe him.

Despite this, my manager has kept Hal on board, and has told my coworkers who question this decision to mind their own business &amp; “worry about themselves and their own performance.” Hal’s performance does affect us though; we have to deal with all the complaints and mad customers, and if our local branch loses business, that’s pretty shitty for all of us too. And while I’m very sympathetic towards Hal, I believe that someone shouldn’t be employed in a position if they can’t do the basic work required for that position.

I sent an anonymous email to our company’s corporate leadership, explaining Hal’s condition and how it’s affected his performance. Soon afterwards, he ended up being terminated (I assume with benefits and a severance package, considering the situation). My manager is furious about the whole thing and has been yearning to know which one of us “ratted him out.” I feel I did the right thing. Was I the asshole to “rat” Hal out?

&gt; Our recent investigation into a campaign to put pro-Brexit letters in local newspapers led to a flurry of online comments.

&gt; In itself that is not unusual, but many of these comments were abusive, while others accused us of a conspiracy.

&gt; They came in response to our two stories on a suspected fake persona spreading messages through regional media.

I get what Nintendo was trying to do with this restriction, but it seems pointless to me. Level creators have to complete the level from each checkpoint anyway, so there's no way to make the goal unattainable for players who start from a checkpoint. I made a level where the goal was to defeat the Boo at the end, in a sort of boss fight, and the stage itself was filled with tricky platforming, exactly the sort of thing that would benefit from having checkpoints placed in a couple spots. But nope, Nintendo didn't want me placing them.

Another restriction, although minor, is the fact that levels that heavily feature the sun/moon can't really have checkpoints, given that the sun/moon only becomes active when it appears on screen, and the fact that you can only have one per area. I mean, you can get around this by using a sub-area, with a checkpoint at the beginning, but it's still limiting.",1561939372

"options","t5_2r8rv","First of all, all things are never equal.    
At the very least, there are after hours markets pushing the underlying around.   

Second, theta is a mere rate.   
Coming from an estimate generated by a model. 
Typically reported as a daily rate.   
An instantaneous rate, always changeable.  
This rate changes with the change in extrinsic value of the option. With more extrinsic value to decay away, the model will calculate a higher decay rate of decay to ultimately extinguish extrinsic value; after a drop in extrinsic value, a lower rate of decay.  According to the model.  

When the extrinsic value is going up for whatever reason, the rate of theta decay may be rendered invisible, if the rate of increase of extrinsic value caused by market factors is larger than the theta decay rate and the value of a long option increases instead of declines (even if the underlying price stays the same).  During moments of market-caused extrinsic value crush, the theta decay rate is overwhelmed and augmented by market factors greater than the theta rate.   

Think of this rate reading like a speedometer.   
Metaphorically, the speedometer can register as 10 miles an hour but also  the road itself is moving, and the road may be moving backwards 15 miles an hour.  

Or also metaphorically, a boat may be traveling  a water speed of 10 knots, but doing so against a 15 knot tidal flow.   Ultimately the boat will reach the expiration destination, but may be astray in the interim, according to the single measure of theta decay.   

The rate of theta decay is not an adequate measure for the entirety of the position. 

Market makers have to pay interest on their inventory or inventory hedges over the weekend, and will attempt to obtain values to carry that cost; they may not succeed on highest volume options, where other market participants' orders and activity may overwhelm their efforts to manipulate prices.   

Don't let theta decay be the only guiding principal to a trade.  

There apparently are some studies that others here have cited, that I have not read, that realized decay may be slightly less than predicted by a model over the weekend.

"MurderedByWords","t5_3hx3r","Thats because the vast majority of muslims dont strongly adhere to all the tenets of islam. They use secular morals to cherry pick “good” beliefs from those that are “bad”. For instance, death is mandated by the quran [4:89] and the hadith for apostates, and while [some countries](https://www.indy100.com/article/the-countries-where-apostasy-is-punishable-by-death--Z110j2Uwxb) still outlaw apostasy, the average muslim would neither enforce nor espouse this belief. Same goes for quran [5:38]. Extremists are those who actually follow the quran to the T. The problem doesnt lie with muslims as people, but with the vile, stone age ideas of islam that inspired 9/11, the hebdo attacks, etc. Its true most muslims arent terrorists, but how far does your head have to be up your ass to think its a coincidence that most terrorists are muslim?",1561939374

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","I think the situation with UNRWA is a pretty good example of this more aggressive negotiating stance that Friedman, Greenblat, Kushner are championing.  Off and on for decades the USA has taken the position that UNRWA should be resettling the refugees and acting more like UNHRC.  UNRWA has consistently refused.  At the same time its been allowed to operate unhindered.  Finally they have informed UNRWA that refusal is not an option and they can comply or be dismantled and replaced.  

Donald Trump and Jared Kushner are North East real estate guys.  In the North East commonly big projects have a government sanction called [eminent domain](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/eminent_domain) which is where the holder of a property gets an above market price (say 125%) and the property gets taken for better public usage.  The goal is to avoid problems like Japan had with that chicken farmer who wouldn't sell his farm sitting on some of the most expensive real estate in the world.   

The Palestinians have a series of claims with widespread acceptance.  The world has tried to have the Palestinians negotiate in good faith where they trade these claims away for compensation from Israel in other areas and a reasonable deal is struck which both sides could live with.  The Oslo process was designed to be very much like a negotiated purchase.   That has proven impossible.   Almost immediately the Palestinians diverted from Oslo and instead started insisting on the 1967 Soviet / UN position.  Trust has been destroyed....  In the meanwhile Palestinians have insisted that they have an unlimited right to cause pubic harm essentially forever until a deal (purchase) meeting their crazy criteria is made.  

Eminent domain is designed to handle exactly this sort of situations in the USA.    I believe Kushner / Trump aren't asking the Palestinians what the policy will be they are telling them.    You are getting X in exchange for Y.  You can offer an X' to replace X but  failure to arrive at a deal means this deal sticks.  

Kushner holding this meeting without Abbas is making it clear.  Eminent domain has been invoked.  Abbas' agreement is not needed.",1561939376

- “boundary issues at 23” are not uncommon for people who have always lived with family. That’s no indication of disabilities unless you are really fishing hard. Even the 2-3 year emotional development delay that other people brought up as a frequent part of ADHD would put him at emotionally 20 years old. That’s old enough to say that this kind of behavior is unacceptable, and needs to be learned. 

But I said nothing at all about “tough love” — though I could point you to some studies about where and when tough love actions are appropriate, since your assumption that it’s only assholes and tv that use them is just as woefully uninformed. 

- “a lot of people at that age are similarly useless”. — I stand by this comment, with the caveat that I was one of them. Perhaps the least stable you will ever be is in your mid-20s. People do a lot of phenomenally stupid things then. I could tell you stories. 

Before this, it’s not uncommon for regularly adjusted people to still not know how to actually live with other people. My prior comments are all built on common roommate complaints. 

I should also note that I don’t have distaste (or hatred) for anyone here, this I think is where you’re reading super deep (methinks the lady Roth protest too much...) into a tone that doesn’t exist. Sure, the kid has to be pretty terrible to live with. But I was that way once, and since I didn’t need to constantly prove myself right all the time, I was able to change. 

Your (deleted) tirade about how his parents are terrible people “for not accepting their responsibility in raising him” (or however you put it) was as judged as it was foolish. At 23, even with a mild delay (which is not definite), the OP was in fact acting like a disciplinarian in a situation where such a role had become a necessity due to the son’s egregious behavior. Say it how you want... she’s the mom, it’s her house, she’s the impartial middleman, whatever — she attempted to resolve an ongoing problem. He doubled down. She did too. 

Your insinuation that she only acted as she did due to wanting sex from her fiancée (only out so much more crudely) is a bigger and more obnoxious assumption than any other you made. 

The fact is... attempting to deal with the situation was a parenting move. That was taking responsibility and attempting to teach. He rejected it. 

Honestly... there’s so much you’re assuming here that it’s unlikely we will agree on anything here. You’re making up an expanded version of what’s going on here with sparse evidence, and seem defensive. I doubt you’ll have much more to offer.",1561939378

"Inception","t5_2rsce","No, they never said they were going into Cobb’s subconscious. The reason why Cobb knew that Mal would have Fischer is that Cobb and Mal have been to limbo before—which means that the structures they built together while in limbo would still exist if one (or both) of them were ever to return there. Limbo is “raw, infinite subconscious” so technically, it consists of the subconsciouses of whoever’s down there.

And it’s not so much *clarified* that the maximum amount of dream levels is three as it is *implied.* The fact that a such a powerful sedative was necessary for just three layers of dreaming suggests that any more than three dream layers would be so unstable that it simply isn’t possible.",1561939378
"teenagers","t5_2rjli","She first sent nudes to my best friend who is a pussy magnet. She later found out that my best friend has a girlfriend. She came to me all sad and heartbroken. She asked me if I knew he had a girlfriend. I said... no. We had already become friends since we shared a lot of interests. We sent eachother pictures during the night. She started taking pictures of her underwear. I got the hint and started taking pictures of mine and then she sent pictures with her fingers under her underwear. I did the same thing.

She then sent me a video. A beautiful fucking video where she is fingering herself and you can hear her quietly moan and you can also hear her pussy and shit like that. I heard from my friend that she had a really nice rack so I sent s shirtless pic of me in bed and said ""It's unfair that I'm the only one shirtless"". She sent me pictures of her shirt on the ground. Then a picture of her tits but covering the nipples and then finally pics of her fully nude awesome tits. I also asked for ass pics and she delivered. The lesson you can take from this is to first find common interests with the girl, make sure she likes to send nudes and if you have the chance be her rebound guy. And yeah she sent me nudes like this for quite some time",1561939378

"canucks","t5_2qrs7","Yooo no one has really talked about them yet, but you should check out some Sedin highlights.   
Their story is pretty crazy, and definitely necessary knowledge for any Canucks fan.   
Twin brothers, drafted 2nd and 3rd overall by some crazy draft magic, they just ended their careers at the end of the 2017/2018 season. Retired with over a thousand points each, they helped reinvent the modern game in a lot of ways over the course of their career through their innovative, **highly** skilled, damn near telepathic abilities and playmaking. The best brother duo in the NHL's history (unless you count Gretzky and his brother who had like 3 points in the NHL), played with each other for their entire careers.    
In 2011, they along with some amazingly talented and colourful teammates, were robbed of a Stanley cup by the Boston Bruins and brutal officiating.   
""Oh come on now, every team complains bad reffing""  some folks would say, and 9/10 times they'd be right. But let me hit you with some of the bullshit: One of the refs SON played on that Bruins team, but he recused himself so it's all good (barf). One of our players got a ***4*** game suspension for a late hit. In a SCF you're supposed to multiply it by some number, 3 or 4 I think, to get the equivalent regular season games, so like 12 or 16 if it wasn't the playoffs. It's pretty fucking rare to get 12 game suspension for a late hit.   
  
But the real icing on the cake (and this is where we jump back to the Sedins from my ""should probably let it go but the kid needs to know"" rage filled rant), is when Daniel Sedin got a 10 minute game misconduct penalty for talking back to the ref. His back talk? Asking why no penalty was called moments early when he was getting punched in the head by Brad Marchand repeatedly, after play had stopped.  
So yeah, we burned our city down after that. Literally. Again. (The riot is a whole other thing, some people came prepared to riot win or lose, not real Canucks fans ((hashtag gatekeeping)), just people wanting to take advantage of our reputation from the last time we rioted in 94 after losing to the Rangers. Then alcohol, emotions, and mob mentality did the rest.)   
   
But seriously, watch some [Sedin highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz6dRT_Wf68) and then fucking throw your hands up and rejoice because Elias Pettersson has the IQ, creativity, and skill to play like both of them combined and help lead us to Saint Stanley's promise land.",1561939381

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Apesar da pressão do músico Roger Waters e do movimento Boicote, Desinvestimento e Sanções contra Israel, o cantor e compositor Milton Nascimento realizou neste domingo (30) o show “Clube da Esquina” em Tel Aviv.

 “Shalom, Tel Aviv”, disse Milton a um público de cerca de 2.000 pessoas. Ovacionado, ele não falou nada sobre política durante o show de duas horas. Produtor do show, o brasileiro Daniel Ring, que vive em Israel, apresentou Milton afirmando que se tratava da “concretização de um sonho de amor e paz de um grupo de amigos”.

 Numa carta, Roger Waters cobrava a reação de Milton a apelos que ele cancelasse a passagem de sua turnê por Israel. No sábado (29), Milton [publicou em suas redes sociais uma resposta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/06/milton-nascimento-responde-a-roger-waters-horas-antes-de-tocar-em-israel.shtml) à [mensagem enviada pelo ex-Pink Floyd](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/06/roger-waters-escreve-carta-a-milton-nascimento-para-que-ele-cancele-show-em-israel.shtml), um dos maiores apoiadores do BDS, que pressiona artistas a não se apresentarem em Israel alegando que o país comete crimes contra os palestinos.

 “Pouquíssimas vezes declinei de um convite. Afinal de contas, todo artista deve ir aonde o povo está, não é mesmo?”, escreveu Milton, depois de visitar Jerusalém. “Durante a ditadura militar brasileira eu jamais deixei de tocar no meu país. Então, por que eu deixaria de tocar agora? Por que deixaria de compartilhar experiências de amor e mudança enquanto acontece no Brasil um governo de extrema-direita? Mesmo divergindo das ideias de um governo, jamais abandonarei meu público.”

 Em quase todos os shows da parte internacional da turnê (Reino Unido, Holanda, Espanha e Portugal), houve protestos de manifestantes contra o show em Israel. “Teve manifestaçõezinhas no final de vários shows. Sempre com meia dúzia de pessoas”, contou o produtor musical brasileiro Manitu Szerman, da Yellow Noises, responsável pelos shows na Europa.

 Em 12 de junho, o BDS publicou um pedido público em sua página na internet com o título “Milton: a voz que vem do coração diz não ao apartheid”. A ONG lembra que o cantor Caetano Veloso, após se apresentar em Tel Aviv em 2015, [anunciou que nunca mais tocaria em Israel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2015/11/1703012-visitar-israel-para-nao-mais-voltar-a-israel-por-caetano-veloso.shtml#article-aside). 

 O BDS também afirma que, em 2018, [Gilberto Gil cancelou sua apresentação em Tel ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/05/gilberto-gil-cancela-show-em-tel-aviv-apos-israel-matar-palestinos-em-gaza.shtml)[Aviv](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/05/gilberto-gil-cancela-show-em-tel-aviv-apos-israel-matar-palestinos-em-gaza.shtml) “após os massacres de palestinos em Gaza perpetrados por Israel”. Mas Gil negou que o cancelamento tivesse a ver com o BDS e afirmou que se apresentou em Israel mais de dez vezes.",1561939381

"SmashBrosUltimate","t5_kcmhp","Ike. Every time, Ike.
I can go on for hours about why Ike is by far the best starter character in the game, but the main reason is his horizontal recovery. His recovery can help people who are unaccustomed to platform fighters understand how to stay on the stage. 
The other thing I think Ike is great at is explaining how percentage works. Since he’s heavy-ish fighter, I think a player will start to recognize how different moves can give different damage, and being heavy will also explain fighter weight classes. 
His special moves (aside from Up special) are player friendly as hell, especially having a counter. A counter helps a beginner who is being overwhelmed with attacks understand how and when to use certain special moves. I find counters to be better explanations to this than yelling “no, you have to press up b when you’re off the stage” since it’s less negative (losing a stock and whatnot) 
Finally, with him being a sword fighter (That isn’t a March clone or has gimmicks, CLOUD and SHULK), it gives him a good range to deal with opponents from a safer distance than say, Ryu or Falcon.

I mean, if they wanted to actually take it, yeah.

But you know there's this giant gun in Azshara pointed right at it?  That thing's not being built for show.  Depending on how powerful it is (and imagine if they juiced it up with Azerite), it could blast Stormwind to rubble.  (Remember that scene we saw, I think way back in MoP, of Stormwind with a gaping hole in it?  Something like that.)

Then Sylvanas sails in and raises the masses of dead to be unthinking undead bound to her will, just like she did on the fields of Lordaeron.

And now suddenly Stormwind is lost, a lot of lives are lost, and Sylvanas has a much larger army.

But heck, if the cannon's potent enough to do a blast that'd wreck the city and the harbor, it'd be better to try to get the Alliance fleet (well, the maybe two or three ships they *might* have left at this point, much like the Horde ""fleet"") there and take it out as well.  Kind of like how Garrosh waited to get as much of the Alliance's military and top commanders into Theramore as possible before nuking it... which still seems to have missed taking out any of the top commanders (only to have Admiral Taylor die off-screen on alt-Draenor, which, even though I'm more Horde than Alliance, still bothers me).",1561939384

Couple that with the evasive but emotionally charged language they used with Cate and Tyler (i.e. giving Catelynn a bracelet so they'll always be connected; going along with Bethany's sales pitch of a wide open arrangement that would allow both Cate and Tyler to play active roles in Carly's life) and I just don't believe their motives to be as pure as they've been portrayed.",1561939384

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because you did not include a minimum of one required tag in the title.

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive &amp; spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct &amp; incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets &amp; capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

I filled the pot about 2/3 of the way up with a perlite/pumice mixture and a little bit of soil, and then basically placed a plant and covered the roots up with the same mix. It was plant/cover until I had all of them generally where I wanted and thankfully the pumice/perlite was pretty forgiving if I needed anything to move slightly. I also found that a chopstick is a huge help for the tiny work! That or [this set](https://www.amazon.com/Ginsco-Succulent-Transplanting-Miniature-Gardening/dp/B01D88DLB0), the tweezers and little scoop are also very useful.

"politics","t5_2cneq","While trafficking, selling and violent crimes while under the influence are separate and nuanced issues, general drug usage needs to become decriminalized. 

Drug use is a health issue, not a criminal one. You won't help Jennifer's meth addiction by locking her in prison. You won't stop Steve from being criminally neglectful to his daughter by putting him prison over heroin. Chris and Joanne were found high on MDMA, LSD, and marijuana, the solution is to either drive them home or put them in a recreational drug use equivalent of a drunk tank so they can be safely monitored as they come down off the drugs, or even sleep it off; maybe play them some Hendrix or Tool. How could prison possibly be the answer to Chris and Joanne?

For serious addiction the way to go is enforced rehab - in a proper national rehabilitation hospital - like the Portuguese do which has shown signs of decreasing drug addiction. You should feel safe going to a doctor or a police officer and telling them you need help. They will take you to a rehab facility, which will be filled with doctors and nurses who are trained to help you with your addiction, your many probable relapses and maybe even send you to someone who can help you get a job afterwards.

I now hope the devs will continue to see these, but also other people, to look at what I believe since I like to go over the details a lot and see what it lacks in order to make it better.

Also I forgot to mention the errors in your summarization. Namely, about No One Left Behind to say change values TO, not BY as it makes it look like you’re adding that much to the current values. And Father’s Glasses, where it states that you can see Auras while phasing. This is not what I said. I said you can see Survivor’s Auras while phasing as in, if their Auras are being revealed by BBQ &amp; Chili, Father’s Glasses will still allow you to see them. This may be me and my way of saying things, but I’m asking you to change it please to not confuse anyone else.

Edit: I’ve rewritten one of the changes for Father’s Glasses to state it removes the “not seeing Survivor’s Auras while phasing” condition.

Edit 2: I think I’m going to have to reupload this post: too many people have saw the error and think of the Father’s Glasses change as something else than what it is.

The axi4 interconnect product guide (pg095) says that with 16 save interfaces, it can do 512b wide bus at 130 MHz on an artix-7 and 230 MHz on a Kintex-7.  If there isn't a clock domain crossing, it looks like 3 clock cycles of latency.  That's some serious throughput.

"AMD_Stock","t5_3fr05","That only works either if earnings can keep growing exponentially for the foreseeable future and beyond, or if the market has a bubble mentality.

Say in a normal market a stock trades at 8 P/E. But then the Fed puts out a QE or some other means of increasing money supply, the whole market moves up. Now its P/E stays at 10. Market moves up again because that's where the money goes. Stock's P/E is now always hovering around 12. Next year it's 15. Then 18, 20, 25, 30, 40. Now it LOOKS LIKE the company is doing tremendously well because it sustains P/E ratios of 40 on both good and bad days.

Smells like a dream company right? But what if I told you this can happen to a company with basically flat earnings? When there is always more and more and more money in the market, this is precisely what happens. Doesn't meant the fundamentals justify it.

Let me put it another way: Over the past 60 years, the top 10% wealthiest has increased its wealth by more than 100% of the wealth created by the economy. Which means the ""bottom"" 90% (the vast, vast majority of people) are poorer now than 60 years ago. There HAS been wealth creation, but only for the already rich.

Who's got a lot of money in the stock market? Not the bottom 50%, that's for sure. It should be obvious that the top 10% owns MOST of the stock market. Where did their increased wealth go? Well for sure, some of it goes into the stock market. These are the guys pushing the bubble higher.

But sooner or later the reset must come. SOMETHING happens that makes people second-guess a 500 billion market cap company whose earnings grow at single digits, but that trades at 30x EPS. In 2008 it was the MBS debacle.

Take a lesson from that event if you must: what happened? The money supply grew through mortgages sold to people who couldn't afford them, and then those mortgages were rolled into securities that were given an AAA credit rating but ran a relatively high ""guaranteed"" fixed income return. The fixed income investors gobbled up all that bad debt, putting it into pension funds, mutual funds, 401(k), life insurance policies, and so on.

When job exports hurt the economy too much, people started defaulting on their mortgages and the whole market blew up. Stocks that were trading at 40x EPS went to 4x EPS. Not because their fundamentals had changed. Because there was a bubble that got burst. That cost the American public $5,000 billion. That is a big freaking number.

Basically, this era of QE from the Fed ensures that we will get boom and bust cycles. Bubble, burst. Again and again. It simply can't be otherwise, when there is more money in the monetary system than the system's players know what to do with. We are right now at the end of a bubble cycle.

"genderqueer","t5_2r1c3"," You're saying a lot of stuff that I really relate to. I'll start with your first question.

I'm in a similar position. I'm 28 and amab and only just came out to myself after a couple of years of questioning. I too have been figuring out how I want my identity to affect my life. I've kind of come to the conclusion that I want to change the vibe I give off, so that people will see me as simultaneously masculine and feminine without thinking too much of it. I'm mostly doing this by wearing womens versions of traditionally mens clothing (high waisted or cropped pants, tighter fitting tops, tucking tops in, that kind of thing) and allowing myself to hold myself in a slightly more feminine way (which has always been comfortable for me, but I've been deeply self-conscious about all my life while I've been trying to play the role of a man). Because most people don't think about non-binary identities, no-one's going to think of me all that differently, and because I have a wife people won't even really think I'm gay. But I do think they'll perceive me differently in a way they may not even realise consciously. I am out to a few of my closest friends too though. You can keep it subtle, is what I'm saying.

To your second question, no, I don't think it's a symptom of something else. Everything you said could be symptoms of you having always been non-binary and not known it. For example, I think it's more likely that you would feel distant from your father at least in part because you don't identify with the gender he is explicitly and implicitly trying to socialise you into, than that you've subconsciously constructed a new gender identity just to spite him. Not knowing how to channel your sexual energy towards those you're attracted to is a pretty clear symptom of being non-binary too. If you haven't allowed yourself to express your gender identity, then why would you have figured out how do that? I've opened up new channels of expression since coming out to myself, and I now really do feel simultaneously straight and gay for my wife. Feminine energy is powerful stuff. Unleash that shit, it's amazing!

It's really common to have doubts about being non-binary, and I think almost everyone here gets that. There's no real social-scaffolding for our kind of identity; no room made for us; almost no messages of affirmation from the broader culture, and almost everything to the contrary.

tl;dr - Everything you've said makes way more sense from the perspective of you definitely being non-binary than it does otherwise. I really hope this is the beginning of some really exciting and positive development for you, and I hope to see you round on this and other boards!",1561939388

* #Please close this thread once the trade is done by clicking 'closed' or 'mark as nsfw', and optionally, edit your post to specify what was sold and for how much. Doing so would immensely help out some of your fellow traders who might be looking to buy/sell the same games.

"OculusQuest","t5_p2wzd","The ""curve"" of battery drain is different, because the Quest is trying to guess at the remaining battery percentage based mostly off voltage drop.

Because rechargeables are 1.2V, they look to drain quickly at first but then very slowly at the end, because they look like a partially drained alkaline right from the start.

I used rechargeables and mine went from 100% to 60% very quickly (like just a couple hours), but then stayed around 50-60% for a long long time.  That's normal.

All that matters is total usage before death.  A rechargeable or an alkaline will have the same total time (assuming they are rated at the same mAh), but the way the percentage looks will be different.  Don't worry about it.",1561939391

"EndlessWar","t5_2s4wg","&gt; So, Russia didn't help and was not part of WW2...

Calling it ""Russia"" is a misnomer. It was the USSR -- a union of many republics.

Though the Russian republic contributed the most and suffered the most, the oil from Baku in a different republic was so huge of a prize Hitler changed strategies to take it. It was the resources and manpower of those 12+ republics that were *not* Russia which were also an important in the war effort.

&gt;  If you are expecting an attack from Germany it's remarkably stupid to waste resources starting wars with other countries.

One could argue that the USSR started the war with Finland, which during WWI and before was part of the imperial Russian Empire. That war and the territorial secession by Finland was important in the upcoming war against the Nazis too.

Not only did the ""Winter War"" point out the shortcomings of the Red Army and change/influence Soviet training and preparations, but it secured a wider space around Leningrad/St. Petersburg which was important for the defense of the city when the Germans invaded and surrounded the city.

&gt; It appears here you site an instance of Russia working with Germany to attack and divide Poland while claiming they didn't do that.

As I stated in that other post, the Soviets tried *twice* to make an anti-Nazi alliance with France and the UK. The UK was trying to spin Hitler eastward and not to attack France.

It was only after the 2nd attempt at an alliance was ignored that the Soviets did a 180 and made the non-aggression pact with Hitler. And as I said, we should be *thankful* they had the buffer zone of eastern Poland.

&gt; You seem to be implying Russia did Poland a favor by invading. 

No, the Soviet Union did the USSR a favor by invading.

Without the ""buffer space"" of eastern Poland, Hitler would have started the Nazi invasion *much* close to Moscow and Leningrad/St. Petersburg than he did.

As it was, the Soviets barely held Leningrad (it was surrounded and was under siege for many months) and only managed to beat back the Nazi armies on the outskirts of Moscow. If the Nazis had started much closer to those cities, it is reasonable to believe that they would have taken them.",1561939391

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Imagine you have 2 processors that are identical in every way, except one has HT enabled and one does not.  For example, this could be a processor with HT in hardware but disabled in the BIOS/UEFI or something compared to the one with it enabled.

As we load the processor with more and more tasks, its performance will scale, up until all of its physical cores are fully utilized (i.e. 100% CPU usage).  For this comparison to work, we need a workload that's at least lightly threaded: if the CPU has 8 cores but there's only 4 threads that are stressing the CPU, then HT doesn't really have an effect.  This can be from a highly parallel workload that naturally uses all the cores, or an application like a game that uses multiple threads, or from combination of multiple applications that each use some threads, as long as all the cores are busy 100% of the time at the maximum clock frequency.

Now that we have set up this scenario, consider putting on even more load onto this CPU, but threaded as before.  Obviously, the CPU is already working as fast as it can, so it will split its performance among these tasks and complete all of them at a slower rate.  A hyperthreaded CPU will do the same thing, but about 15-30% faster, depending on the specific workload.

That's it.  It's a 15-30% speed boost on heavily threaded workloads.  For games, it's better to check benchmarks, as someone else has mentioned.  If you are doing something computation heavy, check this to see the benefit on your specific use case: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=intel-ht-2018&amp;num=1.

The Culture is sorta like the opposite of Star Trek's Prime Directive, they meddle and interfere with less advanced species all the time, but benevolently. Their goal is always to reduce the suffering of sentients and bring the less advanced civilizations more in line with The Culture's values.

Most straight people don't immediately jump to ""I was fired for being straight.""  You would be hard pressed to find a straight person even claiming they were fired for being straight.  (I Googled it and found only one.)

"windows","t5_2qh3k","When building its index, Everything reads the NTFS Master File Table directly. It needs administrative permissions for that and reveals all files and folders as administrators see them, independent of other access rights. 

Now imagine for a moment Windows Search turning up *""who to fire first.doc""* for everyone, even though ""only HR can see that folder"".

Everything provides all data that it can index quickly.

Windows Search, OTOH, is designed to index arbitrary information, no matter how complicated that is. It can scan file content - zip files, Word documents, encrypted files - any file type supported, actually, by allowing 3rd party plugins. It typically scans only when the system is idle or with very low priority (unlike Everything, which scans uninhibited.)

Windows Search is actually intended to find user *documents*, and by default excludes many locations - it is explicitely intended to **not** find ntdll.dll.

If it doesn't have index data (which can happen for a variety of reasons - the index isn't completely refreshed because of an IFilter plugin acting up, some ""helpful ""admin disabled it or restricted the locations, or you are searching in a location like C:\\ which is not completely indexed), it starts a normal disk scan. which of course takes ages before it turns up anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The real crime is that Americans will still pay for tax prep software (most everyone just takes standard deduction, child or education credits and calls it a day), the AMT still exists, and the estate tax is just hilariously bad. Estate tax is the most progressive there is, and we, uh, don't.

The dog died. That's why they gave away all its stuff. In hindsight, I probably should've realized that's why they were donating so much dog stuff, but hindsight is 20/20, right? They were pretty cool about it, though, and of course I apologized several times.",1561939399

"Dofus","t5_2sl1e","Pvp is a horrible way to make kamas. The kamas/hour you actually get is fairly low. If you have a really expensive setup then the kamas you get will be decent, but you need kamas to get that expensive setup to make more kamas.

Also you need to be level 150+. The rewards you get scale with your level. Simply isn't worth touching prior to level 100 or so, and only starts getting decent at much higher levels. 

Plus build diversity opens up a lot past level 100 and you'll find yourself seeing a lot more classes rather than only osas, and have a much better chance of winning.

A good way to make kamas when you have no kamas is to do achievements. Specifically dungeon and ""kill this monster family while doing a challenge"" achievements. Also some quests such as the questlines that have you completing dungeons (pick one up at belinda thumb 1 below astrub grocery, and the other at field dungeon/astrub farmer workshop).

And working on some of the dofus questlines, most of them are p2p but you can start the main astrub questline and continue that into pandala -&gt; wabbit island (cawwot dofus) -&gt; moon island (dokoko) and by then you'll be close to level 100 and there's a lot of questlines that open up here (dimensions, frigost etc). 

You will get enough kamas from doing this stuff to progress your equipment while also gaining decent xp. Not enough to afford a subscription though. 

To afford the subscription I would highly recommend buying 1 month. It's a lot easier to afford future subscriptions when you're a higher level and have better ways to generate currency. 

But if that's not possible, while doing your ""kill this monster"" achievement, take note of which drops are worth decent kamas and the drop rate and evaluate whether it's viable farming them for profit. Chance eca is a very good class to do this on as chance increases your drop chances, and all or nothing makes fights very quick. Also look into the hunter profession and the drop rate/kamas given by monsters that drop meat. If there's a monster that has valuable drops and can drop meat from hunter profession, it's probably worth farming more than anything else. 

Alternatively alchemist profession is an ok solution. But it'll be a very slow grind until you get your p2p as you unlock much better routes for collecting flowers then.",1561939399

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Da dupla de senhores de cabelos brancos que desfilava com um cartaz atacando a imprensa ao discurso num caminhão de som pedindo “bullying” sobre o Congresso, o tom do novo protesto dos camisas amarelas na avenida Paulista foi raivoso.

 Certamente, a indignação era maior do que a da [manifestação anterior dos bolsonaristas](https://saidapeladireita.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/05/26/na-paulista-manifestantes-esquecem-o-pt-e-escancaram-o-racha-na-direita/), em 26 de maio, que tinha uma pauta mais difusa. Neste domingo (30), a defesa do ministro da Justiça, Sergio Moro, esteve em um claro primeiro plano e contaminou o humor da multidão, mesmo quando o tema era outro.

 O sentimento dominante era a necessidade de uma reação urgente para resgatar Moro, após uma sequência de revezes que incluiu os [diálogos revelados pelo “The Intercept”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/lava-jato-desconfiou-de-empreiteiro-pivo-da-prisao-de-lula-indicam-mensagens.shtml), a aprovação do projeto de abuso de autoridade pelo Senado e o susto da quase soltura do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

 Moro, afinal, é hoje uma das duas últimas figuras a unificarem a direita (a outra é o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes). Mesmo movimentos que se distanciaram de Bolsonaro, caso do [MBL (Movimento Brasil Livre)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/manifestantes-do-mbl-sao-hostilizados-em-atos-pro-moro-no-rio-e-em-sp.shtml), mantêm seu apoio ao herói da Lava Jato e estiveram presentes na avenida, embora de maneira relativamente discreta.

 [Vendo o ex-juiz ser atacado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/eu-vejo-eu-ouco-diz-moro-sobre-manifestacoes-em-seu-apoio.shtml), seus defensores foram para o revide. Por onde se olhasse era possível ver cartazes e ouvir palavras de ordem com provocações. “Esquerda escrota, pare de atrapalhar!”, era apenas um exemplo.

 Até o vice, general Hamilton Mourão, [há muito visto com desconfiança](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/sem-carlos-bolsonaro-mourao-recebe-medalha-na-camara-do-rio.shtml) pelo público fiel ao presidente, foi resgatado em um cartaz que pedia: “General Mourão, faça a intervenção. Fim do congresso e do STF”.

 Manifestante segura cartaz pedindo que o general Mourão feche o Congresso e o STF As críticas ao Congresso, sempre presentes em protestos da direita, foram especialmente duras desta vez. Do alto do carro de som do movimento Vem Pra Rua, normalmente visto como mais moderado em comparação com os congêneres, um orador entoou: “Eu estou vendo que o povo está bravo! O povo quer que o Congresso Nacional acorde!”.

 À grita contra o projeto do abuso de autoridade somou-se a constatação, de resto óbvia, de que o sucesso do governo de Jair Bolsonaro depende da recuperação econômica e da reforma da Previdência em particular.

 “Rodrigo Maia, presta atenção, nós queremos a reforma de 1 trilhão!”, puxou em coro um locutor no caminhão do Vem Pra Rua, em referência ao montante que, segundo o Ministério da Economia, será economizado com a reforma em dez anos.

 No vizinho caminhão do movimento Nas Ruas, o recado foi mais direto, e quase ameaçador. “Todo mundo aqui tem que pressionar os deputados pela reforma. É para fazer bullying digital, sim”, afirmou um coordenador.

 Cartaz com crítica ao Congresso e o STF durante a manifestação Segurando um cartaz em defesa de Moro, Jaime Araújo, 51, funcionário de uma empresa que fabrica plástico, disse que a vontade do povo estava na avenida, e não no Congresso. “Existe uma parcela do Congresso que não foi renovada na eleição, por isso é importante a pressão popular”, disse.

 Glenn Greenwald e a imprensa em geral foram alvos preferenciais. A **Folha** foi chamada de “esquerdiota”, “escrota” e “comunista”, entre outros termos, por pessoas que viravam as costas e se recusavam a dar entrevistas.

 “A imprensa comprou a versão do Intercept. Perdeu o norte, transformou o jornalismo em militância”, disse Irineu Ramos, que se apresentou como jornalista e, ao lado do empresário Jorge Fernandes, segurava um cartaz escrito “Imprensa Inimiga do Brasil”.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;Pretending the owners can't control BSV through the protocol is more trickery

What?!   The miners ""control"" the protocol, just like in any other bitcoin blockchain.

If the users (the economic activity) choose to follow a protocol fork cause by a miner, then yes .... otherwise no.

Protocol changes will result in those who change the protocol, ""going it alone"".   This is no different to any other bitcoin blockchain.

&gt;Besides they probably control the node software as well

Miners can run whatever node software they write for themselves.

&gt;That's one of the faith-based assumptions you seem to hold dear

It is not faith, it is economics.   This (economics) is what bitcoin is built on.

Faith would not work.

&gt;Do they plan to make it so they can't change it?

Just like every other bitcoin blockchain.... this is governed purely by economics.

&gt;I would hope not, since I think it will need work

Why?  What is wrong with the original bitcoin protocol?   It needs work? LOL.

I'm sorry to be blunt.... but can you see how the stuff you are talking about above you are totally clueless about.

Probably time you stop ""telling people how it works"".   ;)",1561939400

In any case, just because 80Hz is a good experience doesn’t mean 90Hz isn’t a lot better, and just because 90Hz is considered acceptable doesn’t mean it’s really enough. Obviously OP here isn’t exactly an expert in these things, it seems pretty new to them hence the rather unneeded explanation of hz/fps.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","The first thing is you need to go sit your father down. 

""Dad, that was very hurtful that you jumped to the conclusion that your daughter is an addict. I was accused and dragged through the mud, just for going over to help them. The first thing that I need is an apology from you, and the 2nd thing that I need is an understanding of what happened, so that this doesn't happen again. Do we need to have your parents medically checked? Is it possible that they're starting to lose their mental faculties? In the meantime, I think that since your father doubled down on me possibly secretly replacing the money, I think that it's best if I don't go over there for a little while, and just meet them in public places to protect myself.

3rd, I need you to go settle all of this with everyone, so that all of the family understands the situation. This might be a hard conversation with some people since it means facing some hard truths, but we need to drag all of these issues into the light so that we can resolve them.""

You should not hold this against your grandmother. It is textbook behavior, and it's not her fault, any more than it's not her fault that she is her current height and not 7 feet tall. No more than you'd get mad at an infant for crying. But your family needs to come to terms with the reality of the situation and decide how to move forward in a way that helps your grandparents. Enabling them to not face reality is NOT helping them.",1561939403

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","I always think the EU referendum was kind of analogous to having the public vote on whether we take drastic action to reduce emissions - yes or no? The Yes campaign argues that everyone will be given solar panels and electric cars. The people vote Yes by a tiny margin. The government and Yes campaigners seize the rhetoric of 'will of the people' etc, and decide they have to cut emissions by half in the next year in order to enact 'the will of the people' and anything less is treason.

The government finds itself with only a couple of options to cut emissions by half in such a short time span - ban cars altogether, as there is no funds for an electric car for everyone as promised by the Yes campaign, or perhaps kill half of the population so the other half might still get around the place. People are horrified and argue against it - they are called traitors, they are told that the people voted Yes and that means whatever the government has decided is necessary to cut emissions by half. The ruling party has been infiltrated by insane extremists who are fine with the idea of culling half the population, they think it'll only be the crap people who will be killed, they say it's necessary for the 'greater good' of halving emissions, so the government feels they can only maintain power by going along with it. Plus, several senior members of the ruling party pushing for this option have shares in biodegradable coffins and body disposal companies, so they're excited to make a killing in more ways than one.

No deal brexit is almost as insane as that, it's just people can't see it so clearly becuase it's easier for the propagandists to argue no deal brexit won't be catastrophic than it is to argue killing half the population or scrapping cars overnight would be fine and dandy. Its the same principle though - getting the public to vote on a blank cheque that the government fills in afterwards with something that was never even suggested in the first place, based on a tiny majority, something utterly insane and destructive that no one would ever have voted for in the first place had they known. it's completely the opposite of democracy, it's the kind of thing dictators use referendums for, when they want an excuse to push through some draconian policy or to seize power.",1561939403

"Knife_Swap","t5_2tgpv","
Hello /u/christian_el_atheist, welcome to Knife_Swap! Please read this entire message if this is your first time posting here!

Make sure you obey any laws that are applicable to your country and the recipients country. If we find out that you are breaking them we will ban you.

As a reminder, all posts require a timestamp with the knife open and the blade visible.  This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. Additionally, please make sure to have a grade:

Quality [Q] Levels (use + or - accordingly):

* ""A"" - New, has been taken out of the box a few of times, never used to cut or been carried
* ""B"" - Light wear, been carried, non damaged. Sharpened by someone who knows what they're doing (e.g. original manufacturer or a very well established modder like REK). Non-permanent mods like new clips, new screws, or similar will fall into this category since the knife has been disassembled or worked on but not permanently changed or damaged. If these modifications have caused changes in the knife's performance e.g. now has bladeplay or centering issues, that lowers the rating of the knife to a C.
* ""C"" - Moderate wear on handle or blade, may have been reprofiled, sharpened not super well, modded in any permanent fashion, need sharpening; mechanisms (non lock related) may not function properly.
* ""D"" - Things are broken.


Until you have successfully completed a sale or trade, you can only post one knife at a time. This means one thread, one knife, and that's it. NO EXCEPTIONS  

Once you successfully have completed and got trader flair a sale or trade, you can post however many knives for sale as you want! Please still try to keep them all in one post, though, to avoid spamming our page.  

Please make sure your prices aren't ridiculous.  You will be called out if you're asking an unreasonable amount.

Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services, with any fees added.  All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 

Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  

If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear. 

As always, please don't be a dick.  Message the mods if you have any questions!

He had to stand. He needed to serve. The Grandfather willed it so. Grandfather? Ligaments ground against bones of stone as tendons snapped under the strain of his own bulk. His lungs burned, yearning for oxygen but filling with nothing but sand and dust. Pain lanced his body as he felt his chest splitting and his armour rending to make space for flesh that should not exist. His temples throbbed and his mind screamed as bone pierced his skull, growing and twisting into hideous simulacra of horns and teeth. His eyes shriveled and tore, redistributing their mass into an alien form. A holy form, he realized. As his tongue swole it forced millennia of salt and ash through his calcified, peeling lips and flooding it with a soothing pus... Soothing? He was on his knees, he realized. Light flooded his vision, and he was blind. And then, nothing. All the pain, terror, and confusion he had felt but moments ago left his mind. It was replaced with a comforting feeling. A warm feeling. A voice, soothing and knowing, filled his conscience. ""Rise, my child. You have been dead a long while. But no more. Rise... Find your brothers... And serve your Grandfather.""

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Ooooh I really like that example for that rule! Amazing explanation. 

I personally am not a big fan of the “use no as little as possible” rule because kids do need to learn that sometimes “no” applies. 

I actually told a story not too long ago about my experiences as an au pair with a family that didn’t want to use the word no for their kids. They wanted to distract the misbehaving kid, rather then tell them “no, this isn’t allowed” when hitting their sibling on the head with a toy for example. Which is just completely the wrong application for that rule. Not using no in that situation doesn’t show them that what they’re doing is wrong. Simply distracting them doesn’t teach them that what they did was wrong. 

But, as your example so amazingly shows, sometimes a no needs context. Always being told no does end up leaving them feeling like they have to break the rules, which in turn can domino into not listening to other rules as well. Seriously, I can’t get over how great that example is! If you’re going to say no to something, sometimes you also have to show which alternative *is* allowed. Not to mention that making a kid feel like nothing is allowed will only encourage them to hide things from you!",1561939406

"modular","t5_2qzdf","Disclaimer -- I'm pretty new with this stuff too, but I've got Plaits and Clouds, and have messed with a few of the others on VCV Rack.

Did you know that Plaits has two built-in ""Rings-lite"" modes?

You have a lot of sound generation in not a lot of HP (2-4 modules, depending on how you're using them). If expanding past a small system is probably in your future, and you're totally sold on Plaits, I'd think about swapping Rings out for an effect, or something else your system might be lacking. You can always add a Rings later ;)

A comment on Plaits: it's an excellent, flexible, blast of a module, but each model is a little shallow to me. I like modules that I can sit at and tweak to dial in a sound; since each of Rings' models has only three parameters, I can feel a bit limited at times by it. (I don't regret my purchase, but I do wonder if my first dive into modular would have been different if I started, for example, with a Make Noise DPO or Intellijel Rubicon^(2).) That's totally a very individual opinion, but something you might want to take into account ;)

Clouds is Clouds. Consider Monsoon or Supercell if you haven't seen them already; they're clones of Clouds with extra functionality. (Supercell has a beta version of Parasites available for it, not sure about Monsoon; keep that in mind if you're planning to use Parasites, which you should ;) )

I really want to add Marbles to my rack at some point; I'm not sure there's any more creative module than Marbles in terms of random generation of gates and voltages. So I think that's an excellent choice.

Looking at your rack, I said to myself, ""where's Maths?"" But then I noticed you have Tides. Good enough, haha.

Consider some additional VCAs, or at least attenuverters. I wouldn't say they're strictly necessary, since Plaits and Rings can be used without them -- but I have a feeling you might end up kicking yourself down the road without them ;)

Do you have a case/power in mind?

The really helpful thing about this setup is that you can probably recreate it almost exactly in VCV Rack! Mutable Instruments has copies of all those modules for VCV Rack under the name ""Audible Instruments"", and you can recreate much of the Neutron's functionality with basic modules from other sources, so I'd highly recommend messing around with this setup there if you haven't already!",1561939407

At first you are like ""this is so cool why is it illegal"" and so on

""Smoking weed is fine it shouldnt be called a drug""

If you are depressed or have issues with mental health in general, smoking weed as a pastime hobby can feel like medication. ""It really helped me get through some stuff in the past! I feel way better now!"" Yes but how do you feel when you don't smoke?

Memory issues, weeks months and years just passing by, loss of appetite when sober, insomnia, depression. Smoking costs way more than it used to. Some days you could not eat because you need to sleep at night, and to sleep you need that sweet sweet grass.

This of course will not happen if you smoke or weekends, a couple of times a month, when a friend passes you the blunt and so on. To get to this point you need years of smoking. Some people can keep it under control, some can't.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","&gt; Eric Dier: Eric Dier at Sporting didn't really stand out one way or the another. He was just... there. But he's doing pretty well at Tottenham nowadays. I didn't expect Eric Dier to have a much noteworthy career, tbh. I expected him to go to a lower table EPL side or a club like Norwich after he left Sporting, but he's proven me wrong. And tbh he seems to be a rather low profile player, so maybe that's why?

What are you on about? Dier was a stand out at Sporting's academy from a very early age, often the team captain and always regarded as one of the best prospects in our youth setup. As a teenager he even featured in an Umbro advert for the England national team even before debuting for it's youth teams.

&gt; Rui Patrício: Patrício in his early seasons at Sporting wasn't seen as a particularly good GK. He was even called ""franguício"" by Benfica and Porto fans since he'd concede some embarrassing blunders and goals at times. Patrício debuted for Sporting's senior squad in, I believe, 2007/2008. Ricardo was Portugal's GK at Euro 2008 and Eduardo was our GK at the 2010 WC iirc. I think Patrício's first major NT tournament was Euro 2012.

Also about Patrício, the issue in his early career was that many believed - probably rightly - that this teenage goalkeeper wasn't up to the level of Sporting's first team. The issue was never how much potential he had, but if he was good enough in his first few seasons. This is a guy who became a starter at Sporting as an 18 year old and never lost the starting spot.",1561939409

"Enneagram","t5_2sdjj","Maybe read more about type four. That’s probably as extensive as you’re going to be able to get for info on your wing. Otherwise, a 5w4 is still a 5, so core five issues will really apply. But yeah I’d recommend reading up on 4 as it’s going to color your 5 themes a lot or you might find some of the struggles relate to things found there. 

I can relate to finding it hard to get myself to a place or state where I can create, due to external factors, people and distractions . So many 5 things get in the way, mainly wanting to maintain privacy and letting myself feel safe enough to be really active and in that flow state. Getting into my body helps (yoga, extensive stretching). Setting the mood helps too. I always put on music when cleaning (for example). It’s so fucking hard to feel safe though, or alone enough to let yourself “come out”. I don’t know how to explain it better but I totally get you on it. Like boundaries that are too easily broken into. 

I never worked much either until I got a huge work table. Now I can sit down at it and all my things are there waiting for me where I left off etc. Before that, I was a bed worker but it’s better having a special physical place I can go to and return to every day and can do multiple things upon (writing, drinking coffee, drafting, drawing, patternmaking, sewing etc). Like a one stop shop, something unique and tailored to myself and how I work. And all I have to do is sit down, even if I can’t concentrate I can still sit and think and that feels like something. 

My bf’s a 4/5 type as well and he’s been way more productive since we rearranged his workspace to have better flow/feng shui. Works there most evenings after work. 

Idk. I just know the least productive times of my life were when I didn’t have a private workspace, so now I ensure that I have something in place. My own set up. Otherwise nothing ever gets done. It seems old school but it works for me. 

Though, I’ve also learned how to hack my instincts a bit. Like I’ve learned to put myself into things that I can’t back out of. So even if I don’t want to do it, I have to. It seems stupid to play myself that way but I end up doing a lot. Personal deadlines work similarly. Setting my goals for the ideal, so when I’m a bit behind I’m actually on time and doing well lol. Or doing one thing a day and not beating myself up for just doing the one thing, because it’s better than doing nothing. 

Anyway. Those are things that have helped me though I still really have to force myself some days. It’s never truly easy but it’s gotten better.",1561939409

"vridge","t5_3d52p","I made a similar post like this once and never got a satisfactory answer. Eventually, through enough digging I found out a way to accomplish what you're trying to do. No guarantee it will work for you but I would try using VRidge in HDMI mode and then using whatever other app you're using for image streaming (I assume ALVR, Trinus, iVRy, etc.) concurrently. To do this:

1.) Connect your phone with the VRidge app to the Riftcat client and make sure you have all of your controller settings the way that you want them (you won't be able to change them later without reconnecting your phone). Also make sure that you are signed into your Riftcat account and have remember me turned on (you didn't specify in your original post but keep in mind that in order to use the VRidge controller app/functionality you will still need a full VRidge license or you will be limited to the 5-10 minute trial period)

2.) Navigate to wherever you installed Riftcat on your PC (usually something along the lines of C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Riftcat 2)

3.) Run VRidge.exe (NOT RIFTCAT.EXE)

4.) Run StreamView.exe

5.) Start SteamVR

6.) Press Ctrl + Alt + Insert to fix transparency issues

7.) Use whatever other app you want for image streaming.

&gt;As a wizard, the player is weaker in combat, but has access to 48 spells, with each appearing as a three-letter word that has to be memorised by the player. Examples include ZAP (creates a lightning bolt from the finger) and HOT (creates a fireball). When given the option to cast spells the player is presented with a small selection of these three-letter words to choose from; the player is encouraged to choose from these without consulting the spell listing. It is also possible to fail to cast at all, as false spell words are placed alongside correct choices. Many spells also require a certain item (e.g. GOB requires one or more goblin teeth). If the character does not have the necessary equipment then the spell fails. All spell choices, irrespective of the outcome, incur a Stamina penalty.",1561939409

"investing","t5_2qhhq","From another article I read, Boeing had also agreed to invest $1.7 billion into the Indian tech companies they were outsourcing to, in-order to train them how to program and how to program for aerospace.

I looked up some stats and found that the overall cost of a four-year degree in America is around $68,000 total. At $1.7 billion, Boeing could have put 25,000 Americans through four-year US compsci programs and not only have avoided these tragedies completely, but had an astounding, beyond qualified workforce.

But nah, let's be cheap and throw billions at a bunch of untrained laborers and hope for the best so that the C-Suite can make even more money. It's ironic how companies like Boeing will lambast the idea of training new American hires or even subsidizing potential future American hires because they claim it ""costs too much money.""

Also, the best part? HCL originally agreed to write all of Boeing's 737  Max software for FREE. They agreed to only take a tiny percentage of  sales as payment and that was yearsssssss later.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","Kiriakou pleaded guilty to disclosing the name of an undercover CIA agent to a member of the media. That fact was sensitive classified information that if made public could have compromised the agent's cover and endangered them or others, and was not specifically relevant to the subject of his whistleblowing. It's also unclear that he 'exposed' anything of value. His actual testimony, which was deeply erroneous, in fact suggested that waterboarding was no big deal. The irony was that it was actually much worse than he thought it was.

Your second sentence is word salad, by the way, and does not actually communicate anything coherent or intelligible. After doing research (more than a little), I determined that the man in question was jailed (by a local magistrate) for stealing a sign. Which is what normally happens to people who get caught stealing. And it's not ironic, either, since at a legal level, anyone who stole any sign for any reason would face the same penalty, no matter what their motive or any non-material connection to anything else.",1561939413

Yeaaa, that was me :p And good for you, doing things in chronological order. I think the original FMA is great, and having seen it makes Brotherhood an even better experience.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","These are the first set of headphones I've owned with no reason for it to be handicapped, e.g. not wireless, not a headset, not included with my phone.

Out of the box (which contained a nice case, and the normal range of silicone ear tip things, and some good foam ones), they sounded pretty uninteresting. Flat, no mid or high clarity, which the dual driver design ( ~~one armature, if I spelled it right,~~ and two dynamic per side) should have helped with. But, after a round of tuning in my phone's (Note 9) built in EQ, streaming through Spotify, on the highest quality for premium users, and the built in upscaler, they sound incredibly good.

The fit is top notch for me, except for the bit that goes over the ears. It's like they shaped it for an elf. Long and no space for your ear. A hair dryer helped. 

Overall, for under $30 on Amazon right now, I reccomend these.",1561939414

OP, always ask, the worst they can say is no.   My condolences on your situation.


EDIT:  If you haven’t already done so, ask to meet with the hospital’s financial advocate or counselor as well as social worker.  They can not only adjust the hospital bills but may be able to help petition your other utilities for forgiveness with a doctor’s letter as proof of your situation.

"ChernobylTV","t5_w7o5s","From what I can tell, HBO-Legasov is almost posed to be the viewpoint of a Western observer, asking, ""Why are you all ignoring what is in front of your faces for the sake of the party?""  At least that's what most American viewers think when watching the actions of those in charge at the beginning of the show.  Legasov is given a sort of pure, naive scientific viewpoint that is only really interested in the truth.  While Legasov made many important contributions to revealing the truth about what happened at Chernobyl, he was thoroughly a party man and not a naive scientist questioning the system.  He was a very political person.   In fact, he wanted the truth revealed because of his loyalty to the USSR and its nuclear program -- he genuinely wanted his country to be safer.  The whole notion of ""Legasov is us"" (Western audience) is largely a fabrication.  The things that really motivated him are probably too complex to present to a Western audience in the form of a miniseries.  Also, there are disputes about how scientifically sound his recommendations for putting out the reactor fire actually were, while in the show he's portrayed as the only expert with reliable answers.

&amp;#x200B;

Dyatlov is reduced to a caricature.  There are tons of sources online to find his viewpoint on what happened.  Certainly some of the things said about him being a harsh manager are true, but he was not at all incompetent.  One of his colleagues said that his pride/ego wouldn't let him fail to complete the test, even when he knew the results would be invalid.  It seems he was a very proud man.  He defended himself to the last, even if his statements were sometimes questionable.  Bryukhanov gets the caricature treatment to a shocking degree, too.  People who worked with him described him as a nice, calm, collected, and intelligent.  (You can find an interview with him posted in this reddit and see his mannerisms for yourself.)  Higginbotham's book describes him as sitting stunned at his desk trying to comprehend the scope of the disaster.  He had built the power plant itself and Pripyat from the ground up, and his denial is the denial of a man watching his life's work turn into an epic disaster -- in reality, a very human response.  In essence, I think the show takes ""normal human reaction to loss"" denial and conflates it with ""loyalty to the party"" denial, but I'd encourage you to read Higginbotham's or Plokhy's books and see for yourself.",1561939417

I actually lost a tiny amount of respect for Marvel Studios for the way they marketed the rerelease. One damn scene? *One*? An unfinished one at that. If they would’ve tossed in 3, 4, or 5 it would’ve been worth it, plus a proper next phase tease end credits scene. 

I’m perfectly fine with a rerelease and hope it helps break the record, but they should’ve put more effort into it. You can’t grab the attention of culture, social media, and the casuals by including *one* measly scene. They missed a big opportunity to seal the deal on the record by loading it up with extra content. 

Russo: “the movie could have been even longer lolol”

*Includes a 1 minute extra scene*

Oh! Alright, I just assumed you were caught up on American current events, maybe I shouldn't assume that. North Carolina recently tried to pass a law that would take away the votes of African Americans ""[with almost surgical precision](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/15/528457693/supreme-court-declines-republican-bid-to-revive-north-carolina-voter-id-law)"", for example. I don't disagree that other factors are in play, but even the government can be racist.

&gt;The question now becomes: why?

I think that poverty is a big one. Poor people tend to be less educated, be more desperate, and see gangs as a better alternative to a career. Unfortunately, among the right in the US, cutting welfare is pretty popular.

&gt;From this statement I assume that you are not yourself a blue collar worker.

I dunno... are programmers blue collar? It's a nice air conditioned office job, but I am not, like, management or anything.

&gt;Free college is nice but the problem is here right now, and sending millions into unemployment is not a good solution to anything.

Well... how would that happen? Do you think everyone would just up and quit their jobs to go to college? I mean, maybe... but 4 years later we would have such a productive population!

&gt;not every person coming over is going to be a world class surgeon.

Right, our citizens go to free college and become surgeons, while immigrants come in and do the blue collar jobs. Seems like a win-win

&gt;The USA does not have the money to provide a comprehensive education to every single person on the planet.

Make it only available to citizens then. Easy enough.",1561939419

You started this decrying the fact that CIS character got into a fist fight with trans character.

THAT WAS THE JOKE!

The whole joke that whole episode was that CIS character enjoyed trans characters company so much because trans character was essentially a male stereotype in a female body.

If you're now suggesting that trans characters cannot have a female body and still inhabit male stereotypes... You're bigoted.

If you're suggesting that a female cannot be just as much the aggressor in a physical altercation... Bigoted.

In the context of the episode, the trans character is NOT a victim. Your insistence to the contrary is bigoted.

Lastly, in the cases of airdrop flashing and similar, some people might actually get caught - without elaborating too much (to protect the victim) a lady I know challenged a guy in this kind situation and with the help of other people nearby were able to corner the guy, he admitted it, and they managed to take him to a local police station where the police arrested him, he didn’t have a lock on his phone so they were able to access the evidence easily, and the police also took a full statement from her.

We were all playing basketball in a fenced-in court, when we started noticing people surrounding it...

My buddy had thrown an elbow at somebody who’d been doing the same - the dude had left in a snit, and came back with friends.

There were only two entrances, and both were now blocked.  We grabbed our shit, and fought our way through the one closest to the car.

We all came out of that bloodied and bruised, but with no serious injuries.  But if all of them had been at that one entrance, we wouldn’t have made it.

The thing that really got us out of there, was that we were bigger than most of them.  (We were 18-19, they were 14-16)

A  German feminist artist who has been honored by a journalist group for  her caricatures, is now facing a fiery backlash over a series of  “racist” and “Islamophobic” cartoons – many of them relentlessly poking  fun at Sharia law.

Franziska Becker’s  works have come under the spotlight after the Female Journalists  Association (Journalistinnenbund) awarded her a prize for her  “keen-witted and sharp-tongued” depiction of men and women. The group  hailed Becker as “one of the most prominent, feminism-oriented  successful personalities” – but the praise hit a nerve with some  Germans.

Criticism began amassing on  social media shortly after news of the award broke. Sibel Schick, a  contributor to women’s Missy Magazine and TAZ outlet – and, ironically, a  self-described pro-choice feminist – was one of the first to post some  of Becker’s cartoons which she dubbed “anti-Islam and racist.”

One  caricature depicts a kindergarten where children – girls all wearing  headscarves – are seen playing with toy ""suicide"" trucks or hijacked  planes. Others are building a mosque and erecting a minaret.

Another  one portrays a supposedly Muslim bank employee who tells her non-Muslim  client that withdrawing cash is only possible with “a written  permission from a husband, a father, a brother or a son.”

There  was also a Becker cartoon in which a Muslim policewoman deals with a  shoplifter using an axe – a blunt reference to a Sharia provision which  prescribes that theft be punished by severing the thief’s hand.

Naturally,  there was no shortage of criticism on social media, with users venting  anger at both the artist and the journalists’ association.

The  journalists’ group, meanwhile, has backtracked on promoting Becker’s  award and said that “we take the criticism seriously and are currently  discussing it intensively, but at first privately.”

However,  those defending Becker pointed out that she isn’t overly obsessed with  Islam. Other caricatures that she’s created have been equally critical  of Christian preachers and Buddhists, it turns out.

Becker  has always been a “super-left, super-feminist cartoonist,” one user  wrote, wondering why “this woman is now supposed to be “racist” because  she is critical of Islam (like any religion)?”

Twitter  users aside, women’s magazine ‘Emma,’ where Becker works as an  illustrator and cartoonist, has thrown its weight behind the embattled  artist. The magazine publisher insisted that Becker, who has created  satirical cartoons about “Islamic fanatics” since as early as 1991 had  fallen victim to “a smear campaign and censorship.”

As  controversy mounted, Becker spoke out about her stance, telling the  media that her satire was directed against violent Islamism, but had  nothing to do with Islam as such.

“I am  not concerned with the headscarf itself, but with the headscarf as a  symbol of the oppression worn by female Islamists and converts,” she  argued.

"titanfolk","t5_ioe0d","Well, the time that you have already previously allocated is gone, there's nothing you can do to change that, so realistically, there isn't much use in dwelling on it.

But you can change the future. Just ask yourself what degree of effort you'd have to put in to not have the same regrets next month, use your want to not be feeling the same way, and work towards that goal. I think the goal of ""I want to put x amount of effort"" in instead of ""I want y results"" will always be much healthier because in the end, it's the only thing you'll really have control over.

If I tried my best and got a C in school, I always felt better than if I slacked off and got a B. Because you know that you left points on the table.

It isn't easy, I doubt life ever will be, honestly. But at the end of the day, as long as you can look back without regretting that you didn't try harder, I'd say you win.

No one can achieve that ideal for you and no one can prevent you from being stuck wandering ""what if"" next month, except for you, and it will be hard work,

"whatisthisthing","t5_2s3kh","Cheers for the suggestion. I'm not quite convinced (see below), but it's the most plausible answer (to me) so far.

I found some similar ones online, for sure, but every example of a figurine-style *Blumensteckschale* I found online is in at least 2 pieces: a figurine piece (1) that is placed onto the bottom, which is a flower frog with water reservoir (2), or sometimes a flower frog with (3) a separate bowl.

Here's an example I found on Worthpoint of Hutschenreuther's ""May Dance"" that clearly shows the two component pieces (figurine plus flower frog/reservoir):

[https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images4/1/0616/20/hutschenreuther-dance-girls-dancing\_1\_09c92c950a83aee3344e98aca2ab92f7.jpg](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images4/1/0616/20/hutschenreuther-dance-girls-dancing_1_09c92c950a83aee3344e98aca2ab92f7.jpg)

On the item I posted, figurine + flower frog are all one solid-state piece. This means (for example) that if the flower frog gets gunky inside, the only answer is to up-end and wash the whole thing... thus greatly risking damage to the delicate figurines on the top side. To me, this makes no sense. Still, it's the best answer I have so far (unless someone can find me a similar example of another use), and it may simply indicate that whoever designed it hadn't thought the implications through.",1561939425

Also, I read once that GRRM is an author that one calls a “gardener”. He starts writing his story without any real idea of what is going to happen, save the endings of a few major characters. He grows his story, and if he doesn’t like where it is going, he cuts it back and lets it grow again. It allows for his story to be really really good, and for his writing to not feel mechanical, but it takes a long time. He writes at his own pace, and he has so many other projects he can’t spend all his time focusing on the books. He has tours, conferences, scripts, video games, other novels, even fan letters to get to. That would be tough for a studio to complete, let alone a single person.
This is the reason he abandoned the show in the first place. He wasn’t going to try to keep up with the show, so he let it continue without him, letting it be known that the show wouldn’t be entirely cannon. He put his (ill put) confidence in D&amp;D to complete it, but they rushed the end due to a lack of his guidance and the fact that they too wanted to finish this project after (only) ten years.

Give him time. He’ll make it there eventually.

Also, you are downvoting me for asking someone to elaborate their opinion as to why the failures of the show are GRRM own fault when he hasn’t been involved on the show for 4 years. If you have a counter argument, post it, don’t just downvote me because you don’t like what I’m saying.",1561939425

"actuary","t5_2qp2f","As you move further into studying, I would also be careful to remember that Var(N1...Nm) = m Var(Ni) is true **only if Ni are independent and identically distributed**.

If two (or more) random variables have a negative covariance, that means that the total variance will be less than the sum of their variances. This would be like putting two different bets on the same horse: one bet that they will get first place, and one bet that they will get last place. This strategy would be a form of **hedging**, since it reduces the overall variance. 

The more negative the correlation, the lower the total risk will be. A **perfect hedge** is one where the random variables have a correlation of -100%, which means the sum of the random variables stops being random. This would be like betting $1 that a fair coin will land on heads, and $1 that the same coin will land on tails--there's no longer any risk involved.

If two (or more) random variables have a positive covariance, that means that the total variance will be more than the sum of their variances. This would be like placing two bets on the same horse: on that it will get first place, and one bet that it will get in the top 3 finishers. These two bets have a positive correlation because if one bet pays off, the other bet is more likely have also paid off. As a result, the variance of the combined bet is higher than the sum of the two individual variances.

The more positive the correlation, the greater the total variance will be amplified. The highest degree of correlation possible is the correlation between a random variable and itself: +100%. This would be like placing the same bet twice, or doubling the amount of your bet. In this case, the covariance is just equal to the variance, and we get that Var(X + X) = Var(X) + Var(X) + 2 Var(X) = 4Var(X). This is where we get that Var(2X) = 2^2 Var(X). You can extend this to be Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X) with some basic algebra.

And just for completeness, the strategy of placing uncorrelated bets is called **diversification**. This was the $1 on 100 horses example. Knowing that one horse won or didn't win tells you nothing about any other horse, but you know that all together you will win some, and lose some. 

So when you initially assumed that Var(N1...Nr) = Var(rN1) you were assuming that each of the variables was 100% correlated with each other, when in fact they were 0% correlated with each other. You were ignoring the diversification effect.

This is a pretty important set of concepts, because it's the use of uncorrelated and negatively correlated variables that allow the business of insurance to exist. Using life insurance as an example, we generally assume that two people have independent life expectancies. No one knows whether one life will end in a given year (barring obvious cases like terminal cancer), but we know roughly how many people of a certain age will die in each year. This means that, through the power of diversification, the risk profile of a large number of insured lives is proportionally less risky than any individual life.",1561939426

It’s artwork that represents a level in which Jerome is required to do exactly what’s being shown. You objected to its in game presentation, now I’m showing you it is intended from a creative standpoint as well as critical to the story. 

&gt;Because nothing the covenant has on the ground can match the firepower of a 35 ton forerunner beam or even come close. 

No one argued that Chief’s shields is that strong except you.

&gt;Chief also kills everything with 1 punch, or a few punches in the case of tanks and hunters

You’re the only one claiming this.

&gt; So Chief is never under any stress. There are no threats in his environment, only victims. He's not a soldier in a war any more he's a farmer casually walking amongst his flock choosing the next cow he wants to butcher. Nothing can touch him while anything he touches dies. Why would he be stressed or injured? It makes no sense.

Extenuating factors like the presence of vehicular elements or heavy antivehicle weapons and explosives can make matters more difficult. Plasma grenades and sustained fire from plasma weaponry can drain the integrity of the shields over time, with impacts at least preventing them from having opportunity to recharge. When a mission is at stake, time is of the essence, meaning Chief has to manage his eagerness to attack with the limitations of his shields in mind, because once they drop he is significantly more vulnerable. EMPs can quickly accelerate this, which plasma weapons are known to cause. And even outside of Chief’s personal safety, there are other teammates to consider, namely marines and other UNSC allies who don’t benefit from similar protection.

&gt;It's the 26th century. If we look at how far medicine has come from the 15th century, it's easy to see how it's perfectly reasonable that what's considered a serious injury today would actually be nothing but a minor inconvenience in the 26th century. There are countless lethal conditions in the 15th century that are easily treated today. I see no reason to assume that Chief would have remained injured.

When would Chief had time to receive medical treatment? Regardless, Joseph Staten said he’s injured *during the events of the game.* 

&gt;Chief's shields have been downed by brute fists before. 

When they were broken. That instance was right before Halo 2, which again, was when they were in terrible shape.

&gt;The shields generators at that time are in peak condition, possibly even superior to peak condition, as they were just recently repaired by a Huragok. 

Different fight. His scuffle with the Elite in First Strike happens before his shields are repaired, the fight I’m talking about is in Fall of Reach.

&gt;There is no reason why Chief would remotely struggle with an elite, even a particularly large one. 

Well they had difficulty gaining traction on one another due to their shields being slippery.

&gt;You have repeatedly asserted that Chief's shields are entire orders of magnitudes superior to even a zealot's shields (on the grounds that you repeatedly assert that chief can tank tons of tnt yet bullets can take out zealots). If Chief's fists are stronger than a brute's fists which can in turn take out chief's shields in a short amount of time, Chief should easily 1 shot that sangheilli with half a pinky.

When you’re free floating in space, trying to land a punch on something without being able to brace is exceedingly worthless, especially when your opponent is surrounded by a barrier that has the frictional coefficient of greased ice.

&gt;Red team has shields. Gameplay isn't canon but the existence of a technology in a game is canon, and spartans had shields in halo wars 2.

Red Team acquired upgrades to their armor after recovering Isabel, enabling the implementation of energy shielding and AI integration:

 [“As core components of Mjolnir powered assault armor cannot be replicated by the Spirit of Fire, the Spartans of Red Team will look to take advantage of GEN2 parts recovered from UNSC outposts, ingenious reverse-engineered solutions developed by Serina, and deft modifications made by Isabel to stay in the fight. The potential amalgamation of these changes and Red Team’s original Mark IV armor could eventually allow for completely new design permutations customized to the needs of each Spartan.”](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/the-art-of-war-s) 

Red Team prior to this wouldn’t have been able to equip energy shielding as [Dr. Halsey only made discoveries concerning the technology as late as 2536](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384440617499099136/593463077933154343/image0.png) with the earliest prototypes only appearing in the 2540s. Red Team disappeared in 2531. I don’t know how you want to explain Spartans just having shields that soon when Chief didn’t even think it was possible in 2552.

&gt;Chief's armor is moving for him anyway, as it has a direct neural interface. 

Spartans still walk with limps when they’re injured, this is mentioned multiple times.

&gt;Furthermore, unless I'm mistaken, mark 5 mjolnir has actually been controlled by AI before in halo last light, which shows that the human component isn't even necessary for the armor's movements

Precisely how this was done is unknown, because if she was directly manipulating the armor, then it would contradict other known sources. Cortana explicitly couldn’t control the armor, in a recent novel a rogue AI wasn’t able to manipulate it either even after it had been discovered. More likely, with its unique level of ingenuity the AI had used precise electrical shocks to stimulate Fred’s musculature and force him to move against his will, which he managed to resist momentarily anyway. We know an AI has *this* capacity as Cortana had once used it to kill an infection form that had breached his suit.

&gt;Chief could literally be paralyzed and it still wouldn't affect him because the armor would do everything

Again, I point to the fact that there’s numerous instances of Spartans exhibiting reduced physical performance due to injury. Chief was specifically noted as walking with a limp. Six is shown to walk with a limp in Reach as well.

&gt;His fists would still have the power to punch through dozens of sangheilli zealot shields with one or a few strikes. 

I guess, we see Noble Six do exactly that. But that’s not particularly relevant to my argument.

&gt;And what can damage chief? What does the covenant have, including their tanks, that can compare to 3 digit gigajoules of forerunner weaponry? Nothing. 

You keep saying that number like it means anything. Energy weapons in Halo are known to cause bodies to rupture and disintegrate, big deal. [Covenant plasma launcher erases everything in a 10 meter radius.](https://imgur.com/a/DaDT9KG) Yeah, if you hit Chief with that a few times, he would probably die.

&gt;So despite simply being an earlier version of the same armor, you're contending that it's orders of magnitudes weaker than the normal mark 5? Because otherwise noble team is still one punch man as far as those zealots are concerned. Also didn't jai fight the arbiter himself to a standstill with years less experience and unshielded mark 4 armor? If the mark 5 is truly as impressive as you're saying it is, noble team should still be so many orders of magnitudes above jai that 1 punch would dispatch the zealots with ease.

When did I say the Mark V is capable of any of this? You’re confusing my arguments. Never once did I indicate a Spartan in Mark V is capable of replicating the high end feats in question.

It’s true Jai-006 matched the eventual Arbiter in strength. [But then, Adriana also did this after acquiring Mark VI armor.](https://i.imgur.com/YRglVQ2.jpg) There’s a perceptible jump in power.

&gt;Because noble 6 is also hyper lethal. While it's just a gimmick term and doesn't carry any feats behind it, it does show that the unsc considers noble 6 to be in the same tier as master chief. 

[All Spartans are considered hyperlethal](https://i.imgur.com/IQKW4yZ.jpg), that terminology was retconned to describe severity en totale.

&gt;it does show that the unsc considers noble 6 to be in the same tier as master chief. 

Cut to Six punching out multiple Elites with single blows while badly injured and having fought several Phantoms, Wraiths, and Covenant Elites singlehandedly.

&gt;Thanks for providing me strong evidence to refute your previous claims. Notice how blue team is shooting the elites

Guns are pretty handy for that.

&gt;Your strength feats and speed feats makes shooting completely pointless at the ranges that this confrontation took place at. They should dash up to them with bullet timer speed and punch. 

That means they’re more likely to get shot. They have to dodge fire from dozens of enemies at once. And, well, they’re still kids who have been trained to shoot things.

&gt;It'd be much faster since zealots can at least tank a few bullets with their shields and then a few more simply by being massive armored reptiles. This wasn't a long range engagement either. There was no reason why blue team would shoot. Just walk up and start ripping heads off. Heck, in some of the panels the sangheilli are within arm's reach. Definitely 0 reason to be shooting them there.

The reason is that they’re being shot at by dozens of enemies at once in a confined space. The Elites are mostly using energy swords and Carbines, which fire hypersonic projectiles. Running closer to them would be a bad idea even if they could one shot everything because there’s a wall of fire in front of them, so evasion is ideal.

To keep it short the Antichrist will be a US President who takes advantage of the political system and eventually takes control of the military (which the US has the largest in the world, it's budget being more than the other 9 largest combined. 

The Antichrist will also have his eye on Israel and especially Jerusalem. Trump named Jerusalem Israel's capital and that was a big deal there. 

The Jews will accept the Antichrist as their Messiah and Donad Trump is the most openly pro Israel President ever. They truly do love him there. .

The Jerusalem Boys Chior sings a song called ""Super Trump.""

They have minted a coin likening to King Cyrus. 

They have named a town after him in Golan Heights. 

And they are building a train station near the western wall that will be named after him(probably will help to transport people to the rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem. 

You can find all the links to these things in my post ""Middle East Peace Deal."" Which is the single biggest reason why I believe he is the Antichrist. The others may be smaller but they all help to reinforce my belief.

I remember when my dog had the poops in his crate while I was at work.  I was dry heaving in the back yard at 1am literally sobbing ""I can't do this.""  But my husband was out of town for several days, and I had to do it.  And you know what?  I did.  And I survived.

It was rough sometimes, but we got through it.  I'm in my third trimester now and he is still traveling for work, that's not gonna change.  But we powered through the rough feelings.

I know what you mean about feeling alone.  But you're never really alone, between your mom and your friend and the wonderful people on Reddit.  And if you ever need someone to talk to, you can always talk to me about it, if you'd like.

Fucking (German: [ˈfʊkɪŋ] (listen)) is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf, located in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria. The village is 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Salzburg, and is 4 km (2.5 mi) east of the Inn river, which forms the German border.

Despite having a population of only 104 in 2005, the village has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its place-name, which is spelled the same as the English profanity ""fuck"".  Its road signs are a popular visitor attraction, and they were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when the signs were modified to be theft-resistant.

I don’t understand parents who do this. As a kid I never really understood why people have kids. They are expensive, tons of work, completely exhausting, and seem to suck a lot of life out of people. Now my sister and I are both in our 20’s and our parents use us as drinking buddies every time we visit home. I always joke that our parents only had kids so that they knew they’d have drinking buddies in their 50’s. It honestly seems like a decent plan, but doing shit like this would ruin that plan completely. I’d never hang out with my parents now if they had been that overprotective when I was a teen.",1561939428

AST had Earthly Star's detonation as an additional source of AoE damage and Lightspeed, and it kept both of those. It lost Lord of Crowns as an oGCD damage source.

Yes. Taylor made peace with this, she’s upset it was being sold to Scooter, a man who bullied her. 


2) Also how is all of this sexist and the patriarchy targeting her? I mean people were targeting her but one of the main ones was Kim kardashian. 

Kim Kardashian sure, but also Scooter, Kanye, Justin, and now Scott betraying her. 


3) Also the Kanye thing wasn’t just women in the video and rappers go after everyone (which doesn’t make it right or that she can’t feel violated, but I don’t think it’s rooted solely in sexism). 

I don’t understand this question. You’re basically saying it’s okay because he’s a rapper and it wasn’t “just” women he targeted?


4) Is she pulling the patriarchy and sexism card on anybody that dares to targets her? Or am I in the wrong here? I’m open to peoples’ thoughts

No, I think you’re triggered by the words patriarchy and sexism. She doesn’t even mention that at all in her statement. It’s bigger than that, tbh.",1561939431

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","   So in the fiwst episode, the Awchduke gets assassinated. Ok. But watew in the episode, Austwia-Hungawy gives Sewbia, possibwy wesponsibwe fow the assasination, an awmost incompwetabwe uwtimatum. I think fow a undewdevewoped chawactew making such a stupid decision is a howwibwe ewiting choice.
   In the second episode, both sides take theiw awwies. A-H takes Gewmany, a cwose awwy, but that is pwetty much it. Sewbia, such a smaww countwy, takes in WUSSIA AND FWANCE. This is bawewy undewstandabwe, and it assumes the viewew has seen the show that comes chwonowogicawwy befowe this- Medievaw Euwope. Gweat Bwitain is awso quite afwaid to join in on the confwict, which I find as a fowced and ingenuine weaction.
  In episode 3, weaw confwict begins. Gewmany assumes Wussia has to take some time to mobiwize, so they attack Fwance. But Fwance is weww pwepawed, so Gewmany fwanks thwough BEWGIUM, A NEUTWAW COUNTWY. Why? The Bewgians do a smaww job howding back the Gewmans, thats why. A-H is doing a howwibwe job on the Sewbian fwont, which is outwageous. GB has some fowces in the waw at this point
   In the 4th episode, Gewmany goes diwectwy fow Pawis, Fwance. This is stupid on Gewmany's pawt, because they awe stwuggwing to defend fwom 3 sides. In an attempt to push the whowe fwont fowwawd, Gewmany weft a majow undefended awea, awwowing Fwance to punch thwough and fwank them, making them wetweat. Both sides keep on twying to punch thwough each othew, subsequentwy making them go nowthwawds back into Bewgium. Stupid on both sides.
   The 5th episode focuses on a mowe concetwated wegion of wawfawe and tewws about the sowdiews. They awe in the wowst conditions, and is just a back-and-fowth battwe, both sides doing the same things. Awtiwwewy, machine guns, and is an ovewaww good episode intwoducing the technowogy and sowdiews wives. Favowite episode so faw.
  So in summawy, season 1 is a wushed mess that wewies on the viewew's knowwedge of theiw othew sewies. But it did end on a good note twying to show mowe on the independent battwes of the waw.",1561939432

"DallasStars","t5_2ro4p","TL;DR: you can go over the cap with LTIR in the offseason, but you still need to be under the cap on opening day without using LTIR. So you can't get the full value of the LTIR, but maybe a portion of it allowing you to sign someone and then move players around to fit under the cap on opening day.

Some bits from Sean's article:

&gt;For starters, the Stars will have to be under the cap on the first day of the NHL season without Hanzal on LTIR, so spending over the projected $83 million in the summer is possible but would require some cap gymnastics to smooth things over.

&gt;The problem is that once you invoke LTIR, cap hits of recalled players are viewed as their full potential annual value – potential bonuses included – rather than their salary-based annual value.

&gt;This actually happened last season when the Stars weren’t able to call up Denis Gurianov in one instance with LTIR in use. Gurianov’s cap hit, based on his salary, is $894,166. But the full potential value cap hit was $1,644,166 since he has performance bonuses in his deal.

&gt;A player like Joel L’Esperance doesn’t have any performance bonuses in his deal, so his salary and face value cap hit are the same at $722,500. He is also waiver-exempt, so he’s the type of player the Stars could ideally “paper” to the minors if they are planning on using LTIR right away.

&gt;Hintz is also an option for a paper transaction, but if done in an LTIR scenario his cap hit would jump from $811,667 to $925,000.",1561939432

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","   So in the first episode, the Archduke gets assassinated. Ok. But later in the episode, Austria-Hungary gives Serbia, possibly responsible for the assasination, an almost incompletable ultimatum. I think for a underdeveloped character making such a stupid decision is a horrible eriting choice.
   In the second episode, both sides take their allies. A-H takes Germany, a close ally, but that is pretty much it. Serbia, such a small country, takes in RUSSIA AND FRANCE. This is barely understandable, and it assumes the viewer has seen the show that comes chronologically before this- Medieval Europe. Great Britain is also quite afraid to join in on the conflict, which I find as a forced and ingenuine reaction.
  In episode 3, real conflict begins. Germany assumes Russia has to take some time to mobilize, so they attack France. But France is well prepared, so Germany flanks through BELGIUM, A NEUTRAL COUNTRY. Why? The Belgians do a small job holding back the Germans, thats why. A-H is doing a horrible job on the Serbian front, which is outrageous. GB has some forces in the war at this point
   In the 4th episode, Germany goes directly for Paris, France. This is stupid on Germany's part, because they are struggling to defend from 3 sides. In an attempt to push the whole front forward, Germany left a major undefended area, allowing France to punch through and flank them, making them retreat. Both sides keep on trying to punch through each other, subsequently making them go northwards back into Belgium. Stupid on both sides.
   The 5th episode focuses on a more concetrated region of warfare and tells about the soldiers. They are in the worst conditions, and is just a back-and-forth battle, both sides doing the same things. Artillery, machine guns, and is an overall good episode introducing the technology and soldiers lives. Favorite episode so far.
  So in summary, season 1 is a rushed mess that relies on the viewer's knowledge of their other series. But it did end on a good note trying to show more on the independent battles of the war.",1561939433

Be prepared to read between the lines in other books, and look for things you already know about how magic behaves when a shard is present.

You can read Elantris when you have time. (I haven't read it in ages actually).
But I actually just finished recommending Warbreaker to someone else on reddit.

I'll tackle read order next. 

**SA=Stormlight Archive Series, AU=Arcanum Unbounded collection.**


First of all, for Mistborn, have you read the other 2 short stories **Eleventh Metal(AU)** and **Allomancer Jak(AU)**?

Books/Short Stories that generally don't interfere with each other:



* **Elantris**: This was his first published book You might miss a few easter eggs but it doesn't tie in directly enough to make it a required read before Stormlight Archives.

 **Hope of Elantris(AU)** occurs during events of Elantris as as such should be read AFTER Elantris.
* **The Emperors Soul(AU)** occurs on same planet as Elantris but is geographically/thematically separate.
* **White Sand Graphic Novels 1-2** (3rd one in trilogy is due in September)
* **Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell**
* **Sixth of the Dusk**



That leaves the Stormlight Archives which is generally self explanatory:

* **Warbreaker** can be read as soon as possible(but it is a **MUST READ** before Oathbringer)

* **The Way of Kings(SA 1)**

* **Words of Radiance(SA 2)**

* **Edgedancer(AU)**
 
* **Oathbringer(SA 3)**




As for Hoid, you'll have to read and find out along with the rest of us. Remember to keep your wits about you and look out for him, Brandon Sanderson is an amazing storyteller and there is always another secret.",1561939434

2. If this was picked upped it would have been a knock on by Reid.  These calls played in slow motion and with 20/20 hindsight seem obvious but the quick on field decision making process means it wont ever be perfect. I think if we push too much towards the TMO then its only a bad thing for the nature of free flowing Rugby, (go watch NFL if you want stop start football).
3. Ref had bad calls both ways, eg the blatantly forward pass to Ben Lam for starters, but the worse call of the night which could have been a red card, definitely a yellow was the late shoulder charge on Mounga by Coles.",1561939435

She had bought a new Honda Civic and drove it over 30,000 miles without ever checking or changing the oil. Even when the oil pressure idiot light came on, she kept driving until the engine seized. There was maybe a cup of oil left. The repairs cost her $800 (remember, this was over 40 years ago). Had she changed oil every 3,000 miles as was recommended back then, it probably would’ve only cost about $120. Neglecting maintenance is a fool’s economy.

**""Fo..Follow them""** Regon said weakly,**""Do not let them out of sight..""**

**""Get Joan, he's bleeding out !"" Prepare the oars, we're catching those bastards!!""**

Regon merely smiled, and pulled himself up right. We walked towards a bottle of wine, pulled out the cork with his teeth, poured half the content into his eyes and drank the rest. It hurt bad, but it made Regon's heart pump at a regular beat again. He then grabbed a shield, and axe and pointed at *the Nymeria's Pride,* Which was slowly turning away.

"Comcast_Xfinity","t5_3d8fi","I had the same issue for 2 years straight I’m a competitive gaming who competes in online tournaments and streams in hope to make it a career they have replace everything and for one it stopped for a while and today it happened again the internet hardwired and wireless drop for a couple of seconds. I have a nice rx500 router and Comcast gig modem xb6-t we swapped the modem 7 times I think it’s a modem issue with their modems cause never happened like this prior from switching to gig. They have replace splitter many many times, they replace coax cable from the pole to the splitter and also to the modem. They said they have checked the node out but it’s hard to believe because I have caught them lying before. I don’t know it’s just happened once today I just changed IP and reset everything. Last time it was so bad I had to contact the FCC and never heard anything back from Comcast and randomly it got fixed. The supervisor always said it had to be something with the “plant” whatever that means I guess like a power plant but for Internet? But it just happening once is giving me that old scary feeling of this might happen more often. Do you guys think it’s a modem issue with them I’m about to just buy my own. I know it just happened once today but tbh this could have been happening for this whole time for all I know cause it only disconnects for a few seconds then comes straight back and the modem does not log anything for some reason so nothing I can really use to figure it out the modem says it’s been online for the whole time.

"aviation","t5_2qhu8","G-forces on commercial flights should really never exceed about 1.2. There's no avoiding a small increase like that when changing directions, but a reasonably good pilot should make it almost unnoticeable. Of course takeoff has a lot of other violent forces going on so maybe it's a combination of things you're feeling that's inducing your vertigo.

I'm sure there's some kind of medication you can take to control that if you talk to your doctor.

As far as seats go, the wing is closest to the fulcrum point so it will have the least abrupt vertical attitude changes on takeoff. The wing does have some downsides, though; lots of noises from the landing gear, which make some nervous fliers more nervous, and the only view outside will be the wing and engines. That also can make some nervous fliers even more nervous, since you can occasionally see the engines bouncing around and lots of control surface deflections. The wing area is also noisier than the front of the plane.

Personally, I like sitting a bit forward of the wings where it's generally quieter.",1561939440

Etsy - Encountersucculents
Amazing shipping, quality, and price (huge laui for $20). Would order again from this seller. 

Etsy - StayGoldsucculents
Expensive, and shipping time wasn't the best, but the plants made up for it. Ordered a random assortment and the seller sent at least 3 - 4 rares.

"television","t5_2qh6e","So nobody is actually accurately counting because it's very hard and not worth it (this is the case for every show). But on the information that we do have The Wire is estimated to peak at around 4 million viewers. Shows have been cancelled for more. HBO doesn't need as high of view ship compared to other channels but that's not really the point. The reach was low. The show appears to be really popular among TV enthuthiasts and people in this subreddit. But there's no evidence that a significant amounts of people went and bought/pirated the show making it signficantly more popular after the initial run. Yes people here praise the show and so do critics but it doesn't mean that a lot of people have actually watched it. Mr. Robot, Leftovers, and Twin Peaks get talked about here all the time and by critics but the numbers for those shows aren't amazing. Also, the show has a lot of votes on IMDB, but what kind of user do you think is likely to make an account to vote on their favorite shows on IMDB. The kind of person who would like frequent online forums to discuss tv shows?

If you play video games for example and go to /r/gaming.

"HomeschoolRecovery","t5_3cxr2","For me, it's not that I wish I had never been homeschooled - but I do wish I was at least given a *chance* to be in school. To see what it's really like. To judge for myself whether I should be there.

I was homeschooled when I was young because my mother thought I was smarter than most kids, and decided homeschooling would help me grow at whatever pace I needed. I went to 3rd and 4th grade in public school, however, but due to a lot of complications with moving around from house to house (only to wind up back where we started), I was mostly just homeschooled after that. Particularly through higschool especially, because we've lived in a terrible neighborhood, to the point that even the local school is borderline unsafe.

Still - I'm struggling now, because as a child I bought into the ridiculous ""Highschool Musical"" nonsense, and I was excited to try highschool. I was smart enough to know it wouldn't be singing and dancing, or over-dramatic clicks and whatnot, but I liked school when I was in elementary and I wanted to know what it'd be like as a teenager when I was first able to exercise freedom with my friends.

Unfortunately, unless some miracle happens, I'll live the rest of my life and die without ever knowing what it's like to experience highschool for myself. I'll keep getting older, never knowing what it's like to be in middleschool asking my friends ""what highschool are you going to?"". I still just barely know how to open a locker, for goodness sake. I hope this feeling of regret will go away someday, but for now it stings like crazy. Whenever I pass anything involving preparing pre-teens for higschool by showing stereotypical, unrealistic, flashy teenagers, I have to tell the child inside myself ""Looks like you'll never know after all.""",1561939441

There seems to be a fundamental disconnect between your interpretation of this bill and the people calling for it to be passed; the very descendants of those massacred. What would motivate these Native Americans to ""delete"" _their own_ history, one they are still reeling from today? They are simple calling for proper acknowledgement in its proper context, lest you believe genocidal maniacs are worthy of the Medal of Honor, worthy of being revered with America's highest and most prestigious military decoration. 

Seems like your line of thought is very much on par with those who say removing Confederate monuments to avowed white supremacists from public grounds is ""deleting history"", which is ironic considering the vast majority of people whose ancestors suffered brutally at the hands of the Confederacy want these monuments gone (and justifiably so). So I guess I question _your_ peculiar motives for wanting these men to remain on the honor rolls of that medal, because your argument that this is ""erasing history"" just doesn't pass the sniff test for historical accuracy. Seems you're more content with the revisionism currently at play, the same revisionism this bill seeks to correct.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Now I’m no expert on economics, so take what I say with due skepticism. But I will share what I understand.

It is partly *because* they are far too powerful. Britain has nowhere near enough economic heft to negotiate on a level playing field with them.

Not only that, but the US are... notoriously self interested when it comes to trade. They strongly dislike many of our existing food standards and a trade deal would likely involve a change to them. They also take issue with how the NHS assessed the fair value of the drugs it buys independently, and the last thing we want is American interests interfering with the NHS.

Trading with the US is trading with a country with completely different safety standards, very little existing channels, who has no reason to care for British interests. They will make demands that further their interest but will hurt our local industries. They will make demands we can’t refuse, because we are the ones at a disadvantaged position.",1561939443

"MuslimMarriage","t5_39x1d","Akhi, no need for the harshness. You seem to have a flawed understanding of this concept in Islam of giving advice and such.

""Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma'roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful” (3:104)

“You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah” (3:110)

“Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawood (David) and ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allaah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. **They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do** "" (5:78)

Usually I would DM, but this is a sister and that would probably be considered haram. And also, I want others to see and be reminded and reflect, firstly myself, on our own sins.

You aren't supposed to ask permission before doing this. The obligation is just to do it, and the person decides whether they accept or not. Our job as Muslims is to simply do the action of calling to the good and forbidding the evil and this is of the greatest obligations of Islam and one of the reasons why the Ummah is so lowly today. Because not only do we not do this, but we discourage others from doing it. And we should be terrified of the punishment of Allah that could come at any moment like He sent punishments down upon previous nations of previous Prophets.",1561939443

A  German feminist artist who has been honored by a journalist group for  her caricatures, is now facing a fiery backlash over a series of  “racist” and “Islamophobic” cartoons – many of them relentlessly poking  fun at Sharia law.

Franziska Becker’s  works have come under the spotlight after the Female Journalists  Association (Journalistinnenbund) awarded her a prize for her  “keen-witted and sharp-tongued” depiction of men and women. The group  hailed Becker as “one of the most prominent, feminism-oriented  successful personalities” – but the praise hit a nerve with some  Germans.

Criticism began amassing on  social media shortly after news of the award broke. Sibel Schick, a  contributor to women’s Missy Magazine and TAZ outlet – and, ironically, a  self-described pro-choice feminist – was one of the first to post some  of Becker’s cartoons which she dubbed “anti-Islam and racist.”

One  caricature depicts a kindergarten where children – girls all wearing  headscarves – are seen playing with toy ""suicide"" trucks or hijacked  planes. Others are building a mosque and erecting a minaret.

Another  one portrays a supposedly Muslim bank employee who tells her non-Muslim  client that withdrawing cash is only possible with “a written  permission from a husband, a father, a brother or a son.”

There  was also a Becker cartoon in which a Muslim policewoman deals with a  shoplifter using an axe – a blunt reference to a Sharia provision which  prescribes that theft be punished by severing the thief’s hand.

Naturally,  there was no shortage of criticism on social media, with users venting  anger at both the artist and the journalists’ association.

The  journalists’ group, meanwhile, has backtracked on promoting Becker’s  award and said that “we take the criticism seriously and are currently  discussing it intensively, but at first privately.”

However,  those defending Becker pointed out that she isn’t overly obsessed with  Islam. Other caricatures that she’s created have been equally critical  of Christian preachers and Buddhists, it turns out.

Becker  has always been a “super-left, super-feminist cartoonist,” one user  wrote, wondering why “this woman is now supposed to be “racist” because  she is critical of Islam (like any religion)?”

Twitter  users aside, women’s magazine ‘Emma,’ where Becker works as an  illustrator and cartoonist, has thrown its weight behind the embattled  artist. The magazine publisher insisted that Becker, who has created  satirical cartoons about “Islamic fanatics” since as early as 1991 had  fallen victim to “a smear campaign and censorship.”

As  controversy mounted, Becker spoke out about her stance, telling the  media that her satire was directed against violent Islamism, but had  nothing to do with Islam as such.

“I am  not concerned with the headscarf itself, but with the headscarf as a  symbol of the oppression worn by female Islamists and converts,” she  argued.

It'd be better to have OU=Users, and the perhaps something like IT, Legal, and Finance underneath that. You're more likely to have some special need with regards to particular job functions than where the person is working I would think.

Ditto for computers: an HR or Finance system would more likely be configured differently around its function as used by a particular group (e.g., more encryption) than where it is located.

Also have an OU called ""Disabled"" or somesuch for accounts of humans that are no longer at the company. IMHO you should never ""delete"" an account, and just disable it, to allow for auditing and keeping the username labels of SIDs of files that may be laying around.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Its about a girl and two guys that are fans of a girl called Puri-tan (or something like that). It starts with the fan girl arriving where the two guys created a cult to this Puri-tan. To enter she lifts her skirt and shows the stripped panties that became the trademark of Puri-tan. After the fan girl and the two guys start talking about how much they like Puri-tan the guys show her that they are using the stripped panties too, she gets drunk and fuck both guys. After that she go to Puri-tan's house meet her.

I've read this doujin around 6 months ago, and I simply cant recall its name. I remember reading it in nhentai site but cant find it under the threesome tag (ive looked at least 50 pages) or by searching Puri-tan (tried many variations like Puri-san but didnt work).

I would also be OK with getting tickets for login days plus rank as a little thank you for sticking around.  It shows the veteran players that the company appreciates your loyalty for sticking around.  As of now, I’m a little sour for not picking the 100 tickets for the anniversary rewards.

Give her the benefit of the doubt to see if she does the mature thing or not and decide from there. If she picks up the slack but that's not enough for you for whatever reason, leave her; if she picks up the slack and you are impressed, continue with her; but don't leave her without a warning, specially because you are giving up on her as easy as she is willing to give up on her job.

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","I wonder if a wooden bed frame would work better than a metal bed frame? Trees [wood] tend to flex but metal tends to stay rigid when hit with a force such as wind, earthquakes, etc., so I wonder if (in addition to being cheaper)  choosing a wooden bed frame over a metal one might help? 

Also, I wonder if placing little bits of rubber or other shock absorbing material,  cut to look like metal washers, placed between the parts of the frame when assembling it, such as on the bolts that are used to hold the bed frame together, could help to further damp any vibrations?

Also, as others have said, heavier objects tend to damp vibrations better. So, maybe adding a few cheap weights, like gym weights that people always seem to have laying around or giving away on craigslist, could be stacked on the top of the four bedposts in each corner to increase the weight of the bed. 

Soft pads under the bed and a wooden bed frame with rubber washers could help act like springs and the weights could act as extra mass which all combined might be a cheap solution to your problem? Best of luck!",1561939448

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I myself was ""depressed"" in the past - I used to get extremely sad about my inadequacies in life and ask myself why everyone else had better lives than me. Looking up mental health videos was a pastime of mine where I would dwell on these negative thoughts. I would turn to meditation to achieve ""mindfulness and acceptance"" and also thought about getting medicine in addition to my mild drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Gradually I realised that I did not have a right to be upset at all. I met people who lived in neighbourhoods where gunshots were regularly heard and police were regularly called. People who became homeless and worked 3 part-time jobs to make ends barely meet. People forced to drop out of university to support their families. The list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point - it was quite obvious that I had an ego and thought I deserved everything in life, when in reality I didn't deserve shit based on the work I put in. My view of myself as some ultimate victim prevented me from doing anything - an honest look into my own life revealed I had shit grades, social skills, looks and fitness. These were the areas I decided to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

Since beginning university, I have known people who were diagnosed by doctors as having mental health issues. 3 years later, they are still just as miserable. Why?

&amp;#x200B;

\-They live lives of consumption - instead of learning skills to help others, all they do is spend money on items instead of LEARNING EXPERIENCES (I suppose this relates to your social media stuff).

\-They treat everything as genetic. If they have been called ugly, they simply say it's 100% because of the bad hand they were dealt.

\-They can't cope with discomfort - watching motivational speakers and TED talks is easier than facing the possibility of failure when you're actually the person doing something.",1561939449

The one that aired in May 2009, the full director's cut of 55-minutes. And the director's cut that aired later, which mixes the original with some director's cut scenes.

The first release of the episode didn't have Leaving on a Jetplane, it was added in the DC. But there are several scenes in the DC that are not in the new release (the one we have on Netflix, which also was in the full season DVD/BR sets) that has 7 minutes less than the first DC.


Which gives us 3 versions :

- Original Cut : 43 min, doesn't include ""Leaving on a Jetplane""

- Director's Cut : 55 min, includes ""Leaving on a Jetplane"", Ken Tanaka saliva smearing scene, and a different intro, several other scenes, and different editing (see this : https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=808872 )

- Final Cut : 48 min, the one that's aired today and available everywhere, includes ""Leaving on a Jetplane"" and the Ken Tanaka saliva smearing scene


As far as I know from the research that I've made, the Director's cut can only be found on a standalone DVD.

This type of trauma isn't something you can snap out. It could take years of therapy to understand and slowly gain control over. It's something that takes a tremendous amount of strength. 

The girl I was with cried (from happiness) the first time I stopped when she said she wanted to continue. She had a lot of bad things happen to her when she would stop before. She said she didn't trust that everything would actually be okay, even though she knew I was a good person. She was amazed when it was okay. Sexual assault is not an easy thing to get over. I finally figured out when she would zone out during sex. It's a survival thing. You cannot begin to imagine how much it changes someone and how.difficult it is to trust people again.

I think that would be a great idea for you to check out something like those classes. That's a good attitude also.

He’s going to prison for over 100 years for his lies.  And he was being cast as a democratic presidential candidate who appeared constantly on mainstream media.  

Let’s shift the blame: the air in some Chinese cities is so thick with pollution that they wear masks to go outside.  Spending an hour outside in Beijing on a bad day is like smoking two packs of unfiltered cigarettes.  You don’t think that needs addressing?  You don’t think that this rampant level of pollution could at all be connected to your climate crisis?  This is part of the reason to bring companies back here: so they have to play by cleaner laws and create jobs for Americans.  

The drone was in international airspace.  Iran had no right to fire on it.  As per the documentation released by the Navy from the drone’s flight logs, it was 21 miles outside Iranian territorial boundaries.  Also, unmanned aircraft enjoy something known as Transit Passage, meaning they cannot be harassed by military assets.  

Trump getting rid of Obama policies: he saved families.  Coal, oil, and natural gas jobs that support families came back and kept those good people from poverty.  Trump’s pro-business policies and cutting regulation boosted consumer confidence.  The stock market is at an all time high and people are thankful because there is more money for them.  They’re paying less in taxes and spending more.  That’s good for the economy.  

Where is the wall?  It’s being built in California right now.  It’s on the news.  The panels are going up as we speak.  

Repeal and replace: he’s got rid of the mandate and as of now he’s got bigger things to worry about.  Also, you might want to look up how much socialist medical care will cost.  Then you might want to wonder who’s going to pay for it.  Because what leftists like yourself don’t understand is that whenever a politician promises free stuff, someone else pays for it.  Republicans are the ones who understand economics.  That’s why we don’t say we’re giving you “free” stuff.",1561939451

In the USCF 1700-1900 range, you're ready for Artur Yusupov's Quality Chess series of orange-covered, 'Fundamentals' series, Build Up Your Chess 1, Boost Your Chess 1, Chess Evolution 1 and Revision &amp; Exam 1.  Both the author and publisher now recommend the rating range I've quoted for Level 1, not what's recommended in the introduction to each book.  Each of the first three books covers 24 topics, a total of 72, with tests at the end of each of the 72 total chapters.  The final volume gives you additional tests on these 72 topics.  These challenging, highly recommended works, with careful study, have the ability to help you identify - and fill in - the holes in a strong amateur's game.  Go to the publisher's website, qualitychess.co.uk , then to the blogs and search on the word *Yusupov* for tips on how best to use the books.
2. Play up in tournaments so that you're likely to be paired against players about 100 - 200 points higher than you.  In your case, that would be an under-2100 section instead of an under-1900 section.  You'll lose more at first, but you'll learn more per game played and analyzed, and you'll begin to see exactly what skills 2000-level players have that you don't.",1561939453

I used rape claims as my basis to a question about YOUR beliefs and thrice, you've dodged it. I assume your stance varies depending on topic. Okay, moving on. I stated my source, the PD, which you corrected: they tweeted receiving claims, they didn't themselves state it as a fact, and that's fair enough; and yet, in the parent comment YOU replied to, I also said it hadn't been proven. You chosen to jump in here and attack me, talking about fake news and lies, instead of something like: ""based on X and X, this claim is probably untrue"", in which case we wouldn't be here. Yes, I am ""clearly of the opinion"" that we should consider it, I flat out said that and you failed to read it. This is NOT the same thing as accepting a lie as a truth or naively devouring scraps of information at a whim. I basically said, ""Damn, they're saying there might be concrete mix in those"" and you went on a tangent about stuff I've never said. Your inability to take direct meanings from direct statements is sad at best, as you'd clearly rather project a character onto people that don't disagree with you than have a conversation.

"churning","t5_2vrf0","I think you'll get downvoted for the naivete of your question.
Is this a quibble about definitions? What does ""paying for your points"" mean to you?

Let's look at a more advanced version of this question by making a decision between two possible actions.  In both cases, we will assume that there is no overhead for acquisition and liquidation, e.g. activation fees or money order fees.

-  __Action A__: Buy $500 VGC with a 2x rewards earning CC and earn 1000 points.  Liquidate $500 VGC.  Net gain: $0 and 1000 points.
-  __Action B__: Buy $500  VGC with a 2% cash back CC and earn $10.  Liquidate $500 VGC. Net gain: $10 and 0 points.

Comparing these two possible actions (and assuming the amount of effort and overhead is the same), we can see that the choice is between either a gain of 1000 points or a gain of $10 cash.  If you choose to go the points route, _does that mean that you have paid $10 for 1000 points_ (1 cpp)?",1561939455

If you are ready, maybe try dating so you will see that there is a lot of other people that can be great for you in different ways out there.

En serio?” and the conversation went on from there. I was so impressed because it’s clearly not just a direct translation from English, which was really cool.

E: ah, sorry—just saw you might be looking for something more basic. Maybe you should check out “Influent” on Steam? I just picked it up on sale but haven’t played it yet.

Everyone has guys that teach them a ton, other not so much. That is 100% luck of the draw but I would say there are more good guys out there than bad. 

As far as books, you might be able to get them slightly used, but the JATC might require you to buy the text books from them to keep the publisher machine running. That’s basically what we were told when we asked why text books weren’t purchased and loaned out to us by the jatc. Everyone has to make money, which I get, but it’s tough making $12-$14 an hour and having to fork over $500-$600 or more for books, but I suppose only half of that is books and the other half is work books. 

I think most JATC’s are doing Blended Learning, which is a computer based work book, basically, so no hand me downs there. They can track everything about your homework with that system. Glad I went thru with good old fashion works books.

Are we expected to believe that Bran and Tyrion were so overwhelmingly excited to read the book that they were threatening the Archmaester with execution if he didn't present it to them immediately? Why else would he be in such an immense rush that he couldn't possibly have delayed a bit more, and completely removing Tyrion was the only option he had?

This the problem, they can't take one L. Like I am happy to look at different areas where men and women either do well or struggle and say that this *could* be connected to innate differences. It isn't insulting me to, it's just interesting. I am happy to say that men are most likely more inherently violent than women. But I also think that same risk taking inclination drives most of our euntropenurs, it's give and take. Feminists that I talk to come across as all take. 

&gt;If you want to make the claim that they are, and that this explains the disparity, it's on you to prove that. Otherwise you're just asking feminists to concede your point before the discussion even begins.

You dump your problems onto him, self harm and all. Without asking if he's okay to hear it. 

He said he couldn't right now. Scared he'll lose you. You said take a break because he couldn't hear you venting at that point. 

I would, after going through that, say that's emotional abuse. You expect your partner to be at your whim and call to vent to, regardless of his feelings. 
Then take a break from the relationship, which he was scared of, because he can't listen to you right now, which you don't care about asking about. 

He was stressed, overwhelmed, and you didn't care about him at all, only that you could vent. 

Regardless of your home situation, that is emotional abuse. 
I've gone through that before, and it is not okay.

Your partner is human too. He has his worries, his own issues. He is not your care taker, he is your boyfriend. 

I would highly recommend getting a therapist to talk to you, and talk to the police, your place of education if you are in one or childlike to deal with the domestic abuse at home ASAP. It is not a safe environment and should be brought to the local authorities.

- Laser accuracy auto aim
- Black hole wheels that absorb all damage, no matter what the fuck you hit them with
- Absurd speed on tiny ass maps, allowing them to be anywhere and spot anything within the first 30 seconds of the game.

As for the flexibility on price, I can throw in the shipping as included in the asking price. I can't comment on how these watches have tracked on the market as I stopped checking once I acquired this watch, though, a quick search on chrono24 reveals a current range of $3,300-$3,500 for the 2502.33 and $2,800- $3450 for the 2503.33.

I own both (with far more BTC than Nano) because I see too many obstacles in lightning's adoption after giving it a fair shake and a long hard look.  In addition, a block size increase will never sit well with a huge and vocal part of the community, and in the scheme of adoption, I'd be the first to admit that I see many critical issues with how Bitcoin is trying to scale.  Of all the other alts, Nano covers the most number of things I value in a cryptocurrency asset.  However as the market speaks today, BTC a relatively ""safer"" asset.  We can all get along.

Now regarding this: ""Plus look at how toxic their community is when people point out it has no fundamental reason to be valued as money"".  Please do link to where you saw this.  If ever, the Nanocurrency sub has been one of the most respectful, mindful, and non-judgmental crypto subs I've spent time in.

"heartbreak","t5_2rcye","I've learnt that the best way to help a person when they're going through a shit time is by providing empathy. And one of the best ways for that is to relate. So I'll say for a fact that it's when I get lonely, tired, or hungry (basically when there's something bothering me) that I notice my mind wandering to questions like 'what happened' 'why did she do that' etc – to which we've already established there are no answers to. 

Recognising these patterns and knowing when and why I start to think thoughts like these helps me to reinforce my understanding of my mind, self, and any emotional link between these factors. 

I used to fixate on this idea (can't be sure where I got it from, probably got stuck in my head from a meme or something) that the girl you think about right before you go to bed is the one you love. But when things didn't work out between her and I, obviously that put me in a position to question this belief. But logic didn't help me fall asleep any easier, or miss her less. What did was regaining my own power over how I felt regarding these kinds of beliefs and my emotional or mental states. When I am looking forward to everything else in life, there becomes very little reason for me to look back on a person or event that simply does not belong in my current reality.

I know you feel sad. But one day, this pain will make sense to you. And when that day comes, you will not only be free of it, but also empowered to understand why it was necessary to help push you to achieving whatever comes next.",1561939463

Baghrir or beghrir (البغرير) is a pancake consumed in the Maghreb region. They are small, spongy and made with semolina or flour; when cooked correctly, they are riddled with tiny holes (which soak up whatever sauce they are served with). The most common way to eat baghrir in Algeria and Morocco is by dipping them in a honey-butter mixture, but they can also be cut into wedges and served with jam. It is common to add raisins to the pancake as well.

Second, you shouldn't be stiffing each other in the head. The art of wrestling is to make it look like it hurts without hurting each other. 

The idea of a move where you drive someone'e head into the ground is that you don't. When you do a piledriver, the opponent's head isn't' meant to hit the ground or you end up like Steve Austin with a fucked up neck.

Angry feminism aside, though - this is just crazy. Your mum is meant to be coming to help you, not stress you out more, and certainly not to add MORE chores to your roster. I don't care if she wants you to lick envelopes; no. You've Just had a child. Your priority is going to be that defenseless human being, regardless of who is marrying who.

&amp;#x200B;

System Fusion is technically the name for Yaesu's mixed-mode repeater. Their mode is actually known as C4FM...but everyone calls it fusion. WIRES-X is the digital version of WIRES...which is Yaesu's repeater linking stuff. In analog mode it's WIRES, in digital mode it's WIRES-X. So the thing about WIRES-X is that it's a closed-source proprietary linking system; only Yaesu software has access to it. Hotspots cannot directly connect to it.

&amp;#x200B;

So what you have is an open-source ""reflector network"" for hotspots. Many of these are bridged to a specific WIRES-X room using external hardware.

I looked into it and part of what differentiates drug smuggling in luggage from what qualifies as ""drug trafficking"" in this sign is if they can track multiple trips back and forth and find you with drugs on one of those trips (no drugs needed to be found on the other trips) to establish a pattern.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","ill add on:

1) If youre going to have sex USE A CONDOM (seriously guys stds and kids suck) also condom and pulling out makes you more protected. Btw ladies this thing called Nexplanon is a type of birth control that goes into your arm (it wont hurt they give you a numbing shot) its about the size of a matchstick and it is in your arm for 3 years. It keeps you from ovulating (your body producing an egg) and is about 99.95% effective from kiddos.

1.5) explaining the cycle and pregnancy again because the American sex ed system is trash. So you know about the whole period thing and yada yada and in the middle ovulation happens for the girl (body yeets egg out of ovaries) so about 4-5 days before and just in case 4-5 days after you can get pregnant. Sperm live in your body for about 3 to 7 days, but the egg lives about 24 to 36 hours. The time frame where you can get pregnant isn't that big, but it can happen so still use protection.

2) its all lower than you think for girls. If you think you found what youre looking for go down about half an inch lower and you found the drop zone.

3) Use lube guys and gals. put a drop in the condom so the guy feels more comfortable and some on the outside for the girl. Trust me it feels much better.

I can give a list of sites where I got this information and can answer sex ed questions, also if you want a list of Birth control effectiveness I can also bless you with that. Using 2 methods bumps you up for safety.

4) Communication and consent is key. Done be afraid to ask if youre doing ok during anything you might be doing. If you don't feel comfortable tell your partner. And if you are told somethings off stop ask what you should do and go from there. If at any point you or partner are not ok with something STOP, ask and take the proper steps from there.",1561939465

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let me tell you my choice:

Something like a mech suit or a gatling gun are obvious, and nobody else would have any similar weapons: So I think a stun gun would be a great item.

A stun gun is concealable, so you don't immidiately become a target by walking around with a missile launcher. Hide it in your pocket, in a bag or even in your hair if it's long enough.

A stun gun can also be a tool. Overclock it and it can be used to create heat energy to start fires, use the strings from a stun gun ""pack"" for simple crafting or rig a weapon with a stun gun to electrify it.

And finally, a weapon. A stun gun is relatively quiet unlike a gun, but has range like a bow. It lacks super long range, but if you can sneak up onto a target and shoot them, they'll be too busy siezing up and thrashing on the ground to worry about you finishing them off with a melee weapon easily.",1561939466

Acid Puddle: Why a variable cost? That part seems to make it more complicated than it has to be. Doing that much damage PLUS making difficult terrain seems a little too strong at 1st level.

Disarm: Seems like it's the Command spell bit imo worse. They drop their weapon on YOUR turn not theirs, so they can just pick it up as a free action. If you cast command, you can just say ""Throw"" and they'll throw what they have in hand on THEIR turn. While it is true that you will be able to cast Disarm on ANY creature with a nonmagical weapon,  Command has way more versatility and is a spell slot lower.

"LegendsOfTomorrow","t5_37x73","I do agree in the punching being justified, I think that when I feel they did mistreat him was when they found out that he told Snart their plan, not knowing he wasn't just a hallucination, it really bothered me to see how unsupportive Stein was, abd how Jax was talking to him and how he seemed to have taken it so personally, when it was clear that wgat happened wasn't Rory's intention. Rory telling Snart is what started a chain of events, I feel that if the team would have reacted differently, his reaction would have been different, as well.

Rory makes a mistake &gt; he doesn't feel his friends trust him and two of them almost completely turn on him &gt; He betrays Team &gt; Team still blames him, reasonably, but not acknowledging to him that they had a hand on him switching sides &gt; He proves himself to them whe eventually gave them The Spear.

I like how you describe forgiveness when it comes to The Legends and how that is a reflection of Sara, I agree, initially she was the only person who tried to make him feel that they weren't turning on him, but Jax kept pushing (I just can't express enough how much his overreaction upsets me every time i think about it). That's one of the things that I love so much about Sara, she has always been willing to give people chances, and hear them out, and think through how she will handle things, and even when her ideas are a little insane, they are clever and sometimes the only way out, I think that this ability to come up with solutions is something that Rip saw was special about her.

I still don't think Sara has completely forgiven herself or that she ever will, but I would love to see it explored more, especially with her past with The League, there is so much potential in those stories and it could be great material for Caity to play with. Even if it's not complete forgiveness, learning to *trust* herself was such a great moment for her.

I love your idea about Ava, I would absolutely love to see such a story being explored, but as you say, it will probably never happen, even if it would be a great opportunity to expand her character and putting more attention on The Legends by getting rid of The Time Bureau.

I do hope Ray mantains that optimism going into next season, but I would love to see him dealing with what happened to him this season and overcome it.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Both my parents ate themselves prediabetic and whined that it was impossible not to eat any time they felt bored or hungry. Even their doctor was pandering to their delusions regarding their eating problems. ( Largely because patients lie constantly about what and how much they eat and get angry or shut down when confronted with reality. )

And this was a big WTF moment for me because THEY didn't raise their kids like that, so how the Hell did they convince themselves of that stupid BS?

I managed to convince one to find other hobbies and stop lying to themselves to constantly justify overeating. ( Daily lies such as ""I haven't had breakfest so I need a big lunch."" while the empty can of soda and empty bag of chips is still next to them. )

No you don't NEED a cake and a soda a 3AM because you woke up and ""can't sleep on an empty stomach and a carrot won't do"". 

Find a fucking hobby and do that untill you are tired enough to fall asleep.

That one lost weight and their blood sugar lowered alot.

The other one refused to stop overeating, whined about ""muh genetics"" and is now T2 diabetic : on drugs to delay the damage that their overeating is doing. They can fix that self-inflicted problem whenever they want. ( Losing 15kg or more has a 86% success rate in getting rid of T2 diabetes. )

I don't know when the developped world regressed into ""whiny toddler"" phase regarding the slightest feeling that there is room to shove more food in, but it is now killing and bankrupting entire nations.

We used to have actual periods of food shortages, religiously-enforced ""pretend-food shortages"" and gluttony was frowned upon. Now it is celebrated and you are a fatphobic bigot for criticizing it.

Erm, that's completely wrong no matter how you look at it. Masaki is a human. All quincies are humans.

A  German feminist artist who has been honored by a journalist group for  her caricatures, is now facing a fiery backlash over a series of  “racist” and “Islamophobic” cartoons – many of them relentlessly poking  fun at Sharia law.

Franziska Becker’s  works have come under the spotlight after the Female Journalists  Association (Journalistinnenbund) awarded her a prize for her  “keen-witted and sharp-tongued” depiction of men and women. The group  hailed Becker as “one of the most prominent, feminism-oriented  successful personalities” – but the praise hit a nerve with some  Germans.

Criticism began amassing on  social media shortly after news of the award broke. Sibel Schick, a  contributor to women’s Missy Magazine and TAZ outlet – and, ironically, a  self-described pro-choice feminist – was one of the first to post some  of Becker’s cartoons which she dubbed “anti-Islam and racist.”

One  caricature depicts a kindergarten where children – girls all wearing  headscarves – are seen playing with toy ""suicide"" trucks or hijacked  planes. Others are building a mosque and erecting a minaret.

Another  one portrays a supposedly Muslim bank employee who tells her non-Muslim  client that withdrawing cash is only possible with “a written  permission from a husband, a father, a brother or a son.”

There  was also a Becker cartoon in which a Muslim policewoman deals with a  shoplifter using an axe – a blunt reference to a Sharia provision which  prescribes that theft be punished by severing the thief’s hand.

Naturally,  there was no shortage of criticism on social media, with users venting  anger at both the artist and the journalists’ association.

The  journalists’ group, meanwhile, has backtracked on promoting Becker’s  award and said that “we take the criticism seriously and are currently  discussing it intensively, but at first privately.”

However,  those defending Becker pointed out that she isn’t overly obsessed with  Islam. Other caricatures that she’s created have been equally critical  of Christian preachers and Buddhists, it turns out.

Becker  has always been a “super-left, super-feminist cartoonist,” one user  wrote, wondering why “this woman is now supposed to be “racist” because  she is critical of Islam (like any religion)?”

Twitter  users aside, women’s magazine ‘Emma,’ where Becker works as an  illustrator and cartoonist, has thrown its weight behind the embattled  artist. The magazine publisher insisted that Becker, who has created  satirical cartoons about “Islamic fanatics” since as early as 1991 had  fallen victim to “a smear campaign and censorship.”

As  controversy mounted, Becker spoke out about her stance, telling the  media that her satire was directed against violent Islamism, but had  nothing to do with Islam as such.

“I am  not concerned with the headscarf itself, but with the headscarf as a  symbol of the oppression worn by female Islamists and converts,” she  argued.

Very reasonable point with the gas grill, high end food is so powerful that it almost makes all the other morale bonuses obsolete. I just wish they didn't put so many recipes in there that are pretty much out of reach until power is no longer an issue for you. That comes *very* late in the game for the majority of players and some players never get there.

"evolution","t5_2qhs7","Yes, it's TECHNICALLY true that we cannot prove that unicorns don't exist, but logic can still lead us to that conclusion, and to the contrary position that aliens might exist.

If unicorns were real, they'd be very horse like, by the very definition of a unicorn.  If we venture afar from that definition then we'd be able to call rhinocerosses (rhinoceri?) fat unicorns, which I do.  If these horned horses did exist, we'd have evidence for them, since there are no unexplored open ranges left for them to be hiding in.  A horned horse wouldn't live in a jungle, or a desert island, or in tundra, which is why horses don't, naturally, live in those areas.  Logically, unicorns don't exist, with the caveat that they might, but in a very un-unicorn form.

There are billions of stars, and I'm pretty sure I'm way underestimating that number.  You know the rest...there are millions of planets with conditions that appear to be conducive to the evolution of life.  It would be mind-boggingly amazing if it turned out organic chemistry appeared only this one time, even though, yes, it's possible.  We haven't found evidence of alien life yet, but then again, we're only able to investigate 0.00000000001% of the areas that might have said evidence.

If we only lived in central park, and had never seen unicorns, I'd definitely agree that unicorns were a total possibilty.",1561939475

"gatekeeping","t5_3fkyp","For one the meds that caused weight gain are for other reasons. And the ones I'm on now do help those problems. 

I can't exercise at all no, I have exercise induced bronchospasm. Other things as well that yes will extend the residual pain to ridiculous times after the exercising. I was forced to clean the entire upstairs of the house in 12 hrs and couldn't get out of bed for a week without pain. With fibromyalgia it hurts enough to move as it is. Something is wrong with my posture atm that causes my back to be in excessive amounts of pain if I stand for more than 15 or 20 min. I want physical therapy for that but I haven't seen my Dr in a while and he's very hard to get in to see, and I can hardly afford to see a Dr anyway. Also I've been told I need to be extremely careful regardless because hyperflexibility means I can much more easily injure myself.

Initially the meds caused me to gain a lot of weight on their own as well as be extremely hungry constantly. Ive been on several that caused weight gain that added more and more. Currently I'm on one associated with weight loss but that doesn't always happen. I also don't eat much anymore and I do think I'm losing a bit but literally my only way is diet and that is not taking it off. At the same time as getting on the antipsychotics I was taken off of ADHD medication. (which I'm on again) psych meds can cause quite a bit of weight gain. 

Depakote made me excessively irresistibly starving 24/7 for example, and I have relatives who this has done the exact same thing to.

I'm off most of the medications that cause weight gain though. I finally found a decent combination for that part. Still have the breathing and pain issues which is why I still can't exercise.",1561939475

Title: **My grandmas car was hit not once but twice by a car while parked out in front of our apartment,no one was in the car and a neighbor saw it and told us .Should I be on guard about this being some type of intimidation vandalism tactic or just stupid citizen bumping into car twice in a row?**

Original Post: 

&gt; My grandma is worried about the insurance coverage for this ,in my opinion the bumps aren’t too bad and I probably would just let it go and not worry about repairs .
&gt; 
&gt; But being the ball of anxiety that I am,I’m kind of fearing that this was some type of planned attack or vandalism.I mean...who bumps into a car TWICE with someone watching them .
&gt; 
&gt; Idk just seems a bit odd to me .
&gt; 
&gt; Could this be an intimidation/vandal tactic?
&gt; 
&gt; Or just dumb driver

If ridable Pokemon are introduced in future games, I would want them to have ""exclusive areas"" in a sense. For example lets say that a certain water type Pokemon can dive under water and can allow you to catch bottom-feeder themed Pokemon. As another example lets say that you need a Pokemon capable to traverse rocking landscapes. For such a system to truly work there would either need to be a lot of flexibility in what Pokemon you choose (for party reasons) OR you can assign certain pokemon as your dedicated ""water, land, air"" teams, but I think it would make TMs feel more natural and give you more of an incentive to catch (and evolve) certain Pokemon.",1561939480

Honestly I just had to ride out the wave, I clung onto the idea that things would get better and eventually it did for a time. Life is a rollercoaster and the calm good times never last forever. 

My depression started getting better and less intense when I really grew close with my new university friends.  I had lost all my close friends from home, except for one who i didn’t talk to that much. I had those new people who understand me and could help me. The biggest thing that helped me was therapy. I met an incredible therapist who helped me so much, people in my life have said that they’ve seen massive changes in me. I was receptive to her advice and finally had a place to start putting my baggage down.

&amp;#x200B;

First an explanation of what you see. With colorblind modes you'll get a pre-selected attacker and defender color and UI choices, while it is definitely better in certain scenarios like the blue attack indicator against yellow team, as you can see in the example it makes it worse than if I used the default color mode. 

&amp;#x200B;

This issue could be addressed by choosing a color that'd contrast both teams, but the way to please the majority of the colorblind community is just to let us decide our own UI colors, and potentially even allowing individuals to have their default/chosen colors so I can see their fashion. 

Other games have let us do this to an extent first that comes to mind is the latest battlefield games, unfortunately I don't know if Ubisoft will even consider this an issue as Rainbow Six Siege there greatest success in recent times still doesn't have a colorblind option.

\~What Are They?

&amp;#x200B;

They are just some squishy sponge material that makes a great filtration medium!

If you dont know what they look like just google them or search them up on amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

\~How Do They Work?

&amp;#x200B;

They work using an air pump and an airline. The airline connects the sponge and the pump. The pump pushes air through the airline into the sponge, which then forces water to be pulled through the sponge material and be filtered. the air exits through a tube that the sponge is attached to.

&amp;#x200B;

\~What Are The Benefits?

&amp;#x200B;

Super cheap, super low maintenance, easy to clean.

&amp;#x200B;

Can get them for just a few bucks on amazon. To clean you just put them in dirty tank water after you've sucked it out for your cleaning, give it some good squeezes, and watch the gunk just pour out of them! They can be reused for awhile, after a long time you may want to replace it, but they can last a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Why Do You Choose Them For Your Bettas?

&amp;#x200B;

They are good for bettas since they use an air pump. You can adjust the amount of air going form the pump with a valve. Since bettas do not like a lot of moving current the fact that a sponge is so easily adjustable is what makes them perfect, and again, superrrr cheap!

&amp;#x200B;

\~Which One Do You Recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

I dont have a specific recommendation, anything on amazon is likely good as long as it has good reviews. Just check the dimensions of it to make sure it'll fit in your tank.",1561939481

"OpenChristian","t5_2rvuh","&gt; Later Jesus says ""some demons can only be cast out by fastin"". 

The verse you're citing is from Matthew 17:21 (""Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting,"") and also Mark 9:29 (""And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting,""). The difficulty is that many scholars question the sourcing of Matthew 17:21, as well as the last part ""and fasting"" in Mark 9:29, so they are sometimes not included in modern Bibles (espec. Matt. 17:21). So, I'd be cautious about hanging too much belief on them.

My housemate and I are moving house. This morning, we had an appointment at 9am to collect the keys. I start work at 10. I ended up staying at my boyfriends last night - only because I rolled my ankle, and it was easier for me to not have to make dinner etc-which made the real estate office quite out of my way before work.
My housemate doesn’t work today, didn’t work yesterday, but refused to get the keys, as she didn’t sleep well Saturday night? And 9am was too early for her?
It’s Monday. So I’ve had to sacrifice my sleep, battle peak hour traffic, jog on my bad ankle to the real estate office and only just made it to work in time.
She has no commitments until tomorrow night. AITA for being super annoyed? 
I might add that this is a common pattern with her... I am actually doing the entire move, her furniture and the end of lease clean, as she will be “too tired from work.” Maybe I’m the silly person here for expecting any different?

[Sadly this is the best source I can find (downloadable PDF).](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H041798.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVyp7brZLjAhXxuFkKHb9kCAoQFjAPegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SKJJt_klZDj9bv-Xl3TL7&amp;cshid=1561937967644)

&gt; **Summary and Policy Implications**
&gt;
&gt;*This paper projected India’s food and water future in 2025 and 2050 and assessed their
sensitivities with respect to key water demand drivers. Trends observed in the last decade
were the basis for the assumptions of the key food and water demand drivers, which form the
‘Business-as-Usual’ scenario.
On the water demand and supply, the BAU scenario projects:*
&gt;
&gt; - the total water demand to increase from 680 BCM to 833 BCM by 2025, and to 900
BCM by 2050;
&gt; - ***the total water withdrawals as a % of PUWR to increase from 37 % in 2000, to 81 % and 87 % by 2025 and 2050, respectively;***
&gt; - the degree of development, primary water withdrawals as a % of PUWR, to increase from 37 % to 52 % and 61 % by 2025 and 2050, respectively;
&gt; - the industrial and the domestic sectors to account for 54 % and 85 % of the additional
demand by 2025 and 2050, respectively;
&gt; - groundwater withdrawal to increase from 303 BCM in 2000 to 365 BCM and 423 BCM by 2025 and 2050, respectively, and the groundwater abstraction ratio to increase from 60 % to 74 % and 84 %, respectively.

BCM = Billion Cubic Meters of water, PUWR = Pure Water Usage.

In laymans terms, the % difference of groundwater availablility vs groundwater usage will have decreased by 1.76% per year (between 37% and 81%) between 2000 and 2025. Following this trend (assuming business as usual, increasing population, and a reduction of groundwater through droughts), it'll take about a decade until demand outpaces supply. 

However, you should note that groundwater availability will not be uniform, with some areas recieving higher rainfalls than others due to climate change. So while in theory India *should* have a greater water supply than demand until then, some areas may still go through their own crises.",1561939488

A  German feminist artist who has been honored by a journalist group for  her caricatures, is now facing a fiery backlash over a series of  “racist” and “Islamophobic” cartoons – many of them relentlessly poking  fun at Sharia law.

Franziska Becker’s  works have come under the spotlight after the Female Journalists  Association (Journalistinnenbund) awarded her a prize for her  “keen-witted and sharp-tongued” depiction of men and women. The group  hailed Becker as “one of the most prominent, feminism-oriented  successful personalities” – but the praise hit a nerve with some  Germans.

Criticism began amassing on  social media shortly after news of the award broke. Sibel Schick, a  contributor to women’s Missy Magazine and TAZ outlet – and, ironically, a  self-described pro-choice feminist – was one of the first to post some  of Becker’s cartoons which she dubbed “anti-Islam and racist.”

One  caricature depicts a kindergarten where children – girls all wearing  headscarves – are seen playing with toy ""suicide"" trucks or hijacked  planes. Others are building a mosque and erecting a minaret.

Another  one portrays a supposedly Muslim bank employee who tells her non-Muslim  client that withdrawing cash is only possible with “a written  permission from a husband, a father, a brother or a son.”

There  was also a Becker cartoon in which a Muslim policewoman deals with a  shoplifter using an axe – a blunt reference to a Sharia provision which  prescribes that theft be punished by severing the thief’s hand.

Naturally,  there was no shortage of criticism on social media, with users venting  anger at both the artist and the journalists’ association.

The  journalists’ group, meanwhile, has backtracked on promoting Becker’s  award and said that “we take the criticism seriously and are currently  discussing it intensively, but at first privately.”

However,  those defending Becker pointed out that she isn’t overly obsessed with  Islam. Other caricatures that she’s created have been equally critical  of Christian preachers and Buddhists, it turns out.

Becker  has always been a “super-left, super-feminist cartoonist,” one user  wrote, wondering why “this woman is now supposed to be “racist” because  she is critical of Islam (like any religion)?”

Twitter  users aside, women’s magazine ‘Emma,’ where Becker works as an  illustrator and cartoonist, has thrown its weight behind the embattled  artist. The magazine publisher insisted that Becker, who has created  satirical cartoons about “Islamic fanatics” since as early as 1991 had  fallen victim to “a smear campaign and censorship.”

As  controversy mounted, Becker spoke out about her stance, telling the  media that her satire was directed against violent Islamism, but had  nothing to do with Islam as such.

“I am  not concerned with the headscarf itself, but with the headscarf as a  symbol of the oppression worn by female Islamists and converts,” she  argued.

Further the better the study, the *less* likely it was to find a significant correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably because the important factor is handguns on the street, and that doesn't increase when someone buys two more and a few rifles, they still just carry one.

Antifa being violent is not new. It's actually such old news that I was starting to think they were dissaprearing for good. 

I fully expect them to come out full force and get wilder once the election really ramps up. 

I mean seriously how far back is your memory? The proud boys and other groups came up as reactions against Antifa. Antifa started the violence, other groups responded.

I think that your skin looks lovely but you’ll definitely need to put your blush on a lot heavier for photographs. 

I personally don’t mind the color of the lipstick but it looks a bit more glossy then I would recommend especially with how much more matte everything is, maybe try going for a more satin formula. Application looks a bit messy too, maybe try lining your lips first. I find that red just makes a mess without lip liner. 

I would do a much thinner liner for your top lid and line the bottom with either a dark brown or black eyeshadow, it will help open up your eyes a bit more and also allow more of your eyeshadow to be visible. 

I would also practice more on the brows and go for either the more dramatic mua faded brow look or use an eyebrow pencil or pen to better imitate brow strokes for a more natural appearance.",1561939492

"canada","t5_2qh68","Well, as the inclusion of that pamphlet seems to have been an error, rather than a deliberate decision on the part of the PHN or the school, I think everyone involved would probably agree that the thing is a bit 'advanced' for a class full of small kids.

A few years down the road, however, and I'd say it's a completely different story. Kids are engaging in sexual activities, either with each other or (mostly for girls) being groomed and exploited by older kids. Giving them the vocabulary to discuss what is happening in their lives, and giving them the tools to understand how to do it safely if they choose to do it is important. Anything else is just putting one's head in the sand and humming.

&gt; My concern would purely be what is the uptick in students who attempt these acts and are exposed to potential harm versus the minimisation of the harm to those experimenting with those activities. 

Do you think there are a significant number of kids who could not, should they choose to, access pornography that contains those acts? Are those acts hidden from them in the mainstream media, where jokes and references to unusual sexual practices are common?",1561939492

"learnjavascript","t5_2tugi","&gt; wondering what you mean by ‘if necessary?’ So the result of this expression is not always wrapped in a promise? (I guess unless the result of the expression is already a promise?)

Yeah, I was purposefully being a little vague, because I don't know the specific details. If the awaited expression is not a Promise, it will be wrapped in a Promise. That is clear. But if it is already a Promise, then I'm not sure of the exact mechanics. Might be wrapped, might be left alone. The effect is the same.

&gt; I see. Any expression following await is called &amp; executed synchronously, including event loop macro/microtasks.

Yes. Just remember that under the hood JavaScript has one way of handling asynchronous code: putting a callback on the event loop. That callback is put on the loop synchronously, and then called later in an asynchronous fashion.

&gt; I’m wondering: do full execution contexts remain on the execution stack if they only serve to hold a lexical environment reference pointed to by a closure?

Sort of. Only the actual enclosed variables (the ones referenced within the function) get pulled along for the ride. The JS interpreter can statically determine what variables to keep on the stack, so it doesn't actually need to keep the whole context.

&gt; could you add: throws error, how about a generator function? Does a generator run-to-completion and return an iterator? Or does it actually yield/pause mid-execution?

Ah yes, good point. Exceptions are a way to exit a function early (though it doesn't return anything in that case). And yeah generator functions are interesting. Technically a totally different type of function, but yeah, if you are in one of those you would return a value on `yield` as well.

&gt; Is it ‘await’ that wraps the return value in a Promise (if the return value is not already a promise), or is it the ‘async’ keyword function that wraps any value it returns in a promise? (Or both)?

Not sure. Kind of moot point since you can't have an `await` without an `async`.

&gt; When the interpreter hits a settled promise, does it unwrap it into a non-promise value in any circumstance?

Well, the Promise is unwrapped before it is passed to the callback of the next `.then`. 

    valueAsPromised()
        .then(foo =&gt; /* &lt;-- unwrapped */)

Or alternatively it will be unwrapped by the evaluation of an await-expression.

    const foo = await valueAsPromised();
    //    ^^^ unwrapped

However, no synchronous code will ever encounter an unwrapped Promise. Once you are in asynchronous land, you must handle things asynchronously. 

&gt; Aside: do you personally discern this level of precise clarity from the ECMAscript spec? (It can be a little confusing and abstract to grok)

Oh yeah, the spec is kind of a nightmare to just read. I have dived in once or twice when I really needed to pull something apart. Usually for a presentation or a lesson. Normally though I just make educated guesses and test them out in the console. MDN is also typically pretty darn precise and much more readable.",1561939493

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA.  This toxic, evil bitch doesn't deserve the time of day from you.

And just so you know, I advised the gay dude whose parents cut him off at 18 and now have a change of heart (you all saw that thread, right?) to consider bringing them back in his life.  At least they had some kind of reason...religious dogma, bad reason but I can understand that for people who don't know better, it can lead to them making the wrong decision, and at least they're kind of seeing through it now...and they were leaving him only to fend for himself, not leaving him to fend for himself and an innocent baby.

Your sister threw you to the wolves, but more than that, she threw your daughter, her niece, to the wolves too, and it wasn't for some misguided but understandable moral or religious reason where you can rationalize that there is any way she could have thought she was doing the right thing.  She just did it for completely selfish reasons.

All of this to say, as bad as that dude's case was, I still thought trying to forgive and have some contact was probably the healthier step.

Short of your sister crying and begging your forgiveness, and your daughter's forgiveness, on her knees, and really meaning it, and going way above and beyond to prove she has changed and will do anything to earn her way back into your lives, I can't see where you could even begin.  Throwing you out was one thing, and horrible.  But throwing out your kid, and realizing her whole reason was just pure selfishness , and seeing no real contrition on her part (which there would have to be a great deal of, as in pleading to be absolved for this monstrous crime she committed on you and your daughter)...yeah, I just can't see it.

If she didn't owe you or your daughter anything at all when you needed it most, you don't owe her so much as a single word now.  She sure can't need it a thousandth as much as you and your girl needed her.",1561939493

Then, Accept that the chapter of life with them has passed and thats just how things happen. You dont have to hate them but you do have to stop romanticizing them, AND realize this isn't the only person you'll have a connection with. Remind yourself the mistakes that rubbed you wrong and remember to keep to your standards. Get excited about how you'll meet people who you'll have a blast with (romantic or platonic) in the future, and you just have to keep going on with your life in the meantime (work on your personal goals that youve always wanted to accomplish, and, someone else shouldn't be responsible for your happiness. Be okay with only having you. Instead of being lonely, be okay with being alone.)  I reiterated there a lot sorry.

I was in that situation where i literally did imagine a future with us. (Hard not to though, right?) But, we broke up. It wasn't a bad relationship either (he was very affectionate and supportive, until towards the breakup though, it was a fling disguised as a committed relationship.) For months I'd fall into depressive episodes, be furious about how he's 'wronged' me and how fuckboys are, and cringe everytime something related to him popped up. But now, everything's alright again. Truely the one thing that got me over it was something i read on an advice article, someone mentioned how their love (in general) turned into hate (caused by the breakup) and it was polluting their life. And once they realized that, they changed what they did and improved their life. Thats when i thought...yknow what, ill just be understanding instead of resentful. Understanding that he was young and dumb. That he'll make mistakes, but also that not all relationships work, and the ones that don't, need to end, to make room for better ones. We weren't a longlasting match and thats okay. I want someone who's truely for me and I will find them. Im not saying i cut him some slack, but that shit just really happens sometimes and we just have to rise above it and find our own happiness because thats the only thing we can do. Really, time passing was also a big help. 

TLDR: get your closure, cry as much as you damn want, accept it's a passing chapter, know you WILL make a wonderful connection again (+dont think they were your only chance at love), go through life working on your goals and passions like stuff that fulfills you like nothing else, and meet people (friends and potential dates) along the way.  I apologise if what i said doesn't apply to you, it all comes from my personal experience as someone with abandonment issues and lots of insecurities. But i hope at least part of it helped you. I wish you luck fellow demi 👊",1561939494

I started with the shield, but then for the kitchen i thought 'just save a few bucks since its the kitchen'.  Well even with that light use, it just wasn't 'good enough'.  I'd have lockups, weird resolution issues since Im using a monitor not a 'tv'.  Shield I've had 0 issues.  Mibox is now sitting in a box.  100% not a 'living room' acceptable experience.  I lived with it for like 6 months in the kitchen, then when a Shield went on sale I bought my 3rd shield.  

The MiBox is 'ok'.  I could put up with it honestly.  If you have a person in the house that isnt able to put up with tech issues I wouldnt buy one.  WiFi was fine for me, but I do have pretty good wifi in the house.  I never had boot issues.  I had resolution switching issues and such.  For the price its ok...but honestly the Shield is the way to go really.  

Not sure about UK pricing and all, but they do go on sale decently often (tho it usually is like just get the controller for free type of sale).  And Shield is an officially supported device... which says a lot to me.  Not a hack like the cheap ones.",1561939494

How to create a social state:

There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.

The first is the most important.

1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people

2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.

3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.

4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.

5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).

6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.

7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.

8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.",1561939496

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","Dumbledore is apparently gay. Quote from JK:

&gt; ""The book wasn't about Dumbledore being gay. It was just that from the outset obviously I knew he had this big, hidden secret, and that he flirted with the idea of exactly what Voldemort goes on to do, he flirted with the idea of racial domination, that he was going to subjugate the Muggles. So that was Dumbledore's big secret.""
&gt; ""Why did he flirt with that?"" she asks. ""He's an innately good man, what would make him do that. I didn't even think it through that way, it just seemed to come to me, I thought 'I know why he did it, he fell in love.'

So apparently love redeems evil people, protects them, can turn back death, and the lack of love turns the big-bad bad in the first place, but homosexual love corrupts an “innately good man” into flirting with nazism.

On the AIDS thing:

&gt; ‘Lupin’s condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS.

&gt;‘All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.’

And the only other werewolf character besides Lupin in the series is Fenrir Greyback, the aforementioned (literal and metaphorical) child predator.",1561939497

The dragon emperor thing is admittedly unclear. Some lore treats him as immortal but that directly contradicts other lore where there are named emperors.

Most of it is super scattered around various books but if you piece it together you get some idea of armies and territory.

1. Make a business plan for each idea you have. What will happen is one of the ideas you have, you end up getting a brain block on creating a business plan and another idea you end up making tonnes of pages non stop filled with strategies and growth ideas and .etc. From this exercise, you will know which idea is easier to implement
2. From point 1. You should know each idea on their capital cost, timeline, how much time will it consume you, and the big question is... Which one gives you stress and which one gives you motivation
3. Finally, this is market research. Do your full-on marketing research for that idea and make sure you have demand and enough customers to serve

And you now have an idea that you know it's going to be good for a start, does not give you stress, motivates you to continue, and you know there are customers out there who wants it

No it is not. More dumb lies. I'm not searching out and posting any article I can find about a man being an asshole or an MRA doing something I don't like. I'm telling an individual that his behavior is unacceptable.

Govt hospitals often don't have the necessary resources. Govt hospitals often are far outside the reach of the patient. Govt hospitals often have trouble hydronic standards. Govt hospitals often don't have standard drugs/supplies available anywhere in the vicinity. Given the size of our population, they are vastly inadequate.

Admittedly, they are there on the paper.

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","I went to K-expo to see The Rose last year and was chosen by raffle to go up and play a charades type thing with them. (k-expo was a fucking shitshow though...... it's like the kpop version of dashcon for tumblr if u look it up a disorganized mess where we couldn't go out to get food and the artists didn't have a proper green room, plus there was [this HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM0spAknEfw) that I had recorded, like even with meeting the members it was overall the worst kpop event i've been to, 10/10 do not recommend going to events organized by that company)

&amp;#x200B;

Jaehyeong has slowly been pushing his way up the list and was number 2 at that point for me ~~(now that a certain cnblue member acted a certain way Jaehyeong is now my number 1 LOL)~~ but we got to talk to them a bit before the game. I'm still sorta sad that the girls who introduced themselves before me were super flustered cause our fun fact about ourselves turned into our favorite ice cream and I didn't get to tell him I was a bassist too :((

&amp;#x200B;

But because our fave ice cream was our fun fact, I was on team cookie dough with him and Sammy (my two faves in the group) and was sooooooo happy!! They were both super nice and kept quietly joking with the two of us on the team between rounds (especially about how Dojoon is a big cheater in games LOL). Jaehyeong's English isn't the best in the group (even though Sammy and Dojoon practice it with him and Hajoon and they've learned more recently) but he kept engaging with me and the other girl on the team. He's also super duper polite cause a few of the times when we had to act out our word as a group he accidentally would bump against me and would apologize quietly.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the boys def went beyond what they were required with us for the on stage fan engagement, even doing things the rest of the audience wouldn't notice even though they were probably exhausted from how bad the event was dealt with (they were literally using the same bathroom as the audience and had no changing room, so they could have just done the bare minimum and I would have understood).

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that really surprised me was how average height he is, like it doesn't matter much, but J Star lies about The Rose members' heights a lot. Like in [this video](https://youtu.be/B2PxqikS-go) I'm wearing the red jacket and I'm 5'2"". The members were all wearing super high shoe lifts too, Sammy is like..... 5'5 or 5'6 w/o his shoe lifts he's super tiny and Jaehyeong is so thin so it makes him look taller.",1561939500

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","While I agree with people’s sentiments that debt sucks for sure, I am not sure the ones advocating for an older car are properly accounting for the costs of maintenance.

Granted I live in a super expensive coastal city BUT dude, lemme tell ya.

When I was young and times were very lean, I had a lease on a BMW. For $300/mo over 3 years and $3000 down, BMW paid for everything and so money management was very predictable and easy. I was in a business where I was paid by commission so I knew at the end I could buy it, and if I did within 2 months, it was the same cost as if I bought it up front.

Contrast that with now. I am a mom driving a mom Ferrari—a 4 year old used Honda Odyssey, in my 6th year of ownership. This was the exact car I wanted, and I wanted to drive it into the ground because it’s a Honda, I had been told they are build so well you don’t even need to purchase an extended warranty.

I need $1000 worth of spark plugs and 4 new tires right now. And I looked recently, I made $300 -$500 repairs 3 times a year on average.

Granted I go to the dealership and a tire center...but this is like adding at least $1000/year to the cost of the car and it’s not like you have a choice usually to postpone or decline to do it.

Contrast this with all the other new cars I have had since I was 23 and were purchased on loan—basically they needed inexpensive oil changes from time to time, with something major every 3 years.

Big big difference. I say the new car on loan lets you plan your expenses much better. And when you factor in the safety features and improved gas mileage: it’s a NO BRAINER.",1561939502

Just adding.  If you get this far and you can't blame the spindle, spacers, or rim then it's time to consider maybe the wheel bearings are shot and your wheel's not being held centred; maybe the ring is bent or something foolish like crap underneath (between ring and rotor or rotor and rim) but that'd make sense only if the rotor and ring were removed which isn't a necessity when you change and balance tires; maybe the fork is bent; maybe everything's out of alignment but that's a stretch.

Late Edit.  I just went back looking through your pics.  Check out how polished your tone ring for about 1/2 its circumference.  Either that rim is not being held centered (bearings) or that ring and/or mating surfaces are deformed.  It might not be a wast of time to snap that rotor and ring off, and having a look.  Check for trueness (straight edge or level across three (minimum) chords, or on a nice flat surface) and for shit underneath and between mating surfaces (ring to rotor, rotor to rim).",1561939508

The truth is, I've been questioning my gender, and it's possible I'm (nonbinary, genderqueer, transgender--whatever term feels right). That's why I want to try growing my hair out again, not just because I like the style. I know you like me as a guy, but I think you should know that that's maybe (probably?) not actually what I am."" And then we'd take the conversation from there.

And if the conversation doesn't go as well as you want it to, remember that it's okay to say you don't want to answer certain questions (right now or ever), to tell her that you don't want to discuss certain topics during this particular conversation, to pause the conversation for a little while or end it entirely when you need to. Just because you're making yourself kind of vulnerable by telling her you're questioning your gender doesn't mean that you have no power in or control over how the conversation goes.

Bogie is an absolute monster, and as thrilled as I am about getting Brogdon, losing him dulls the day a bit. You guys are going to love him. The stats obviously jump out at you post losing Oladipo, and he didn't look great in the playoffs. The reality is probably somewhere in the middle but he's just terrific at taking advantage of space, whether that's by floating to a spot and hitting a spot-up three, or recognizing he can drive by someone and getting to the rim. He's a solid defender who moves surprisingly well laterally and gets deflections. His impact on the Pacers identity as a team that ""plays the right way"" can't be overstated.",1561939510

So there is plenty of opportunity to gain experience and all of that.

&amp;#x200B;

But what we saw in the 30 or so games is very promising. He's improved his 3 point range, obviously can drive to the rim (that was his main strength before). And he's at least not a minus defender.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: With New York seemingly looking like they are going to strike out, I had the Knicks pegged to throw this guy at least 10 million a year. He's exactly the sort of player those types of teams love to go after because he's still 26.",1561939511

Is that not the same with every sacrament, both ordinary and extraordinary form? You are assuming that the priest in question is intending to do that which the Church ***does not*** do in the mass. You don't know the answer to that, and assuming otherwise means you run the risk of being very, very wrong.


&gt;While we should assume that despite this change the consecration is still valid, nevertheless this does add to the doubt.


If the assumption is indeed that the words are valid, then there is no doubt - no room to argue around it. The novus ordo is a valid mass and anybody who says that the novus ordo, due to its rubrics, puts it at risk for being *invalid*, wanders pretty close to the heretic line.

"classicalguitar","t5_2sij1","&gt; Is this a key principle of cg to always alternate fingers 

Yes, the principle being that it's easier and faster to walk on two legs than hop around on one. There are times where repeating a finger is necessary or makes sense but the default should always be to alternate between fingers. I was terrible at this for the first couple of years (no teacher, no method books, I just had a guitar and some chord diagrams and figured things out as well as my early teenage self could, so I  developed a lot of bad habits) and I still catch myself doing it sometimes 20 years later. 

&gt; One more question: I have kind of a habit of bridging my right hand  pinky against the top as kind of an “anchor.” I realized no other  classical players do this. Bad habit that needs broken? 

Yeah, that's not a good habit to get into, it'll limit your finger movements and possibly give you a bad hand position overall. You also eventually want learn to move the hand up towards the neck and down towards the bridge to get different tones which seems like it'd be difficult with a pinky glued to the top. You'll get a more intuitive feel for it pretty fast if you keep playing, but if you feel like your hand is getting ""lost"" and want some stability, try placing your thumb on the low E-string and playing a melody or some scales on the other strings with your fingers. Using the strings as a reference is much better than gluing yourself to the body of the guitar and limiting your movement.",1561939514

When Shang uses his fatal blow, he doesn't use any of the ninjas moves. He releases a big soul energy blast thing in front of him, which transitions into a cinematic. In the cinematic, he transforms into those characters, but that's just a fancy way of showing that he's doing ~300 damage. Gameplay wise, it would be identical if his cinematic had him bashing them with flaming skulls, setting them on fire, or even doing a funny little jig. The attack itself would still be him blasting out soul energy, and then doing about 300 damage.

Reptile's slide, on the other hand, directly effects the gameplay. His hitbox comes from the slide, his positioning on the stage is effected by the slide. It's not just a cinematic that *looks* like he's using the slide, he's *actually* using the slide.

As for your Sub-Zero joke, that is different. He's not using Sub-Zero's slide. ""Reptile's"" Slide goes a different length, switches sides, has different KB requirements. 

That's why Shang Tsung doesn't transform into, say, Nightwolf for any attacks. Or why he doesn't have any of the *playable* Ninja moves as abilities.

It's similar to with Jade in MKX. Kitana had a few of her moves, therefore, she wasn't in the game. Shinnok had Shang Tsung type moves, so Shang wasn't in MKX.

TL:DR: Reptile isn't happening, not because Shang has a slide move, but because he has *Reptile's* slide move specifically.",1561939516

Here are a few random tips that you might consider, given your current situation.  I'm only going to give you a surface-level summary, so you'll need to read up further and talk to other people for a more detailed understanding of what I'm going to say:

- Begin tracking your expenses against your paycheck.  I know there are software packages to do this, but I personally don't even use one myself.  I just use a Google Spreadsheet document.
- Invest in mutual funds.  Some people will tell you to go with an ""index fund"" (which is designed so that its portfolio will match a particular stock market, like the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq).
- Open up a Roth IRA retirement plan, preferably with a mutual fund account.  And make regular yearly contributions to that Roth IRA.  As of right now, you can contribute up to $6,000 per year.
- If your current employer offers a 401K plan, take advantage of it.  It will entail putting away a small percentage of your pre-tax paycheck into a 401K account.  And if/when you change jobs, find out if your new employer also offers some kind of 401K plan - if they do, chances are that it will be with a different financial company, and you may want to consider rolling over your original 401K with your previous employer.",1561939517

Wasn't always like that, I used to be really chatty and social when I was younger but then I moved and gradually things deteriorated from there. People I was ""best friends"" with at my new location moved away after a couple of years, I was bullied in school (nothing physical, but every time it happened I would sorta close myself off a bit more), and then when I was about ten I basically dumped my group of close friends (who were all girls) because I decided for some reason I'm a boy and all my friends were boys - let me tell you that was a mistake! 
By the time I was 15-ish I was basically in a sort of self-imposed exile. 

I'm 25 now, and I'm getting better. I still have issues with connecting to people, mostly out of a fear that they don't feel the same way (whether that's just friendship or anything more) and that I'll look stupid.  Basically the best advice I can give you is give it time, and try chat with people whenever you can - online helps sometimes because it's easier to be confident when you don't have any personal stakes! (This is where online gaming really helped me)

Sorry I couldn't be a bit more help, but hope everything works out!

Sure, let's say the generators operate more. Do they increase how fast they spin? Dump more coal into them? Send more high pressure steam through the turbines? Whichever way you think it goes, let's just assume it works.

Now you got your magic power increase. What about the transmission lines that carry that increased power? What happens to them? See, the power formula is pretty specific. Power equals voltage times amperage. If you increase your ampergae by generator more power, can those old utility lines support that? Nope. They'll melt. There's a reason that they push big transmissions at 230kV. 

Ignoring the destroyed lines, what about the transformers that are at the utility poles? Do they just start pushing the hugher amperage though? Nope. They melt. And when transformers melt, the explode. Have you ever seen a transformer explode? Doubt it. There was a video a while back on /r/news about an eery light over NYC. It was a transformer exploding.

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It’s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",1561939520

Folks, if you're wondering, this guy is literally blaming Heather Heyers for her own murder by a Trump supporting Neo Nazi. This is typical for conservatives. They cry violence when a conservative gets milkshaked, but then when a conservative murders a liberal, they blame the victim. This is why we call them partisans, fascists, racists, and bigots. This is what they do. This is their modus operandi.

The conservative platform is one of violence. They support a president who engages in stochastic terrorism and then when citizens are murdered by conservative terrorists they absolve themselves of guilt.",1561939521

In this situation Taylor signed a contract with Big Machine Records when she was young. Like any other recording contract, BMR pays producers/players/mixers etc to make TS records and she gets the benefits of BMR’s marketing and knowledge (she was just a kid at this point). So while TS owns the songs, BMR owns that particular recording of those songs. 

When it comes down to it, the record label business is a game of building up a collection of copyrights and masters and then cashing out. That’s what the owner of BMR did. He cashed out, and part of that involved selling his most valuable asset (Taylor’s masters) to Scooter.",1561939521

Either change the rule so it's more consistent for different referee's, or call a foul every time. That was my line of thinking, although I still think the original handball rule needs to be changed. For example the penalty on Sissoko in the CL-final I thought was ridiculous.
Technically you can't really complain because it could be called either way, but to give a penalty for that is telling players that they need to be mindful of their arms at all times and that they even need to be wary of giving instructions to their teammates by pointing..",1561939523

He was barely above the legal limit, and hit a guy illegally crossing a causeway at 7 in the morning while going 10 mph over.

And for the record, war is brutal and savage, but shooting your own foot off, while not forbidden, is generally ill advised and Sylvanas has always been quite proficient at waging war. I was one of her defenders during Legion, because she actually was the exact type of person you wanted fighting the Legion. Smart, ruthless, cunning, willing to do whatever it took to win. THAT'S the Sylvanas I remember, this caricature of chaotic stupid they have running around in BfA is just a mockery of the character and her arc because at the end of the day, almost every choice she's made in this entire pointless faction war has been to her detriment. She's alienated the Horde and then invited a honorable empire of trolls into the Horde so that when they inevitably turn on her, she has even more people to fight. She burned Teldrassil down and ruined her own plan which got her powerbase destroyed. She's just a self destructive wrist cutter at this point and it makes me ill to remember that she used to be an interesting character.

&gt; 
&gt; Does this make any sense what I'm asking?

yes. yes. yes. yes.

but at some point you are risking a lot of money for a 1% gain through arbitrage. its not worth the hassle and risk considering the amount of money you need to move around to realize that arbitrage gain. 

The only exception to this was when QuadrigaCX had a 5-10% premimum. it was well worth the arbitrage to move money through that gateway. but ultimately the risk was too great.",1561939529

Or, do you want to be on the side of the authoritarian conservatives that want to ban immigration, care less if they destroy our environment, and only act fiscally *conservative* when it comes to helping people who actually need it.  It’s not about who got assaulted on what day, no one should be in favor of any violence on either side.  This kind of stuff is only a side show meant to produce turmoil and anger between Americans who should be united in helping us progress as a country.  Don’t let it side track you from the real issues.",1561939530
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Bedding is more or less the perfect example of what happens in an experimental realm of unrestricted marketing, run to its ultimate conclusion.  Quality signifiers are identified as having an impact on consumer interest, but are then subverted by low-quality imitators because they are extremely difficult to verify; research identifies new quality signifiers, which are in turn subverted by imitators, so on and so forth.  The ease of buying sheets online accelerated this process.  Search for sheets on Amazon and you can see the battleground in real time.

3. [ Air Force Good Conduct Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_\(United_States\)#Air_Force_Good_Conduct_Medal). The ribbon looks like it may have had some kind of device on it that has been lost.

4. [Army Good Conduct Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_\(United_States\)#Army_Good_Conduct_Medal) with clasp device. This indicates multiple years of good service; I just can't tell from the picture how many.

I worked as a HCA for about 12 years and personally loved it.  but depending on the area there's no question it's heavy going. mentally and physically. if you care about it working with burnt out staff will drive you mad while you try and advocate and do your best for the people in your care. it's also _very_ hard not to get burnt out by it when there's low staff, more than you could ever get done, constant emotional labour and very high stress. 

I didn't think the money was that bad once upon a time.  but cost of living went up. the crash happened and there was wage and hiring freezes and it's never caught up again.

&gt; These are the cards that seemed way too good when people were playing them at the event. Eye of Ugin was by far the most busted card on the banned list, as Eldrazi made up 22% of the day two metagame, yet 62.5% of the Top 8, and I even knocked out three different Eldrazi pilots in rounds 13, 14, and 15 to keep them out of Top 8. Eldrazi then went on to win the event. I would not have been surprised to see a full eight Eldrazi decks in the top eight based on what I was seeing at the top tables, and I think I got lucky to squeak by so many Eldrazi decks, as I think I had a matchup disadvantage. I actually woke up at 4:30 AM the night before the event and threw three Ceremonious Rejection in my sideboard, and if I hadn't had that middle-of-night epiphany, I would have never made it very far in the event.
