Maybe it's because my brain thinks words like ""Cancel,"" ""No"" and ""Discard"" are roughly synonymous. At least in the context of closing a file without saving.

I don't have a great solution, and maybe only my brain hates these dialogs. Although the fact that 4 OSes have arrived at 4 different answers, and people are still blogging and debating it, suggests that other people have the same problem.

One thing would to have a simple 2-possibility dialog. You hit the  Quit or Close button. ""Do you want to save? Yes/No"" (because you've already obviously elected to quit).

If the person is a dumbass and hits close accidentally, they can always save and open the doc up again. I mean, my web browser doesn't ask me to confirm a close because browsing is read-only and I can always reopen the page.

I gave other examples in other respnonses to Whitey4Obama. Specifically several quick mentions of events that happened to me personally (Which were not racism, but bigotry). There were other ""big deal"" crimes as well while I lived down there, but the details of this one just stuck with me because it was so horific to read about.

&gt;I reject your claim that racism is somehow unique to the south...

Please show me where this claim is made.

&gt;...or that it is even more prevalent there.

My only comparisons are going to be various locations in the South (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, etc) and various locations in the West (Arizona, California). 

Out in the West  I've never heard someone say ""Damn wetbacks"" randomly in public. I'm sure it happens occasionally, but I've never experienced it.

When I lived in the South I heard ""Damn niggers"" (and wetbacks, jews, etc) more than my fair share. Some of these occurances were from complete strangers.

I tell you what, it's some experience when someone you've never met looks at you with one of those half angry, half smile annoyed expressions, says, ""Fuckin' niggers, right!?"" and then expects you to agree with them (Maybe even throw a little hate in that black person's way). How do you respond to that?

Based on my experiences, the South, or at least the rural South, is far more racist than other places I've been. Can I back that up with statistics, other data, or even life experience? Not beyond what I already have. I don't have experience in the North and far East other than my youth, where racism didn't even enter my mind, and whenever I've visisted people.

From everything that I've read that's not too common in the U.S., at least not for the treatment that my daughter had (8 years old, surgery, and then chemo for 8 months in-patient).  Not to mention 10 week premature triplets, chronic lung problems due to prematurity, and autism care for the last 10 years.

No, you know what I mean to say, and it's not about the right, but the left that I speak regarding hypocrisy.

But I'll acknowledge that you're point is a valid one.

Hypocrisy is central to politics of any persuasion, unless you can be really Taoist about things, and it seems that nobody is.

&gt;What's your opinion of Todd Palin being given access to information (the emails), which his wife in her official capacity refused to give to the people of Alaska, that the she claims is covered by executive privledge?

Oh, my! I'm shocked! Appalled! I'm as indignant as a Yeti on his 3rd Bitburger can possibly be.

Only Obama can save us now, with the help of his trusty sidekick and mentor, Joe...

Personally, I am not an idiot and I do not make a lot of keystroke mistakes. If I hit Command-Q to quit and I get some annoying dialog, I just want to be able to hit Enter to do what I wanted to do. I don't want to have to use the mouse, read anything or make any decisions. A pre-highlighted ""OK"" button makes me happy! 1% of the time, when I do make a mistake, *then* I can move the mouse and click the other button.

In other words I want ""the most logical"" but definitely not ""the safest"" to be the default.

Somebody else might have a different preference, maybe they make lots of mistakes.

But in that case, the thing to do would be to ask ""why are our testers making so many mistakes with this action"" and discover things like the buttons are too small and close together, the icons look too much alike, the French words for ""close"" and ""format"" are too similar, Save shouldn't be right next to Quit, or some other UI insight.

In other words, reliance on an ""are you sure?"" dialog box should be seen as the design failure.

If I open a file in Photoshop, rotate it 90 degrees one way, then 90 degrees the other way, then I haven't changed it. (Or type something in Word and then type it back.) So why does Photoshop interrupt me to ask me if I'm sure I want to close without ""saving my changes""?

There is no harm in positive evolution for the rest of us.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Step #1 is a rule of God's creation which He is immune to as He is sovereign from it.

You're begging the question.  You're assuming that God exists and has (or doesn't have) certain properties, and then using that assumption as a basis for ""proving"" that your assumption is correct.  That's circular logic, and is an invalid argument.

*Edit:*  Here, let me give you an example of what I mean:

1. Everything that exists has a cause
2. The universe exists
3. The universe must have had a cause
4. This cause must have had a cause which must have had a cause, ad infinitum.
5. Acting outside of the laws of physics, premise #1 does not apply to time travelers from the future. Conclusion: Since things can't regress infinitely as in #4, time travelers are the only rational explanation for the origin of the universe.

See?  Circular logic allows you to reach *any* conclusion, which is why it's invalid.

&gt;[I]f someone claims that an infinite succession of events had to be concluded before his existence, then he is saying that an infinite succesion of events came to an end, which is a contradiction in terms.

Except that no one supposes that the universe/existence/whatever has concluded.  In an infinite series of events, each event must have an infinite series of events that ""concludes"" with that event, with another infinite series afterwards.

The only way your previous quote would make sense is if we presume that the universe will cease to exist at some point, thus requiring an infinite series to ""conclude"".  And even then, there's really no problem.  Think of the integers from 1 to infinity.  The series is infinite even though it has a beginning.  Thus, I see no reason when you can't reverse that and presume an infinite series that never starts, but has a conclusion.  Kind of like counting from negative-infinity to 0.","1220229306"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;One of the official justifications for patents is that patents would encourage inventors to publish their techniques instead of keeping them secret, so the inventions won't disappear with them. After any kind of rational examination, this justification appears as completely bogus. If secrecy were a working method to ensure an indefinite monopoly on a technique, and the monopoly were the prime motivator of inventors, then inventors would certainly not publish in exchange of a patent that gave them a monopoly for only a few years, when they could have an indefinite monopoly by not publishing! More generally, the patent system is only meaningful when reverse-engineering would otherwise allow the invention to be universally deployed despite attempts to preserve secrecy. Thus, the technical effect of the patent system is always to slow down the way inventions are spread, never to speed it up! 

Reverse engineering carries a much higher cost (all of it basically wasted) than reading a patent.  Thus, it would distribute information only to a few prospective competitors, while a patent would make the information universally available.","1220229866"

I have absolutely no problem with, in fact I completely support them, people who preserve species in a free market orientated way.  The countless examples of it successfully in action are a great testiment that are frequently ignored, whilst the obvious deficiencies of collectivist attempts to preserve species are also ignored.  For example;  The white Rhino in Africa was being hunted to extinction by poachers for its horn.  This was because the Rhinos were collectively owned.  Just like the overfishing in the sea.  Just like the Bison in North America.  The government finally gave permission for the poachers to purchase their own land.  Now the species has entirely recovered, and there are more Rhinos in the poacher's territory than the government's!  Fact is, with property rights and free markets, any species that is valuable to humans and scarce, will be protected.

Even species that don't give tangible goods to humans are protected, for example; pets?  The massive swoths of private land in places like the Amazon that are being preserved naturally so that people can enjoy them in their wild state.  The countless private charities set up to support these reserves.","1220229874"

I do agree with the article and with the comments here: Stack Overflow will probably be misleading, wrong, and amateurish when it comes to questions that require experience and knowledge. A quick peek at the site after setting the magic beta cookie confirms this.

But in the real world of being a day-to-day programmer, I don't have so many questions/issues that require deep experience or knowledge; when I do, I turn to a book or to someplace more appropriate.

I do however constantly run into irritating, time-wasting trivia: under-documented APIs, buggy implementations with nonobvious workarounds, magic incantations, etc. Things like, from the site, ""how do I make the HTML page print in landscape when the user selects print""? Or even better: ""C# console program can’t send fax when run as a scheduled task"".

There is a place for a site that collects this sort of answer, and I welcome it. Maybe it won't make for very interesting lunchtime reading (except perhaps to troll the people obviously posting CS homework), but it *will* come up in Google when I paste in an error number or stack trace.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Here's a comparison from a post on metafilter:

&gt;Palin's experience: After being selected as the runner up in the 1984 Miss Alaska contest, Palin served two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska City Council from 1992 to 1996, was elected mayor of Wasilla in 1996, and ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor in 2002.

&gt;After charging ethical violations by state Republican Party leaders,[2] she won election in 2006 by first defeating the incumbent governor in the Republican primary, then a former Democratic Alaskan governor in the general election.


&gt;Obama's experience: A graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review, Obama worked as a community organizer and practiced as a civil rights attorney before serving in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004. He taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, he announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate in January 2003. After a primary victory in March 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He was elected to the Senate in November 2004 with 70% of the vote.

&gt;As a member of the Democratic minority in the 109th Congress, he helped create legislation to control conventional weapons and to promote greater public accountability in the use of federal funds. He also made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During the 110th Congress, he helped create legislation regarding lobbying and electoral fraud, climate change, nuclear terrorism, and care for returned U.S. military personnel. After announcing his presidential campaign in February 2007, Obama emphasized withdrawing American troops from Iraq, energy independence, decreasing the influence of lobbyists, and promoting universal health care as top national priorities.

The subtext of the video is more concerned with ""your god does not exist and your ideas are stupid"" as opposed to ""no god exists anywhere I know everything about the universe lol"".


To actually respond to your point:

&gt; To claim that religion is generally bad for society doesn't fit with human history. Memes, like genes, evolve; the meme of religion would have been lost to the ages but for the fact that religion seems to give some unnamed advantage.

The advantage is to the reproductive survival of the meme itself. There is absolutely nothing that means it has to be advantageous to those human beings themselves (although it can).  You're familiar with HIV, and Cholera etc right?  Just because something exists, doesn't mean it's good for humans.  Religious group solidarity is a great way to arbitrarily define an in-group and and out-group, and to justify war, torture, censorship and all manner of human rights abuses against the out-group.  Your in-group will gain some reproductive advantage from this scapegoating, but *in what world is that a good thing*?","1220230417"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I guess I disagree- I don't think ""rattling people"" out of their stupid beliefs is the way to get things done. You catch more flies with honey. I think if we address the moderate and liberal religious side, and tell them - ""Hey, we think your beliefs are a bit outdated, but we don't hate you, we just hate the people who take your outdated beliefs and do stupid things with them."" 

I guess my point is that fighting fundamentalism and puritanical belief systems cannot be done as an atheist effectively. The only way to have change in a fundamentalist church is to evoke change in a slightly more liberal church, which in turn requires change in a more liberal church, and so on. It's like feminists fighting extreme patriarchy in the middle east. They can make as much noise as they want, but they have _no standing_ in the patriarchy, so the patriarchy ignores them. The only way you can fight a closed belief system, is to get a slightly less closed form of the same belief to make it socially unnacceptable -- amongst the belief's own social circles -- to believe the more extreme form. 

I agree- we should aim for churches to have no special treatment under the law- we should not tolerate psychopathic reactions to minor events like taking a cracker out of church. But- we only hurt our own limited credibility by running around screaming ""You're a bunch of idiots, believing in a talking snake and a zombie savior!"" That's like telling a woman that she looks fat, it may be true, but you don't do it, because it just gets her angry and she stops listening to you.

I also disagree that my grandmother's (or anyone else who's reaction is similar) is unjustifiable. It may be _baseless_, but trying to say ""You're not allowed to be upset by this, it's just a cracker"" isn't going to make her, or anyone, amenable to actually critically thinking about what they believe. 

I guess I should have realized that a non-extreme anti-theistic view on this subreddit would not get downmodded to hell. But hey, I value rational positions rather than the wonderfully unthunk position that is fundamentalistic antitheism.

Contrary to what joeldavis says, this is not at all irrelevant.  The distinction between objects and ideas creates problems of enforcement and questions of how to compensate the inventor.  But both objects and research require an initial investment, which will only occur if the investor expects to receive a sufficient portion of its benefits.  The problems begin when patents are written broadly, used defensively, and generally over-issued.

Another example, which I think may translate to IP somewhat more easily:  You build a theme park, and sell the rights to build concession stands.  There's plenty of land along the footpaths, so there's no effective limit to the number of stands that can be built.  However, competition in your park will force you to cut prices.

They have 4 sizes. Which one is the ""medium""?

I work PT at a coffee shop, we also have 4 sizes. Personally, I think this is not worth the trouble. People understand 3 sizes. Small, medium, large. 3 sizes! Easy! But, I am not the boss.

We call them ""tiny,"" ""small"", ""medium,"" ""large"" with the amounts clearly labeled so 50% of people and most regulars just order ""12oz."" or whatever. But for everyone else it's kind of confusing, which one is ""small"" and which ""medium""? The physical cups are prominently displayed with their size names, but it's still very counterintuitive for some folks to order ""small"" for the cup that's not the smallest.

Starbucks has solved this problem. ""Short,"" ""tall,"" ""grande,"" ""venti."" Starbucks has ubiquity so everyone just learns these, and from then on, everyone's life is easier. Orders go faster, people know what they are getting with confidence. It's all about efficiency and accuracy.

If one day Starbucks wants to add a 5th size, they can call it an Enormi and we can all keep on trucking. In fact, they have already done this -- they didn't use to have a venti, and the short used to be up on the menu. (Now you just have to know it's there somehow, like ""animal style"" at In-n-Out.)

Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists made by the National Hurricane Center.

According to the National Hurricane Center, the use of short, distinctive names in both written and spoken communication is quicker and less subject to error than the older latitude-longitude identification methods.

The original lists were composed entirely of female names. In 1979, male names were introduced and now alternate with female names alphabetically.

The six lists of names are used in rotation, so the list used in 2008 will again be used in 2014. The lists are maintained and updated by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization.

The only situation in which the list is changed is if a storm is so costly or deadly that using that name for a future storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity. In such a case, the WMO committee will strike the name from their lists at their annual meeting and replace it with another name.

2005, in particular, was a rough year for tropical storms, with five names being retired, including Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan and Wilma.

Since 1953, 67 names have been stricken from the lists. Several names have also been changed since the lists were made. For example, in 2004, Gaston replaced Georges and Matthew replaced Mitch.

The lists contain 21 names each year. Should more than 21 tropical storms occur in a season, additional storms will take names from the Greek alphabet: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. 2005 marked the first time in over 60 years of regularly-named Atlantic storms that all 21 regular names were used and the Greek system had to be employed. Tropical Storm Zeta was sixth Greek-named storm of the year and brought 2005’s final tally to a record 27 tropical storms.","1220231436"

Also, if you are ever lucky enough to have a woman come to visit, just roll up the mat beforehand to reveal your spotless floor. She will be quite impressed when she uses your bathroom (and she will to ""check"" you out, not to use actual bathroom). Replace the man-mat after she leaves.

My mother used to keep it in the cupboard, high up where I couldn't reach it.  I was always bitter about the fact that only when we had adult guests was it ever taken out and passed around and could we kids have any?  ""It's just for adults dear"" she'd say and no other explanation.  Had I known the damage it can do at that time, maybe I wouldn't have piled one chair on top of another to get it.  Maybe I wouldn't take some out and replace it with hair gel, hoping nobody would notice.  How am I supposed to know?  I was just a kid!

It ruined my life.  First it was strawberry jam.  Then I moved on to jellies and marmalades.  Before I knew it, I was buying expensive 'organic' jams and jellies from overseas and eventually became a dealer myself, importing and distributing cases of delicious jams.  Sure, it was fun for a while but first the teeth started falling out and I gained 800 pounds.  I had a habit that exceeded anything I could make off it and eventually went broke.  I had to beg on the street to raise enough money to make my own but it never turned out the same!  It was about then I took a hard look at myself and started to pick myself back up out of the gutter.  My only regret is that I am no longer able to eat toast.  Too many bad memories.

Addressed in another comment.  Go do your basic-level homework, 'k?

&gt; you can find articles for either side about the polar bears drowing off or at record level populations....but here's one from nasa that supports the fact that they are dying off and a quote: "" According to scientists from NASA and the Canadian Wildlife Service, these increased Arctic polar bear sightings are probably related to retreating sea ice triggered by climate warming and not due to population increases as some may believe.""

The total number of individual bears has increased and is set to continue increasing.  There's nothing you can do to contradict that.

&gt; Here's one from Time stating that the ice caps are melting

Time? *Time*?  Bullshit.  [Try the NSIDC.](http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/ddw82wws_13dbt97vdf_b.jpg) You know, **an actual authority on the issue**?  Furthermore, ""the ice caps"" were **never** ""melting"".  Last year saw a record *high* for the Southern polar cap.  The northern cap was supposed to be ice-free this year, and instead we are seeing a total reversal of the 30-year trend; a year where the ice level was higher at end-melt than it was the year previous.

&gt; or how about the chicago tribune just recently talking about sea ice in the arctic ocean being at its second lowest level in about 30 years................

Just how blind are you, son?  Last year was the absolute lowest point.  I did not contest this.  You imply that it being at the second-lowest in about thirty years seems to imply that it is still receding.  And I just got done stating that the current sea ice extent minimum was a **reversal of the trend**.  This is a total irrelevancy which has already been addressed; but tell me, how would you account for the fact that there is in fact more ice this year than last year?

&gt; give me some links for reference to prove your point.....

You seem to be good enough at finding the run-of-the-mill bullshit, why don't you do your own research and actually go straight to the sources?

&gt; never heard of dr pianka till now....i dont agree with his view...nor do i give a shit....my point was that idiots breed....

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","Actually, Sexism is relevant only to one sex. Specifically, women. Sexism is the systematic oppression of a group of people based on their sex, men are not oppressed based on their sex, women are.

I can confidently say, and I'm sure you can see the point of what I said clearly, if for a moment you lose the arrogance.

It is sexist to call women 'chicks, girls, ladies, bitches, sluts, whores, hookers, hos etc,' it is sexist to speak over a woman, it is sexist to assume a woman is 'yours' when you enter a relationship with one, it is sexist to place your arms around a woman (because it does not signify that you are in love with the woman, it signifies that she is an extension of you, and no one, ever, thinks that you are the extension of a woman), it is sexist not to give a woman not only the frequent opportunity to voice her opinion, but to also belittle it in any way shape or form. It is sexist to protray women as objects, to assume that a woman is there merely for your sexual pleasure, it is sexist to assume all women are heterosexual, and is sexist to assume to that women just havn't found the right man when they turn out to be lesbians. It is sexist to assume a man has some say in whether a woman has her child or not, it is sexist to ask what the sex of the child will be if she has it, it is sexist to ask who the father is, it is sexist to fuck a woman when she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol (more over, it is rape as well).

This is a summarised list. Alot of people will think, ""No way!"" But the fact is, yes way. All of these things, men have been conditioned - through the forced oppression of women by the ruling class - to believe it is alright to act this way. More importantly, the reason all of those things are sexist is because Men and Women ARE NOT EQUAL. And all of those things merely aid in the suppression of the ability for women to gain confidence to achieve that equality. - Now stop and think to yourself, If I were a woman, and saw all of that every day of my life, and was told over and over again that, that is how it is supposed to be, would I have the incentive to fight it? - Probably not. At least, not for a while anyway.

Sexism is not about men. It is only about women. Men are not oppressed based on their sex, Women are. Therefore, it is not Sexist of me to say anything remotely negative about a man. 

Those men who whine about their feelings are completely ignorant to why it is women are doing what they do. No, women do not have to apologise to those men. Those men need to suck it up, and dispose of some of that dominance they have been conditioned to believe they have.

Let's back track to the 1960s, and the Women's Liberation Movement. Do you honestly believe the women gave a shit then? Nooooo. Not at all. But what did happen, was a broad spectrum of Women, Students and Industrial workers got on board using Demonstrations and Industrial Action to win them major victories, such as the right to suffrage.

What women do to gain their equality does not come down to, ""What will the men think?"" It is exactly that social conditioning they are trying to destroy when they take up the flag of liberation.

Women and men are not equal. This society has ensured that. It is not that I do not see women as my equals. It is that society refuses to allow us to be equals. My partner earns 'award' wage. That is just below minimum wage. If I were working the same occupation, I'd be earning 10,000$ Per annum more than she does. And it is not because I have more experience. That is what I would earn at entry level.

Women's hygene products are not tax exempt, where-as men's shavers are. Child care facilities are at an all time high in costs, forcing many working women to return home to assume the role of carer. Women workers are still being sexually harassed and belittled in their offices and work places much more frequently than modern media will allow us to see. Women are perpetuated as sex objects. Or, in recent times on australian TV, always thinking about men, calculating what he will be like in bed etc etc.

The concentration of women in casual/part time and temporary employment is substantially higher than that of men. The majority of administrative positions are occupied by women, where as the upper level managing positions still have majority men. Women are paid approximately 75c to the Male 1$.

And to add further, people seem to think this closing gap means women are becoming equal. That is a falsity. Women havn't gained anything since the 70s. Women have actually lost more rights than they have gained them. It is a matter of fact, that attacks on the rights of workers in general have caused this supposed 'equality.' Men now earn less than they did 10 years ago. Women havn't been given more money. With men's wages down, inflation and living costs up, men's and women's wages are now almost just as low as each other, with women's wages setting the bar at its lowest.

Finally, I never said there needed to be an Us v Them style mentality. That is identity politics. I do not preach identity politics, and more over, all identity politics do is segregate further, and give the false impression that say, a rich white women has just as much in common as a poor white woman, because of her vagina. - That is obviously not the case.

But I stick to my statement. What men think about what women do is irrelevant. How dare any of you take the stand of, ""Oh men should have a say!"" as that is exactly the subordination that is being sought, and destroyed.","1220232336"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I don't think ""rattling people"" out of their stupid beliefs is the way to get things done

I happen to agree with you on that, mostly.  The problem is that on certain circumstances you have no other way but make others feel cognitive dissonance.  You catch more flies with honey, true on the average, but not aways.

&gt; ""Hey, we think your beliefs are a bit outdated, but we don't hate you, we just hate the people who take your outdated beliefs and do stupid things with them.""

The problem with that view is that, while it works on mostly sensible people, there is a large swath of completely irrational people who are not just unmoved by that argument, but actually take offense and some even react disproportionately violently to it.

&gt; I guess my point is that fighting fundamentalism and puritanical belief systems cannot be done as an atheist effectively.

The fight is not against fundamentalism or puritanism.  The fight is against irrational belief.  Nonfundamentalists with irrational beliefs legitimize those irrational beliefs for the fundamentalists.  And, since beliefs inform your actions, you can add the former problem to the fact that these irrational beliefs beget wacky wastes of time and resources better used to do real, measurable good in the world.

&gt; They can make as much noise as they want, but they have no standing in the patriarchy, so the patriarchy ignores them.

I bet if they had guns, the patriarchs would sing to a different tune.  See?  Now, I'm not really arguing *for* arming oppressed women because I'm not sure it wouldn't turn into a bloodbath.

&gt; That's like telling a woman that she looks fat, it may be true, but you don't do it, because it just gets her angry and she stops listening to you.

Unfortunately, you're right.  However, if that fat woman threatens you to death, I have fair confidence that at least some fat women who see that, will think to themselves ""fuck, that's just wrong, no matter how fat he called her"".

&gt; able. It may be baseless, but trying to say ""You're not allowed to be upset by this, it's just a cracker"" isn't going to make her, or anyone, amenable to actually critically thinking about what they believe.

Well, I can't force her to smile and cheer, but I can certainly use legal force to restrain her from overstepping her rights, which is what the ""impeachment proceedings"" are about to turn into.

&gt; I value rational positions rather than the wonderfully unthunk position that is fundamentalistic antitheism.

I don't know any fundamentalistic antitheists.  All atheists I know come from a rational, well-argued set of evidence-backed reasons to abolish the belief in gods.  ""evidence-backed reasons"" automatically excludes fundamentalism from the mix.","1220232401"

Hiroshima was a horrible thing to do. I'd like to think there was another way. I'm not convinced there was. Japan was nowhere near surrender. They were absolutely barbaric to civilians and soldiers they captured. Hiroshima ended that.

I would argue that Nagisaki was all about power - the US didn't give Japan enough time to realize that they HAD to surrender at this point - and I'd argue that it would have been far more humane to bomb an isolated base.

Neither Yudkowsky's arguments nor mine as far as I can tell imply that ab initio chemistry must either be impossible or be sufficient for all possible chemistry.

""One can either believe in god, not believe in god, or be unsure.""

Not true, because being unsure has nothing to do with weather or not you believe. Typically if you are unsure about something, you don't believe it.

I don't believe ghosts exist, because I'm unsure if they do.

I don't believe aliens exist, because I'm unsure if they do.

You can be unsure about something and still either believe it or not believe it.

Belief is binary, and I've proven that absolutely.

""You give me three terms to use, one for someone who believes in god, one for someone who believes in no god, and one for someone who is on the fence.""

1. One who believes in god is a theist.
2. One who believes in no god is a strong atheist.
3. One who is on fence could believe or not believe, so I need more information. Typically someone who is on the fence does not believe... so that would be a weak atheist, a.k.a. an agnostic atheist. However, there could be someone who is on the fence but believes, an agnostic theist.

This distinction is important, a failure to recognize that is a failure to understand the various theologies that exist.

You are dismissing the ideas a large number of people hold because you refuse to acknowledge a subtlety. For what? To be stubborn? To hold onto some view you have of yourself? I still want to know, what's the point of refusing to acknowledge the agnostic theists? Do you deny Fideism exists? Why carry on using definitions that make it so hard for you to understand?

Don't you realize that the definitions I'm using are what is used by all modern atheist writers? You couldn't even read a book without getting yourself confused because you have some silly attachment to specific definitions. So why? What's in it for you?","1220233114"

Execution to deter murder, certainly.  But the reason for that is a pretty straightforward Biblical commandment that murderers should be dealt with in kind.  The fact that it deters murder is part and parcel of why that course of action is seen positively.

I guess what I'm saying is that most of these can be explained away by a fairly superficial practical view, but when it comes down to it the personal reasons that people have for devaluing others are often less relaxed and more tied to harsh judgments or personal feelings of disgust based on a religious conviction.

Being in command of a remote state's national guard is not the same as being potentially the commander of the entire nation's military.

Found this [here](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-cvn-palin-grasping-at-straws,0,5624833.story): 

&gt;Maj. Gen. Craig Campbell, adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard, considers Palin ""extremely responsive and smart"" and says she is in charge when it comes to in-state services, such as emergencies and natural disasters where the National Guard is the first responder.

&gt;But, in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, he said *he and Palin play no role in national defense activities, even when they involve the Alaska National Guard. The entire operation is under federal control, and the governor is not briefed on situations.*

Foreign Policy experience: Palin has visited three foreign countries, Germany, Kuwait, and Ireland. Ireland was just vacation and in Germany and Kuwait she did not meet with foreign officials but with Alaska National Guard troops. [source](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Palins_travels.html?showall)

On the bridge, initially she supported the bridge until she decided to use the federal funds elsewhere.

Ethics: Haven't you heard how Palin is being investigated for a personally motivated firing of her Public Safety Commissioner? I'm not gonna cite that because it's been all over reddit recently.

In the same vein, have you heard the clip from Palin going on a shock jock radio show and laughing while the host cracks offensive jokes about her political rival?

The following may sound sarcastic, but I believe it to be honest truth.

Years of dialog box designers have trained people, programmers included, that dialog boxes are these static things that must be laboriously laid out. Some sort of mental exception is made for passing in one sole and singular parameter to it (in this case the text for the message), but I think that the idea that the rest of the dialog box could be easily generated by passing in, say, an array of strings, is so totally and utterly foreign that many programmers can't even think the thought.

Yeah, I'm in the ""GUI designers are of the devil"" group, and this is why. They are wonderfully convenient, at the cost of rotting your soul, errr, too dramatic, at the cost of making you forget that GUI dialogs are just another form of data, subject to manipulation like any other form of data.

"politics","t5_2cneq","And so, your first paragraph seems to be still denying that the firing was politically motivated.  

Your second paragraph puts the case in terms that purport to deny that there are political reasons if the guy exercises his political right to support the opposition, but his candidate loses.  That would be the definition of ""for political reasons,"" if the only thing that makes his performance suspect is that he supported someone else.  Your saying he ""couldn't be trusted and probably wasn't supporting her as best he could,"" which is only demonstrable in the context of his political support.  That's the very definition of ""for political reasons,"" since she didn't demonstrate a problem with his performance.  Calling it ""sound management practice"" hardly refutes the obvious political context of her decision, the political reason for the dismissal, or your description of why you'd fire him.  In fact, government workers at nearly all other levels have to be trusted under similar circumstances, or we couldn't be said to live in a democracy.  

Your third paragraph says you'd do it, too.  

So you're saying you don't think he was fired for political reasons, but he should have been.  

So what point is gained by acting like you know it wasn't for political reasons, even if you believe that it was and should have been?  Why pretend you think it was for performance reasons?  That would have been easy to show if there had been performance reasons.  The judge agreed she could fire him for non-performance reasons, that she didn't need to show lapses in performance, which I gather she didn't or she would have shown that she did.  

Why not say, yes, he was obviously fired for political reasons--so what?  It was her right to.  What point is gained by denying that?  You still haven't answered that, while giving all the reasons why a political firing is appropriate.  

Yes, Machiavellian tactics work, especially for despots.  ","1220234546"

I hope in the book, this Kimmel guy actually tries to find out why this happens rather than just sling around stereotypes.

I'll go out on a limb and say: It's the economy, stupid! The baby boomers still have a lock on the economy, the management positions, the political leadership, and entrepreneurial opportunities. Sure there are a few opportunities, but it's not like in America's past when anyone with half a brain could scrape up enough money for a storefront or go door-to-door, and still make good. Our fathers and grandfathers either worked in factories and workshops with pensions and benefits, or else went to college and landed a cushy career right off the bat where they could stay until they retired with a cake and a gold watch. Doesn't happen anymore. 

Also, it's just not financially feasible to start a family at a young age. Salaries have stagnated the past few decades, especially for entry-level jobs, but inflation continues unabated. The feds like to juggle numbers to make it look like everything's ok, but Americans have been getting poorer and poorer since 1973.'

As for young people acting like their parents don't have anything to teach them--well, they might not. My dad's career hunting advice for me was, ""Just go around, and knock on doors and see who's hiring. Eventually, you'll find some job you like."" He didn't mean knock on doors figuratively, either. That works great if it's 1968 and you live in Pineville, Louisiana. Thanks. Most of the jobs that are hiring today didn't even exist a generation or two ago, and if they did, they now require a comepletely new skillset.

Anyway, I'm 32 and I can remember just a few years ago being called ""kid"" or young man"" at work or around town. With attitudes from old people like that, is it any wonder that more 20-somethings aren't in public office or running businesses?","1220234653"

Is this in reference to the ""teach them both and let the kids have a debate"" comment?  I honestly don't think that was so bad of a response.  Kids aren't dumb, even if you don't teach them about something, it doesn't make it go away.  I went to school in Alaska and they *did* teach both creationism and evolution.  They said ""some people believe that life was created by an omnipotent being who created everything in the universe but most scientists believe _______.""  Honestly, I think kids should know what other people believe; however, I don't think such topics belong in a science class.  In my school, they did evolution/religion in more of a history-style class which went over all different kinds of topics relating to not only human development, but also human society, culture, and religion.

Honestly though, she could want her kids to be taught that life was created when Jesus jacked off into a half-empty bottle of Shasta and left it on his coffee table for a week and it wouldn't matter to me . . .  because the President has no business (and no right) to determine what's on the pages of the books in schools in my town.

Now, while what we traditionally call ""open source"" software has this in passing, it is possible for commercial libraries to also provide this.

If you have the source and you can compile it, then the balance is quite strongly in favor of using the library. Should you find a corner case that ""really ought to work"", my experience is that it is often quite easy to go ahead and _make_ it work. Even if it takes a dirty hack that would work only for you. I've never actually been blocked on a source-available library because of bugs.

On the other hand, source-not-available libraries have caused me no end of grief, causing unbelievably ugly workarounds at best and sometimes requiring tossing entire libraries for what are, in the end, quite small bugs from the internal viewpoint of the library, but show-stoppers from the external viewpoint. In this environment, the argument about building vs. using libraries is a lot more even, I find.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Don't forget he also ran one of the most effective presidential campaign in U.S. history, toppling the Clinton campaign, which is no small feat.

This is from an interview Marc Andreesen (the founder of Netscape) did with Obama prior to the start of his campaign:

&gt;     We asked him directly, how concerned should we be that you haven't had meaningful experience as an executive -- as a manager and leader of people?

&gt; He said, watch how I run my campaign -- you'll see my leadership skills in action.

&gt; At the time, I wasn't sure what to make of his answer -- political campaigns are often very messy and chaotic, with a lot of turnover and flux; what conclusions could we possibly draw from one of those?

&gt; Well, as any political expert will tell you, it turns out that the Obama campaign has been one of the best organized and executed presidential campaigns in memory. Even Obama's opponents concede that his campaign has been disciplined, methodical, and effective across the full spectrum of activities required to win -- and with a minimum of the negative campaigning and attack ads that normally characterize a race like this, and with almost no staff turnover. By almost any measure, the Obama campaign has simply out-executed both the Clinton and McCain campaigns.

&gt; This speaks well to the Senator's ability to run a campaign, but speaks even more to his ability to recruit and manage a top-notch group of campaign professionals and volunteers -- another key leadership characteristic. When you compare this to the awe-inspiring discord, infighting, and staff turnover within both the Clinton and McCain campaigns up to this point -- well, let's just say it's a very interesting data point.

By comparison, Hillary, for example, seemed to run her campaign like an absentee landlord rather than a wise leader. In the emails that leaked out from her campaign a few weeks ago, I thought it was interesting in showing that even some of the better decisions her campaign made, were made by other people, including Bill Clinton, who, among other things, was the one who made the decision to run the ""3am"" ad.

Similarly, McCain's campaign nearly died at one point before limping back to the stage and capitalizing on, among other things, the goodwill he built up in New Hampshire during his ""maverick"" years in 2000. And McCain arguably didn't face any serious competition, just a bunch of destined-to-lose sock puppets wasting space on the campaign trail (Giuliani, Thompson (both of them), Tancredo). The only quasi-serious (but flawed, as far as ""traditional"" republicans go) candidate he defeated was Romney (Ron Paul was defeated by the corporations and the media, his campaign never had a chance to get within striking distance of McCain).","1220235078"

Why would a company spend Billions on microchip design, drug research, green energy, or any large endeavour when someone could just steal their idea once complete?  

The answer is ... they wouldn't.  It's the same reason why so few companies want to manufacture drugs with expired patents, and why drug companies spend Billions on advertising to ensure that the drugs get to market quickly to maximize the ROI (the same can be said for other inventions in other industries as well).

I believe that the creationists, at least those who do more than merely believe everything and anything their pastors tell them, know inside that their position is indefensible, that exposure to evidence will discredit, if not outright disprove, their views, thus they must squelch such exposure. 

I believe this is especially true of the pastors themselves; they've presumably read the entirety of the Bible, even if they haven't studied it all equally, so they know how many ethically horrible and logically ridiculous things it contains. They've confronted skeptical members of their congregation who have begun questioning their faith, so they know what questions and doubts arise. So, they do their best to quiet these doubts.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First of all, let me make this clear- I didn't mean to imply that you were among the fundie-antitheists. I didn't make that clear in the above post, so I just want to ensure that. 

I have, however, more eloquently (I like to think, anyway) summed up my view in a post at my blog. humbuggery.net, link follows.

I actually address most of what you replied with there, so I won't repeat myself, but let me just quickly say the following:

&gt; Well, I can't force her to smile and cheer, but I can certainly use legal force to restrain her from overstepping her rights, which is what the ""impeachment proceedings"" are about to turn into.

Yes, and I agree that if she, or anyone else, wanted to overstep her rights, that you should take legal action. However, My point was that there are alot of people who don't want the boy ""impeached"" be it in the SGA of his school, or in a trial of public opinion, they just are hurt by his actions. Relatively innocent bystanders, now galvanized by the unfortunate actions of one person. It's not wrong, it's not evil, it's not a hate crime, it's just counterproductive.

&gt; I don't know any fundamentalistic antitheists. All atheists I know come from a rational, well-argued set of evidence-backed reasons to abolish the belief in gods. ""evidence-backed reasons"" automatically excludes fundamentalism from the mix.

You lucky bastard, :). The one that comes to mind is TheAmazingAtheist from youtube, but I know several personally, so perhaps I am more sensitive to the notion. To the YT Atheist's credit, TAA is somewhat ostracized, and thought of as a bit of a pimple on the face of YT atheism, but he is a fundamentalist antitheist nontheless. Also, I want to make clear, I don't think it's possible to be a fundamentalist atheist, that's (as has been said many times) as silly as being a fundamentalist not-astrologerist, or fundie not-monkey. And while not _all_ atheists come from a rational set of ideas, it is not necessarily true that an antitheist does. Atheism denotes a neutral opinion, and preference -- in a way -- not to believe. Antitheism denotes a positive belief that theism (in some form or another) is bad. Positive beliefs are prone to fundamentalism, (believing the belief at the expense of critical thought about said belief). 

You know what, I think I'm done, I just confused myself... In any case, I've only got one more point.

&gt; Nonfundamentalists with irrational beliefs legitimize those irrational beliefs for the fundamentalists. 

Ahh, the Sam Harris argument, I actually agree. Which is why I think we need to change that. My appeal to the moderates and the liberals is an appeal of ""Join up on not accepting the fundies, then we can have a real, rational discussion about the merits of religion."" I can sum up my point as follows, I'd much rather have a world full of somewhat clear-thinking liberal/moderate religious types, so we should get said moderates and liberals to join up in the ""fight against idiocy.""

Like I said, I don't think religion is the problem, religion is a fairly benign influence, I mean, a moderate who believes in a talking snake isn't going to kill anyone, it's the crazy stupid religious people I don't like. Because a fundie who believes in a talking snake is far more prone to killing someone, vis a vis Joel's army et al.

Anyway, it's late, I'm probably not coherent, hopefully I didn't sprain something...

Fact of the matter is you were (if my assumptions are correct) born with a life expectancy not much more impressive than that of a citizen of sub-saharan african today yet will die well into your 90s.

It isn't the free market that granted you these decades but rather the forces opposing it else you'd pay a yearly ""stay alive"" premium.

Medical care was never socialized nor did it approach anything similar; fact of the matter is there were simply less doctors, less cures and less expectations of recovery or survival. Dig into the data produced by the Census Bureau (for lack of a better source of statistics) and appreciate how far past you are your assumed end and you may well begin to appreciate the global medical system (regardless of the USA) and its advances as they stand.","1220236355"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;As far as I can tell, the independent investigation into the firing of that one guy is still ongoing. You might want to at least wait until until they determine whether or not there was any wrongdoing.

I already know that she said untruths (adding to her list of those). I already know that there are recorded conversations that seem to contradict her account. And I know that the idea that the aide were pushing this so hard without any input from her is laughable. Whether or not there is sufficient proof for an impeachment is a different standard than whether or not she should get elected.

&gt;Is this in reference to the ""teach them both and let the kids have a debate"" comment?

That and her denial of anthrogenic global warming.

&gt;honestly don't think that was so bad of a response.

Well I do. So did the federal court in Dover, PA. Intelligent Design is not science, it is not close to science, it is theology with the name of God changed. And she, if not you, knows that. How do I know? Because she is against ""explicit"" sex education and in favor of abstinence only. That is, she is in favor of ""open choice"" by students only when it promotes her goal. 

&gt;I went to school in Alaska and they did teach both creationism and evolution. 

Did you go after the federal courts banned teaching creationism? BTW, you need to get with the program: you can't call it creationism, you have to call it Intelligent Design. If you don't present the lie to get around the courts how can you promote morality?

&gt;They said ""some people believe that life was created by an omnipotent being who created everything in the universe but most scientists believe _."" 

So you did not learn about evolution, which is not about the origin of life. Now why were they teaching you about religion in science class? There is little enough time to teach the science, why use the time for other stuff?

&gt;Honestly, I think kids should know what other people believe;

Does that belong in science class? And do they learn only about what fundamentalist Christians believe or are other non-scientific ideas presented?

&gt;I don't think such topics belong in a science class. 

She does. So why were you defending her ideas?

&gt;Honestly though, she could want her kids to be taught that life was created when Jesus jacked off into a half-empty bottle of Shasta and left it on his coffee table for a week and it wouldn't matter to me

What she wants to teach her kids is not the question. How she wants to use the power of government to promote her religion is. 

&gt;because the President has no business (and no right) to determine what's on the pages of the books in schools in my town.

Presidents appoint judges. And presidents makes hundreds and thousands of decisions regarding science and based on science. If she has so little understanding of science that she thinks that Intelligent Design is science then she is dangerous. If she thinks she can get scientific information from her church then she is dangerous.

As I say: I was there, I know what it was like. BTW, cancer patients are far more likely to survive in the US even today than in socialized-medicine pits like Great Britain. When medicine becomes just another government program, you get what you'd expect: shortages, long waits, political BS guiding the actions of doctors, and so on.

I'm not a member of any church or a believer in any supernatural religion, but the fact is that many churches provide a surprising amount of help to the poor. I used to have a chip on my shoulder about religion, and I've certainly seen plenty of racist, mean-spirited self-described Christians. But the fact is, that's a problem of emotional health, not of religion. People practice their religion, and behave generally, in accord with their level of emotional health.

I like having what the ""cancel"" button does as an option, I just dislike the label ""Cancel"" because I think it's unclear.

Something like this is more explicit:

    You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to quit?

    No, go back
    Save and then quit
    Quit without saving

But I'm not sure it's better, maybe it's too wordy. Companies like Apple focus-group this stuff to find the answer.

I also wish that things like undo history were saved with documents, so this is less of an issue. Adobe has been moving toward this for years, where a file may contain original source bitmaps but further edits are stored as a stack of transformations. You can ""flatten"" (or ""rasterize"" or ""save as vector outlines"" in Illustrator) documents, but the user has to elect to do that. MS Office has ""track changes"" mode so it would just be a matter of turning it on by default.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","He isn't overpaid though. The TV shows and the movies he makes make hundreds of millions of dollars for the companies he is working for. He deserves a fair share of that money considering he is the face of the product. If he was being overpaid, the execs wouldn't be paying him. Athletes are also not overpaid. They make billions of dollars for their league, they are entitled to making a share of that money.

Doctors provide a service, and they are incredibly important. It takes a lot of work to get into their business as well, and they are paid extremely well as a result. I think it is hard to say they are underpaid. The cousin of a friend is a surgeon in Cali and he makes around 300,000 a year and he is only a few years out of med school.

Firefighters and Police officers are also providing an extremely valuable service, but they are working in public service. Maybe they deserve more money for it, but the money isn't there to give them. That said, my grandfather was a fireman and was eventually made the fire chief. He made quite a bit of money, and he had a pretty cushy retirement.

Teachers are underpaid, considering the education requirements, and the service they provide. However, they are not significantly underpaid. They can also boost their income by running summer school classes or working minimesters at community colleges during summer months. They work in the public service though, so their salaries will always be lower than if they worked for a private institution.","1220237436"

The jargon gets slippery when you move between religious, social, and philosophical zones.

In their chart they point out the condition where, a person, newly freed from the restraints of religious inhibition, may break various religious rules, such as drinking tea or coffee on the mild end of the spectrum, to doing something more radical like free love, etc.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; How can you justify increasing a population when there are already so many suffering in the world today?

Non-sequitor. The two are totally unconnected.  Unless, of course, you ascribe to the Fixed Pie Fallacy.  Here's a hint: Economic expansion is in fact not limited.

&gt;  Wouldn't it be better to work towards improving the lives of the people already here, rather than make it possible for us to just have more?

In fact, working towards expanding the viable population of the human race **would** be a way of improving the lives of the people already here.  The greater the overall size of the economy the less burdensome any individual -- or population -- becomes in effecting their uplifting from poverty.  This is basic.

&gt; And what gives us the right to bulldoze over other animals natural habitats, wall in rivers, dump tons of garbage into the ocean, pollute the atmosphere?

You assume this is resultant to population growth.  It is not.  As technological development increases, the relative ecological impact on the planet per person decreases at a rate greater than the rate of population expansion.  The rate of technological advancement, however, increases alongside the size of the population.  Given the principles of reversion to the mean and basic statistics, the larger the population at any given point the more likely we are to be capable of invoking the Black Swan Effect towards the acceleration of technologies.

Ergo; at this point dramatically increased population could in fact very likely result in a strongly decreased ecological impact.  This is self-evident if you've been following the trends in human population progress; for the first time in human history a majority of the race is living within urban centers -- and that number percentage-wise is increasing. Simultaneously, skyscraper farms are finally now viable to VC funding. (Meaning newly constructed towers are seen as being able to turn a profit within 15 years.)  Simultaneously, a few different groups are working strongly towards making cultured meats viable.  The RepRap and Fab@Home projects, meanwhile, seek to realize vonNeumann rapid-prototypers, whose effects on the standard definition of poverty and wealth cannot be overstated.  Meanwhile, we are only now beginning to get into the development of materials technologies sophisticated enough to make megastructure construction a viability.  Once //that// happens -- and I assure you, it will; the money being poured into decreasing the cost of carbon nanotubes alone will make it happen before children born today start having grandchildren -- that combined with the above dictates that the world we live in will be as fundamentally different as was 1908 compared to 2008; or how 1808 was to 1908.  

Much as I disagree with Vingean singularitarianism as a blind predictor, there is no question at all that *currently*, technology is on the cusp of a major revolution; and of course as that happens so too will society be radically altered.

We have not yet begun, for example, to build subaquatic, subterranean, arctic/antarctic, lunar or NEO arcology structures.  But it //will// happen.

1. Love is subjective, freedom is an absolute. Neither can be correlated with the other. Love implies compassion, caring, emotion, servitude, devotion, community, sacrifice and forgiveness. Freedom implies many antonyms of those specific terms - shockingly to no detriment - but ne'er the twain shall meet as they say. If you want a two-word solution to all of life's ills I suspect you may have to venture further into the dictionary.

2. The Church wasn't the main point of my thesis, rather, that governments have an obligation as unbiased civil (read secular) institutions to uphold an egalitarian standard of service regardless of religious, political or social affiliation. That's part of the splendor and wonder of democracy; its service of the disenfranchised and underrepresented.

3. The UK is no model for socialized medicine. I live in a country in which I had a heart attack at 17, was diagnosed with Angina Pectoris, EKGd and tested in a further appointment, had minor corrective surgery and was prescribed preventative medicine and care all within the course of 2 days. It isn't the system or model that's broken, just the execution.

A free market would also not prefer private ownership (which capitalism does); in fact, it would not prefer any type of ownership or type of ideology to be predominant, and there would be many that manage to co-exist.

A truly free market could not function properly with the existence of government / state (which constantly intervenes).  A truly free-market would also require much more polycentric law &amp; free association.  If you do not know any of these terms, I encourage you to look them up.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Who cares about this stupid treaty?

Well apparently, the US likes to say that it does, but only when it suits their interests:

[May 2008:](http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/delegates%20statements/P5%20Statement.pdf) The delegations of China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm the strong and continuing support of our countries for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on the occasion of the second Preparatory Committee of the eighth NPT review cycle.

The rest of the world on the other hand, they care about it [a lot:](http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/shalom42.htm)

&gt;If we just look at this past year in the UN General Assembly we get a sense of Washington's commitment to nuclear disarmament. Resolution 60/46, prohibiting the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction, was adopted by a vote of 180 in favor to 1 against (United States), with 1 abstention (Israel). Resolution 60/48 on implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace was adopted with three no votes, France, the UK, and the United States. Resolution 60/53 sought effective international agreements to assure non-nuclear weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons; it was adopted 120-0, with 59 abstentions, including the United States. Resolution 60/54, aiming to prevent an arms race in outer space, was approved 180-2, with only Israel and the United States voting no. Resolution 60/56 on accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments was adopted with five negative votes (France, India, Israel, the UK, and the United States). Resolution 60/58 on a nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and adjacent areas was opposed only by France, the UK, and the United States. Resolution 60/65 expressing a renewed determination to totally eliminate nuclear weapons was adopted 168-2-7, with only the United States and India voting no. A resolution on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, 60/92, was opposed only by the United States, Israel, and three tiny Pacific island nations. And resolution 60/95 urging all nations to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was adopted 172-1-4, with only the United States voting against.*

Now, you could say that this simply proves your point, ""whatever country is *hippieish* enough"", thing is, the US seems to like dressing up like a hippy. However, even the other nuclear powers have made more moves toward disarmament than the US has (see above) so who does that make the most dangerous? It's already made them among the [most hated](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6421597.stm)

Daniel Jennings' edit to his post existed before I posted my answer, so it's not his reply to my answer.

Every part of Stack Overflow is run and moderated by the community except one: the selection of the accepted answer. As long as you have one person in charge of selected answers you will always have to deal with their particular biases, which decrease the value of Stack Overflow as an objective reference to programming questions.

It might be a good idea that in addition to the answer selected by the asker that there be a community selected answer. This would be completely orthogonal to the up/down votes for the questions, and would only allow one selected answer per person per question. An approach like this would greatly serve to make Stack Overflow a more equitable and fair system.

Women have a lot of options to prevent themselves from getting pregnant, and they also have the final option: no pregnancy gets past an abortion. So if a woman doesn't want to have a kid, she can avoid it. Hell, if she's got moral objections, adoption gets her out of the 18 year obligation, if not the 9 month obligation. A woman has just as many options to defend herself from an accidental pregnancy as a man does, but in today's culture, she does not really need to care, because the state will back her up every single time.

If she *wants* a kid, she should take responsibility for having it and not use the cudgel of state enforcement to keep an unwitting father in hock for 18 years.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;As far as I know she wasn't talking about what the government should do, she was talking about her own personal ideas on the matter.

Not according to the [Anchorage Daily News](http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8347904p-8243554c.html). But they seem to print lots of anti-Palin stuff, so they must be liberal. Of course, that she would want to teach her own children the non-science of creationism would be pretty bad enough.

&gt;But everyone has their own blend of fucked-up personal beliefs

Everyone is allowed their own beliefs, but they are not allowed their own reality. To the extent that creationism is science (that is, to the extent that it actually says something about the world) it is demonstrably wrong. To the extent that it is not wrong, it is not science. 

&gt;Obama, for instance, stated that the biggest failing is his lifetime was that people don't follow a basic biblical principle, and then went on to quote the scripture.

I am not complaining about her religion or that she has a religion, I am complaining about supposed scientific claims. If I wanted to bring up religion I would mention her apparent connection to some pretty scary people like Joel's Army, but I did not want to change the subject.

And, again, this is one of at least two, and perhaps three, examples where she promotes theology over science. The other is anthrogenic global warming. I'll give her a pass at the moment on teaching abstinence. If she admits that the evidence shows that ""Abstinence Only"" does a worse job at preventing teenage pregnancy and disease, then she can promote it as ""more moral"". (I'll disagree, but that is a straightforward policy issue.) But if she promotes it as more effective, then she will again push her theology over scientific evidence. I am sorry, but I do see that as serious and meaningful. I want people making decisions on the best available evidence, not simply on what their preacher tells them. And with that I am quite happy with Obama. As far as I can tell he does not confuse morality and science.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It pains me to be so cynical, but do you really believe that the 'average American' will get through 'implication', and 'subtlety' to Biden's message, which you propose still be praise, even if faint?

I agree Biden runs the risk of seeming a bully, but his best strategy is to actively compare her to Obama, not avoid the comparison. 

Obama is a known quantity because he's been in the public eye for a year and a half; he's met with international leaders; he's been vetted to his eyeballs and back. His campaign was the best run anyone's seen in ages. The message is 'see what him governing looks like'.

Palin's entering the race relatively late in the game; she's got no experience internationally; we're vetting her on the fly; we have no idea what her governing looks like other than a high approval rating from Alaska, for heaven's sake. The message is:'you can't show me what her governing a huge organization looks like, and we can't take your word for it'.

I say this because Biden's message should still be 'dangerously ignorant', but her faults should be ones of misused power, not a pat on the head. Condescension will just enrage the touchy Clintonites, whereas wary anxiety still indicates she's 'powerful', which is what those 28-50 year old uneducated women apparantly want to hear (or at least, that seems to be the gist of what Chuck Todd is always talking about).","1220239196"

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Yeah, and you're a fucktard douchenozzle.  I never said anything about it mattering which way it spins *while recording* (though it does, I never said that earlier).  Allow me to quote my earlier post:

&gt;The grooves go backwards, or something along those lines, which makes it easier to record on.

Perhaps I should have changed it to ""the guy on the video claims it's records more accurately that way"". All I did was say to you that, yes, the video clip does indeed state what made the wax cylinder unique. No need to be a dick after someone answers your fucking question, just because you can't wrap your head around the answer. Insecurities can be a bitch to deal with I guess...

Anyway, the guy in the video indicated that the tracks on that specific wax cylinder go in a different direction than they normally do, and claimed that as a result, it recorded more accurately.  And if you couldn't figure that out from just watching the video once, then you, sir, are the one who is dense. Remember, you came away from the video thinking ""duhhhh, whaaaat? Why wax cylinder so special? Me find many others on ebay!!""

Think of this cylinder standing on it's base. If the grooves usually spiral going upward (since it wouldn't make much sense for the groove to connect with itself after going around the cylinder once) then turn it upside down (in case you're not following, make the top its base), then the spiral would no longer travel upward. They would travel downward.  This is very basic.  When you stand normally, your clothes, from bottom to top, are as follows: shoes, pants, shirt, hat.  Turn upside-down and do a handstand, and now your clothes, from bottom to top change to: hat, shirt, pants, shoes.

Do you understand how records work?  You put the needle on the record, and it moves from the outer edge of the record to the inner circle of it as it plays, because the grooves spiral around.  If you were able to play that record backwards (from the inner edge to the outer edge), you would hear the music itself backwards. If you were to record the music beginning on the inner edge of the record, and you tried to play it like a normal record, from the outside, inward, you would still hear the music backwards.  If the grooves are backward, to listen to the music properly, you'd have to play the record accordingly: backwards.  Record players play the music on records in a similar fashion as phonographs played those wax cylinders.  Therefore, it both CAN and DOES matter which way it spins when it's recorded, and that would determine which way it should spin when you play it.  

Now, if you record the record (or wax cylinder) with it spinning (not sure at the moment which direction is normal, but that's irrelevant) counter-clockwise, and your record player spins the record clockwise, you wouldn't be able to play the record unless your record player had a 'reverse' function.  

In spite of *all* this, by all means feel free to once again cite the name of the geometric shape into which the wax is molded as a rebuttal, assclown.

edit: but you don't need to take my word for it.  It's not like I went to music school, or even worked at a couple different record labels for that matter.  Oh wait, actually I've done both of those things...","1220239207"

My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it. ","1220239328"

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","this is just off the top of my head, but:

the reason is because it's in society's best interests to prevent men from leaving their women &amp; children.

it's a fact that kids generally do better with two parents, and that means less pressure on the state to have more educational support, food/shelter support, police/courts/jails.

hence, laws make it harder for dads to leave a kid.

however, it would be nice if there was some sort of father-based veto power on abortion (either to have one or NOT to have one), but i don't see how that would work: you count the nine months of carrying the kid, and the mom gets 51% to the dad's 49% and wins the contest every time...

You can try and make the case that it might be necessary, or even preferable to an alternative, but there is no way that such an act can be portrayed as heroic or an adventure. So the story sucks as far as war movies are concerned.

Having said that there have been a number of movies/TV series made about the _making_ of the first atomic bombs.  As a techno-thiller that story has a lot of hooks.  There's the gadget aspect, the Russian spy subplot, the burn-before-reading secrecy element.  High points of the story are the Einstein letter, recruiting Oppenheimer to lead the scientists, the lab accident, the first test (code named _Trinity_ for God's sake!) And of course there's the famous Bhagavad Gita quotation:

    &gt; If the radiance of a thousand suns
    &gt; were to burst into the sky,
    &gt; that would be like
    &gt; the splendor of the Mighty One—
    &gt; I am become Death, the shatterer of Worlds.

It has a neat advantage due to our culture: most people who really want a family already do it anyway.

Oh, and I can acknowledge anything I want, my religion doesn't bar me from things as you seem to believe (I'm not a creationist or anything like that either). 

2. Okay, I'm just giving a rationale for the Israeli's actions, It was kill or be killed. That makes perfect sense to me. If you see people lining up with guns on your front lawn would you try to physically stop them had words and sense not deterred them? I would (that's probably more ammunition for you, but whatever, I like my home the way it is... without bullet holes). Oh, and as for the bullet holes, I'd rather the people advocating evil and terrorism have them in their homes, rather than the people advocating peace. How many times do you see Palestinians marching for Israeli human rights, you can go to Israel and see the opposite lots of times.

3. In pretty much all cases the blame does lie with the Palestinians. Kidnap a soldier and expect cookies and brownies from the Israeli's. Come on, even you have to understand that is absurd in the most blatant manner possible. Don't gamble if you can't afford to lose. 

4. Sorry, I don't put a monetary value on life. It's just not my place to do so. I think you meant to say ""quirk"" not ""quick,"" correct me if wrong.

5. I never said they only target military and terrorists. There always will be collateral damage, it's unfortunate, but it's inevitable. Israel does however try to minimize or have zero civilians die. Israel always gets burned when they kill a civilian, it's in their general interest to have the best intel possible to minimize the chance a innocent person loses their life. I will concede there is a small group in the Israeli army that does hate Arabs, most however don't. Look at any other army in the area and see how many hate Jews. I'm sure it's orders of magnitude larger.

He served with distinction in that capacity, particularly known for his brutality.

I honestly have no clue as to the motivations for writing such an article, or even if it was written by him at all. But it's interesting to note the timing of many of such provocations.

One telling coincidence is that much of the Litvinenko drama unfolded during a historic Russia-EU Summit.

"PalinProblem","t5_2qlxu","&gt;Sue Williams (12:31:50) : 

To the person who commented on Sarah’s hair - no, it’s what happens when one has hair extensions - which Sarah, at one time, don’t know about now, had.

Re: babygate - I don’t know what’s being reported. Here, however, is the truth. Trig is Sarah and Todd’s baby. 

When Sarah first learned she was pregnant, it was shocking and overwhelming. While she and Todd had not planned to have anymore children, it is common knowledge among their family and friends that neither of them ever surgically insured that they wouldn’t have any “late in life” surprises/blessings.

This, to me, showed a disturbing lack of judgement. If you want to ask the citizens of a state to let you run the state for four years, to me she and Todd should have thought ahead and determined that the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy wouldn’t have been prudent for either the child, their family, their extended family (who are the ones who end up helping them raise their current four children) or the citizens of the state.

They either didn’t think this through, or didn’t care. Not sure. But, either way, to me and to others, it was a lack of foresight and judgement.

But it is the same vein - this lack of judgement - Sarah showed, on the campaign trail for governor, when asked who would raise her children should she win, she promptly stated that Todd would quit his job and stay at home with the kids (Todd works a “Slope” week on/week off schedule).

Sarah was elected and then - whoops. Todd didn’t like the stay at home gig - so Sarah, citing they needed money for the kid’s college (even though Track enlisted in the military) said Todd was returning to work. When asked about her statements on the campaign trail about how Todd would quit his job, Sarah said she’d actually never talked to him about what they would do if she was elected (in terms of his employment) and that she’d spoken out of turn when she spoke for him stating he’d quit his job.

Again, call me picky, but this is the kind of bizarre judgement Sarah routinely displays. Are you kidding me that she would run for governor and she and her husband would somehow not think to have a conversation about what to do with their four school aged kids? That’s insane. So, either her judgement is super goofy, or she wasn’t telling the truth. Either way, it’s not reassuring to now think this is someone who would be one 72 year old heartbeat away from having to call shots for the country/world.

So Todd trots himself back to work and Sarah is busy traipsing around the state and the nation. The kids are “farmed out” (this is the word used by thier associates in “the Valley”) to family and friends to raise while Todd and Sarah are off having their respective careers (Sarah is famously quoted as saying, “My mom does whatever I need her to”).

During this period is when Bristol, Sarah’s sixteen year old daughter, turns up pregnant. So, it’s kind of interesting to note that the Republican Vice Presidential Nominee and her sixteen year old junior in high school unwed daughter were carrying babies at the same time. Once Bristol’s condition became more obvious this summer, she was whisked out of sight and hasn’t been seen in public until yesterday in Ohio. This is why Trig’s blanket was strung across her entire abdomen and torso, but, when she walked down the stairs from the stage, in a profile shot, it was very clear to see she is well into her third trimester of her pregnancy.

It has come out in the past couple of days that she and her high school boyfriend had a quickie wedding and that she is home schooling her senior year.

The Anchorage Daily News has known about this for months - and haven’t touched the story. But I can’t imagine the national press or the Democratic Party will be as willing to turn a blind eye.

For me, once again it speaks to judgement. We all - every single one of us - even Sarah’s closest friends in the Valley (I know, I’ve been speaking to them) know she is in no way qualified for this position. At all.

But then, why would she accept the nomination, knowing that Bristol’s situation will come to light and knowing her hunger for national and international acclaim and attention will carry with it a mighty high price for her seventeen year old daughter who had absent parents last year and who turned up pregnant. 

How embarrassing will it be for Bristol once the news (or the baby) comes out and not just the Valley, not just Alaska, not just the USA - but Bristol will be known the world over as the seventeen year old unwed - then quickly wed senior-in-high-school-homeschooled-teenage mom and daughter to the Republican Vice Presidential Nominee?

How hard will that degree of scrutiny and shame be?

How does one do that to one’s daughter?

How does one dash about the country for the next 66 days trying to pull off an image of the devoted mother of five when she, by and large, isn’t the one raising them and when one of them - her daughter, is in a truly vulnerable point in life; not to say anything about the needs of Trig. But maybe he doesn’t count, except as a talking point or a photo prop. But this is a person, a little boy who is going to require a tremendous amount of time and attention. From his mother.

This is okay?

This shows that humans are capable of determining right from wrong through logic, reason, and emotions, rather than needing a guidebook to tell them that eating shellfish is unacceptable.  I would think that atheists are more inclined to be affected by societal standards and personal insight than someone who believes a book of rules and regulations was written by the creator of the universe. That's not to say that theists aren't capable of the same, but that they are more likely to dismiss personal moral conviction due to their belief in divine instructions.

I attack bogus arguments when they are bogus.  If it were a sop (SOP?) to reddit, I'd take the position that these firings demonstrate politicizing of positions that shouldn't be politicized.  

Yes, he had the right to vote for the opposition in a secret ballot, but getting fired for exercising his First Amendment right to political speech would be getting fired for political reasons.  I think you are aware of that, and are pretending to be all concerned that reddit readers are making a big deal of her political firing of a police chief as some sort of way to smack down Democrats who are looking for things to criticize in her record.  I certainly think it's fair game to bring this out, and I think it's fair game to dismiss as no big deal because such political firings are legal and common.  

I don't think it makes any sense in this case to pretend it's a ""managerial"" decision devoid of any political reasons, and I would think, but honestly don't care, that if the shoe were on the other foot, if it came out that some Democrat had done that, you'd not only decry the decision as political, you'd add that such a Democrat were endangering children in the act of firing a police chief of such upstanding credentials (whoever it was).

Yes, my mind is made up. Go read about the Kaibab Plateau. They culled the predators there and destroyed the ecosystem.

&gt; ADC once killed off the mountain lions of the Kaibab Plateau, north of the Grand Canyon, in an attempt to increase the number of deer for hunters and naturalists. Without the lions to cull the weak, sick, and old, the deer population outstripped its available food, and the result was mass starvation.

If there are shades of grey you are not capable of perceiving them due to your religius and cultural upbringing.

You are a zealot and therefore are unable to perceive the suffering of palestenians let alone being able to take responsibility for it.

You're not getting it still.  First, there can be many reasons to fire somebody for what they said that are not political.  However the bigger issue is not what he said but it's that it destroyed his ability to work with the rest of the group.  If you want to call that political in terms of the interactions within small group dynamics, then fine.  But the reasoning is not based on his beliefs, but that his actions had caused a rift that was going to seriously degrade his performance and reputation.

Where does the most of the oil produced in Alaska go today?

Given how much oil can be produced in ANWR, what will be the impact on prices over the next 3 years?

Much of what you call on as safeguards depends on an instutionalist assumption that the legal and political system can prevent abuse. Given the blatant and admitted corruption, how do we know that the safeguards will work?

If you'd bothered to research Obama's record you'd know that he voted ""present"" for about 130 out of more than 4000 votes. If you knew anything about the Illinois legislature you'd know that's not even close to a record. If you examined the individual votes and his positions on them you'd know that they were entirely in keeping with the appropriate use of the ""present"" vote in the Illinois Senate.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","That's the thing though, you're arguing that any human consumption of Caribou or moose is immoral and unnatural. I disagree. Mankind is a part of the ecosystem in Alaska and has been for over 10,000 years. Mankind has been in these areas as long as the Moose have. Before that it was Glacial ice fields, uninhabitable. Global warming is changing the habitat for the better. It's been called the ""age of the Shrub"" by climate scientists as Beetle killed trees give way to shrubs, permafrost melts creating ponds full of nutritious alge, less rain giving way to more forest fires. Burned forest is some of the best Moose habitat there is. All the easily accessible nutritious shoots. 

Bears kill over 40% of the moose calves. Man lets the moose grow up before hand. 

Our disagreement comes down to one concept I believe. I view mankind as a part of nature. You view mankind as separate or apart from nature. I feel that is a very dangerous view.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","These guys all sound like fools.  When it comes to whether or not there is a god, shouldn't we use every bit of our experience, every bit of our thought, every possible manner of approaching the question?  

Enough of me attacking your beliefs, though.  Here are some of my own for you to attack.

I think largely my belief in god springs from the fact that I have a conciousness, that there is in fact an ""I"" experiencing this world.  It is an impossibility for science to ever understand why a conciousness exists, because there is no objective manner to tell if something is or is not concious.

Your earlier comparison fails because Shakespeare was making insightful observations about the human condition, whereas religions are presenting baseless existential claims as fact.

Any commitment to GK Chesterton-esque poetic 'truths' over more scientific ones has to deal with the huge problem that one is left with no reliable nor sensible means to choose one poetic 'truth' over any other: all contributing variables are by definition divorced from the real world.

We scientific types can fit poetry into our worldview as interesting but perhaps poorly-supported hypotheses.

&gt;A half-term governor has more claim to leadership and experience than does a one-third-term U.S. senator who has risen through a big-city political machine.

Since when is 3 years and 8 months a third of 6 years?  Also, apparently 20 months is half of 48 now.

&gt; But surely for a Washington novice, the vice presidency is more appropriate than the presidency.

Not when said VP's running mate has a higher probability to die than most.  McCain's pick for VP is really a pick for President.  If you're criticizing Obama for inexperience, the same exact argument has to be used for this pick for VP who has a higher than most chance to become President as a result of the President's death.

I cannot believe we are arguing that a candidate with:

* a handful of years on the city council of a city of ~10k, 
* a mayorship of that same town, 
* less than half a term of being Governor in the 3rd least populous state in the country,
* worked as a television sports reporter and a fisher,
* received a bachelors in journalism and a minor in political science.

is more qualified than a candidate who:

* worked for 7 years as a state legislator for Illinois
* worked for 3 years as a United States Senator for Illinois
* worked as an associate and counsel for a law-firm which specializes in Civil Rights litigation
* his education culminated in a juris doctorate at Harvard Law
* taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for 12 years.

Nothing will convince these people that any of what I listed about Obama is important, but goddamnit I can't believe that this is even up for argument.

Also, consider giving subreddit moderators the ability to see a thread on the front page and link it to their own subreddit (e.g., if someone forgot to link a post to politics, the politics mods can link it to politics, for the benefit of the people who are trying to block posts from politics).  Maybe just for the big 10 ""default"" subreddits.

Then, automatically link headlines that contain ""vote up"" into a new ""vote up"" subreddit, which people can opt out of.  It doesn't take them off the front page, it just lets individual redditors automatically block them.  Whoever moderates the vote up subreddit (qgyh2, I'd imagine) can manually link any main page posts which use clever spelling to get around the filter, into the ""vote up"" subreddit.

If that is what's perceived as having caused a rift, then it's a political firing.  Sheesh!  

You can put it into words devoid of the political context, you can pretend that politics had nothing to do with it, but as you yourself said, it was coming out for the political opponent that was precisely why you'd have fired him yourself if it had been you.  

You are pretending it's some form of insubordination.  It isn't.  

As it happens, it's debatable whether that shows leadership or vindictiveness.  That's what's being debated here.  I've certainly seen situations where it would be considered leadership, and I've seen situations where it would be seen as vindictiveness, probably more because ""leaders"" seem to resort to firing when they feel their authority threatened more often than proving their authority with leadership.  

I'm certain she felt she didn't want to work with somebody who backed her political opponent.

The stretch is identify that as somehow not a political firing.  What's hard about this?  It was his political position that was responsible for her losing faith in his backing.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Alright, let me quote my previous post:

&gt;I'm not asserting anything regarding those recording methods and their respective qualities.

In other words, I'm not even TALKING about the quality of the sound. Didn't assert a single opinion either way on that one.

Moving on. I also didn't say anything about whether or not it was priceless. Although, the guy in the video does assert that there is ONE thing that differentiates that specific was cylinder from all the wax cylinders on ebay. That's what *he* asserts, not me. From watching the video, I can't tell you whether or not what he says is accurate.  I'm only telling you *what the guy in the video clip was asserting, since you couldn't seem to figure it out yourself.*

Let's try this again, and I'll walk you through:

**BOBCAT:** *What makes this wax cylinder so special? I found many others on ebay.*

**ME:** *Well, the guy on the video indicates the grooves on this specific wax cylinder go in a different direction than they normally would, and he also claims that, as a result, it records more accurately.*

Got it?

So, if you have to play it in the same direction it was recorded in, as you just stated, then you were wrong when you stated earlier that:

&gt;It cannot matter which way it spins when it is recorded.

If it doesn't matter which way it spins when you record on it, then you wouldn't have to play it in the same direction it was recorded in.  

Anyway, this is all irrelevant, because the *only thing* I wanted to prove to you in my long post is that you can, indeed, go backwards around a wax cylinder, which you don't seem to believe, and that it can and does matter which way it spins when it's recorded. From said long post:

&gt;Think of this cylinder standing on it's base. If the grooves usually spiral going upward *(since it wouldn't make much sense for the groove to connect with itself after going around the cylinder once)* then turn it upside down (in case you're not following, make the top its base), then the spiral would no longer travel upward. They would travel downward.

Do you agree with the above quote?  Because you didn't before.  And I quote:

&gt;Backwards. On a cylinder. Sure.

It seems you've changed your tune on this quote, however, when you said:

&gt;OF COURSE you have to play it in the same direction it was recorded in.

The reason I say you changed your tune, is because earlier you thought I was ""dense"" for challenging your assertion that the grooves can not go backwards around the wax cylinder.  But now you acknowledge that you in fact can.  

So, basically, unless I misunderstand, you now agree with me on the only two points that actually started this argument: 

1) That it is possible for the grooves to travel backwards around the wax cylinder, and 

2) That it does matter which way the wax cylinder spins when it's recorded on.

Now, do you disagree with the above 2 points, or are we done here?","1220243441"

I am asking BBC to ask the question of why banks the size of Lloyds continue to use such pathetic protocols instead of reporting how amusing the nature of the password itself was.

Arguing that teaching non-scientific theories in science class is hardly a straw man argument.  ID/Creationism is untestable, and completely unscientific.  It is not a valid alternative to any scientific theory, especially one as strong as evolution.

&gt;I cannot force people to believe as you...

I know.  I am not trying to force anyone to believe anything.  People are entitled to their own beliefs, even if their beliefs are completely irrational.  My argument, once again, is that creationism/ID is not a scientific theory, and therefore should not be taught in science class.

&gt;Choice is one of our rights in America.

Freedom of religion is part of the American constitution.  This does not entitle American public schools to teach Christian ideals.  It also does not entitle American public schools to teach Muslim ideals.  The separation of church and state is extremely important in maintaining citizen's freedom to choose whatever religion/belief system that they desire.

That is an unwarranted, and completely baseless ad hominem attack.  Grow up.

Yes I would definitely agree.

&gt; It is an impossibility for science to ever understand why a consciousness exists,

I wouldn't quite go *that* far, because we can't know for sure that they won't develop a way to determine consciousness in the future, but yes, at the present time we have no definitive method.  I guess my response to that would be that that pretty much just falls under the gap theory, which if you're not familiar with it, states that humans ascribe every phenomenon that the science of their day can't answer to the supernatural.  For example, people used to not know why the sun moved across the sky, so they invented the supernatural explanation that it was being pulled by horses as a giant chariot.  So I would just say that that is just one more thing that we haven't found the answer to yet.  We might find it someday, or we might not, but like you said, no conclusions can really be drawn from the fact the we currently don't know.

And yes I suppose *philosophically* it opens a lot of doors, and we can speculate endlessly about the true nature of the universe (the idea that we could be nothing but a simulation has always intrigued me, of course I don't actually *believe* that though).

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I'll speak for Christians in general to a degree since I am one and know plenty:  Yes, a lot of Christians (and Christian organizations, radio hosts, etc.) do tend to support politicians almost exclusively based on the issues of abortion and gay marriage these days.  I admit that there was a time when I did as well, though I'm glad my voter registration got screwed up so I didn't have to feel the guilt of voting for Bush, as I had planned to at the time.

It's becoming quite clear to me in recent days that these issues are absolutely NOT the central issues we need to pay attention to.  I would certainly prefer to vote for a candidate that shares my moral values, as I think everyone in this country would.  But I find that Obama's display of humble virtue and clear understanding of faith, politics, the American people, and how they all fit together is extraordinarily admirable, even if his stance on these ""hot button issues"" is opposed to my own.

On the other hand, you've got McCain, who may be pro-life, but is a TERRIBLE representation of Christianity as a whole, I cannot remember another presidential candidate who has spoken and acted in such a spiteful, angry way towards pretty much everyone.

I'm a Christian trying to point this out to everyone I know: Obama is much more Christ-like than McCain could ever hope to be.  And it's true, abortion will stay legal no matter who's in office at this point, and gay marriage really should be left in the hands of the states anyway, so why vote for an evil, warmongering filanderer when you can vote for a man of faith with a strong family and the guts to speak to Americans with respect and understanding?","1220243972"

The ancient world was very much based on slavery. Ancient Athens with all of those glowing philosophers was famously based so.

It can be argued that the advent of Christianity eventually caused the removal of the ancient system of slavery, for who would enslave a fellow christian?

see wikipedia

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_medieval_Europe

&gt;Medieval canon lawyers recognized that slavery was contrary to the spirit of Christianity, and by the 11th century when almost all of Europe had been Christianized, the laws of slavery in civil law codes were now antiquated and unenforceable. There were a number of areas where Christians lived with non-Christians, such as Al-Andalus and Sicily, the crusader states, and in the still-pagan areas of northeastern Europe; therefore, canon law permitted Christians to keep non-Christian slaves, as long as these slaves were treated humanely and were freed if they chose to convert to Christianity. 

&gt;In fact, there was an explicit legal justification for the enslavement of Muslims, found in the Decretum Gratiani and later expanded upon by the 14th century jurist Oldradus de Ponte: the Bible states that Hagar, the slave girl of Abraham, was beaten and cast out by Abraham's wife Sarah. A popular medieval legend held that Muslims were the descendents of Hagar, while Christians descended from the legitimate marriage of Abraham and Sarah. By extension it was therefore permitted for Christians to enslave Muslims.

Unfortunately it appears when other persons were found who were considered worthy to be enslaved, given numerous wars, etc.

See the early years of the Spanish in America, as well as the African slave experience. The history of the resurgence of slavery is fascinating, and probably cannot be blamed on religion alone, since there were many religious folk who opposed it on religious grounds.

And many dietary rules probably had some pragmatic roots at one time or another.","1220244194"

Tangential question: How would you think a society of mind readers would fare? If suddenly we all woke up tomorrow with that weird whispery voice in our head, what would happen to society?

I see a few options:

1) Society would be initially shocked at what they saw in each other's heads. There would be some major upheaval, but with uncut knowledge about our differences, we would also see how fundamentally the same we are, and gradually evolve into a more tolerant society as we became more open.

2) Same as 1, but we would slowly lose all sense of individuality and become some sort of hive mind.

3) Society would mostly fragment, with various incompatible religious, racial and political factions breaking off from each other into various geographical regions(Let's say the ability has spatial variance and you only really hear people who are close to you).

4) Nothing would happen because the first order would be figuring out a device to block people from reading your thoughts. The rich would get them implanted in their head, the middle class would work to attain the ability to not be heard, and the lower class who couldn't get a mind shield would be analyzed and controlled by the upper class. Basically, the same as what we have now.

5) Society would implode within a few weeks. 

I wonder about this now and then, because it seems we are headed in a direction where pulling a thought from a person's head would be technologically feasible. You can't take away any more privacy than that - and given miniaturization and large scale manufacture, at some point such a device would come down to iPod levels of attainability. Personally, all 5 options look reasonable even under those circumstances, but I would lean towards #3 or #4, depending on how the tech is introduced. I think the chances of uniting or tearing each other apart completely are both contrary to human nature. Any different thoughts on the matter?","1220244412"

There most certainly is a reliable (and arguably) sensible method of judging a poetic 'truth' - did it affect you?  If art affects you, it must have hit on something true.

Let me ask you, as a scientific type, do you apply the scientific principals to other abstractions?  For instance, is love true or is justice true?  

There is apparently another class of scientific types. . .we scientific types apply science to science problems, but rely on other methods for other things; for example, to determine that the Rolling Stones are much better than the Eagles.

That is why, the Federal Government in 1968 began the program of [National Flood Insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program). 

So, in fact, you are wrong.  The government takes *our* money and *their* money for insurance when catastrophic flooding occurs.  They do owe the *private property* home owners something.  My tax dollars go to this and yours do too.  Sucks, but I would rather it go there than to building bombs to kill muslims...but I digress.

When the government takes my hard earned money they can spend it in various ways.  Flood insurance is a money-making program I would guess.  But when shit like this happens and the stupid ass government spend money *helpng people out*...c'mon this is ideally what thay should do.  Right...take our money and help out people whose lifes have been ruined?  Right?

You are allowed opinion about religion and morality. (But I am allowed to have a different set of moral views.) But you are not allowed our own facts. ""I don't believe"" is not a valid argument against scientific evidence.

I know it sounds like I'm being picky here, but I think privacy is a desirable luxury, or maybe a 'civilized right', but justifying anything as a 'right' is always a tricky business. It's something that not many people throughout either history or society have had, and it's something that's under constant attack from other people's curiosity.

So, before we argue about something that's not what I'm arguing about, first could you define what you mean by *natural* right, and why you use the word natural. I think the word carries with it a very specific meaning, ie of nature. 

As a second point (trying to keep this aside from the rights issue, which is more to do with ideology than practicality).. Do you think, given the shrinking size and mass proliferation of recording and transmitting devices, mobile phones cameras etc, that privacy will be possible in 5-10 years time for anyone without significant active involvement in maintaining that privacy? 

Personally I doubt it, which is why I think we should prepare for the possible eventuality of a near/totally privacy-free existence.

Talk to them, not whine at them, talk with them about your concerns as an adult in 3-5 years.  Your calm long term thinking might sway them.  Typically parents can giver there children firearms before they are of age to buy them.  If your parents are not happy with you _having_ it until you are 18/21 then have them keep it until you are 25, but make sure that you are the legal 'owner' now.  The details will vary depending on state (I'm assuming your are in the U.S.).


This is just a bunch of bunk however, because any legislation will take a while to get into law, and these things typically have enforcement dates after they are signed into law (to give people time to react).  More likely than not they won't do anything with guns anyway for fear of pissing off the right.  And even if they do you'll probably be 23 before it mattered. 

 


Second off, don't get an ar-15 as your first weapon. It has lots of moving parts with low tolerance and needs some love and skill to keep working.  Get a bone stock cheap ass X.  Whatever X is.  

After you put a few thousand rounds through X, then decide what you want.  Or at least go to a range and rent a few things before you plunk down a bunch of hard earned dollars on what you wont' use or like. 


I'd recommend something at least getting one .22 lr  per weight it's the most lethal weapon around.  A cheap brick of 500 rounds'll cost you less than a nights drink'n money and you'll shoot all day.


Then figure out what kinda weapon you want, and why you want it.  Are you looking for home defense, pinking, long range, short range, QC, competition, looking good with an ugly gun, or what? 


Then you can optimize your purchase based on your goals. 


After the .22lr I'd recommend something in 7.62 mm you know, ""Gods' caliber"". 


Oh and at some point in your life fire a .50 Desert Eagle.  Until I shot a box or so of ammo through one I didn't think there was such thing as a gun that was 'too big'.  Now I understand I'm not 300 lbs, 6'5"", and made of muscle... or an Officer who should only be firing a weapon when everything has gone totally wrong.

Now perhaps one may argue that Obama trumps Palin in that his experience comes from the Senate while hers is from being a governor of a small populated state. Two counter arguments can be made here. 1) Palin has more experience at being a leader than Obama. You can't lead in Congress, but you can lead a state. Consider the duties of a governor. It's pretty much the same kind of duties a president does. A senator doesn't have those kind of duties. When approval ratings come around, the numbers for a governor is squarely on the governor. The numbers for a senator is unknown because the rating applies to all of Congress. I've read that Palin's approval rating is higher than Congress' disapproval rating. However, looking at Obama's popularity, does anyone believe Obama's rating should be around 20% along with the rest of Congress? The bottom line to that is Palin's responsibility neck stick out a lot further than Obama.

2) Palin is in good company. After all, Ronald Reagan was only a governor, too. Regardless of criticism, Reagan is the GOP's poster boy and the illusioned benchmark in which all Republicans are judged.

All that I've said should be taken with a grain of salt for that the vast majority that does have loads of experience are the main causes for everything wrong with this country. Whenever I hear someone gloat about their length of experience, I know that person is someone I will never vote for.","1220245157"

Perhaps not, but I've certainly seen legitimate in-house implementations of memory management and string formatting code.

I've also seen things like a home-made sort algorithm (to ensure consistent behaviour across multiple platforms; a lot of standard library sort routines don't specify the exact algorithm, and therefore may have different behaviour in unstable sorting).

Using a library can be a smart move if (a) it really does what you want, completely and correctly, and (b) the risks and overheads incurred for incorporating the library are not greater than the risks and overheads for doing it yourself.

"politics","t5_2cneq","During Palin's time in office, she's made innumerable decisions of questionable ethical value, she's been for the Bridge to Nowhere, then against it, but in the end, kept the pork (she kept the money for the Bridge to Nowhere - McCain seems not to have noticed). She has limited experience in government - Obama in contrast is a Constitutional scholar. And on the national stage, where the issues are completely different than those she has faced in her limited time as Governor, she has NO experience. 

As Steve Clemons has put it
&gt;This was a ""Country Last"" decision. If McCain had something happen to him, I just don't know what the country would do.

&gt;We would be faced with a scary situation in which many major institutions in our nation -- and you probably know at least part of what I'm talking about -- might not support her ascension to the presidency. We have to consider the implications of that.

&gt;I can't prove that the government would divide if she were to move from VP to the presidency, but I know that there would be enormous tension. I think we'd see mass resignations.

&gt;Sarah Palin is not Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is not Condoleezza Rice. She isn't Kathleen Sibelius or Olympia Snowe or Janet Napolitano. She's not Susan Eisenhower or Dianne Feinstein.

&gt;Alaskans typically devour their governors. They usually serve a single term before the tectonics of state politics undermine their state leader. But she hasn't even served two years as governor.

&gt;What does she think about Cuba? Does she know the difference between America's relations with Brazil and Venezuela? Does she know what a balancing act we are walking in Asia between Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea, North Korea, Russia and more? Does she know anything about nuclear weapons and our defense posture?

&gt;What books has she read? Who are her inspirations as thought leaders? Has she written any serious articles or published anything we might see to get a sense of who she is?

&gt;What would she do with Iran? Can she name even five nations on the continent of Africa?

&gt;She better study up. Because as she begins to have her national coming out -- forget the reporters. . .regular people are going to kick her tires about this stuff.

And although I disagreed with him vehemently, Reagan had *opinions* about foreign policy even in his stint as Governor. Palin, in contrast, seems to have few or none. At least Reagan was *interested* in the subject. How possibly should a such person, with no opinion on the Iraq war ""except what she read in the news,"" be a heartbeat away from the Presidency??? 

I really don't see how any person can make the claim that she has enough experience with a straight face. Republicans seem willing to put the entire country at serious risk by not admitting the obvious. I understand why though. You guys are really stuck now, because if McCain has to withdraw the nomination, he's sunk for sure.","1220245768"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well I can't.  Belief in god and the reason religion exists are two very distinct subjects in my mind.

Hmm, I will try to give more details, but it won't be pretty.  Words are a poor means of communicating abstractions, and a need for brevity doesn't help.

The existance of my own consciousness is but one way that I feel amazingly fortunate. . .the laws of science that govern the physical world could have operated differently, but no, every thing is perfectly in place to allow for my existance.

Perhaps other people can think that something came from nothing, but my mind has a hard time believing in an effect with no cause.  So where does a ""self"" come from?  If one wants to define god as merely the power from which a ""self"" comes from, and nothing else, there is still a god that exists outside of the realm of science's penatrating eye.

In many ways, god is a personification of the world, the hollistic view if you will.  Science tends to look at how the details come together, while spiritual types are more interested in broad truths about the world as a whole.  In many ways, god is a synonym for ""the universe.""

Back to the concsiousness, we are very quick to ascribe this concept to other things with brains, and most people are open to the idea that a computer may reach this point as well.  But the behavior of plants is very similar to that of animals, just their behavior is much slower.  Perhaps plants have a limited form of conciousness.  Perhaps cells, too.  After all, they are autonomous units that are co-dependent on the life around them - - just like the rest of us.

A hive mind exhibits a form of intelligence far greater than its individual parts.  If each bee has a brain and thus some limited sense of self, it seems logical to accept the possibility that the hive has a mind as well.

Then of course, the earth as a whole could be described as one giant organism.  Perhaps it has conciousness. . .the thing is we will never know for sure.  It is not that different from quantum theory, the cat will always be trapped in the proverbial black box, and we will always be forced to accept that both possibilities are equally true.

HOWEVER --

&gt; It is not the duty of the Federal Government to send money to any such humanitarian effort

The Constitution says:

""Section 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the **common defense and general welfare** of the United States"".

Support for New Orleans can be argued under BOTH defense and general welfare headings.  It's THE key port, and to continue as such, it REQUIRES the city infrastructure.

If the U.S. were ravaged by war as with large parts of Europe in WWII, it would be in line for the Federal Government to pay for reconstruction, right?

So if a city is blown to pieces by a natural disaster, how does it make any sense to leave it demolished?

It is not good for defense to have your major cities in ruins; nor is it, obviously, good for the general welfare.

You can do this while still respecting States' rights by allowing them to decline federal funds and assistance and pay for it themselves.

Policemen and National Guardsmen were carrying guns as they stood watching over the city's empty streets, while the nation anticipated that Hurricane Gustav could rival Hurricane Katrina in its destructive power.

There was some theoretical work done on 8 in. nuclear rounds, but tube artillery just doesn't have the range that rockets do,.  No to mention nuclear tipped cruise missile are good enough and not accidentally going to fall into the wrong hands because of some ground advance, when it can be fired from a standoff bomber at 1000 miles away. 


I personally would draw the line at what an individual human can fire safely without harming others.   If you have access to a rifle range, then rifles, if you have access to enough space to safely deploy tanks or artillery, sure why not.  I think all American citizens with a pilots license and the means should be able to strap on some guns and bombs and head out to civilian day a the local live fire range.  Too bad Vieques is closed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To do this you will need three things. First, you will need the Ore of the Amazons, which is located in the Temple of Golos in the land of Scythia. It is guarded by a twelve-foot tall cyclops-woman who will gaze into your soul with her Eye of Truth. If she finds you to be pure, she will let you pass into the altar room, where the ore is located. However, if she find you to be marked by sin, she will do battle with you. She will let you choose the weapons: swords, knives, or battle axes. Always choose knives. 

Next you will need to procure exactly twenty-seven grams of banana puree from the banana orchards of Colombia. You must search long and hard throughout the country for a certain tree, but you will know when you have come to the right tree because it will be much taller then any of the others and will be guarded by a three-headed jabberwock. It will ask you to answer a riddle, and will let you ask one question about the riddle to each of its heads. However, take note that one head will always tell the truth, one head will always lie, and the third will immediately devour you if asked a question. Choose wisely.

Finally you must obtain the Poncho of Destiny, which you will later convert into a mop. It is well-hidden within the one of the four Ice Caves deep in the Himalayas. The exact location of these caves is known by only one woman, an old hag who lives at 1233, apt. 4, Northern Boulevard, Boston, MD, USA. Her name is Suzanne and her ancestry passed down through generations the story the Ice Caves. However, she will not tell you the story until she knows she can trust you. You must visit her three times, each time bringing successively greater gifts. On the first visit you must bring her a dozen roses. On the second you may bring either a dozen glazed donuts or a dozen blueberry muffins. For these two visits she will only talk to you through the door and will have you smoosh the food through the crack between the bottom of the door and the floor. Take note, however, that if she finds your offerings to be unsatisfactory she will curse you and your family for the next 10 generations. One the third visit she will let you into her apartment. Do not take offense to the smell, nor to her grotesque appearance. She uses her sole tooth to open beer bottles. She will ask you a series of questions pertaining to the history of the Red Sox. She will then ask you if she is beautiful. You must answer ""Yes."" You will then have to make love to the hideous cavern of semi-necrotic flesh she calls a vagina. You will lose all desire for sexual activity after this and eventually your penis will wither and fall off. Do not keep it as some sort of token of the past; feed it to a hound.

If, in nine months, she is blessed with a son, she will share with you the secret of the Ice Caves. Once you return from the caves you will have all three of the items necessary to clean your bathroom floor. Combine the banana puree and crumbs from the remaining pieces of the ore in a saucepan over medium heat. Add three liters of boiling water and stir until the mixture emits a smell similar to that of a baby's diarrhea. While it is cooling, fashion a mop from the poncho and a broomstick. Now you are ready to clean your floor! ","1220246608"

And this doesn't even begin to address the indecent, public shaming that took place by repeatedly posting images of a slightly chubby 16 year old girl and accusing her of being so large as to be evidence of pregnancy, a girl whose only crime is being born of a woman who would eventually run for public office.

Unfortunately terrorists hide and fire from places where the general population lives for this very reason. The Israeli's always have more hesitance when something will effect non-combatants, and terrorists/militants capitalize on this, it is unfortunately the smart thing to do.

 As for the lining up on your lawn for no good reason. Many people in the middle east take the Koran/Qu'ran quite seriously and believe infidels should all die (there are Jews who take the Torah too seriously and think the same thing, they thankfully are in far fewer numbers physically and proportionally). I don't think any religion should be taken too seriously, it always has bad results. 

You and I would both need military intel access to truly put to rest the ""they do/don't target civilians on purpose"" argument. I ask you to acknowledge one thing, Israel is a country that thrives or dies on public perception, killing innocent people isn't good for that, and therefore isn't in their interest.

And yes, the ""they are worse"" excuse did come up. I think it is a good thing that Israel tries to be better than its enemies. Nobody's perfect, we've already established that.

As for the argument that I can't see shades of grey, I have already admitted Israel makes mistakes and both sides are not innocent, isn't that perceiving the grey? Simply having a different upbringing doesn't mean you see the world in black or white, just through a different lens. 

I don't take responsibility for the suffering of Palestinians. They use pipes that could be used for water and instead cut them down and make them into rockets. They also pour money into weapons instead of infrastructure. As a Jew I can vouch that is Israel suffered no more attacks from the Palestinians, and no more were plotted, there wouldn't be any Israeli incursions into Palestinian territory. I put the ""no more were plotted"" in there because if Israeli intel is tipped off on an attack, they obviously would react.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Thanks for the conversation, oreng. I'll continue with my thesis, though: love and freedom are in fact a duality in human life; those two qualities are necessary to human health and happiness and they depend upon and include each other. From one of my columns:
-----
Without love, there is no freedom. Without freedom, there is no love. Consider the example of the early United States:   

First, slavery was allowed in some of the states. Second, American Indians were sometimes mass-murdered, their land was stolen, and the survivors were forced onto reservations.   

In both cases, the target groups were not being treated with love or compassion.   

It is equally clear that in both cases, freedom was being denied to the target group.   

One cannot enslave or murder someone while treating them with compassion. Loving someone requires and includes allowing them the rights of life, liberty, and property. The Marxist focus on love-without-freedom created even more horrific results than did the reverse focus in America. 
-----
On democracy: slavery is the most democratic institution there is; rule of the minority by the majority. It was known back in the time of ancient Greece and Rome that even well-meant democracy  falls apart as soon as the voters learn they can vote themselves booty from their neighbors; it doesn't take long for lobbyists to appear.

I agree with you that the execution of socialist services has much to do with how well they work -- for a time. But the long-term forces are always for more corruption and less efficiency, and because when services are ""free"" there is no end to the demand for them, rationing of one sort or another begins. Plus -- and here's the real problem -- a coercive state ALWAYS attracts sociopaths who LIKE having power over others. Not every socialist nation is like the National Socialists of Hitler's Germany, but every socialist nation is a potential Nazi state. For some history in the matter of Marxist states, see The Black Book of Communism, written by Marxists, not right-wingers. Really: if you've not read it, consider getting a copy. You really can't understand the corrupting influence of government power without understanding how widespread mass-murder by government (including non-Marxist governments) really is.","1220246938"

In my opinion, the pantheistic or deistic routes are at least somewhat respectable. Although I do think they have their problems. There just seems to be a kind of bait and switch going on when the religious are defending their belief in god.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I really wouldn't believe that cars use ICE because they are, with current technology, the best method.  More likely because they were 100 years ago, and even that isn't necessarily true.  Steam engines were competitive until an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth banned public troughs, and then pure ICE took over.

I have no idea whether the car performs as claimed.  I agree that there will be loss of efficiency.  The main advantage of the car is the engine which actually drives the car can be at low temp, which means lighter materials.  This is the key fact which you seem to not have addressed at all.  Even if the efficiency is cut in half, if the weight goes down by a greater factor, you win.

The key point is a compressed air powered car would be lighter.  I'm mostly guessing about the details on how it's gas powered, but the spec sheets clearly specify a tank volume of 8 gallons.

edit: Somebody else is suggesting it uses gasoline to heat the gas: http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6yald/106mpg_air_car_for_only_18000_coming_in_2010/c05742t

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I must disagree that religions fail to make ""insightful observations about the human condition."" Mythology very much does that, and mythology is at the heart of nearly every religion.

Perhaps I could have been more clear, maybe I should say Shakespeare was *only* making observations.  The difference is that Shakespeare was NOT making existential claims.

&gt; If you were to say that belief in god is merely a subjective truth I could probably live with that.

THat doesn't even make sense.  'belief in X' is not a truth, subjective or otherwise, unless it is attached to an agent who does the believing, and even then it belies a scale of conviction. Conversely, the 'existence of X' is a proposition that is either true or false, and we can (and do) engage in various means of trying to understand the probability of such a proposition being true or false.

&gt; If art affects you, it must have hit on something true.

Where the hell did you pull that from?  If I told my mother that my sister died in a horrible car accident, the fact that she is highly affected by this has no bearing on whether the claim is true.  I thought you respected critical thinking...

&gt; Let me ask you, as a scientific type, do you apply the scientific principals to other abstractions? For instance, is love true or is justice true?

Even ignoring the false dichotomy, if such absurd questions trouble you, I invite you to Philip K. Dick's definition of truth/reality:
""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away. --Philip K. Dick""

'Love' and 'Justice', in the abstract form you have presented them, are not propositions, and they cannot meaningfully be assigned a value of truth or falsity.

The Dems policies put more money in the hands of more people who do more work, while the republican policies put more money in the hands of fewer people who do less work.  And that's why the Dems get better economic results.  A system that rewards greater effort will always outdistance a system that rewards the greater privilege.

She has not.

&gt;""I don't believe"" is not a valid argument against scientific evidence.

It is not, but it is still a common reaction which even the most renowned scientists fall prey to.  Recall that even Einstein protested ""God does not play dice with the universe.""

Science is also ignored whenever it is unpopular.  For instance, scientific research showing men to be more intelligent than women, and yet prominent politicians still insist on creating laws which ignore the differences between men and women and demand they be paid the same amount, and artificially transplant women into higher-paying jobs typically occupied by men.  To ignore biological differences (such as a willingness to take risks and neglect family) but still pass legislation to ensure men and women are paid the same is not much different IMO than ignoring science which say abstinence education is not as good at preventing teen pregnancy as teaching safe sexual practices and funding programs which teach abstinence education.

Sometimes people make decisions based on perceived notions of what's best for society without focusing primarily on scientific evidence.  I don't like people ignoring science either, but I just can't find many politicians who adhere to scientific principles, much less scientists who adhere to scientific principles.

&gt;Do you have a quote about this? I suspect you are playing fast and loose here, but I am open to evidence. I also suspect you are trying hard to change the subject.

&gt;BROWN: Senator, if one of your daughters asked you -- and maybe they already have -- Daddy, did God really create the world in six days? What would you say?

&gt;OBAMA: You know, I'm trying to remember if we had this conversation.

&gt;OBAMA: You know, what I've said to them is that I believe that God created the universe and that the six days in the Bible may not be six days as we understand it. It may not be 24-hour days. And that's what I believe.

&gt;I know there's always a debate between those who read the Bible literally and those who don't. And, you know, that, I think, is a legitimate debate within the Christian community of which I am a part.

&gt;You know, my belief is, is that the story that the Bible tells about God creating this magnificent Earth on which we live, that that is -- that is essentially true. That is fundamentally true.

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","&gt;""Sexism is relevant only to one sex"" This statement proves my point. You create an us v. them situation. You can claim that you don't all you want.

No. It really doesn't. That statement is a matter of fact. Sexism, by definition, is the systematic oppression and discrimination against people based on their sex. It is relevant to only one, if both sexes were discriminated against and oppressed equally, there would be no sexism. It would just be labeled oppression.

It is relevant only to women, because Men are not systematically, or non-systematically for that matter, oppressed or discriminated against.

I am not saying Women need to turn on men. I'm saying how dare a man think he has the right to once again pretend like he has authority on the matter of how women act when they try to liberate themselves. That line of thought is exactly what the WLM tried to get rid of.

You are arrogant, because you still think a man has that right, when he clearly does not. Just as a woman does not have the right to have any authority over what a man does.

Sexism does mean treating a gender as inferior, you do not do that when you tell Men to get over themselves.

I have statistics, facts of sexism and other studies on my side to say that Sexism is indeed practiced by and large by the majority of men. Not because they want to be sexist, but because they have been conditioned to believe the things they do are not sexist.

In the case of men, my doing what you say still is not sexism. Call it unfair generalisation, but certainly not sexism.

I do care about what you say. Because it is what you say that is so damn destructive, Deterring the whole point of women's liberation to a mere ""Only if the men say its okay.""

I do not think men are negative figures. What I was saying, and I'll say it again, is that Men do not have the right to dominate the topic of Sexism. They do not have the right to flaunt their opinions on what is good and bad for women to do. I'm saying, how dare they be so inconsiderate.

It is the duty of every man to, in this day and age, realise that Women are still treated worse than men. And that systematically men have been conditioned to propagate Sexism. And that it is necessary for Men to get over their 'dominant' position in society and shut their traps.","1220248625"

There should always be some kind of non destructive autosave, but I think the only solution to reduce or eliminate this in the end is to remove the idea of the file or document as the primary breakdown of information, so that things you do or create on the computer are simply there. You may bound certain things and call it a file, but you shouldn't have to. I guess the rule should be: the things you do should be there with the minimum of overhead. Make a mark on paper, it is there; you shouldn't have to answer the paper's questions about whether you meant to do that, and you shouldn't have to dialog with the trashcan when you toss the paper away; if you want it back, go in and get it.","1220248902"

The hospital that Sarah Palin claims to have given birth has a Birth Announcements webpage.
There's no mention of any Trig Palin born on the day she claims to have given birth. Or on any other date. Pre-deluged snapshot of the birth announcements page:

http://pics.livejournal.com/billylickalolly/pic/0002qd8g

A more juicy tidbit: 
There's a MySpace page cached in Google for a 16-year-old ""Chris Ray"", from Palmer, Alaska. He goes to the same High School that Bristol Palin goes to, Palmer High School.

Here's the Google cached version of his MySpace page, long before this whole thing unravelled. In the Google cache, there's a curious snippet: 

""I LOVE BRISTOL PALIN MORE THEN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!""

Proof:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chris+ray%22+%22Bristol+Palin%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=


Two days ago, Chris Ray's MySpace page was mysteriously made private with no explanation given. Mood set to ""worried"".

Google cache version, dated July 20:

http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:bHNn_pcOQWkJ:profile.myspace.com/index.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3Duser.viewprofile%26friendid%3D59375496+%22Chris+ray%22+%22Bristol+Palin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us

Note the above--Chris Ray lives in Palmer, Alaska. Population 6,920. A small, podunk town. This also happens to be the town where the ""Mat Su Reigonal Hospital"" is, where Sarah Palin claims to have given birth to the baby.

So. We have what appears to be the father Chris Ray, whos in love with classmate Bristol Palin, and her supposedly pregnant mother, supposedly giving birth in a podunk hospital in the same city, with no mention of the birth on the hospital's own birth announcements webpage.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Well, but who's going to determine what constitutes ""fucked up""? Unless I miss my guess, you'd probably say that Nazi-era German culture would qualify as ""fucked up,"" and would thus be categorized as ""others cultures"" for which ""allowance"" ought not be made. On this we agree.

I'd further presume that we agree that the essential thing that makes such cultures ""fucked up"" is that such cultural values infringe on rights inherent in individual human dignity: life, liberty, et c.

As such, an ""allowance for other cultures"" with strings attached, such as, ""only up to the point that they don't infringe on others' individual rights"" is not much of an allowance at all, since it still prioritizes the importance of individuals over the importance of communities.

Ultimately, I think we mostly differ on semantics. I refer to ""Multiculturalism"" as the set of beliefs that claims that groups have rights that ought to be protected by democratic societies. I would say that the individuals within those groups have rights that ought to be protected (""I want to be a Sikh""), but the groups themselves ought not to be protected (""Because I'm a Sikh, I have to carry a knife or sword with me at all times, so I get to take a knife on airplanes.

Dropped from aeroplanes or Zeppelins over enemy trenches or airfields, these gravity missiles were capable of penetrating a helmet and the wearer's skull. Similar weapons were 'Lazy Dogs' (or 'Devil Dogs'), used by the U.S. in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. These 1 3/4"" length (4.5 cm) bomblets were air-dropped at height in canisters by aircraft or scattered from buckets by helicopter crews, reaching high sub-sonic speeds as they fell.

"business","t5_2qgzg","5% is barely enough to cover current inflation rates - if at all. I wouldn't keep my money in a bank for less than 5% on top of the inflation rate.

The thing is that banks don't necessarily need to lend out money on a higher interest rate than what they pay for deposits. For every dollar they attract they can lend out $10 or so (don't know what the Fed is requiring right now in terms of minimal reserves but it should be somewhere around 10% in a sane economy). So they can offer 10% interest on deposits and lend out money at 1% per year and still break even. Well, they can't really because of other costs.

There's a moral hazard of course - if they lend out money for a lower interest than they pay on deposits then people will be tempted to just loan as much as they can and deposit it immediately.","1220249806"

These are the people who would rather yell hate speech at women getting abortions instead of loving and comforting them after they've made the most difficult decision. 

Christians have forgotten the root of their religion, and replaced it with a list of enemies they must resist to prove their holiness. Mainstream Christianity fails at almost every aspect of discipleship to Jesus' teachings. While I am in no way a perfect Christian, I would like to distance myself from this movement. I hope that these Christian leaders will realize the harm they do and rediscover the true message. 

I would also like to say that I respect all of you who disagree with my faith, because in my view, God gave you the ability to disregard him, and who am I to take away a right given to you by God.

You have to believe that. That's how you justify destroying electical generation facilities, television stations, milk production plants, bridges, water treatment facilities etc.

It's a very tidy belief structure which allows you to excuse all of the above without a twinge of guilt or shame.

It's the jewish way.

&gt;The Israeli's always have more hesitance when something will effect non-combatants, and terrorists/militants capitalize on this

Factually false. Whenever israel has struck it has always struck civiliand facilites first.

For example in the lebanon war of 2006 the first target was the airport terminal (not the runway, the terminal) where israel killed around 50 people who were waiting for flights.

&gt;Many people in the middle east take the Koran/Qu'ran quite seriously and believe infidels should all die (there are Jews who take the Torah too seriously and think the same thing, they thankfully are in far fewer numbers physically and proportionally). I don't think any religion should be taken too seriously, it always has bad results.

And yet you are a zionist zealot.

funny huh?

&gt;You and I would both need military intel access to truly put to rest the ""they do/don't target civilians on purpose"" argument.

No. We can simply look at the actions of israel. We look at their choice of targets. We can take a look at the death toll.

&gt;I ask you to acknowledge one thing, Israel is a country that thrives or dies on public perception, killing innocent people isn't good for that, and therefore isn't in their interest.

I do not acknowledge this. You have no basis for making this statement. Israel kills hundreds of civilians every year and yet they get billions of dollars in aid from the US. If anything they get more aid when they kill more civilians.

See lebanon for example. They killed a thousand people, left a million people homeless (sorry I am going to refer to them as ""people"" even though you don't perceive them that way). They dropped cluster bombs on crowded cities and lied about it.

So what was the negative consequence of all that?

Nothing.

&gt;I think it is a good thing that Israel tries to be better than its enemies. Nobody's perfect, we've already established that.

It doesn't succeed though. 

http://www.ifamericansknew.org/

Normally the defenders of israel have to point to darfur or someplace like that to point to ""they are worse than us"".

&gt;As for the argument that I can't see shades of grey, I have already admitted Israel makes mistakes and both sides are not innocent, isn't that perceiving the grey?

Not really. Your apportionment of the blame seems to be that palestenians are 99% responsible for the deaths of all those dead palestenian babies while the israelis are forced into killing babies and do it reluctantly and are 1% responsible.

You have made excuse after excuse for the israelis and show no sign of actually holding them responsible for anything.

&gt;I know I can't really do anything to dissuade from your opinion that I'm a zealot,

Nonsense. Just stop talking like a zealot and you'll convince me.

&gt;I don't go to Saturday services. I enjoy my cheeseburgers. Just for kicks I don't eat bacon or shellfish, I realize I'm not going to hell I do, I just do it for the ""cultural"" thing. Bacon is terrible for you anyways (however, it does smell pretty damn good).

Aiming takes skill, practice, patients, and when some one is shooting at you some very weighty cojones.


Handing a kid a fully automatic weapons is effective enough for many situations... none that civilized society would condone however. 


An fully automatic weapon is better for the untrained, suppressive fire or area attack.  If a marksman can hit a person 1000 meters away with years of training and an aimed shot, a machine gunner can do the same with enough bullets some time and someone stupid enough to not get behind something very hard.  Conversely, someone good with a fully automatic weapon can lay the hurt down on a bunch of people quickly. 


 
The argument is that 9 times out of 1 the only reason any one would want to have a full auto weapon is massive overpowering, normally involved with illegal activities. a.k.a. rum running, bank robbing, or  Bonny and Clyde sort of stuff. 


In the past a full auto machine gun was alos not really usable by normal people.   In 1930, you could get the BAR, and the Thompson machine gun.  Both huge guns that only only meant business, in the guarding banks or attacking Europe sort of way.  Recently with the advance in armaments this may not be completely the case.   For example the full auto Glock 18 is an excitement self defense weapon.

Even if they re-enact the AWB, I don't think buying upper receivers will be outlawed, because it is for a firearm that's already owned.","1220250540"

"programming","t5_2fwo","That's the sign post up ahead... your next stop... CPAN dependency hell.

Don't get me wrong, I *love* CPAN and re-using library code is a *very* *good* *idea*. But there have been times when I've had to give up on installing Very::Useful::Module because it depends on 42 other Less::Useful::Modules, 3 of which failed to build correctly on the machine I happened to be using that day.

As the author of several CPAN modules I know how hard it can be to a) write a comprehensive test suite to detect bugs on all platforms and b) get your code to pass all the tests on all platforms.  As a trivial example, *every* time you write a test that interacts with a file you *must* ensure that the filename is properly localised (e.g. /foo/bar vs c:\foo\bar on unix vs dos).  Writing portable code is hard and it's Not Fun.

Doing it for free in your own time is doubly Not Fun.  Especially when you have to test your software on a whole bunch of platforms (and account for all their stupid differences) that you wouldn't normally use.  I thought that by using Unix/Mac I was free of ever having to deal with MS' ass-backwards paths.  But no.  Instead I have to install Windows XP and spend several miserable days using it to give my software a [clean(ish) bill of health](http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Template-Toolkit.html).

So in summary, re-using library code is a good idea.  But we must also be aware of just how difficult it is to write good, clean and portable library code.  Every time you add a dependency to a 3rd party module/library you are adding a link to your chain that can potentially break.  ","1220250886"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Sure, but really, to place limits on Multiculturalism is to deny Multiculturalism itself, if we're both defining it the same way. I refer to ""Multiculturalism"" as the set of beliefs that claims that groups have rights that ought to be protected by democratic societies. I would, by contrast, argue that the individuals within those groups have rights that ought to be protected (""I want to be a Sikh""), but the groups themselves ought not to be protected (""Because I'm a Sikh, I have to carry a knife or sword with me at all times, so I get to take a knife on airplanes. If you don't let me, you're discriminating against my religion."") (I.E., liberalism, not Multiculturalism)

I would also humbly submit that the reason why it has to be so black and white is that the main thing that the White Man's Burden, the Crusades (both sides), the Inquisition, the Holocaust, Stalin's Great Purge, Tiananmen Square, and all other similar obviously bad things have in common is that all were justified by assigning a greater importance to groups or communities (Christians, Muslims, Aryans, Communists) than to the rights of individuals on the basis of their human dignity. Calling this type of value assignment the root of all evil may be going too far, but it's certainly a top 5 contender.

Another reason why I would argue that it has to be so cleanly cut is that White Nationalist (not to be confused with White Supremacist) groups like Stormfront have gained a disturbing amount of traction by calmly applying the same Multiculturalist arguments made by minorities to white people, a tactic bolstered by the foretold minority status of Caucasians. Essentially, I'd say if you can't flip the position around and have it be just as OK, you're in a philosophical bind. (E.G. ""We should encourage black racial pride,"" vs. ""We should encourage white racial pride."")

To protect somebody's culture as an element of an individual's choices (that don't interfere with the rights of those around her) is fine. It's also not ""Multiculturalism"" as I understand the term is used by social theorists. The placing of ""limits"" that you refer to is, I would humbly submit, the assignment of greater value to the individual than the community, and ultimately antithetical to the essence of any true Multiculturalism.","1220251275"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Stephen King’s first published novel offers a warning to bullies in the person of Carrie White, a high school misfit who wreaks her revenge in a now-famous prom scene. While the story is no less fresh today than it was in 1974, this audio edition promises a brand-new introduction from the author. he story is narrated by Sissy Spacek, who played the title role in the movie. While Spacek perfectly understands the protagonist and amply projects both her hopes and misery, this listener found it unsettling to hear a story about Maine natives in a Maine town read in a clear Texas drawl. Spacek’s consistency and acting ability somewhat make up for this incongruity, but King’s “Mainiacs” still sound more performed than real.

Of course what you are saying is something like ""Everyone is technically agnostic."" I'd agree, but there are plenty of people who claim to either know god exists, or know he doesn't.

Among agnostics, weather theist or atheist, opinions differ on the issue of principle. There are two major groups. TAP (temporary agnostics in principle, the kind that believe absolute knowledge is possible they just don't posses it) and PAP (permanent agnostics in principle, or those who believe absolute knowledge is impossible.)

In fact, I think this division of philosophy is another demonstration that it's knowledge we are talking about, since agnostics are divided on the ""knowability"" issue.","1220251339"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; How about you?

(remember I'm playing devils advocate arguing all positions from the pro-life/anti-abortion POV)

So we're basing all arguments here on their presupposition that abortion is just like killing anyone else.  So from that point of view:  There are very few people in this world who would support killing someone in order to keep someone else from being emotionally upset by their existence.  

Hypothetically, if there was a woman who was raped, and willfully kept the baby to term, but then after it was born decided that it being alive was too painful a reminder of what happened to her, does that mean that she can kill it just to spare herself emotional stress?  Because that's the argument you're presenting to someone who sees killing the unborn as equal to killing the born.

If they were to make an exception based on the circumstances of conception, they would be saying that murder is sometimes okay.  This would be a very inconsistent position for them to take.","1220251347"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I more or less agree, I think religion generally serves purposes (good or bad) which really have very little relevence to the truth of god's existance.  For instance, they form groups which increases the members' power, or it passes on wisdom from generation to generation.

But if you must use the word rationalization, it is my observation that many atheists are that because of a dislike of religion, and similarly rationalize their beliefs.  God is such an all-encompassing concept, it would probably be impossible for the conscious mind to do anything but rationalize why the unconscious made its choice one way or the other.

Consider this: If you allow god to be a synonym for the universe, what about prayer?  Well, I think there is enough documented evidence to suggest that meditative states increase one's health; a new study suggests that optimists are more successful than pessimists.  One can conclude that prayer is probably a healthy activity, giving both a relaxed and optimistic mind.

That is a good example of what I mean.  People realized ""praying to a god"" was a healthy activity long before we put all the parts together.  The concept of god is often a means to express the wisdom of the things humnas have learned without yet putting the scientific pieces together of why it is a good thing.","1220251353"

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","The Engineering Perspective:

Neural Networks are basically a fancy, slow way, of getting a class of nonlinear functions which can be trained to fit a labeled data set very well. AFAIK, they don't generalize as well as Support Vector Machines, at least without substantial massaging.  

The Math Perspective

They are fairly interesting mathematical objects, in that they represent a large(well, relative to what?) class of very nicely parametrizable functions.  There's a whole bunch of parameters defining the topology of the network, and then, we can think about the actually weights of the various connections, and their derivatives with respect to a particular data set, under back propagation.  Sadly, almost none of the neural nets people I've ever talked to seem to have any interest in this bit, which I think is the most interesting bit about them.

The ""Neuroscience"" Perspective

Frankly, I think the so-called neuroscience perspective of neural networks is utter hooey.  For example, a previous poster here, off-handedly mentioned LSTM, as if that conjunction of four letters was supposed to instantly fill my mind with some sort of well developed image. Googling about a bit to see what this latest gobbldeygook acronym signifies, I came across this site:

http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/rnn.html

What do I take issue with here, and what does it have to do with neuroscience and neural networks? I find fault with statements like:

""The human brain is a recurrent neural network (RNN): a network of neurons with feedback connections.""

What the fellow really means is ""I would like to characterize the brain as this particular thing, which is kind of like this neat math toy I built."" , but he can't say that because making definite, though inaccurate statements is what generally gets people to listen to you.  

McCulloch-Pitts neurons are kind of like real neurons in that there are lots of them, they are connected together, and they can do some neat things. That's about it.  We might also use christmas lights, home heating systems, or perhaps the sewage vents as a model of the brain if multiplicity, connectivity and efficacy at some selection of cherry picked tasks are our criteria.

1)  It is not that big of a stretch to call insightful observations about the human condition ""existential.""

2)  Earlier you say that the ""existance of x"" is either true or false, but later you admit that applying ""true or false"" is absurd if x = love or justice.

3)  Telling your mom that your sister is dead is not my idea of art.  Logically, why would you expect a method of judging art to apply?

4)  But let's say it is.  Yes, your lie would affect your mother.  Why?  Presuamably because she loves your sister very much and would miss her horribly.  Those are some powerful truths, without which, your lie would not have affected her at all.

5)  PKD was in no sense an atheist, in fact the bulk of his work tends to debunk the idea of an objective world all together.

6)  God is an abstract concept, so is love.  What criteria does an abstract concept require before we are allowed to ponder its existance?  If anything, I would have said that the existance of love is a much easier thing to prove than god, although justice maybe not so much.

7)  Perhaps asking whether or not god exists is as absurd as asking someone to assign a color to the wind.  That may be the most profound thing written on reddit, although I must note that cartoonists do it all the time.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;But if you must use the word rationalization, it is my observation that many atheists are that because of a dislike of religion, and similarly rationalize their beliefs.

I don't agree with that. I'll tell you why. I used to be very religious. I might even say that I enjoyed most aspects of it. But belief in a deity to me suggests more questions than it answers and this is where the rationalizations come in. Why, if god is all good, is there so much evil in the world? Of course theists have answers for this, but they aren't good or even plausible answers. Then there is the impossibility of being simultaineously omniscient and omnipotent. Can omniscient god, who knows the future find, the omnipotence to change his future mind? And dealing with your problem earlier of not being able to imagine something coming from nothing. I can't imagine an infinitely complex and powerful being just being. Why does this entity exist? What was he doing in the infinity before he created everything? As Stephen Hawking put it, was he preparing hell for people that ask such questions? Why would something that is perfect create anything at all? How could something that's not perfect come from something that is? If one was to claim that Beethoven was a perfect composer and then found out that he wrote the latest Kevin Federline CD, you might call into question this perfection.

&gt;Consider this: If you allow god to be a synonym for the universe, what about prayer? Well, I think there is enough documented evidence to suggest that meditative states increase one's health; a new study suggests that optimists are more successful than pessimists. One can conclude that prayer is probably a healthy activity, giving both a relaxed and optimistic mind.

Even accepting all this, belief in a deity does not follow. We can do studies to see if prayer has any affect outside of the individual, and these always fail to produce results. 

There are very good reasons to suspect that the gods of the major faiths are nothing but mythology and when you rule them out, what are you left with? A god that has no measurable affect on the universe is effectively the same thing as a god that doesn't exist.","1220252664"

I assume you mean Alexis-Charles-Henri Clérel de Tocqueville because he is the only Tocqueville worth mentioning and it seems odd to point to a man who was dead two years before the start of the war for a classical discussion on a war he never witnessed. It is true that he predicted assimilation of Blacks would be impossible to prevent, but that seems hardly noteworthy - because any intellectual worth their weight as a political thinker predicted that obvious tale.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; The gem itself can't execute any code when it's being installed.

This is not true. A gem can have arbitrary code executed as it is installed via the mechanism used to build extensions (extconf.rb). This is one of the reasons why I avoid gem install. You're allowing arbitrary code execution and have to trust the original uploader plus the integrity of the rubyforge.org server plus N mirrors (and it really is N, you cannot just choose one mirror, you get the files from a random one each time). Moreover, it used to be possible to overwrite existent packages simply by renaming the .gem you upload (IIRC this was fixed not so long ago), enabling anybody to add something _special_ to the latest Rails; there's no easy way to know which rubyforge user uploaded what (you have to trust the metadata in the gem hah). Similar attacks against the rubyforge.org infrastructure might still be possible.

You can extract the code from a .gem file safely as follows:

    tar xfO whatever.gem data.tar.gz | (mkdir whatever &amp;&amp; cd whatever &amp;&amp; tar zxvf -)

Any package manager will install code that will screw you when you run it (some have a public key mechanism to at least verify that you're getting the real thing; RubyGems also has one but it's used by about 1 person, the guy who hacked it: nearly nobody bothers to sign his gems, and there's no web of trust anyway). RubyGems adds to this an obvious way to execute arbitrary code at install time, and a distribution system where N + 1 hosts and (effectively anonymous) sysadmins have to be trusted.","1220253364"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","There was no mention made of why the woman in the story drove straight home instead of taking the teen to a hospital. I can think of one reason, which deserves discussion: if taken to a hospital, the teen would very likely have been charged with whatever law forbids underage drinking in Utah. 

This is quite a problem for high school and college drinkers, who very often risk death with their drinking antics. When someone is lying on the floor at a college party, passed out from a dozen shots over the course of the night, the people at the party must weigh some very significant questions. If their friend is in actual danger of dying, then they need immediate medical attention, and damn the inevitable legal consequences. If they are not in danger of dying, then the legal consequences significantly outweigh the potential medical consequences. The problem is, its very hard to tell if someone is in danger of dying or not from alcohol poisoning. Medical professionals will tell you that if there is any doubt, bring them in just in case. But ""bring them in just in case"" rings very, very hollow when you know that they **will** get into legal trouble for it. An uncertain, low probability of something very bad (death) must be weighed against an almost certain, high probability of something moderately bad (citation/booking for underage drinking). 

I have no doubt that this formula is what kills most underage drinkers who die from binge drinking. In a sane universe, the medical emergency would trump the law breaking and an alcohol poisoned minor would not be in danger of a citation, nor would those who brought them to the hospital. Such a policy would cut down on the danger of underage drinkers dying of alcohol poisoning dramatically.","1220253442"

All too readily people point out the harms of religion without considering the good.  Wars are committed in religion's name, but so is an awful lot of charity.  Which of the two gets mentioned?  (I for one am skeptical that religion is often the real cause of either.)

It's not a question of what anyone expects, it's what they're willing to accept.  Just because we expect little of politicians, doesn't mean we should avoid calling them on their missteps.  This particular one might not be important to you, but it's significant to some people.  

My opinion is that it's significant because it shows, as with Bush, a disturbing lack of familiarity with basic features of the nature of the United States.  Someone with a weak understanding of the country's most basic constitutional tenets is not fit to lead it. 

Basically, the Republicans have become a Christian takeover movement, trying to overturn what America was founded as, using the threat of terrorism to build on the ""advances"" made while communism was still considered a threat.

The comment has this holier-than-thou attitude about Palin finishing the conference and then flying to Alaska to have her baby, when the original news article (ADN) about the issue said she had called her doctor to let him know she was experiencing pre-labor symptoms (slow leak of amniotic fluid) and he said it would be fine if she flew back to Alaska.

The point you are avoiding is that women can have an abortion pretty much any time they want. In fact even after birth they can leave the kid with a fire department or hospital and suffer no more consequences for it.

Both parties have an equal responsibility for contraception. Women can abort or give up the child. Men have no say one way or another.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; 2) Earlier you say that the ""existance of x"" is either true or false, but later you admit that applying ""true or false"" is absurd if x = love or justice.

You didn't say ""does love exist?"" you said ""is love true"", which could mean something entirely different.
If you want to decide whether 'love' exists, you make a meaningful definition of it, then you simply go through and determine whether something satisfies that definition.  
Alternatively arguing over something with no definition, or perhaps circular definitions is a pointless excercise (deciding which of GINO or OING is true, where GINO: Gino is not oing, and OING stands for Oing is not gino) is pointless.  You can also jump on board with the [Grelling-Nelson Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grelling%E2%80%93Nelson_paradox) if you are that way inclined.

&gt; 3. Performance art.  By your concession in 4, it reveals something about the human condition, and so I'm pretty happy to call it art.  But anyways:

&gt; 4. But let's say it is. Yes, your lie would affect your mother. Why? Presuamably because she loves your sister very much and would miss her horribly. Those are some powerful truths, without which, your lie would not have affected her at all.

Did you notice that any truth that are revealed are different to the original lie?  The point stands that people can be strongly affected by falsehoods, and that there is no poetic 'truth' to my sister being dead, regardless of the effect on my mother.  Likewise, in the original context of existential claims about the existence of a god or gods, the emotional state of my mother is entirely irrelevant.

&gt; PKD was in no sense an atheist, in fact the bulk of his work tends to debunk the idea of an objective world all together.

I'm happy to quote people who don't think exactly like I do.  From what I have read of his work, I found him agreeably contemptuous of our assumptions of knowability, but in such a hazy world as rampant unknowability leaves us in, whether or not there is an objective world at all becomes moot point.

&gt; 6. God is an abstract concept, so is love. What criteria does an abstract concept require before we are allowed to ponder its existance? 

I would start by demanding a definition to work with (see my GINO, OING point above).  If God is everything that exists, then we already acknowledge everything that exists as 'existence' and adding a superfluous term gains us no new understanding, and additionally confuses the issue for people who mean something quite different with their definition of God.  If love is defined in chemical terms, then we can objectively examine it. If it is defined in emotional terms, we can observe behavior and determine whether it satisfies some criteria or not.  All falsifiable truths are related in some way to outcomes in the real world, and I have yet to find an unfalsifiable proposition worth wasting any time over.

&gt; 7) Perhaps asking whether or not god exists is as absurd as asking someone to assign a color to the wind. 

My analogy was to your question ""is love true or is justice true?"" rather than the existence of god.","1220255555"

That's true.  But when those extremists themselves are now an existential threat to the human species itself, **it is time to do something about the ideology**.

BTW redditors, seeing as you all are pretty tech savvy you should look into Biden's policy on file sharing. In fact his main endorsement?

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The usual catch is that MMORPGs are boring games. They will most likely include having you smash an x amount of monsters until you develop to the next stage. Levels will almost certainly be at the center of your character's development, and if they aren't, jobs will. 

The problem with MMOs is the tedious chore related. Until you are you are well-developed enough to engage in extra-curricular activities - such as PvP either on a one-on-one basis or with guilds clashing together or, as with WAR, huge serverwide alliances - your only task is pretty much to level up. Some games try to break this model with interesting concepts, such as EVE's semi-independent capitalistic economy or games that heavily concentrate on teamplay. Some games, however, are shamelessly devoted to the idea of grinding, like Ragnarök Online: for example, it has a path that will allow you to reincarnate to an upgraded version of your current character, meaning you have to level your character's base level from 1 to 99 (and your job level, too) *again* with a much harder experience curve than before.

"business","t5_2qgzg","- Don't look to reddit for financial advice.  ;) You are just as likely to get suggestions from 13 year olds as you are from MBA's and financial experts.  

I happen to be closer to the latter than the former, so I will dare proceed.  

2. Go find a good financial seminar, specifically one that is NOT trying to sell you something.  The product sales pitches  (masked as financial training) that are trying to sell you something are less than worthless, they can be downright harmful to your financial well being.  Primerica is a great (/horrible) example of this - they come at you as a financial training program, but they are just a poor excuse for a multi level marketing program with some bad products.   
One program that I would recommend is a seminar by Dave Ramsey.  He comes from a slightly religious perspective, but if you don't mind that - his information is very solid.  His ""Financial Peace University"" is excellent.  

3. Risk = Reward.  Always. (...baring a scam...)  The FDIC has never defaulted (knock on wood), so your 3.5% is a guaranteed return.  If you want a better return, plan on more risk.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.

4. Take care of your debt first.  Doesn't make sense to get 3.5% on your money when you are paying 15% on a credit card.  (Tax deductible debt like a mortgage, and govt. subsidized student loans are a different story...)

5. After you've taken care of short term debt, set up an emergency fund for when your car breaks down, etc.  This will keep you out of dept.

6. Learn to budget (see #1), and setup financial goals.  You can play with some of the [financial calculators here](http://www.dinkytown.net/financialcalculators.html), gives you a taste for compounding interest, etc.

7. Plan for the long term.  You are looking to save money for a house down payment, to start your own company, for retirement, etc.  Don't try to ""time the market"", just start saving.  

8. 99% of the fast buy / sell ""day trading"" strategies are BS.  If anyone tells you they know how to ""time the market"", they are full of it (and probably want to sell you financial product.)  

9. Want a better return than the bank CD, etc?  You will need to invest in the financial markets.  Go mutual funds.  It isn't worth your time to purchase into individual stocks (you probably don't have the financial / accounting background to analyze corporate accounting statements, etc. and many of the ""financial experts"" (especially the ones on TV) are more often wrong than right.  (If what they were saying was valuable information - they wouldn't be talking to you about it.)  With a mutual fund, you are paying for an expert to manage your money.  Unlike the talking heads on TV, he has skin in the game and he probably knows what he is doing.  What the fees - very important - only purchase ""no load"" funds, anything else and you are just giving the fund managers free cash.  Look at an index fund (that follows the broad financial market).  These are less risk (over the long term), and typically have very low fees.  You don't need to worry about getting into the exotic funds, they have their merits, but also have higher fees, etc.  Go to [Morningstar](http://screen.morningstar.com/FundSelector.html) and look at some of the 5 star domestic funds.  Any of these funds can be purchased with a Scottrade account or similar. 

10. If you end up having a financial advisory (some day, when your personal net worth is ... well ... more than it is today), try to get one that charges by the hour, or charges a flat fee.  Don't use one that makes money on sales commissions, because his only motivation is to churn your portfolio as often as possible.  (Again, the fees can kill your return.)  

11. Read.  Many books have been written on these topics; I can't do them justice here.  The better you understand finances, markets, etc. the better you will be to not get trapped in a bad deal.  ","1220257411"

Then, my grandmas rottweiler ran out the door and viciously chomped it on the side of the neck and shook with amazing ruthlessness. It went nonstop for a good 3 minutes.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly speaking, it varies. H264 compression is notorious for being computer intensive, which is a side affect of compressing so highly while having such good visual quality .

I would recommend a 2ghz Intel duo core 2 as being more than satisfactory in being able to handle all the kinds of difficult encodes.

You have to get a capable CPU, and shouldnt aim for minimum becuase there is no such ""bottom metric"" to measure against especially with 264. x264 is my preferred video codec, although some very knowledgeable people still use xvid/dx50/divx, but its fast becoming obsolete.

No, the criminal offence is *putting someone else* in fear of their life.

*Being* threatened or killed isn't a crime - *scaring* or *threatening* someone is.

&gt; A crime happens where the effect happens, otherwise at most it's just a victimless crime

Again, this is wrong.  Jsut because the victim is in another location doesn't mean the crime is ""victimless"".

[Victimless crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimless_crime) are crimes where *nobody* identifiably suffers, not crimes where the victim doesn't happen to be standing right next to the criminal.

Example: cross-border fraud or blackmail.  The victim is in another country or state, but he's still a victim.  A *victimless* crime would be something like prostitution, where both people get what they want (money and sex, respectively) but can still be arrested for the action.

I'd argue in the case of the shooting that the crime was *killing* or *threatening* someone, and that action was taken by the shooter, and hence the crime was committed in his location.

*Being* shot at or *being* killed is not a crime, so it doesn't make sense to say the crime was committed in the location of the victim.","1220257575"

And they have to live with the fact that there is competition for those jobs from people who are sometimes not at their desks. These other people have spent some years giving a lot of time and thought to other aspects of their lives, interacting with assorted medical and educational professionals while building their communication and leadership skills dealing with various young people, some with limited cognitive and speech abilities.  These people have dealt with a huge range of new experiences, coped with a variety of different bureaucracies and fought protracted battles to get the right solutions. They have decided that some problems need tackling by a group, and have spent untold hours serving their local PTA, learning how to sell suggestions to very mixed committees, how to manage volunteers who don't have any compulsion to do as you say, how to communicate effectively with school boards and experienced teachers who think they know it all.

Oddly enough, some employers do think that parents may have acquired useful extra skills that give added value over those who have never lifted their nose from their desk at work.

No, you fucktard. No one has ever said that. You're an idiot trying to put words in peoples' mouths. 

Try to keep your arguments straight. The whole point was about Wright's influence on Obama over twenty years, which easily relates even back to Michelle's own tendencies to black-liberation theology, demonstrated at college.

You're trying to say that one side = only saying ""God damn America"" and the other side = white supremacist, but as usual, you're mucking yourself up again. 

Black supremacy is no better than white supremacy, demotard. 

&gt;sorry that should have been spiritual advisor.

Actually, no, you remain incorrect. McCain rejected the endorsement of a Texas pastor who had made racist statements. Obama has twenty years of history with a black-supremacist pastor notorious for some of his statements - enough so that Obama has disowned him since it became a political issue.

Understand the difference? I suspect probably not.

&gt;Keep your arguments straight.

&gt;You told me he gave some advice to the imam and that you count that as ""being thrown under the bus"".

Idiot. I never identified that statement as his throwing Wright under the bus. I clearly stated that Obama disavowing Wright publicly was the throwing under the bus.

Haha...now you're back on the muslim trail...hope you realized just how much you fucked up in that last sentence there. Really, I have no idea why you started claiming Obama is Muslim anyway ;p

For crying out loud, you idiot, try pointing out where anyone has claimed that. And if that was the point, why did Obama abandon his pastor of twenty years, who even married he and Michelle? Your can't even match your arguments to your own candidate's values and actions.

HAHAHAHA...you're freaking hilarious, trying to pretend others have made arguments so that your own might have a better chance of working. That's awesome.

By the end of the day I'd been there 14 hours and had a blood test, so then they told me I needed an ultrasound but I couldn't have it until the next morning because it requires that you fast. 

I made an appointment for the next morning. Didn't eat anything (was told I couldn't even drink water after 10PM), went in for 8am, had the test and was told to check back in through emergency to get my results. I waited 6 hours to hear another tell me what the first doctor probably could have told me instantly during the ultrasound (it was done by a doctor, not a technician). By then it was around 3PM and I still hadn't eaten since 6PM the day before. I left after that, sure enough that if they were dicking me around that much I wasn't dying. 

I'm sure it varies greatly from province to province. Like the western provinces are probably reasonably fast... but here in Quebec going to the hospital is one huge joke.

I think a simple definition of ""god"" would be this: one that encompases all power and knowledge.  I like this definition because it gells with the universe/synonym concept.  The universe is one thing that encompases all knowledge and power.

Of course, this definition falls short of all the qualities people attribute to god.  Not to beat a dead horse, but it would be very difficult to adaquately define ""love"" in all its various forms.  Again, back to art, so much of which has love as its topic.  Art, through pictures, videos, and sound, is an abstract means of defining an abstract concept.  A good love song can communicate things about the definition of love that no prose could hope to achieve.

I think the best definition of god, now that it occurs to me, is as such: consider if the scientific universe is the left-brain method of describing and understanding the world around us, god is the right brained version.  One way to understand existance is through rules and logic; another method is through feelings and abstractions.

""Does god exists?"" therefore is rather absurd indeed.  However, ""is god true?"" perhaps remains more relevent.","1220258486"

No, idiot, you're making things up again so you can pretend you can argue. 

&gt;How come you are not comfortable with the idea that blacks should be liberated?

OK, I get it that you don't understand the English term ""black-liberation theology"" (probably neither ""black nationalism""), in addition to ""throwing under the bus"".

&gt;you mean when he gave him very sound advice about how to conduct himself in front of the media right?

You still haven't got that the two events were separate and occurred at different times? Why?

What's wrong with your comprehension?

&gt;Abandoned as in gave him some very sound advice right?

No, you're still all messed up. Honestly, do you really not get things, or do you just try to ignore points because you lack the ability to counter them?

&gt;I am still confused though. You hate the pastor because he said ""god damned america"" (you obviously hate everybody who criticizes america) and yet you hate obama because he ""threw the pastor under the bus"".

&gt;It seems like you should adore obama for throwing the pastor you hate under the bus.

&gt;Doesn't make sense.

Actually, I think you're the only one who seems to hold hatred for people. And from one of your other posts, it seems your English comprehension skills extend to thinking that hate comes from [sprouts](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6yq1m/sarah_palin_ten_reasons_to_vote_democrat/c058bbg). Very smart, you are.

So you think the lack of integrity to renounce a friendship you've sustained for over twenty years, just because things you've known about all along make it politically expedient, is a good thing?

At least we know integrity isn't something you require in a political leader, I guess.

&gt;Don't go around saying things like that. As much I think Mccain is an evil war pig who will destroy the country even I don't say he eats babies.

Yes you do. &lt;/practicing being malcontent&gt;

I suspect you probably do comprehend more than you appear to. Perhaps it's that you have no counterpoints, so you simply pretend arguments are different from what really have been made.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Did you even read my comment? Im *for* nudity for the most part, but offering up nudity with little context no context is basically saying ""oh hey kids our game has boobs in it lol, come buy it"". I mean age of conan for example: What the hell? The only nudity is with your own character breasts only when she is undressed and that is never if you play the game right? Where are the npc strippers! Where is the quest where your loot is stolen and you have to run around naked? Did you put nude breasts in their only for the kiddies? Why not the bottom half? 

See this is the underage thinking that plagues developers minds if they even consider adding nudity to the game and they need to get past it and to the next step: What can you do with nudity. 

Sex without context is meaningless. If you simply stared at breasts all day you would be considered immature as well. Sex needs a story, nudity needs a role other than attracting underage kids. Developers need to find the natural beauty in the human form and get past the hangups that you are describing.


I am a mature gaming and i will tell you someone flashing their tits in a game is immature and made for the underage. More nudity in games is a nice step but i do not want to stop there at the same level of mindless pornography, the same level as *girls gone wild*. 

Context! that's is what is needed! *Why* is the player flashing her tits? Is she going to get a reward for it? Is its a quest? Isn't that far more interesting that simple nudity made to attract virgin players? 

That's how you get nudity into games and it stays there: Through a narrative much like a book or movie. Make it important to be nude and you simply don't need to argue about maturity levels with soccer moms anymore. ","1220259252"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I'm curious as to the reason for your arbitrary selection of 'one' as opposed to many gods.

Also, in order for 'power' (in the human sense, as opposed to Energy over time ie Wattage) or even 'knowledge' to have any meaning, don't you have to imply some kind of agency?  This immediately deviates from the impersonal 'god is everything' proposed earlier.

Also, I shouldn't avoid pointing out that defining something doesn't necessitate its existence. For example, the 'midget balancing on my little finger' is, by definition, balancing on my finger, even though there is no such midget.  In the same way, your definition seems to presume that some agent has all power and knowledge, a claim I find absurd in the absence of evidence.

&gt; ""Does god exists?"" therefore is rather absurd indeed. However, ""is god true?"" perhaps remains more relevent.

So don't use compilers - their compile time assertions aren't present in the production code, and as we just learned, that's a mistake.

Edit: Why are people downvoting me?  Static typechecking is a form of assertion, that most compilers compile out.  I have seen plenty of bugs where a statically typesafe program had a type error introduced at runtime that was only caught because of runtime type checking.  I was not joking about that part.

The ""don't use compilers"" line was facetious, of course, but it demonstrates the absurdity of a blanket ""on/off"" decision.  Whether a particular assertion should be active in deployment or not depends on that assertion - its performance, its importance, etc.","1220259306"

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","""I loved coke. I never did a lot, just a little bit at parties,"" said Mirren. ""But what ended it for me was when they caught Klaus Barbie, the Butcher of Lyon, in the early 80s. He was hiding in South America and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron. And I read that in the paper, and all the cards fell into place and I saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this fucking horrible man in South America.""

refresh my memory of history:

In 1947, Barbie became an agent for the 66th Detachment of the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC).[2] In 1951, he fled to Juan Peron's Argentina with the help of a ratline organized by the Ustashi Roman Catholic priest Krunoslav Draganović. Asked by Barbie why he was going out of his way to help him escape, Draganovic responded, ""We have to maintain a sort of moral reserve on which we can draw in the future.""[3] He then emigrated to Bolivia, where he lived under the alias Klaus Altmann. Testimony of Italian insurgent Stefano Delle Chiaie before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism suggests that Barbie took part in the ""Cocaine Coup"" of Luis García Meza Tejada, when the regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980.

EDIT:

While in Bolivia, Barbie managed a company that diverted Belgian and Swiss arms to Israel while Israel was still under a post-1967 war international arms embargo. ""A report in the Israeli press alleges that Barbie also had frequent dealings with Israel concerning supplies of Israeli arms to Latin American countries and 'various underground organizations'"" (from Wikipedia)

Under the current economic circumstances though it's very hard to tell what would be best. You should definitely stay away from anything denominated in dollars. Real estate may still be an option, although you may want to wait another 2-3 years for the elusive rock bottom. I save my surplus cash in my employer's stock matching plan which still pays off even if stocks drop as much as 50%. I also pay off some of my highest-interest debt (4% per annum variable), as the central bank might decide to hike rates again in the future. I don't have that much extra since I got married and had a child, we're living on one income for now.

I don't think I would feel better in a newer or better car. It's just a car. So I rather save and invest. Neither do I buy many expensive clothes, when I do buy something it's usually fairly expensive, because their textile feels better on my skin, but I buy them very rarely because I don't like going shopping, so my clothes are, although expensive, are very worn and used.  Neither do I get a haircut more often than twice a year, I just don't like wasting my time on things like that. Do you think all that moola in the bank attracts women? No, because my lifestyle is simply not that kind. 

OTOH you could have a negative net worth (so practically dirt poor) but still attract women if you buy a nice car and clothes on credit and go to places.

--I agree, but telling somebody that your position is superior to someone else's position, *when we are talking about something that cannot be tested*, is just arrogant.  Your example of round earth vs. flat earth can be proven beyond any doubt, so that doesn't apply.  A supreme being, on the other hand, cannot.  So I agree that it's ok to tell someone that their position is faulty when it can be proven without any doubt.  But come on, man, you're honestly going to sit there and say ""I'm right about God, your position is wrong..."" like you have all the answers about the universe and existence, and then tell me you're not acting like an arrogant ass?

2)  You say:  ""If you're not interested in determining the truth about reality, and you truly don't care about determining what is likely to be true then sure, to you, one belief is as good as another.""

--No, no, no.  Such an arrogant ass.  You think you are the only one seeking the truth about reality?  Why are you making assumptions about me, assuming that I'm not interested / don't care?  I think you're just trolling now.  

3)  You say:  ""I want the belief system that gives the best shot of telling me what is true about the world, and on that criteria, unjustified beliefs are wrong.

--That's what everybody else wants too, chief.  We all want the system that gives us the best shot at truth.  *I* want a system that gives me the best shot at truth, which is why I hold the position that I cannot rule out existence or nonexistence.  ...But do you hear me calling *your* beliefs as inferior to mine?

4)  It's really just as simple as I posted above:

You choose to be atheist because you don't believe god exists.

Theists choose to be theists because they believe god does exist.

I choose to be neither because I consider both options to be reasonable options.


Now, I could sit here and tell you that you are just WRONG (like you are to me), but that would only make me look like the arrogant ass.  Why?  Because you know damn well that I cannot absolutely prove you to be wrong.  Just like you know damn well that you can't absolutely prove that I'm wrong.

I don't know about anyone else, but I prefer to use a language with GC and data types that are higher level than ""bytes"" and ""machine addresses"" because doing so frees me to think more about solving problems external to the code.  My personal language of choice is Python, but the same rationale would apply for using Scheme, Common Lisp, Ruby, Haskell, Groovy, O'Caml, or any number of other languages.

All of those languages give you the ability to write extensions in C if, somehow, you can't get good enough performance in the language itself.  I've done it for Python, and it's not that hard -- even the ""remembering to type free"" bit.  A part of it, though, is because by the time I've sat down to write a C extension to do X, I've already tried writing it in Python, so, while I'm coding my C extension, I can think more about the coding process and less about the process of ""doing X.""

I don't think this applies in general, perhaps more in her profession, and maybe also a bit depending on which years you grew up in. I can definitely tell that people won't look down on women that happened to be blonde with perhaps a large chest where I went to university. This ""myth"" seriously sounds pretty alien to me in real life, and more something I would see in a highschool movie. I've met a good number of lucky attractive women that were both intelligent and treated as such.

Heck, some may even have had an easier time, because people are often happier to hire good looking people for certain jobs (customer relations etc), and after getting to know them, see they're intelligent and good at their jobs too. Lowered barried of entry, in other words.

If she's intelligent but with an extremely outgoing personality bordering on ""shallow"" that doesn't make it look like she's intellectual to people who don't know her, then that's an entirely different subject altogether. But then the looks shouldn't be blamed, although that can be welcoming. I have at least one friend that is a bit like this; I'd never expect her to be who she is after having had just a quick talk to her at a party.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;And the minarchist state is a fantasy that is wholly unrealistic.

I disagree. I think a functioning minarchist society could exist, so long as the following criteria for the government are met:

* It must extremely local. If it serves any more than 20 or 30 thousand people, democracy becomes unresponsive and worthless.

* It must be (small 'd') democratic and (small 'r') republican in nature, with an a judiciary and legislature that are independent from the executive, and each other.

* It must be bound by a written constitution, directing, in clear and unambiguous language, that the government's singular function is to defend the negative (i.e., property) rights of the citizens it serves. This constitution must explicitly guarantee the inviolable rights of property (e.g., freedom of speech, religion, movement, etc.), and the equal protection of all citizens.

* The populous must be well armed. No restriction on citizens' arms of any kind should exist.

&gt;You shouldn't apply your crude reductionist reasoning to cultural phenomena and call them natural. Production is a rather loose term that does not accuratly describe the life of a sea star or a bacteria, not to mention higher animals like cats and goats. It would not be correct to say that any of those organisms needs to ""produce"" to survive. There are virtually no parallels between a goat and a factory that would permit reasonable use of the word ""productive"".

You are using far too narrow a definition of the word 'productive.' In a purely physiological sense, nothing really 'produces' anything, as it is not possible to make something from nothing. To be 'productive' one must simply improve something into a state where it can be more useful. In a creature as simple as bacteria, its own digestion may be the extent of its 'productive' behavior, as it breaks down the proteins and such that it needs to survive and reproduce. In higher animals, such as cats or goats (or humans), this productive effort may be much more involved. In order to survive, each of these creatures must, at a minimum, find and ingest food and water. In this way, both goats and factories are similarly productive, regardless of whether or not the objective of the productive behavior may be fairly dissimilar. This is as much a ""cultural phenomenon"" as is gravity. It isn't, it's **reality**, as it has always existed.

&gt;Wage slavery is a problem because no alternative exists. The system has developed to a point where no comparable alternative exists. One may not merely withdraw from their lifestyle and live a comparable one elsewhere under their own effort.

There is always a choice. If you don't like the level of compensation you're receiving, you can seek employment elsewhere. If you truly can't find another job (which is quite improbable in a developed economy), then you probably need to either become self-employed, or improve your skills to make yourself more valuable to a potential employer. And I'm sure you can give me a sob hypothetical about a single mother working to support her five children, and how she has no time to work to improve herself. But then, is she not more accurately ""a slave"" to the reality of her situation, and not the person who employs her, allowing her the ability to feed her children?

&gt;But, I do suppose that you could merely call it ""natural"" and right it off--it happens that the same argument works well for slavery and racism as well.

That's a pretty idiotic thing to accuse. Slavery (the authentic sort, not the abstract ""I am a slave to my *voluntary* employment"" sort) is the most unnatural, repugnant, and patently anti-free market, anti-liberal invention in the history of mankind. Did you forget already that liberalism (just always assume I'm speaking of ""classic liberalism"") is grounded in the assertion that each man has unconditional ownership over himself, and that this right of property is inviolable? (To head you off before you go there, American slavery was enabled by the, at that time, widespread belief that certain peoples were 'less-than-human'--*this* was a ""cultural phenomenon"", one that has long since been rectified.) This hard definition of rights is non-arbitrary and non-negotiable, **unlike Marxism, which quite literally has men working involuntarily for the benefit of others**. Now what does that remind you of...

And **racism is an collectivist impulse**. Libertarianism, being a firmly *individualist* philosophy, rejects this ignorant and self-defeating nonsense outright.

&gt;Theft is non-violent, violence is violent. Theft via violence is violent, because it involves violence. Theft is not inherently violent. Your model means that all property claims are legitimate and all theft is unjustifiable. Neither assumption is true.

In liberal philosophy, a man's property is an extension of himself, by virtue of that property being acquired through his productive effort. A violation of a man's property is a violation of his person. If you claim ownership of something that was gained through the labor of someone else, have you not just exploited that labor, and, in essence, turned it into forced labor? In any event, what one finds ""legitimate"" will be based on one's own philosophy, so to say any of what I'm saying is ""illegitimate"", is more than a little bit pretentious.

&gt;So trickle down finally works! Except for the fact that it really doesn't.

""Trickle down"" is, much like ""wage slavery"", a sensationalist term meant to discredit an idea without having to argue an actual point against it, much less think critically and logically about economics. You have hidden behind your chosen terminology so that you may make an assertion and make absolutely no attempt to back that assertion up. Even the most rabid Keynesians admit that investment drives growth. This isn't some crackpot idea, it's Econ 101.

&gt;Investing in ""stocks, bonds, etc."" as well as putting it in banks makes capital available to other wealthy individuals, not to all people.

No, investing in banks makes capital available to anyone who will, at some point, have the ability to pay it back. That includes ordinary people. Investing in ""stocks, bonds, etc."" makes capital available to business owners to create jobs, also for ordinary people.

&gt;Investment that helps everyone is social investment, like building roads and schools

It's easy to generalize and say that roads and schools ""benefit everyone"", but do they benefit us all by simple virtue of them being roads and schools? Or does it make a difference what, where, and how they are used? Does a billion dollar bridge to an island of a hundred people in Alaska ""benefit everyone""? Do public schools, that fail to instill a basic understanding of math, science, english, and economics in students, and that teach shameful misrepresentations of history bordering on propaganda, ""benefit everyone""? If parents didn't pay so much in taxes to the public school system, they might be able to afford to send their children to get a quality education. Instead their property is squandered by the state and their incompetent and politically-motivated economic planners, all so  the children can receive a second-rate education. But these are the all-too-familiar consequences of resources being allocated by bureaucrats instead of consumers.

&gt;The rising tide may lift all boats, but not all equally. You will notice that despite your Utopian dream of investment to help everyone, income inequality in the past three decades in the US has risen, not to mention contrasts between wages in the industrialized and third worlds.

You said it yourself, ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" That they all don't rise equally is utterly irrelevant. Equality isn't the goal. Those who are more productive *should* do better. That's where the incentive lies to be a productive member of society. The same studies that show a the rising gap between ""rich"" and ""poor"", if you look at the data, show that the ""poor"" have made monumental gains and are far better off than they were thirty years ago, regardless of what gains the ""rich"" may have made. **Percentages tell you nothing about the size of the pie**. So the envious class warfare rhetoric becomes not about ""helping poor people"", but about punishing those who have done better. Economic equality is poverty for all.

And your mention of the plight of the third world (and your implicit suggestion that capitalism is the culprit) is equally obtuse. The developing (third world) economies that have embraced some level of economic liberalization (e.g., China, India, etc.), indeed, the very countries your ilk accuses the west of exploiting for ""slave labor"" and other such nonsense, have experiences astounding economic growth in recent decades, lifting literally hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty.","1220262093"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;I did not make the story of Jean Valjean

I never said you did.

&gt;if you to criticize this example, find why it is unrealistic before you make a blanket statement about all hypothetical or abstract situations. The play is not unrealistic, and even if it were, it still sheds light on the underlying cultural principles that play into the system.

While I think Les Misérables was as much a critique on *government* as anything else, it doesn't effectively prove anything. The scenario is fabricated every step of the way. Hugo first invents the ""victims"" of capitalism, Valjean and his family (regardless of whether or not you could really call the economic system in France at that time entirely 'capitalistic'). He invents the notion that none of the many wealthy people in this ""capitalist"" society is willing to voluntarily assist Valjean and his family in their troubles, so he is forced to steal. He then invents the motivation for the crime, that Valjean must steal a loaf of bread to feed his family. And, finally, he invents the draconian punishment for said crime, five years in prison. (For the sake of relevance, let's pretend that the story is framed in present day.) Never mind that, in reality, Valjean would be just as  likely to be impoverished, not because he and his family were ""victimized"" by evil capitalists, but because of their own poor economic choices. Never mind that, in reality, Valjean would have likely found the voluntary assistance of a generous individual or any one of the many thousands charities and aid organizations in existence. Never mind that Valjean would have never received such a stiff sentence, had he been truly just trying to save his family from starvation. What if instead of to feed his family, Valjean stole in order to support his meth habit, or because he gambled away his life savings? Would the theft have been justified then? The point is, if you invent the reality as you go along, you can make it say anything you like. Les Misérables is fiction, it ""sheds light"" on nothing.

&gt;So you criticize a hypothetical situation for being hypothetical and then respond with an unproven blanket statement that easily fails your own standards you apply to my argument? I will cite Ted Turner as a good example of this.

Your one example doesn't disprove what I said. I was careful to qualify my statement to include exceptions. In a free society, you will always have those who do things you disagree with and/or are irrational, but this *is* the exception, not the rule.

&gt;But to say that it fails to provide a framework to encourage charity. It is based on egoism and encourages egoism--quite the opposite of charity.

And, yet, charity still occurs everyday, without coercion. I guess when given the option human beings can *choose for themselves* to do the right thing.

&gt;Why bother at all if that is your viewpoint.

Because I'm not looking to create an egalitarian fantasy utopia, I'm looking to create (or rather, unleash) a functional society.

&gt;Yet, there is enough land and water and the such (if properly allocated) to sustain a population.

As I explained before, without pricing signals, there is no way for resources to be properly allocated. This is the major inherent failure in socialism and other forms of central economic planning.

&gt;&gt;Self-interest does not preclude collective action, so long as this action is perceived to be in the best interest of each individual.

&gt;That sentence contradicts itself.

No, actually, it doesn't.

&gt;If it is ultimately the individual that matters and determines everything and is the organizational unit of society, then the collective needn't enter into the system at all.

If cooperative action is in the interest of the individual then why would self-interest prevent him from cooperating? Your objection makes no sense. Are you suggesting that the only time that people are capable of working together toward a common goal is when they are coerced to do so?

&gt;If you're going to talk about Smith then you should at least make your arguments congruent with his. Smith talked alot about competition and collusion. Cooperation and mutualism represent collusion, a big no-no to Smith.

I form my own opinions. I don't rely entirely on the wisdom of others. I paraphrased Smith because it was relevant to my point. I'd quote Marx if I thought he ever wrote anything worth quoting. In any event, Smith made no argument, that I'm aware of, against cooperation, or ""collusion"" as you've called it, between private individuals or businesses. His argument was against the collusion between *government* and business, as occurs constantly in this country today (mainly through taxation/subsidization and regulation, under the pretense of ""restraining"" business).

&gt;One does not choose to eat, they choose to survive, and thus the choice to buy food is non-trivial.

Economics is survival. That's why it so important that maximum economic growth is allowed to continue and capital is allowed to be allocated properly. Capitalism fulfills these objectives, socialism fails miserably.","1220262143"

Alister Mcgrath, as pointed out on other comments on this page, side steps most of the questions that Dawkins asks, rather like listening to a politician at times. After all, they ARE questions that you CANT answer with faith alone and Mcgrath tries very hard to rely on the understanding of his faith to give him the answers... and as a consequence he trips up over his own points quite a bit. He seems smart enough to under this though, and perhaps that is why he tries to keep his answers as vague as possible - giving him to room for re-adjustments as Dawkins presses harder for solid answers.

There is one point I would like to make though. I don’t thinks it is 100% fair to arbitrarily label people such as atheist/theist when they have committed 'evil deeds'. I don’t thinks that gets us anywhere. Perhaps it is better to say... Religious texts can provide people with the contexts they need to justify 'evil deeds' and atheists have no religious texts to aid them in such things (and perhaps that is the difference). But I think the point most of us miss here is that you have to be pretty-fucking-mental in the first place if you want to do them.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Well, if inflation is higher than expected, debtors benefit at the expense of creditors. If it's lower, the reverse happens. Of course, anyone who holds large amounts of currency would lose.

That's only the case if already existing money is lent and the amount of money-supply is not expanded in order to lend newly created money.

In the current banking system however, the money that is lent is created anew from the signature on a 'promissory note' - a type of negotiable instrument that is ""accepted for value"" by the banker and credited to the borrower's account.  Before that, this money was not in existence, and so they lose nothing.  

The newly created credit is lent as debt to be repaid with compound interest, and as such, it is the bank that benefits from the lending of money in the long run.

It is also true that as the money-supply is inflated through this mechanism as more and more new money is lent into existence, then the currency is gradually debased and devalued, and if the rate of money-supply inflation is greater than the rate of increase in productivity, then we will perceive general price inflation.

As each unit of currency loses its 'worth' from this money-supply inflation, then anyone holding capital savings or reserves in this currency will have its total 'worth' devalued over time, and those that have debt will also have their debt devalued, and so they owe less as long as the rate of money-supply inflation minus the rate of productivity increase is greater than the compound interest rate the borrower has to pay on the loan.

It is not the banks that suffer as they lose nothing from lending out new money, and in a 9:1 fractional reserve banking system, in order to create and lend $10,000, by law they have to hold in reserves $1,111.11.  But the banks can then draw up a second negotiable instrument on the loan (a derivative) and sell this on to other investors to raise money in order to lend more money at a rate of 9:1 over their reserves.

It probably costs the US more to fly than them.  They are just increasing the US rate of consumption.  Just like how Ronald Reagan screwed them in the 80s. 


It costs about twice as much fuel to run a  tu-95 vs a f-22, but that f22 only has a range of about 600 miles without help.  That help rapidly expands the operating costs. 


The video from the Russian cockpit was telling.   The tu-95s were going slow, basically laughing at the US planes.   Sure the f-22 has supper cruse, the bear can still get with launch distance of targets.  It's $160-300M USD up against a prop plane that the Ukrane was selling for $20M USD in 2000 for debt forgiveness, and that was designed in the 1950s.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Well I'm telling you from actual real-world experience that it *is* a problem.
Games don't have nice performance hotspot patterns. *Everything* is performance critical. Our development configuration runs at around 15-20Hz here, while the release version runs at 30Hz.

Paying that cost only to have a marginally nicer ""total failure"" experience isn't worth it. Why let 100% of your customers experience bad framerates (or crappier games tech), just so that the 1% who actually get a crash has a slightly nicer experience in that one instance (where they have to restart from the last savegame no matter what we do anyway)?

In some apps a few percent difference in performance may not be a big deal and the tradeoff is different, but there are cases where performance is directly related to your sales (games that run better look better, and that usually means they sell better), while the ""niceness"" of total failures don't matter one bit (do you really care if you get a message box telling you that the game just crashhed?

"science","t5_mouw","At some point, I'd like to try to make my own diesel fuel. In addition to the vegetable oil that would be required, there are a few other chemicals, the next most important of which is methanol.

This can be purchased, of course, and certainly I intend to do so during my first experiments (which will be delayed long enough that I can be certain that I will be able to handle the stuff as carefully as it deserves to be).

My ideal target would be for 1000 gallons a year, as I figure this is the upper limit that I might require. I'd expect to fall short of that for quite awhile.

Now, such a target isn't simple... depending on what I grow, I could need as many as 10 acres. Some sort of oil press would need to be purchased, and these can easily run several thousand dollars. Additionally, a small building would be required, storage tanks, and several other things besides.

For 1000 gallons, what I'm reading suggests that I could need as much as 250 gallons of methanol. This is not a trivial amount.

Is there any method or process by which a person could conceivably manufacture this much?

On the one hand, it would seem that a person could make it in the manner employed before 1920. The destructive distillation of wood, I believe it is called.

However, it remains unclear exactly what would be needed for this. I understand the basics of it, you essentially make charcoal out of the wood, while capturing the gases that cook off of it. The charcoal itself would be a nice byproduct of the procedure, that's a bonus.

But in addition to methanol, several other nasty chemicals boil off of it too. Short of hiring a handful of chemical engineers and building a full plant, is it possible to do this?

And, how much wood are we talking, to get 250 gallons? Are any other consumable materials or reagents required? It makes little sense to be able to make methanol, only to turn around and purchase yet another thing which I can't easily make myself.

Alternatively, I believe that I might manage to produce small amounts of natural gas (60/40 methane/carbon dioxide). However, what little I can find on this method of methanol production suggests that it is even more complicated than the previous. Expensive catalysts, 5-10 atmospheres of pressure, extremely high temperatures...

Just interested in speculation about what might be possible. All those that ask ""why would you want to"" or ""couldn't you just buy it""... I might be persuaded to answer, but only after I've gotten my own.","1220264600"
"politics","t5_2cneq","Now, imagine for a second you're Karl Rove. You got Bush into office on the Fundie vote, and you won Ohio and thus the race in '04 on Fundies who went to the polls to vote against gay marriage. You, Karl, know that you're not winning in '08: the long term models (Lichtman, etc.) say you won't, the '06 vote says you won't, the several dozen Republicans holding state-wide or Federal offices who won't be showing up at the Republican Convention says you won't.

And while you, Karl, have won on the backs of the Fundies, the Fundies don't really trsut you anymore. David Kuo, your token Fundie, described how you (Karl) and other White House political bosses laughed at and mocked Christians and Christianity. John DiIulio, Bush's Director of Faith-Based... Initiatives said the same thing. The Fundies are starting to feel used, and the smarter Fundies have begun to realize that subordinating Jesus to the needs of a political party debase Jesus. And that that's why polls of young people show they see Christianity as not about Jesus, or the crucification, or the Sermon on the Mount, but as a religion primarily preoccupied with persecuting gays.

You (Karl) have an problem: you know John McCain's gonna lose, and lose bad. You've never liked the guy anyway; you dragged his daughter through the mud to win the South Carolina primary in 2000. And your crack force of Christian Fundamentalist voters is waking up to realization they've been used.

So Karl's gonna make that problem an opportunity: saddle John McCain, who is going to lose anyway, with a token Fundie Christian running mate.

This is genius, for several reasons:

1. in 2012, you (Karl) can tell the Fundies that the Republican Party does respect them, the Palin candidacy proves it,

2. but the atheistic Communist liberals lynched her because she was a Christian.

3. Fundies love believing that they are a persecuted minority ""just like"" the 1st Century Christians, a small remnant hewing at great personal cost to the flickering flames of the truth they painfully but joyously carry like embers in their mouths. A ""martyred"" Palin fits right into this narrative, and ties ""suffering minority for Jesus"" meme to the ""suffering minority Republican"" meme, further cementing Fundies to a Republican Party that uses and despises them.

4. But it also gives Karl and his people an excuse not to put up a Fundie in 2012, allowing them to maintain control of the Party in the face of loose cannon and heir-apparent Mike Huckabee (who will either deal with Karl and get the nod, or buck Karl and get shafted),

5. By saying privately to the non-Fundie Republicans that the Fundie base is back under control and will vote for whatever oligarch, emplaced by Karl, who will throw them a few worthless crumbs.

6. It sidelines Palin, who was opposed to the Rove-backed corrupt or nepotistic Alaska Republican politicians. She'll win a place in the Fundie's hearts, but she'll never win another state-wide office.

By putting a not ready for national politics Fundie into a sure-loss race, Karl gets to: further fuck over McCain, and demonstrate to any other potential maverick that mavericks get knee-capped; throw a sop to the Fundies; and keep the Fundies hating ""the Libs"" over the 2008 loss, rather than questioning what the Republicans are really doing *for* Fundie goals.

Pure genius, and the Fundies will never even know that they've once again been used and tossed aside.

That's because you should be able to use [Google](http://www.google.com.ph/search?q=obama+disavows+wright&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a).

So you're not really familiar with the word integrity either then?

Ok. Good for you. You're hilariously tragic. Desperate to think you can argue points, but missing the simplest, most obvious things. 

Here, for the more simple people present (that's you, buddy, just to make sure you understand):

For the first while, despite Wrights utterances (after all, Obama's been listening to these sermons for 20 years): 

&gt;*""'I can no more disown [Wright] than I can disown my white grandmother,'' who loved and sacrificed for him but feared black men and ""more than once has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe,'' Obama said.*

However...later...Obama decides it's no longer good for his election chances:

&gt;Senator Barack Obama, saying that he'd had enough, forcefully repudiated his former pastor today and declared that racially charged remarks made by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. contradict ""all that I stand for.""

&gt;Obama said he had tried to give Wright ""the benefit of the doubt,"" but decided to disavow Wright after the minister's nationally televised appearance on Monday reignited a lingering controversy on the eve of two crucial Democratic presidential primaries.

What happened to ""throw under the bus""?

Integrity? What does disagreeing with a friend have to do with integrity?

I see nothing wrong with what you quoted. I honestly don't understand why somebody would get their panties in a wad about those quotes. They are perfectly sensible.


Since I am trying to understand where your hatred of obama, wright, and black liberation is coming from let's try this format.

1) What's wrong with saying ""god damn america"".

2) Why should Obama be held responsible for something somebody else has said.

3) Are you still friends with everybody who was your friend twenty years ago.

4) Have you ever disagreed with anything any of your friends have said.

5) What's your problem with black liberation. Do you still believe blacks should not be liberated. Do you believe blacks should not seek liberties.

"science","t5_mouw","I find it sad that the Reddit population seeks confirmation bias on this and many issues. Basically we just don't know yet. As with many scientific advances we do not yet have the ability to predict all the possible outcomes.
[Telegraph article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1687491.ece) drawing on studies that suggest there may be a link.
[Another article](http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/news/20050901_neuroma.asp), referencing the actual studies, also pointing to the increasing incidents of certain types of brain cancer.

When we started burning coal and oil, there was no evidence that it would cause global warming, [first suggested in 1824]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier#Discovery_of_greenhouse_effect), but there is now strong evidence to support this claim.  Just because something is supported by anecdotal evidence, does not mean that it is not true, just that it is not evidence, it is often a good starting point for a well-conducted study. 

Personally I don’t like mobiles much, simply because of how they interfere with the few peaceful times I find in a day, so I only use them when they are really useful, such as when meeting someone and lost. I and keep it switched off the rest of the time.

Actually, your statement is incorrect. Nicotine in itself is not carcinogenic. It's a natural part of the human body. 

&gt;The carcinogenity of tobacco smoke is not explained by nicotine per se, which is not carcinogenic or mutagenic.

And who's to say those things you mentioned don't cause cell phones? Cancer is the top 3 killer in the USA.

Also, do you wear the transmitter of those items right next to your head for minutes, hours at a time? Nope, like you said, the two aren't even comparable.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Gosh. You really don't pick up on things people say, do you? 

The issues have been pointed out pretty clearly, more than once. But I think for you to concede that is to concede that you're unable to argue against them, and have to resort to flailing around to distract from that fact. 

Try researching the phrase ""throw under the bus"". Hope that helps. 

The only person here who seems to have hatred is you yourself. Stop projecting. 

If you find nothing wrong with saying ""God damn America"" then good for you. It was apparent some people do, and even Obama said it was an unacceptable sort of statement. 

&gt;2) Why should Obama be held responsible for something somebody else has said.

For fucks sake, do we really need to cover all this ground again? Back read, demotard.

&gt;3) Are you still friends with everybody who was your friend twenty years ago.

Once again, you're showing your lack of comprehension. There is no twenty year gap here sorry. I think you messed up there.

&gt;5) What's your problem with black liberation. Do you still believe blacks should not be liberated. Do you believe blacks should not seek liberties.

We've already covered that you're misunderstanding language again, and that you don't seem to understand the difference between black nationalistic and supremacy-based ""black liberation"" theology, vs the liberation of blacks from slavery. 

In fact, being the slightly slow fellow you seem to be, you probably never realised it was Christians who fought for over 30 years to free blacks from slavery - the first abolition of slavery in recorded human history. 

What is apparent is that you just seem to lack the ability to track arguments made and respond to them with counter-arguments. You seem to think that jumping around, issuing ultimatums (""Find me this, I can't use google - if not, your point can't be true"") is a valid way of responding. 

I'm sorry you can't seem to manage this. Perhaps as you grow older and leave your teens behind you'll get better at this.

BTW, how about those sprouts? You still have hate-filled sprouts in your garden? LOL...what a retard.","1220268007"

Parental responsibility compels parents to support their children, regardless of gender. If a father has custody, the mother pays child support.  If the mother has custody, the father pays it.

A fetus, before being born, is different.  The reason that a woman has the right to end a pregnancy is that it's her body. If men got pregnant, they would be entitled to this right as well.

Now, if I had to name a game that I absolutely love playing the moment I see it, it'd be Mario Bros. 3. It was and always will be a game that is enjoyable from the start to the end - I've never gotten tired of starting the game all over again because of losing all my lives in the last world. Yeah, the game can be so painstakingly hard in the end! 

Even my little brother, now seven years old, enjoys playing it even though he knows that a variety of other games exist on other much newer platforms as well. For him, it is something that he can share with his friends. For me though, it was a real buddy when I wasn't with my real friends (which consisted of a large portion of my life). Even the soundtrack is something that you can listen to for a long period! Truly a game you can love.

March 2008:  Alaska newspapers report that the Governor is pregnant, surprising many in the state and leading a few to conclude that she was too skinny to actually be pregnant.

As weeks went by, the pregnancy became more visible, and this was no surprise to people in Alaska at the time.

April 2008:  The governor is now too fat to ignore.  She goes down to Texas for a governor's meeting and notices a slight trickle of clear fluid.  She calls her doctor who tells her it's probably a slight amniotic fluid leak, which is common but may mean the baby needs to be delivered within 24 hours, but since she isn't going into labor she can fly back to Alaska.

She flies back to Alaska.  Still no labor.  She goes to her doctor who tells her they will need to deliver the baby due to the amniotic fissure.  Labor is induced at 6:30 the next morning.  The baby weighs 6 pounds.

Three days later she returns to work, again surprising the people of Alaska.  The fact that she didn't show for so long, and returned to work so quickly, leads some to suspect she did not in fact have a child.

Months later:

Idiots on the Internet catch wind of the rumors, and start downloading photos like mad, accusing Sarah of not showing her pregnancy (which she did) and accused Bristol of showing a pregnancy (two years before the baby was born).

Not to be deterred, idiots online try to feed the rumor (which should have pretty much died by now) by saying that maybe a pregnant suit was used.

People seem to continue to ignore the fact that to pull of such an incredibly bold stunt (for a sitting Governor) would require the complete and total assistance of:

The family (including the dejected pregnant teen daughter)
The doctor
All the nurses

Moreover, it seems totally reasonable that instead of a 44 year-old woman giving birth to a child with Down's Syndrome, it was in fact a 16 year-old girl.

So, we have:

Old woman gives birth to an underweight baby with Down's Syndrome.

vs.

Teenager gets pregnant with a baby with Down's Syndrome, hatches plan with mom to pretend she is the pregnant one.  Mom fakes pregnancy for over a month.  Mom rushes home early from a conference in order to pretend to give birth to a child which is actually being birthed by her daughter in a private room of a hospital with doctors and nurses all sworn to secrecy.  Mom assumes the child and pretends it is her own (presumably for the rest of her life).

The authors are all affliliated with the Department of Pharmacognosy, The School of Pharmacy, University of London, and the book was commissioned by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in response to the many questions they were fielding on herbal medicines from practicing pharmacists. This is not a book that will interest most lay people as it is quite technical in its approach to the topic. The book, however, is very readable, despite being technical. It is organized around 141 monographs on individual medicinal plants. Each monograph includes species, synonyms, parts used, availability of other pharmaceutical monographs, legal category of product (in Great Britain), constituents, food use, herbal use, pharmacological actions, side effects &amp; toxicity, contraindications &amp; warnings, a pharmaceutical comment from the authors, and references.

What's wrong with being black and nationalistic?

Of course you won't provide any proof but it will be fun to watch you squirm.

So what's your problem with black liberation being preached at a christian church?

I just want you to back your claims. Calling somebody a black supremacist is a serious charge and you ought to provide ample proof.

When we start relying on drugs to do our parenting for us, to keep us happy, give us sexual drive, to make us sleep, to change our behaviour without finding the underlying cause, we'll just grow more and more dependent on them. Medication might help battle people's 'disorders', but there may be other, better ways of doing that then pills. But people are lazy, and the medical industry knows it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I think that gems/eggs/whatever should be trying to solve the problem ""how do I easily specify for language X any necessary build steps and dependencies in a common format""?  That way they can be machine-translated to the operating system's native package format, maybe using their own hack/stub for operating systems like Windows and OS X that don't have good package support.

&gt; RPM, dpkg, ports, etc are all platform-dependent.

Those define the platform more than they are dependent on it.  pkgsrc, NetBSD's ports, works on GNU/Linux, Solaris, and maybe even Cygwin.  Debian builds FreeBSD with dpkg.

&gt; This is by design, because the same system needs to be flexible enough to install anything from a boot loader to web browser and accurately resolve any dependencies between them.
&gt;
&gt; In contrast, CPAN, Ruby gems, and Python eggs are designed to solve a different problem -- cross-platform distribution of simple packages with few or no dependencies. They don't care what OS you're running, as long as you have the appropriate language runtime installed.

You need the full stack.  Example: C library bindings.  You can express the dependency 'I need foo-1.2', but the best you can do in one of these language-specific package management systems is abort the installation with an error telling the user which package to find.   That sucks!  I have this wonderful tools available to me, be it apt, RPM, ports, or whatever, and I'm back to manually fetching dependencies!

The worse option is to package the C library in your special package file.  Not only are you poorly reinventing your system's package manager, but you're also installing an extra version of the library, and given how stupid some of these are, you're likely to damage your system.","1220269433"

Suppose Religion A allowed effective sex education, contraception, abortion, free thought, and didn't want you to teach the religion to your children until they were the age of consent. Religion B only allows ineffective sex education, no contraception, no abortions, no thinking, and forces children to learn if from Day 1.

Which religion will be more ""reproductively successful"", meaning will spread the fastest and take over the larger population of religious people? Obviously Religion B.

Now consider that both religions started out the same, but the above issues each got introduced as local mutations of the religion. It's simple natural selection of religious memes.

I suspect that's why the U.S. mutations of Christianity spread so much within that population (of religious people) and why the particular ""sins"" that Fundies hold closely all seem to result in more children despite their expressed beliefs that, in their own minds, should reduce unwanted/teen pregnancies.

I would have to disagree with this statement. Coffee first became popular in the United States during the Revolutionary War, which was over 200 years ago. Its popularity grew and by the time of the Civil War, it was an everyday drink. Folgers, the largest US manufacturer of coffee, and Maxwell House both date back to the late 1800's.

To behavior to be immoral, it must be self-consciously within the scope of morality but not abide by its edicts. This is not how these people behave. These people don't feel that they are doing wrong. 

Generally speaking, tribal morality like this, is prescriptive. It imposes the norms of the collective on the individual. Tribal norms are more or less arbitrary and culturally dependent.

&gt;Being buried alive is cruel and barbaric, and customs and moral codes need to evolve or perish.

I agree with you. I disagree with the notion that you can call these people immoral, this would imply that Pashtun people (ca 40 million people) are just criminals you could put into jail or kill. If you want to call them something for acting against our morality, you could call the amoral or having amoral customs.

*amoral:*

1. a: being neither moral nor immoral; specifically : lying outside the sphere to which moral judgments apply &lt;science as such is completely amoral — W. S. Thompson&gt; b: lacking moral sensibility &lt;infants are amoral&gt;

When Fermi told everyone he was looking for a way to best achieve what we now call 'fission' using the phrase ""I know what I am fishing for, I just can't find it!"", as he (coming from Italy) thought the word 'fishing' was a direct conjugated synonym of the verb 'to search'.

When fission became the showstopper it is today, it was affectionately named 'fish'n' by his american colleagues. The scientific establishment did not accept this, and changed it to the more scientifically acceptable 'fission' we have today.","1220271496"

This law made it harder for people to erase debt by declaring bankruptcy. A Washington Post report said the law represented the most significant change to bankruptcy law in 25 years. The bill was backed by the White House, the credit card industry, retailers, and financiers. A Washington Post article said the ""bill would require many people filing for bankruptcy court protection to repay a portion of their debt under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code rather than allowing them to erase it almost entirely under the more commonly used Chapter 7. It is estimated that the proposed legislation would force 30,000 to 100,000 additional filers a year into Chapter 13.""

"politics","t5_2cneq","No. They aren't. Anyone who makes that claim is grasping futilely at a mythology invented to legitimize the candidacies of even worse runners like Ron Paul and Ralph Nader. In fact, the Democrats - though wholly gutless and in dire need of a party reformation - are nonetheless *vastly* better than the Republicans. Saying otherwise tells me that you don't bother to research voting records and read platforms, preferring instead to perpetuate a lie that you for some reason believe makes you sound intelligent and politically informed.

Redditors, on average, are far more liberal than the average American. Thus, during the primaries the most liberal candidate, Dennis Kucinich, found a broader base of support here than in the general public. Most of us realized, however, that what made us like him also made him a nonviable candidate in the national election. Moreover, even if he was somehow elected his stances on so many issues are so divisive that they would have made working with Congress, and therefore making any substantive progress towards effecting those stances in the law, nearly impossible. On that basis, most of us came to the conclusion that Obama, though not always in agreement with our own political beliefs, would still do a much better job of bringing about the changes we want than Kucinich. 

The problem with third-parties in the States is that they are invariably formed by radicals. Now, radicalism can be good or bad depending upon your own views, but by *definition* it is foreign from what *most* Americans want. The reality is that the large majority of Americans can find their beliefs best represented in either the Republicans or the Democrats. Both parties have so many disparate opinions stratified inside them that they create the illusion of diversity, although functionally only a narrow sect of the party actually makes decisions. Even so, the Democrats still represent a left-leaning American better than the Communists, and the Republicans still better represent a right-leaning American better than the Christian Falangists.","1220272441"

What I'm talking about are things like these: [Diagnosing Deadlocks in SQL server](http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/20047/diagnosing-deadlocks-in-sql-server-2005). There he says:

&gt; We have added **with (nolock)** to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some.

... 

&gt; I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?

Obviously, that shows that he uses such SQL statements as a short-term solution, has no desire to look up what exactly nolock does, and has no desire at all to investigate what the actual source of the problem is. In other words, he just grabs the first thing that looks somewhat like a solution, does not dig into the implications of it, and just assumes that the problem is fixed with a workaround he doesn't even understand.

That, imho, is not how a good developer should behave.

From his point of view the universe is unending because it is meant to express that God is unending &amp; unlimited.

Not that there weren't any such people in positions of power before Lorraine came on board -- but after that, nobody in a position of significant power in the company was really putting up a fight any longer.

There were still some good products being released at the point Dragon Dice came out, however.  The Planescape setting, for instance, was released in the mid-'90s.  The good products were just clearly outnumbered by the bad, by that time.

Regardless, 4E looks to me like a case of marketing managers having significant say in what features get added to a project and the timing of product release without any deep understanding of the hobbyists the company serves, with a few good features being snuck in by game designers still trying to fight the good fight, so to speak.","1220273971"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;There was no mention made of why the woman in the story drove straight home instead of taking the teen to a hospital. I can think of one reason, which deserves discussion: if taken to a hospital, the teen would very likely have been charged with whatever law forbids underage drinking in Utah.

So, when faced with the problem of exposing some law breakers or risking a life she took the responsibility to risk the life. Now as it happens I am sure there is no law against underage **drinking**, but rather a law against things like selling alcohol to minors. There are also laws that say that medical professionals don't turn in patients. 

&gt;But ""bring them in just in case"" rings very, very hollow when you know that they will get into legal trouble for it.

If what they are doing is protecting their illegal activity rather than taking care of their friends then it is grossly immoral and, depending on the circumstances, rationally illegal. 

Now do you know of any emergency people who have turned in an underage drinker to the cops? Or did you really mean that the school/parents can learn about the drinking and embarrassment, not jail time, is the concern?

"WTF","t5_2qh61","To do that trick, you put your fingers *under* the child, not on top. Four adults can do it to an adult too, and it is a good party trick.

The trick is to spend a minute pushing down on a table with your hands, from a seated position. Once four people have done that, they can place a finger each under a seated person and lift them with apparently no effort. You get a finger under the back of each knee, and a finger under each armpit.

Of course, this is not magic. The trick is that after pushing down, your brain is still compensating for the table you were pushing against, and so you don't actually *feel* the effort involved. Each person is only lifting a quarter [forth] of the seated person, so it is not really that much of an effort involved, but do use a light person just to be sure it works without straining.

It is a bit like accidently using your left foot on a brake pedal in an automatic car, when you are used to operating a clutch with that foot; you press so much harder than it feels like you are, and give your passengers a really rough ride, and perhaps put one of them through the windscreen if they are not belted in, while gliding to a 'gentle' stop.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Wow, this is a shitty article even by Reddit standards. The site has more ads than text, and Osborn clearly has a child's grasp of both essay writing and our government.

About eighty percent of the article is a Schoolhouse-Rock-level overview of the Constitution, leaving pretty much this sentence as the only thing that approaches an original thought:

&gt; Nowhere in that Constitution does it allow the President, appointed or elected, to declare war at his whim, or remove the protection of the Bill of Rights from any person. What the Bush regime has done is clearly unconstitutional and any legislators who go along with him are also impeachable.  Thus, they're all clearly violating their oaths, as Bush has done since his appointment.

The article fails to discuss with any specificity what ""the Bush regime has done,"" which you'd think would be pretty important if you wanted to talk to adults about impeaching our elected officials. 

If Osborne wanted to talk about the Iraq War, you'd think he'd have at least devote a paragraph each to the President's powers as Commander-in-Chief, the specific language in the Constitution that grants and limits those powers, and the War Powers Resolution. You'd think he'd also throw in the fact that the US hasn't declared war since WW2, and why that is important.

If Osborne wanted to talk about the warrantless wiretapping program, you'd think he'd have mentioned the Fourth Amendment, and why he believes the program constitutes an ""unreasonable search."" Perhaps a little discussion on the what constitutes a ""reasonable"" search, and maybe a little bit about the legal distinction between monitoring a completely domestic call and one in which one party is not in the US. For extra credit, he could have thrown in some discussion on relevant legislation and case law.

&gt;It is not, but it is still a common reaction which even the most renowned scientists fall prey to. Recall that even Einstein protested ""God does not play dice with the universe.""

Sorry, but I don't know of many ""renowned scientists"" who substitute religious belief to contradict rock solid fully established science.

Does not make it right. And when you start off ignoring the science, the popularity issue makes it worse.

Bull and you know it is bull. You are free to show that this is well established science rather than distorting some fringe biased sample.

Whether it is a fact or not distinguishing two groups of human beings one from the other and then telling one of them the other has more then you and you must take it back, creates us v. them.  Telling women they are against men causes anger, hate, aggression, adversarial relationships.  

Tell both sexes that the roles that society has created for them are not written in stone and that they should treat all members of each gender as equal individuals and you have a non adversarial process of cultural growth and change.

And when did I ever say that I thought men have the authority over how women act when they try to liberate themselves?

I was voicing an opinion on what way the issue should be approached not claiming men have authority over how women act or telling anyone how they had to act.  Advice and a viewpoint is not domination.  Your assumption about what I think was in error.

You treat men as inferior when you act as though they all suffer from an inability to treat women equally.  All men are not so mentally and morally frail.   And I'm sorry but I must disagree with you generalizing the behavior of all of a gender because of the behavior of one of a gender is sexist.

In nothing I have said did I say or imply that women could only do anything ""if men say its okay.""  Please point out where I ever gave any indication that women had to ask for permission to do something.  They clearly don't.

Finally ""They do not have the right to flaunt their opinions on what is good and bad for women to do.""  Yes they do.  Anyone can voice an opinion on any topic they want.  I hate to be so cheesy as to go this route but this is America (edit - sorry just realized you're in Australia so this only half applies. sorry), and while we are struggling to protect our rights at the moment it is still a market place of ideas where voicing your opinion is the key step into learning, sharing, and bettering the world around you.  And even more so this is the internet.  If you honestly think the internet isn't a place for voicing any and all opinions from the crazy to the sublime you need to get off of it.

""arrogant"" ""shut their traps"" ""damn destructive"" - In general, it is easier to have a meaningful discussion where you actually have a chance to persuade someone to your point if you aren't insulting them.

Until later and your inevitable long winded response ;)  ","1220274595"

We divided up boys and girls and taught them separately and the school made it optional - the kids' parents had to sign a form - but one point we fought over for years was condom demonstrations. It took two people. One really only had to stand there with their arm in the air as another put a condom over it (to demonstrate the fact that there's no such thing as a penis that's 'too big' for a condom) and then used some Vaseline or other lotion containing oil and rubbed the condom until it broke (to show how oil-based lubricants break down latex). It was awkward, funny, educational and completely harmless.

I sat in on one of the many public meetings they had on this subject, and at one point faced down the most vocal opponent of the program, who likened condom demonstrations to showing a child a loaded gun, how to use it and where it was kept, and then admonishing them to never touch it. I pointed out that the use of condoms very rarely results in trips to the emergency room with gaping wounds and that her approach to sex education was more akin to hiding that gun somewhere in the house and turning off all the lights in hopes that the child wouldn't stumble across it.

I've designed some computer simulations, and the *highest* probability I've come up with is roughly one in a trillion.

Now ask yourself - nine days. Unforeseen asteroid impacts, global pandemics, supermassive volcanic eruptions, methane burps, gamma ray bursts, full-blown nuclear war - hell, even vacuum collapse. Any of these things could happen in nine days' time. But I very much doubt they will.","1220275463"

"it","t5_247c","L’Università Cattolica, per iniziativa della Facoltà di Scienze della Formazione, del Centro di Ate­neo per la Solidarietà internazionale (CeSI) e di Educatori senza Frontiere (E.S.F.) ha istituito il Master RELAZIONE DI AIUTO IN CONTESTI DI VULNERABILITA' E POVERTA' NAZIONALI ED INTERNAZIONALI che si svolge all'università Cattolica di Milano in 12 mesi ed è rivolto a chi, in possesso di laurea, è interessato a lavorare in organizzazioni del terzo settore.

Il Master si colloca nel contesto della lotta alla povertà in accordo con gli orientamenti dell’ONU per il conseguimento, entro il 2015, del “Millennium Development Goals” (MDG) programma che intende promuovere, attraverso obiettivi raggiungibili, il progresso umano e, soprattutto con un approccio centrato sui Di­ritti dell’Infanzia e dell’Adolescenza, contribuire a rendere il mondo un luogo migliore. Il Master intende fornire gli approcci metodologici e operativi necessari per l’attivazione di progetti di cooperazione, sviluppo e assistenza, soprattutto nei contesti dove l’Università Cattolica già opera in collaborazione con ONG ed associazioni umanitarie.

Nel mondo globalizzato il problema dell'assenza dei diritti è diventato un problema di tutti. Ogni popolo o Paese riceve inevitabilmente, direttamente od indirettamente la conseguenza di un'azione avvenuta dall'altro capo del mondo. Per esempio il fatto che in Cina non esistano dei sindacati, che i lavoratori abbiano paghe ed orari inaccettabili, che il Tibet venga violato e che ci sia la pena di morte per 68 reati con il numero di esecuzioni più alto di tutte le altre nazioni del mondo messe insieme non è solo un probema dei cinesi ma anche di tutti i popoli che devono interagire con i Cinesi sia politicamente che economicamente.

In una società mondiale legata alla necessità sempre maggiore di energia, alla ricerca di manodopera sempre meno costosa, condizionata dalla tecnologia e dalla comunicazione globale tutto diventa visibile a tutti e tutti ricevono le conseguenze di tutto. In questi giorni in Georgia l'occidente è partecipe di una situazione che comporta un rischio reale e continuo di gravi violazioni della Convenzione europea dei diritti dell'uomo; nella striscia di Gaza decine di migliaia di persone in festa hanno accolto dopo anni di isolamento il primo sbarco di associazioni umanitarie non controllate dalla marina israliana. In Afghanistan decine di civili sono morti sotto il fuoco occidentale mentre in Pakistan sono gli attentati suicidi a mietere le vittime. Nel contempo però dall'Africa o dall'India le popolazioni affamate possono vedere, valutare e giudicare il nostro operato, possono sperare nel nostro maggior benessere e cercare di raggiungerlo, a piedi, di persona o con azioni dimostrative.

Rabbia frustrazione, percezione alterata della realtà, comunicazioni propagandistiche fanno leva sugli istitinti primari del popoli a cui è stata tolta la dignità. Ed è propro chi non ha nulla da perdere, neanche la dignità umana, che è disponibile a fare qualsiasi cosa anche farsi saltare in aria su un autobus pieno di gente. E' necessario quindi che le scuole , le università e le le istituzioni stimolino i ragazzi ad interessarsi ai temi del diritti umani, alla tutela dei soggetti deboli, agli aiuti nei contesti di vulnerabilità. Solo con un cambiamento culturale e formativo sarà possibile creare una classe dirigente che possa essere sensibile alla tutela dell'umanità e non solo del proprio potere personale o ancor peggio del proprio portafoglio.

Il Master RELAZIONE DI AIUTO IN CONTESTI DI VULNERABILITA' E POVERTA' NAZIONALI ED INTERNAZIONALI è una possibilità, un'opportunità per ogni persona in possesso di Laurea che è interessato a lavorare per il bene di tutto il mondo e quindi anche di noi stessi. La Direttrice del Master è la Prof.ssa Cristina Castelli, docente di Psicologia del ciclo di vita nella Facoltà di Scienze della Formazione, il Coordinatore Scientifico è il Prof. Giuseppe Vico mentre il Coordinatore didattico è il Dott. Davide Scotti.

If you don't need to enhance the functionality of the library you have written, it cost very little to maintain, but when using a library written by someone else, the interface may change because some functionality you don't need may change the library under your feet, adding to maintenance costs. 

The real problem is not when you use one library however, but when you use a library that use several other libraries, that again use other libraries. The dependencies this create can be very hard to maintain. I have examples on systems that require you to carefully pick the right version of more than 40 libraries (far from all in latest version) so you get a version that is internally consistent. The dependencies are not always properly documented (e.g it claim that you should use the latest version which is no longer true), and it may take weeks to even install it on a new system. In that case, it is favorable to remove some of the dependencies by writing some of the functionality the libraries provide yourself, so you get a more maintainable system. Some of systems I think of use open source libraries, and although the maintenance burden of the libraries are distributed, it does not remove the burden of maintaining dependencies. 

Someone below got downmodded for posting a link to this [blog entry](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html) by Joel Spolsky, that is somewhat exaggerated, but contain some of the points I mentioned about the cost of using libraries. ","1220276030"

That America is circling the drain is already really, *really* clear to everyone else in the world.

The trouble is that - as with any empire - the it slips, the louder and more vociferous the nay-sayers and nationalists get, extolling how great the country is, and how ""change X doesn't matter"", or ""loss Y just makes the country greater and stronger"".

The more America circles the drain, the louder and longer people who realise it are shouted down.  Seriously - if the majority of the population can't see by *now* that the USA has passed the peak of its power then it's doubtful whether they'll *ever* notice until it's far too late to pull it back.

I think ner0 is on the right track but I'll go a lot farther: it's a lot cheaper for society if a person has 72 hours of food and water on hand in their home than it is to get it distributed to them after a disaster, but hardly anyone does this. If everyone did this the need for emergency (ie: rushed) supplies sent to a disaster area would vanish. 

Where I think ner0 is off base is the fact that he wants us to embrace price gougers. Taking advantage of a situation is the essence of capitalism, but most people don't support unvarnished capitalism.

Take, for example, someone who supports John McCain and posts a pro-McCain comment.  Such comments are instantly downmodded into oblivion.  Now, if the poster is obviously trolling, that's one thing, but there's no reason to suppress genuine discussion.

"AmericanHistory","t5_2qiee","Well he's right... contrary to popular belief, our constitutional republic isn't quite a democracy. And considering the fact that until 1913 the only directly-elected federal officials were members of the House of Representatives, the United States government hasn't been a government of the people.

Senators were elected by the state legislatures up until that point. Until the mid-19th Century, presidential electors were largely chosen the same way. The Supreme Court and the judicial branch are all appointed by the president, and are confirmed by the Senate. That makes for a strong oligarchical trend in our government, although half the time we don't even notice it.

The people were largely left out of the picture... and still are, but just to a lesser extent.

For these reasons I tend to get annoyed by the Constitutional purists who think it was the greatest document ever crafted. It's not really democratic at all. In fact, it was crafted for the sole purpose of replacing the Articles of Confederation, which wasn't strong enough in the eyes of the founding fathers. Also, keep in mind that for two years the Constitution was totally void of the Bill of Rights.

Amendments to the Constitution take forever and all you need is a few disgruntled Senators to block it from ever finishing the first phase. They've amended it a whopping 17 times since 1790.

On that note though, one good thing about the government is that it does have strong checks and balances and this makes it particularly difficult for a dictatorship to arise.

But that still doesn't make it a democracy.","1220276931"

There's an element of it being a natural overreaction having experienced it previously but then, if it has been overplayed, it might just compound the problem for next time.

People do need to trust the authorities and for that they need consistency, that the FEMA etc majorly failed last time will have underminded people's confidence - one counter to that will be to provide plenty of data directly to the public that they can renew confidence in FEMA etc. - be frank and honest with the public.

Would I have done it differently.. I would have looked to move the people out in the same way but would have played that this was the potentially the same, and not greater, than Katrina. That would have been sufficient. Making out it's the mother of all storms risks looking daft when it's 'just' a bit smaller and people underestimate the risk next time when it maybe is very real.

Unfortunately, saving is a cheap operation, diffing is probably more expensive, and _writing_ the diff algorithm is very ""expensive"" indeed.  In other words, it would cost a lot of programmer time and then actually _waste_ machine time, all for an incredibly trivial reduction in user time.  In some cases (file has changed) it would increase user time, because you would have to diff and _then_ save rather than just saving.  So it seems like a good idea but is probably very difficult to do right.

Most modern apps have a limited form of this, though.  If you _undo_ all the way back to the last save, the app recognizes that you have made no changes.  If you use other operations to do the same thing, like typing and then _deleting,_ of course the app doesn't notice that you've effectively made no changes.","1220278114"

YES!!!! Reproduction is critical, one could say ""everything"" since the species must continue.

But, in today's general western societies many females have attempted to place themselves in male roles.

Sorry, girls, you are inferior when attempting to do what is natural for males.

Sure, there is a small minority of females capable of performing male roles, usually due to training or the natural variances among individuals.

However, for most females, attempting to step outside the societal norms of old before ""political correctness"" attempted to overcome biology, has caused problems for society, males and the females who have been brainwashed that they can be as males.

Nobody in the area has ICBMS that are pointed anywhere outside of the region, which is what spawned my comment, as the Middle East != World.  

I also don't see a Germany style invasion campaign happening.  Things are too unbalanced at the moment for a World War.  Do you also think Iran would really launch a nuclear weapon?  That would be lead to serious retaliation from all over - retaliation that they are aware would be unmatchable.

If there was going to be another true World War, one of the superpowers would have to start it, and really what would be the point?  The US already has military bases in probably ~140 countries.  Russia has more land and resources than they know what to do with.  China is busy dealing with internal growth issues...

"religion","t5_2qh39","Well, I posted this as a ""self"" reddit, which means I was simply stating my personal opinion for the sake of discussion as a forum.  I agree that I would LOVE some well-respected public figure or publication of the Christian faith to go on record with their opinions of the candidates, to help get a fresh perspective and see if maybe, just maybe, there are some virtues McCain has that I have missed up until now.

As for ""acceptable authority"" to interpret scripture, I'll make two brief points.

1) The Bible says that all believers are ""priests"" and that we have a one-on-one relationship with God, filled with the Holy Spirit so we can discern God's will.  Certainly some people are more trained, more studied, and more wise than others, but we are EXPECTED to interpret scripture for ourselves, otherwise we really only know God second-hand through our local pastor or Bible teacher.  So whether my interpretation of the Bible is ""acceptable"" for you, is your own choice, but every believer in Christ is expected to be able to read scripture for themselves, and of course, also learn from others more knowledgable.

2) The Bible is plainly clear on the items I quoted.  Interpretation is really not necessary, unless maybe you're Bill Clinton and need extraordinarily specific definitions of words like ""adultery"".  I am an American, non-denominational Christian, but I expect that all denominations can agree on what ""You shall not commit adultery"" means.  

And finally, I would be extraordinarily happy for someone such as yourself to have a discussion about the relative virtues and sins of each candidate.  I don't need you to be an ordained minister in order to listen to your opinions and take them into consideration.

As for the first commandment, ""You shall have no other gods before me"", that is a tougher one to judge without knowing a person on a significant level.  I mean, maybe I could speculate that Jay Leno puts his many cars above God, and I might be right, but without knowing him better I can't really have any clue.  So is the same for the candidates.  What I can do is notice the personalities, actions, and words that come from these men and make a general judgement call about them based on how I expect God's love to manifest itself in a person.  Obama is clearly slow to anger, slow to judge, kind, compassionate, and respectful (all virtues mentioned in the wisdom of the Bible), while McCain is stubborn, mean, hot-headed, cheated on his wife, publicly lies about his opponent, and so forth.

Anyway I think I've made my point, feel free to disagree if you like, you're certainly welcome to your own opinion.","1220278414"

Unfortunately the media tends to focus on the negative (not just about Christians, but about all news), so you rarely hear about many of the good things that are done on a daily basis in the name of Jesus.  

Of course, you likely know some Christians personally who fail to represent Jesus very well, I surely could be placed into that category myself by some people who have known me in even the recent past.  Living like Christ is a struggle for us imperfect humans, and there are plenty of hurdles to our spiritual growth that make it so easy to fall away or give up on trying to live Christ-like.  

It's also a failure of many churches, who preach the concept of ""grace"" so hard (the Biblical teaching that salvation is based on God's love and not your own good works) that they ignore many scriptures that also include repentance and spiritual living as part of salvation and outward evidence of it.  It's pretty easy for us humans to go, ""Oh cool, my sins are forgiven, God loves me no matter what, so I can get away with [insert sin here].""  And while it's true that our sins are forgiven and that God loves us no matter what, He also calls us to live a holy life.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I met the tarantula hawk while swimming in a housing development at my then-girlfriend's mom's place on the southwestern outskirts of Phoenix, AZ. They lived right on the edge of prime, raw desert - which was kind of depressing because I like the desert, and I had to watch them continue to plow through virgin Sonora desert for more crappy tinder-stick and styrofoam-stucco ""luxury homes"".

I met the scorpions and vinegaroons in the high deserts around Southern California living at a friend's place in the boondocks.

I must confess at this point I've screamed like a little kid due to bugs more than just three times.

At least a dozen of those moments were due to vinegaroons.

Ok, yeah, they kind of look like scorpions until you get used to them. But even after you get used to them, you learn that they're agressive.

You know those creepy attack bugs from Starship Troopers? Vinegaroons are like that, but smaller. But just as agressive.

I've had them leap at me from walls. I encountered one in the driveway once, and instead of running for shelter like a spider or scorpion it REARED UP and ran at me. I turned and ran and that damn thing chased me all over the lot. My housemate left a worklight outside on the driveway once and we went out to find a vinegaroon moshpit totally covering the light.

Still want to see a vinegaroon? See [Uropygid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uropygid).

Why hello there, nightmare fuel! The ones in the American Southwest are more tan colored and have a different shape, and no picture can accurately capture the truly bug-fuck nature of those things and how they move like creepy killer alien robot ninja bugs.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.

The homes were raided with warrants that were so broad that the police could look anywhere and take anything, -and they evidently did just that. They took these items and then made up BS implications about how these items were going to be used. Gasoline and matches? So I can't have them in my house before I go to a protest because that would indicate that I wasn't going to protest peacefully?

Not sure I get what you are saying.

As an aside, if one watches the clip of the police chief explaining the what they found,
and then research the facts, it is brutally obvious that the officer is full of shit and supporting dictatorial policy. The ""unine"" that they found came from more than one house, and in one case was grey water that was being recycled, and in the other case was next to a toilet that did not work. The three man ""slingshot"" was a pair of bike inner tubes they found in a garage, -a garage with bicycles in it. This is enough evidence to hold someone against their will?

The judge that issued the warrants should be removed from the bench, the police chief should be fired, and the officers that conspired with the chief to perpetrate these offenses should be reprimanded severely.

- Educate and inform the whole mass of the people... They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. 
- Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day. 
- I am mortified to be told that, in the United States of America, the sale of a book can become a subject of inquiry, and of criminal inquiry too. 
- I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature. 
- I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition (Christianity) one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. 
- I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country. 
- I never will, by any word or act, bow to the shrine of intolerance or admit a right of inquiry into the religious opinions of others. 
- I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies, and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.

Even if the premises are true, I don't have to point out the fallacy here.

Furthermore, the whole notion of ""false interpretation"" as some objective fact to be determined objectively is pretty much meaningless. Osama bin Laden's interpretation of lawful violence has been continuously attacked by islamic scholars across the spectrum. Does this mean his interpretation is ""false""? No, it means he represents a marginal movement. A movement whose few scholar-like figures have by now been detained or killed.

Interestingly, the attacks of 9/11 weren't justified as offensive jihad, but defensive. That is to say, as revenge and retaliation for the attacks on and occupation of Muslim lands, among other things. Killing of civilians was justified similarly. They reasoned: The US is known to have killed innocent Muslim civilians at countless occasions, known as ""collateral damage"". And so we transgress against them as they have transgressed against us.

My point is, even intelligent people seem to have been infected by the propaganda about Al-Qaeda wanting to kill us because they hate our freedom or because we are infidels etc. But things aren't and will never be that simple.

The stock market cannot radically beat inflation forever, and even over a LONG period of time it isn't always a great investment.  If you look at all 30 year periods starting between 1900 and 1978, you'll find that bonds outperformed the stock market over 50% of the time.

The vast majority of wealthy Americans have their own business or invested in real estate.  The reason is simple - leverage.

* write down a partial order of the languages
* change the scoring function to return 1 if you prefer lang A to lang B, 0.5 if you have no preference
* run the program with the new scoring function

That's it! You have a new ranking, where a difference of 500 points means a 90% chance of you preferring the language with the higher rating. Under the assumption that there's some inherent property (comparable to ""playing strength"" in the usual analysis) that makes you like languages (i.e., something that can be mapped to a one-dimensional characteristic), it will even tell you how you'll feel about languages you don't even know yet.

This can be generalized to a larger population (assign the score in the 0..1 range according to the result of some poll).

If you're looking for a single winner, you can have many people express their preferences as a partial order and run the [Condorcet method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method).","1220280489"

I did not mean to insinuate men can't treat women equally. What I said was that the society we live in does not allow us to live as equal individuals. It is for that reason that Men must go the extra mile of humility to allow Women to step ahead of them, and to take some dominance for themselves.

Though men, by and large, propagate sexism, they are not the cause of it. And no where do I claim that men are responsible for it. I am saying that men cannot expect that their 'feelings' deserve to be protected in the face of the complete oppression of women being destroyed. It is as simple as that.

Men must assume the supportive role. They must put aside their affinity for the dominant roles they've been forced into, and understand that their feelings become largely irrelevant in comparison to the fact that Women's feelings aren't even creditted, by and large, at all.

Opinions are fine, but that doesn't mean they are not wrong, or misguided.

I will gladly though, apologise for insulting you so frequently, or at all. I really shouldn't do that, and it is one of my negative traits.

It is simply because Men and Women are not equal, that Men must take it upon themselves to be understanding, respectful and supportive for women's equality and rights. They must remove the idea that their feelings come into account, and so too should the women.

Only when both sexes are truly equal will all of those wonderful things be possible.","1220280682"

Not much point arguing here.  Their mission is to always append insult-filled answers to distorted representations of the true arguments.

For instance when they say ""truthers don't understand that fire can weaken steel!"".  When we say that office fires can't melt iron, that's not as an answer to ""the WTC collapsed because it was melted by the fires!"".  That's because *there was tons of molten iron* in the debris.  Ordinary fires did not produce these.  **Thermite** did.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Henry Ford certainly knew this, and often said that his company would prosper only if his workers earned enough to buy the Fords they produced. And in 1953, when General Motors' president told the Senate that ""what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa,"" he was simply stating the then-commonly held belief that success for American corporations generally meant success for America and American workers.

This disconnect between the national interest and corporate responsibility and interests has helped shatter the ""contract with the middle class."" And in the most painful measure of just how broken this contract is, based on data from 2005-2006, the top 1% of Americans -- 300,000 -- earn as much as the bottom 150 million combined. Income inequality is the greatest it has been since 1928, and for every three-year period since 1981, the top 1% of taxpayers have gained, on average, $100 billion in total earnings, while the bottom 80% have lost $100 billion.

Corporate America frequently justifies its actions, however harmful those actions may be to workers and to the local and national economies, as necessary to remain competitive globally. But globalization doesn't have to mean more job insecurity, stagnant wages for workers and little or no healthcare coverage for 75 million people. It doesn't have to mean threats to move jobs overseas and slashed benefits just because multinational corporations have almost complete mobility of capital and technology and American workers have almost none. It doesn't have to mean excessive executive compensation and preferential corporate and personal taxes. And it doesn't have to mean unfair trade practices of the sort that are contributing greatly to the extreme income inequality.



Our overseas trading partners have generally gone in a completely different direction. These countries have instead instituted economic policies to hold on to and improve the quality of their existing jobs and to induce foreign corporations to shift production facilities and technology their way. This is particularly the case throughout Asia. In China, for example, 60% of its exports come from ""foreign-invested companies."" ","1220280925"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Yes, ""accessing"" an artery is quite difficult.  Most doctors and nurses have a difficult time - it is tough skill to learn, 10xs tougher than venous access.  In the US only MDs or specially certified nurses can attempt to withdraw blood from an artery with a needle.  

The arterial system is radically different than the venous.  The key differences that make shooting up through your veins much more likely than through an artery are:


arteries are constructed differently - they are under high pressure and as such are muscular in nature to provide counter pressure (against the pumping blood).  This muscular construction makes them much more difficult to pierce (even with a needle) and keep the tip of the needle in the ""tube"" of the artery.

secondly, most arteries are difficult to locate in comparison to veins.  Some are obviously superficial or even visible with a pulse but they are not easily seen color-wise and must be visualized.  Furthermore, since only two or three are readily locatable people who shoot up would quickly use the locations up and be out of places to get high from.  

arteries lie much more ""deep"" in your tissue, making them hard to find.  Ironically, most IV drug abusers don't like or are afraid of needles and don't relish the thought of having to ""dig"" around in their bodies.

finally, there is quite a large risk of stopping or restricting blood from the artery that has been accessed (either by clot or other means) which could result in loss of limb or death.  

So, for these reasons and more I think people don't shoot up in the arteries.","1220281044"

Where are the Xians proclaiming that God's creation is perfection and how the Earth was meant to be?


I am so saddened that America's based-upon-emotions PC droids are not up in arms. Baby fur seals are embraced but not Guinea worms? Is it because baby seals are furry cute critters? Just because a worm's natural reproductive cycle causes some pain to humans is that enough of a reason the permanently remove an entire species from the planet?

If the PC crowd would practice their beliefs vice merely spewing and bawling their knee-jerk rhetoric one would think that bunch would accept the Guinea worm into their bodies to save a species from genocide.

Aspects of Guinea worm eradication are Holocaust-like.

Personally, I don't give a damn if a species dies off. Guines worms, snail darters, this or that bug or even the barbaric Muslim hordes.... wipe 'em out.

I think an approach that would be more along the 'Emacs way' would be circumventing the browser as a mean to access web-based content. RSS is an easy approach for some sites, whereas simple scrubbing would work for others. And in an ideal world, the usual Javascrpt/Web 2.0 interface would be just one way of accessing the underlying service.

Yes, that was supposed to be a little bit of humour. Sorry that you didn't get it.

No, I take it back - you obviously did get the humour because here you are repeating it again.

For many funds, I could completely agree.  But, look at the index funds, their fees are very low. Usually 0.3% give /take.  Or the near index funds, which are 0.35% without a buy/sell load.  

&gt; I wouldn't start to invest till it starts to level off and start to go higher.

I'm sorry, but I have to strongly disagree with this statement.  Us plebeians don't know enough to ""time the markets"".  Over the long run (say 10-15 years), trying to time the market swings will just cost money.  Even the academic researchers can't find a timing theory that works.  

For the casual investor, I would recommend A [dollar cost averaging](http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/newinvestors/a/041901a.htm) approach.  Again, this is a long term approach which is an antitheses to day trading.

and the mechanism of action is important in that the cause/effect that has been sold by the medical industry is a lie. i agree that if it works the patient needn't necessarily concern themselves with the biomolecular details...but from the industry standpoint, it is fraudulent to say ""we know you have a measurable deficiency and this drug will correct that"" if this isn't demonstrably true and accurate. which it isn't, since AFAIK they *never* test anyone for the mythical condition of 'serotonin deficiency' (at least they've never tested any of the 10 or so people i know personally who are or have been on SSRI's).","1220282481"

It's also more likely that someone having a knife defensively will try to defend themselves, instead of yielding. Again, increasing the risk of knife injuries.","1220282619"

This is *not* a report on FBI-directed harassment of protesters in St. Paul, which is currently ongoing, and appears to involve some very questionable interpretations of the law.  The article (inadvertently) presents a lot of outdated information as current, and this can become confusing if people end up with a set of 'facts' about what's happening that contradict each other.

I'm not saying the article has no relevance.  I'm just saying that it's important to notice when it was written.  It would have been helpful to note that in the tag line (i.e. link).

His good friend Penny Ballou, is a 'telepathic Scientologist' who has been involved with Riley's schemes for years. 

Riley is a genius at exaggerating and convincing others that he has accomplished great things. This is how he rakes in donations and fees. In reality, he hasn't sold one invention that anyone can verify. All he talks about is his great success with Grandma Tibbetts and how much he hates Skippy Peanut Butter (among a hundred other companies). He has no verifiable success as an inventor. He doesn't seem to know anymore about the patent system than anyone who has read the Patent Office's free booklets.

What planet is this guy from?  He's assuming that total income is constant or something.  There is an alternative to spending: ""not spending"".  Investment and consumption can slump together, because at the same time production of goods decreases.  People slow down in production, consumption, and overall transactions of any kind.

Sorry it doesn't wash. It's like trying to connect Obama to the Weather Underground (active when Obama was 8) because Bill Ayres and he are both Democrats in the same city and bump into each other now and again.

The worst thing I can find about Obama is he got a little too chummy with Tony Rezko. Peanuts if you compare it McCain's connections to Keating. The fact that Rezko is the __worst__ that you can come up with against a Obama is a plus. Based on my 15+ years as a Chicago resident, Obama's a fucking boy scout.","1220283105"

I agree her/her daughter's pregnancy should be beneath the level of political discourse, but I think it tickles people:

The fact is that *either* she's prepared to lie repeatedly and extensively to cover up a relatively unimportant personal issue (which, remember, was apparently enough to *impeach* Clinton), *or* she's willing to put the very life of a baby at risk for no good reason (apart, possibly, from ""to further her political career"").

The reason why ""cul-de-sac"" is pluralized that way is because the ""de"" shows how ""cul"" is the object being modified by ""sac."" Since there's no adjective form of sac, the ""de"" basically makes it ""this cul of sack quality."" Therefore, it doesn't make any sense to pluralize the ""sac"" since it's simply there to describe what the ""cul"" is. 

Most pluralized French nouns look like this since the adjectives usually come directly afterward, but since English-speaking people do the exact opposite they assume that the pluralization should go to the word coming last in sequence.

as far as your second point, there's really no cut and dry answer there. privacy from whom? governments? neighbors? significant others?

How about you research the ""RNC Welcoming Committee""
http://www.nornc.org/

Some nuggets from their page:

*September 1st, 2008, we, the RNC Welcoming Committee, invite all anarchists and anti-authoritarians, all radicals and **rabble-rousers**, all those who are fed up with government lies and spectacles to show up ready for action and ensure that we leave no place for these expired politicians. **What we create here will send the convention crashing off course into insignificance.***

*2. Crash the Convention – We didn’t get an invitation, but we’re showing up anyway. This party will be what we make of it. We don’t want to confine our potential by imposing a single vision of what success will look like. We recognize that there will be a lot of people coming with their own agendas and carefully laid plans and want to be open to the diverse tactics that will be necessary to accomplish our many goals. **Together, we can derail the purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands and according to our own visions.***

*10. What is meant by “Crash the Convention”? Crash the convention is one half of the Welcoming Committee’s call to action - quite literally the action component of what we as a logistical organization are facilitating. Crashing the convention is open to interpretation - By crashing, we can set realistic goals that are incremental rather than setting up a dichotomous failure/success scenario by a call to **“shut down” the convention**. We refuse to confine our potential by imposing a single vision of what success will look like. **Blockading** is crashing the convention, as is radical street theater performed outside the Xcel. Carefully orchestrated acts of **civil disobedience** could easily constitute crashing the convention as could **spontaneous acts of direct action.***


The problem I have with groups like this is it is OK for them to SHUT DOWN conventions but when they get shut down for trying to stiffle the free speech of the GOP or the Dems they cry foul.

Their stated intention is to shut down the RNC. They, in essence, are enemies of free speech. I am all for people protesting and speaking on issues they think are important but why the hell should I feel bad for these people? Some of the crap from their site reads like they are fascists and if they were in control they would stomp out people that disagree with them just as bad (or worse) then the government we have now. They (the Welcoming Committee) are showing their asses even though they aren't in a position of power, but I would be willing to bet if they had power they would shut down free speech and ""counter-revolutionaries"" that disagree with their ideals.

In instances where that person is claiming that Israel orchestrated 9/11, that incidence climbs to 100%. Congratulations, kiddo - you're an antisemite!

3. Mikheil Saakashvilli started this expecting diplomatic support from the West (plus he gets to strut in front of an EU flag speaking English, not Georgian). And to strengthen his political support in Georgia as nothing makes people more nationalist and ""loyal"" than a ""heroic"" war fought by a ""brave"" leader against an evil superpower. He has been successful in achieving both these goals. I am not sure if he expected the West (esp. the US) to send military help, as it seemed unlikely from the beginning.

"politics","t5_2cneq","
Overall, I now face the choice of whether to vote for a ""major"" party for President or not.  IT pisses me off that people are such sheep, to be sure.  It is, was, and (I suppose) will continue to be the reality.  To the matter at hand.
1.  There is no misstep.  She is a politician, not an historian.  She was pandering to her base with what she wrote, and technically, as already explained, there is nothing historically inaccurate in what she wrote.  She merely isn't interested in expounding on history.  Her statement is tangential to the history of the pledge and it refers to the phrase ""under God"".  The specific use of this phrase by Lincoln, as in the pledge, is to comment on how indivisible the nation is (it is a blessed union, like a marriage).  Presumptively, you agree with that (the indivisibility). I certainly do not and mostly the founders did not.  The ""Refounder"", Lincoln, made it a central principle, like say, life liberty, and property so it had to have the same basis - GOd - to achieve his logical triumph of form over substance and defeat the ideals of a true republic.  But, I won't be holding my breath for someone to give us back the right of secession.  IT's fundamental to having the consent of the governed, so, its lack is our (the people's)loss.
2.  IF this is the worst case her critics can find of her pandering in 16 years of public life(although they have attacked her not for that, but for being ignorant) she is an angel compared to other US politicians.  I doubt the Republicans see the connection to the pledge that you see with their policies on terrorism or the war in the Middle East.  IT is not entirely wrong that the US was founded on Christianity  but the way some of them wave that around makes you wonder if they get why that is the case (and whether they understood what Jesus taught, BTW).  They wanted a Republic and were of rather different religious beliefs (some were atheists, no doubt).  ""The God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are a gift from God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever."" 
3.  The pledge isn't important, and, this one is going to hurt, neither is the Constitution.   The reason the Constitution isn't important is because the people give it no importance.  So, the courts and Congress bat it around to their own will.  Whether this sorry state of affairs can change, we will see.
3.  I think you have overly reduced complex matters, like the Republican party.  IT reminds me of those who run against the democrats, claiming they are merely socialists.
4.  We will see over the ensuing weeks what this Palin woman is all about.  IF she shakes up the Bushies like she did her home state Republicans, that will be a good thing.  I fear we will find less that she stands for something and more that she stands for her own self-advancement.  But, as much as that turns my stomach, I don't think it is all bad in a President.

That's right, somehow they're the party of ""Jesus"" and millions vote blindly, despite the corruption, despite the fact that the GOP has done NOTHING for the religious right except for maybe take their jobs away, but, oh yeah, they posted some Ten Commandments in schools. Yay... 

After the past 8 years of this bullshit I would hope there would be some sort of political movement to get these people out of office. I guess those of us dedicated to this movement are ""obamabots"". Yes, because trying to educate people that voting corrupt war-mongers in for another 4 years makes a lot of sense. 

Sure Obama and Biden are not perfect, but are you really going to try to argue that McCain and Palin are going to be better? Are you really trying to argue that ""100 Years"" McCain won't spend another 10 trillion dollars in Iraq and bankrupt this country? Are you really trying to tell me that a person's who greatest accomplishment in life was marrying a rich young women (that gave him all the money and political connections to make a career out of politics), is better?

"politics","t5_2cneq","I was thinking about this last night. I am not 100% on board with Obama and Biden because of their voting records (FISA to name one). Everyone this week has been criticizing McCain and Palin. But not many people have been open with their own party affiliation, so not many are clear as to ""who"" is saying ""what."" (i.e. Is it a republican/conservative saying Palin is not qualified? or is it a democrat/liberal saying that she is?)

Also, people are criticized for ""slamming the other guy"" while making their own candidate ""shine"". 

So I want to open it up for discussion: What is your party affiliation (or political/social bent) and what are the negatives about the party's standard bearers? What can you see is wrong (to you) with this candidate?

I'll start: Obama voted for the FISA bill. He doesn't have much political experience. He seems out to please the centrists of the party. He's anti-gun (as far as I know). And he hasn't addressed the Muslim issue (as far as I know.) I'd like to see him say something like ""People say I am a Muslim. I am not, but so what if I were? Has the Bush administration made us so Islamaphobic that you won't vote for me because I believe in God?"" 

Biden: His war vote and the bankruptcy bill. I'd like to see him address these. Is he in bed with big bank? big oil? He is long winded and the message could be lost.

The Democrats needs a base of right-middle of the Green party to left-middle of the Libertarians. This would create a base to win most elections. However, it would be a very simple and generic platform. Then you just need to add the people to the ticket that reflects this simple platform and move on. 

So this would give you something that reflected a  pro: environment, liberties, worker and anti-war ticket. Then you just argue that your platform is best for the problems of the country. For instance, the Democrats can say that their platform is best for the economy because it will create new jobs from alternative energy. And their platform will keep America safer and your civil liberties intact. Then you just make a short clear argument why. See how much easier that is? Then you can make attacks like this: ""Don't vote for us and you will die from the environment!"" I think that's pretty effective. In fact, I would re-release Gore's film right now. Yes I would scare people into voting for me. It's kinda low, but it works.

How about you research the ""RNC Welcoming Committee""
http://www.nornc.org/

Some nuggets from their page:

*September 1st, 2008, we, the RNC Welcoming Committee, invite all anarchists and anti-authoritarians, all radicals and **rabble-rousers**, all those who are fed up with government lies and spectacles to show up ready for action and ensure that we leave no place for these expired politicians. **What we create here will send the convention crashing off course into insignificance.***

*2. Crash the Convention – We didn’t get an invitation, but we’re showing up anyway. This party will be what we make of it. We don’t want to confine our potential by imposing a single vision of what success will look like. We recognize that there will be a lot of people coming with their own agendas and carefully laid plans and want to be open to the diverse tactics that will be necessary to accomplish our many goals. **Together, we can derail the purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands and according to our own visions.***

*10. What is meant by “Crash the Convention”? Crash the convention is one half of the Welcoming Committee’s call to action - quite literally the action component of what we as a logistical organization are facilitating. Crashing the convention is open to interpretation - By crashing, we can set realistic goals that are incremental rather than setting up a dichotomous failure/success scenario by a call to **“shut down” the convention**. We refuse to confine our potential by imposing a single vision of what success will look like. **Blockading** is crashing the convention, as is radical street theater performed outside the Xcel. Carefully orchestrated acts of **civil disobedience** could easily constitute crashing the convention as could **spontaneous acts of direct action.***


The problem I have with groups like this is it is OK for them to SHUT DOWN conventions but when they get shut down for trying to stiffle the free speech of the GOP or the Dems they cry foul.

Their stated intention is to shut down the RNC. They, in essence, are enemies of free speech. I am all for people protesting and speaking on issues they think are important but why the hell should I feel bad for these people? Some of the crap from their site reads like they are fascists and if they were in control they would stomp out people that disagree with them just as bad (or worse) then the government we have now. They (the Welcoming Committee) are showing their asses even though they aren't in a position of power, but I would be willing to bet if they had power they would shut down free speech and ""counter-revolutionaries"" that disagree with their ideals.

All Gustav needed to do to strengthen considerably was to slow down over the warm waters north of Cuba a bit, and waver a bit to the right to threaten N.O. quite a bit more.

So there's no reason to impune a political motive to the governor's concern.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;""How exactly is this fascist??? They got a search warrant.""

That's the problem, -they got a search warrant. How and why are the questions to be asked. Evidence as shown in the many first hand accounts and reports say that no warrant should have been issued, and warrants so broad should never be issued.

They are obviously using the ""RNC Welcoming Committee"" as an excuse to throw a wide net ensnaring anyone, whether connected with the RNC Welcoming Committee or not, using overly broad warrants, to stifle dissent. 

Do you have things in and around your living space that could be used to build bombs and other ""terrorists/anarchists tools""? Yea, lets make up shit about you because we disagree with your opinion, get a broad warrant, take your computers, literature, personal items, and oh yea, why not take that car packed with bomb building material (gas). We can do that because we saw on a website that the ""RNC XYZ"" people are planning to be somewhere in the state.

No, they didn't take anyone's car as far as I know, but the broad warrant allowed the cops take anything they wanted, including a car, and to use the warrant to harass in an attempt to instill fear and suppress dissent, which clearly was the intent.

And this morning on C-Span, they had a guest that was a member of the Green Party in Minnesota whose daughter was taken into custody, for no reason. Have you seen the clips of the police chief in charge of the forces executing the warrants in which he explains how the items that were confiscated were going to be used? Pure unadulterated bullshit. As the Green Party member pointed out, the confiscated ""buckets of urine"" the chief pointed out (just the buckets) and implied were going to be used to throw on the cops, were confiscated from different sources, and only one contained urine. The one that contained urine was next to a toilet that did not work, and the other buckets from another location contained grey water to be used for recycling. The two bike inner tubes that the police chief illustrated could be used as a three man slingshot were found in a garage that also contained bicycles. Imagine that, inner tubes found in a garage alongside bicycles. But the inner tubes were going to be used as a weapon according to the chief. BULLSHIT.



""Fascist"" may not be the best fit here, but it accurately describes the direction we are going.

"programming","t5_2fwo","In the literature (to my knowledge) it is a bit ""you know it when you see it"".

A stab at a formalization follows.

If you have any category theory you can think of emergence as a broken functor: you have a category C, an emergent category E, and a functor F:C-&gt;E satisfying these properties:
- calculating c an object in C s.t. F(c) = e is computationally easy for a given e in E; c need not be unique.
- given arbitrary c, however, the computational complexity of computing e = F(c) is not guaranteed to be easy. (Meaning: if we say e(C) = {c | F(c) = e} then F only has an easy time with some of the c in e(C)...for many c in e(C) any implementation of F requires a lot of computation before concluding that F(c) = e)
- similarly, there is no guarantee that for f:c-&gt;c' determining the value of F(f) is computationally tractable, even when c and c' are both ""easy"" members of e(C) and e'(C), respectively

The ""brokenness"" of F is the following: suppose you have partial knowledge of E, are given e and e' (say: two statements in chemistry-speak), and want to know if there is a morphism g:e-&gt;e' (say: a proof that e' is a reachable state from e). If you have good knowledge of C, you could find ""easy"" representatives c and c' of e(C) and e'(C), respectively, and check if there's an f:c-&gt;c'; however, even if there is such an f, there's no guarantee that F(f) can be calculated efficiently...which provides a practical limit to what can be inferred about the relationship in e and e' by way of C.

The functor between the two formal systems is thus ""broken"" in a practical sense: you can map objects in one system to objects in the other (physical states -&gt; chemical states and vice versa) and/or derivations in one system -&gt; derivations in the other, but computational complexity prevents the base system from completely subsuming the emergent one: there are facts that can be easily derived in the emergent system that cannot be derived easily (or at all, if you have limits on cpu time) in the base system.","1220286026"

Also statins have common side affects like muscle weakness. 

While the article is really horribly written... my endocrinologist gave me omega 3 fatty acid pills that are FDA approved. The ""drug"" is called Lovaza. My triglycerides more than halfed to about 120 after 3 months of use. Clearly there's alot of uses for omega3 fatty acids and their implications in cellular activity means they easily have a lot more uses.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_3#Health_benefits

Lots there, but from that:
""There was another study published on the benefits of EPA in The Lancet in March 2007. This study involved over 18,000 patients with unhealthy cholesterol levels. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1,800 mg a day of EPA with a statin drug or a statin drug alone. The trial went on for a total of five years. It was found at the end of the study those patients in the EPA group had superior cardiovascular function. Non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced in the EPA group. The authors concluded that EPA is a promising treatment for prevention of major coronary events, especially non-fatal coronary events.""

"reddit.com","t5_6"," I've been watching this conflict with a level of cynicism which I previously had thought impossible. When people first started trumpeting about Russia's unprovoked unilateral military invasion, all I could think of was that Putin would never allow such a faux pas. Never. He's too intelligent.  The guy is a cunning tactician, he's been playing by the rules and beating the west for some time now. He's taken a country that collapsed to the point of creating Gazprom and others. A force to be reckoned  with...
 
 While the Bush administration has *intentionally* tried to project an image of instability, or rash decisions, of trigger-happiness as a supposed means of deterrence and coercion, Russia has done the exact opposite. It's acted like a giant speaking softly. Giving *ample* warning, for example, that it would pursue remilitarization of its nuclear sub fleet if the missile shield threat wasn't averted (and it did hold its promise). Or actually diplomatically making Iran halt its Uranium enrichment plans. Russia projects the image of Vulcans...

 On the other hand, Cheney and the Neo-cons in their eternal pursuit of unhappieness, or rather in the pursuit of creating a bigger than life threat to sustain their Straussian ideals have been pushing Russia's buttons for the past 5 years with bafflingly moronic attempts to make a missile shield. Against what? They are trying to trigger a second cold war. It's clear as day. Their simpleton minds think that this current recession is just because the balance of things has been upset and if only we could have an existential struggle once again we'd be fine.

 There is often talk about Europe wanting this shield, but I'm starting to see that it's Germany, France and England that want it the most. The three prime puppet states. Gordon Brown, Sarkozy and Merkel... all US admin lovers.

 And the telltale signs of media manipulation: the German diplomat who initially said Georgia was breaking international law, and then was silenced. And then the initial reports in the media that quickly got stifled about how Georgia is an important asset in the transport of crude oil to Europe through a pipeline.

 It all stinks. And what stinks more is seeing that people are still ready to identify Russia as ""evil"". The cold war has ended almost 20 years ago, so you'd think people would have lost their past conditioning. Evidently not. 

 And btw, Russia has a great playing card in this game: the fact that it was the one that convinced Tehran more or less of halting nuclear production. Tehran has already hinted that they would resume production if Russia's interests were jeopardized. They play chess, the West plays checkers.

 And last point, I am convinced Israel's recent plans to unilaterally attack Iran *have* to do with this current gambit being played out. One of these days Israel is going to get burned so bad we will all collectively roll our eyes.","1220286235"

No doubt there might have been scenarios where the absolute worst case could have happened. Since you're evacuating people anyway beyond Cat 3, you don't need to state the worst case as if 'it will', you state that it 'could be'/'all the signs are' that this is another Katrina and indeed at this stage 'if x,y,z' then it 'might' even be worse.

The reason it's important is to mitigate the risk of it suddenly being a non-event (relatively) and then having less influence next time.

I don't think you understand how big 500 km is. 

An asteroid as powerful as the worst nuclear bomb is tens of meters across. [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event)

500 km would be a thousand billions of times more powerful. 

The Earth's surface is 500 million km^2. 

That amounts to 2000 Tzar Bomba per square kilometer. That's the equivalent of covering the Earth Surface with a square grid of Tzar Bombas set every 22 meters.

In my mind, if you are going to go after pork-barrel spending, then you better be ready to have the spending magnifying lens shoved right down your own throat. If your hill to die on is abortion, you better make sure your own record is clean when it comes to babies.

But even in the eighteenth century, legislators wanted to legislate, and states signed on in part because the Articles of Confederation were a useless disaster.  They wanted to preserve their own ability to legislate, certainly, and be unencumbered by much that was explicitly stated to not be in the provenance of Congress, but they also wanted the flexibility to make decisions and to legislate.  

They didn't have a central bank as we now know the Federal Reserve, for example, but apparently, while it took an act of Congress, it didn't take an amendment to the Constitution.  That wasn't in the original document.  Some still think it's therefore unconstitutional.  

The list is long of things people are ready to declare unconstitutional which may be stupid, may be irritating, may be not what the opinion holder wants, but which are constitutional.  FEMA and various insurance programs are being pointed to in this thread as unconstitutional.  That's nonsense.  

Lefties hate all kinds of corporate subsidies, bail-outs, no-bid contracts, etc.  I rarely see them say these are unconstitutional.  They are either ignorant of the Constitution and don't want to make claims about it, or they know they are indeed constitutional.  Our current methods of skirting declarations of war seem to be hardly what is provided for in the Constitution, but has been working apparently constitutionally for some time.  

But I certainly think the warrantless monitoring of electronic communications of Americans must surely be unconstitutional, which is why I say I'd like the fourth amendment back.

"reddit.com","t5_6","A few key points here:

* This is another example of abstinence-only education completely failing.
* Seeing that the article refereed to the soon-to-be father as a ""young man"", I'm going to assume he's also under 18, unemployed, and lacks a basic education.
* And one more time, seeing that Sarah Palin is such a huge advocate of abstinence-only education: **Abstinence-only education doesn't fucking work**.

Now, it's generally a safe assumption that the right-wingers will praise the 17-year old child as ""brave and courageous"" for choosing to have the child. And, of course, this will get twisted into a reason that abortion should be make 100% illegal.

And on a final note, can you image if Obama had an unmarried, uneducated 17-year old daughter that got pregnant? They'd blow a fucking gasket and go on about how ""Obama's family values are reflected in his out-of-control 17 year-old daughter that got knocked up without being married and is going to hell"".

Seriously, at this point I almost feel *embarrassed* for the Republican party.

Nation-states are ultimately abstract social divisions ruled by those with a monopoly on violence. All nation-states come about through war, bloodshed, and, most importantly, chance. 

Patriotism and country-loving is simply loyalty to a transient division of people, and loyalty to those who currently hold the rights to violence.

Samuel Johnson: ""Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.""

One reason to favour a smaller division over a larger division is if the people stand to benefit in terms of liberty and support. In the case of Alaska, those who want to secede seem to be those who will profit from oil in Alaska.

When one or two kids are found with incriminating evidence, then that is thrown in with all the BS evidence, and then the police use that ""body of evidence"" to justify their actions, it is deceit and propaganda. When the context in which some of these ""incriminating"" items is pointed out, it is obvious that the chief is deceitful and intent on spreading disinformation.

"technology","t5_2qh16","To begin with, the insulting tone was unnecessary. 

Second, how short sighted a comment is ""250gb should be enough for everyone"". It reminds me of another statement, ""640k should be enough for everyone"". The internet is the future, and indeed the present, of content delivery, and this cap does not serve to enable the adoption of that trend. As high definition media begins to replace standard (near DVD-Quality) media, do you believe that an internet offering of standard definition media would not be seen as sub-standard? 

When you take your math, which I did not bother to fact check, and scale it to hd bandwidth, which would be necessary to stay competitive, how many hours does that give us? HD can easily reach 18mbit, which is more than 4 times the figure you stated, which leaves us with 12 hours of video per month... wait... thats pathetic! Local news, international news ( I love the bbc ), the odd movie and sitcom and you'll notice you're quickly running up against your limit on video ALONE, not to mention what else you may do with your connection at home (Security cameras, VPNs, web browsing, internet radio, internet hosted backups of your data, etc).

As I stated in my original comment, my concern is not the sustainability of current applications, but the way the cap will stifle innovation and future commercial applications of the internet, to the advantage of our current content providers such as cable tv.

Peer to peer video streaming could open up the floodgates for independent media, but at 400kbit/sec, it faces serious obstacles before it can become viable. Imagine this, a company decides that they want to start a video stream of smaller theater productions. The cost of traditional streaming could be prohibitively expensive, but with peer to peer streaming, the bandwidth cost is shifted to the viewer. One person views and sends it out to two. Brilliant. Now anyone with content can start a tv channel without having to pay for bandwidth... except this cap illustrates the shortcomings of our current level of bandwidth. To receive a stream, and then distribute it to two other people, the stream must be 1/3 your total sustainable throughput. In this case, it would be a 266kbit stream. Not sufficient for a commercial operation. 

Another application that would benefit from higher bandwidth is the very lucrative multiplayer videogame market. To provide a richer experience, the game provider needs to push more data down the pipe. Textures and geometry, synchronization of hundreds, if not thousands of models. 

Furthermore, and most importantly, there are applications for additional bandwidth that haven't even been invented yet, which only exist in the mind of a developer, limited by today's infrastructure.

So go away with your argument of 'theres no need for that much bandwidth'. History has already proven you wrong.

A team of investigative journalist got several prominent political leaders to admit (gloat) about their leadership in that massacre, captured by hidden camera. This post made it to reddit front page several months back and has several informative comments about India's Militant Hindu Nationalist.

while this experimental-and arguably successful-system of governance has so many checks and balances in place, the position of President has much power-i.e., executive order and directive, and veto being two that are often reported...Commander-in-Chief of the Armed forces is another...

the balances only work when the people and their elected/selected leaders/servants are of good conscience and are willing to participate in continuing education, whether so-called formal or experience-based, built on certain principles and behaviours...

morality, ethics, responsibility, accountability, service, duty, humility...these are some of the parts of ""good conscience"" that i have been taught about...these cannot be legislated effectively...these are taught, with word and action, and nurtured and cultivated by the individual on a continuing basis...sincerity, thoughtfulness, and consistency (as opposed to *constancy*) are necessary components, as well...

all in all, it is careful, diligent teaching, thought, and practice which seem to be the objective solution to the shortcomings of our respectable and imperfect system...

I am not for them sabotaging the political process for their opinion of what is ""right"". Disliking the Republicans doesn't give them the right to stop the RNC, that is true fascism in the sense that this group is attempting to stop people that agree with Republican ideals from (peacefully) assembling.

This time let's read **[The Name of the Wind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind) by [Patrick Rothfuss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Rothfuss)**.

We've already done americana and dystopian philosophy, so fantasy seems like a logical next step.

It's Rothfuss's first novel and the first in the *The Kingkiller Chronicle* series. It also won a couple of awards: a [Quill Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill_Awards) and a [Publisher's Weekly Best Books of the Year](http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6496987.html#SF/Fantasy/Horror) award, both in the science fiction/fantasy/horror genre.

Here's a few places to get it:

* [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle-Day/dp/0756404746/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220289496&amp;sr=8-1) - $8
* [Your local library](http://worldcat.org/search?q=9780756404079&amp;qt=owc_search)

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Not true at all. 

You don't seem to grasp how many applications are in fact available for Windows.  If 1000 Windows applications work differently, it still wouldn't change the meaning of what I said.


Besides, the Ars Technica article doesn't contradict anything I said.  Nearly all of *work* in exactly the same way.  I'm not talking about the spacing between the letters, or the default themes.  I'm talking about the way they work.  If they didn't, I certainly wouldn't use them, because generally I can get in front of any Microsoft product (no matter how crap it is) and because of familiarity I'll know how to perform most of the major functions.


The image you posted is also very misleading because it uses takes different versions of applications from the same suite - eg.  Word 2007 (which has a ribbon) vs Office 2003 (which doesn't).  The menus in Visual Studio depend on what you're working on (just like in OS X) and it's got the menu disabled in Messenger and Media Player (press Alt or enable it permanently in the setup).  The article even states that it's showing the latest versions of the applications, but that doesn't mean much.  Even though they are the latest versions of those applications, they could have been released years apart (are they seriously comparing Notepad to Office 2007!?)


Someone else pointed out that the messages in Vista and XP are different (this is because of the new TaskDialog), but that also makes no difference - the applications still work in the same way.


I'm not saying Microsoft is without it's flaws (in fact, there are huge number of UI failures in Vista that this article doesn't even mention) but it's undeniable that nearly everything released for Windows (since about Win 95) works in exactly the same way.  That is an immense achievement giving the amount of software released by Microsoft, let alone the entire Windows application Universe.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Are you claiming that there is no journalistic bias?

And no, you are *assuming* that is what happened. When they conduct interviews with people who claim to have been victimized by the police, of course all the facts will mesh correctly to portray the police as being oppressors and the victims as being fully innocent. You can't avoid biased reporting if you get all your facts from one side, whether or not you mix in opinions.

As for examples... it's practically every thing posted on there. Take [this](http://The-UpTake.groups.theuptake.org/en/videogalleryView/id/641/) for example. The entire article is based on the word of the victims. No further investigation into motives, no perspective from the police, and no perspective from any non-victims.

Then you have quotes like this:
&gt;One of the group members said she asked the St. Paul police how far they have to be away from somebody to shoot a taser. The police officer told her they can be any distance. She had heard that if you’re too close they can be fatal or cause heart attacks. 

Apart from the fact that I do think that tasers have been fatal before (especially in cases where it's been used to repeatedly shock detainees) I don't think there is any basis for it being more fatal nearer than further. I went online and looked for some information, and what I found was that a taser shock at under 3 feet induces an effect known as ""drive stun"" that induces pain for compliance but doesn't incapacitate a target. But the quote tries to frame the officer as being unknowledgeable about the risks of his taser.

But hey, I guess I'll suffer downmods because fair journalism isn't what many other people on reddit wants to hear. Most seem to just want confirmation for their own beliefs, rather than supporting the uncovering of good evidence.

Seriously - how many people have stepped over a homeless person without thinking?  How many people vote for a presidential candidate who's happy to kill millions of foreigners or risk a world war for no good reason?  How many vote against simple things like universal state-funded healthcare for all?  How many people don't contribute to charity because they have to have the latest pair of trainers or cable package?  How many people sit at home and watch American idol instead of volunteering to help the needy, or starving?

All (real, contemporary) societies are ""sick"" in one way or other by *somebody's* standards.

Important: I'm **emphatically not arguing in favour of moral relativism, or excusing the barbaric nature of what was done to those poor girls in Pakistan** - it was utterly fucking disgusting.

However, I question your unthinking (and astounding) arrogance in assuming your (or our) culture is beyond criticism... or that there's some strong, impenetrable dividing line between the two.  We in the west are *quantitatively* different to Pakistan, but not *qualitatively*.

You look with abhorrence on the kind of disgusting shit that passes for ""acceptable"" in Pakistani tribal culture, but I guarantee you there are others in the future (hell, in other countries *right now*) who feel exactly the same about yours... albeit hopefully to a lesser degree.

Sure, I'd like to think the culture in the USA is a whole shitload better than cultures who cut the rose, or still stone people to death.

Still, some of us with national healthcare systems, an *informed* populace, a lack of unprompted wars of aggression and self-interest, no death penalty and/or no religious fundamentalist stranglehold on popular debate could make the argument that American (or any other western) culture seems beyond ""natural human feeling"" as well.

You people will effectively let someone *die* because they don't have medical insurance?  You'll actually allow your government kill people by the tens or hundreds... *even knowing* that statistically many of those you execute will be innocent?

Seriously - it's brutal to kill a few girls for wanting the right to self-determination... but is it *not* brutal to allow a tramp to die for want of a few meals or some simple health-care, or to allow kids to get pregnant in their teens - even from incest, or rape - because the only sex-education they're allowed is ""don't do it""... or to allow millions of foreigners to die because you can't be bothered to keep yourself informed and educated about what your country is doing in your name?

As I said, I'm only raising the question - I'm not even sure where I stand on it.

&gt; Just stop, chauss7. They got you.

What do you mean, they got me?  *Their story makes no sense.*  There is no way Sarah Palin was breaking her waters with a premature baby and giving political speeches and boading a flight!

From a comment on http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/apr/22/palins-flight-labor-falls-under-scrutiny//hour

&gt; I recognize that this all sounds like a conspiracy theory, but there are a few things out there that are pretty clear facts and born out by multiple sources:

&gt; (1) She announces she is pregnant at 7 months, and the AK press corps and fellow legislators profess, in multiple sources, surprise, since she's not showing in the slightest.

&gt; (2) She announces that she is pregnant with a special needs child.

&gt; (3) Her water breaks one month early before she is about to give a major speech. Her reaction is to give the speech and then be so obsessed with giving birth to her child in AK that she flies from TX to AK.

&gt; A flight that takes over 8 hours and through Dallas to Seattle to Anchorage. The entire time of which, should there be any major complications with her special needs child who is being born one month premature she is either (a) miles above the Earth or (b) miles above the Earth with no conceivable place to land.

&gt; Having already spent 8+ hours since her water broke, she then gets home, bypasses the Anchorage hospital and goes 50 miles to get to her town hospital.

&gt; In other words, this woman who is delivering a special needs child one month premature has gone anywhere from 8-10 hours between her water breaking and even stopping to accept any face-to-face medical care.

&gt; I realize that movies overdramatize the moment of your water breaking. I realize that it's not all running around, people panicking, heavy labor instantly beginning, etc. etc. etc.

&gt; But excuse me? Why would anyone, if they realistically WERE pregnant, put themselves or their unborn child in that position? Why would you put the other members of that flight in that position? The whole thing is just bizarre. I appreciate her wish that her child be born in AK, but something is off about this.

  The thing is, *has Palin been bullshitting the public about her alleged pregnancy, or not?*  That is the point!  A teenage pregnancy does not make a political scandal.  *Covering up a teenage pregnancy with a false adult pregnancy does make one.*

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Now as it happens, I have twice been charged with underage **drinking**, not buying alcohol or possessing alcohol but having it in my bloodstream. Additionally, I have a friend who was taken to the ER for a major cut while he was intoxicated and underage. He was also cited for the crime of having alcohol in his bloodstream. Apparently the receptionist called the cops when he told them how he was injured, and they showed up while he was in the ER waiting room. The cops didn't interfere with his treatment, but they did give him a citation which he would not have had if he had not gone to a hospital.

So fun fact #3: the penalty in the state of Texas for your third underage alcohol offense is a minimum of 30 days in jail and a $2000 fine. That might be trivial to *you*, and it is certainly trivial when weighed against a high probability of death. The problem is, if you aren't a medical professional, you probably cannot judge the severity of alcohol poisoning. And if you've been to many parties, you've probably seen many people who looked in a bad way come out just fine. No party or gathering which I've ever been to has led to someone dying, but there have been times when I thought they might be in danger. So in the judgment of a college drinker, the odds of death are low and the odds of criminal citation are high. It's a tough choice. We should make it *not* a tough choice, by giving amnesty to kids in medical emergencies and those who convey them to a hospital. Such an amnesty won't do dick to reduce the underage drinking problem, although I doubt it would increase it, but it would definitely decrease the number of deaths from underage drinking.","1220290960"

Even assuming they're rounding four and a half months up to five for Bristol's pregnancy, she would have to have gotten pregnant immediately after giving birth to Trig. 

If Bristol doesn't go in to labor in December, or loses the baby somewhere along the way, that may suggest that the whole thing was a cover up, but that can be hidden until after the election.

Another point is that Trig Palin has down syndrome. Young mothers have very low chances of having children with down syndrome (on the order of 1 in 1,000). Someone as old as Sarah Palin has a much higher chance of a down-syndrome baby, with odds around 1 in 35.

However, the fact that you just compared Gmail to a *standalone* mail client goes to my point:  at the point that Gmail came out, webmail programs were horrible clunky things.  Gmail set the standard of having webmail that behaved as well as standalone mail programs, and without just slavishly recreating the basic ""MS Office"" UI style, like Yahoo did when they finally overhauled their interface.

Not to mention, going from having insanely limited mailbox sizes to offering virtually unlimited storage was more than an ""incremental"" upgrade.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","My state, Texas, has trivial legal consequences until they stop being trivial, which is around the third time you get cited. A third underage drinking conviction in Texas carries 30 days of jail time and a $2000 fine. Additionally, if the person driving them is over 21 and the cops are in a particularly unfriendly mood, that person could be subject to charges of providing alcohol to minors, which in Texas involves driver's license suspension and several thousand dollars of fines. And in Texas, a driver's license suspension is serious trouble.

I can't make any judgments on the case at hand, I'm really not trying to defend the lady. I'm presenting a possible line of reasoning, because I think the legal consequences for being taken to the ER for alcohol poisoning need addressing. In the MADD rush to ban alcohol from everyone in the name of ""saving lives"", obvious avenues of saving more lives are being overlooked. In case you think it is an unlikely scenario, I have been an underage binge drinker in Texas, with two citations for drinking. I actually stopped drinking and going to parties until I turned 21 because I was so scared of the legal consequences, which is probably the point.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I know browsers are hard.  I'm not saying they aren't.  But that doesn't change how, from what we know so far, this appears to be a product completely devoid of innovation.  Honestly, it doesn't even sound like they're *trying*.  What do we have?  A slight improvement to the UI design, and a ""privacy button"" feature that, besides being a pretty obvious evolutionary step, is being implemented by ALL the major browsers.

And I guess the thing is, at the point that Google is cynically putting out inferior - or at least uninteresting - products and relying solely on their brand name to carry them, then their torch-carrying days really *have* passed.

I also worry that, as much as this seems to be ripping off all the features of Opera that FF and IE have not yet stolen, it could help push Opera off the stage entirely.  Which would be ironic, since for practically the last decade, it's been Opera that's actually been driving browser innovations.

1) It creates a system whereby the many exploit the few.  Thus, the person with no drive, ambition or desire to succeed can live off of the extra work, effort, and intellectual abilities of others.

2) Never forget that there's ALWAYS somebody that makes less or has less than you that is content with living at your expense.  If they are empowered by government to seize what you have or make, then what will be your incentive over the long term to produce or earn more?

"women","t5_2qh8d","I love the way they say it stops obscenity.  I also love how 99% of the time, a man is NEVER at fault for anything he does.  It is always the females fault.  She committed sin, she disobeyed the laws, she doesn't cover up properly, she talks to men, etc.  She has to do whatever is told to her, with no comment uttered from her and it's her responsibility to make sure the man doesn't get aroused, interested, or talks to her.  It's tradition.   They place such enormous responsibility upon the female, but don't allow them any responsibility in the real world.   I mean really, it's a do-what-your-told-or-you-die society for women.

As taken from Wikipedia:

""Social responsibility is voluntary; it is about going above and beyond what is called for by the law(legal responsibility). It involves an idea that it is better to be proactive towards a problem rather than reactive to it. Social responsibility means eliminating corrupt, irresponsible or unethical behavior that might bring harm to the community, its people, or the environment before the behavior happens.""

If a PIN gets compromised, you change it.

Furthermore, if you use a fingerprint for all accounts (bank, retirement, etc.) - you are potentially (depending on how they created the hash) screwed across the board, not just one compromised credit card account.

The same goes for all biometric security (blood, iris scan, etc.)  

Now, I'm not saying that all biometrics are bad, they just need to be used correctly.

 - Biometric for secure access to a closed loop system (NSA main office access, your car security system, etc.) - good use.  
 - Biometric for a credit card system - very bad idea.  (The system is distributed, has many points of access, and has a very poor track record for security, etc.)

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; Parents can tell if their children are not learning, and it should be parents who have the unilateral authority to remove their children, and the funds that go along with them, from a school. When this happens, first line supervisors are perfectly capable of tracking possible trends and evaluating performance.

No, when that happens, ignorant parents beget ignorant children, which bring the entire country down. If you're the kind of parent that would take your kid out of school because he or she isn't receiving a quality education then you aren't part of the problem to begin with.

The problem parents are the ones would be be like, ""$2,000 a year for schoolin' my kids! Hell, that's 100 bottles of Olde English 800!""

You can choose to say ""that's their problem"", but we live in the same country, so their problem quickly becomes your problem.

&gt; and the funds that go along with them

That only works if the educational funding scales linearly with the number of children. Economy of scale makes that number impossible to calculate.

A concrete example: a bus route has to go down a street as long as there is at least one child on it. Adding more children doesn't significantly add time to the route. How do you calculate the individual cost per child?

I believe transparent governing is exactly how the system should be.  I don't see it as spying, I see it as making sure that people with the means to do a great many bad things, as well as good for their country, don't get carried away with themselves.

absolute power corrupts absolutely

who will police the police?

OPEN &amp; TRANSPARENT is the ONLY way to ensure our freedoms and the future of democracy.

If you can't see that then you are blind.

As for you relating this to spying, there is a massive difference if the politician waivers CERTAIN RIGHTS (and we're not talking filming them walking down the sodding street) for the good of the people.

I would be really suspect of anybody that felt that pregnancy caused by rape was justification for abortion when it otherwise wouldn't be justified.

It would be like saying that murdering your loud neighbor is bad, except if the only reason you don't move is because somebody kidnapped you.  Yeah, it sucks you got kidnapped, but that doesn't give a free pass to murder your neighbor.

I imagine you don't think a fetus is a person.  In that case, it still doesn't make any sense to say that somebody saying outlaw abortion (even in cases of rape) is any more 'extremist' than somebody saying we should outlaw abortion (except in cases of rape).  It just shows that they have come to the natural conclusion of their belief that a fetus is a human and therefore worthy of the right not to be murdered.","1220292568"

&gt;The Qur'an plays a part in the texts they use, but it is but one - usually general, ambigious - text and its interpretation is conditioned by other texts and layers and layers of a long interpretive history.

If the Quran is ambiguous, that just begs the question - why would God communicate a message that can be interpreted to condone mass murder? As Sam Harris has said, it is precisely because such books are claimed to be holy that the bar is to be set exceptionally high for unambiguity. If a book is easily construed to justify murder, God couldn't have written it (or God doesn't deserve our praise - take your pick).  And if it really takes scholar upon scholar to explain Islam, doesn't that lend credence to one of the following two options: (1) God messed up and should have created something more simple for people to follow because look at how layers and layers of interpretation have gotten out of control, or (2) God had zero part in writing the Quran and Islam is pure delusion?

I think a rather salient point is you would have far less people willing (and excited) to kill themselves in suicide bombings, etc, if there were nothing to be personally gained by doing so. The Quran has very unambiguous claims that it is the most righteous to kill infidels, that worldly-like paradise (why is it so similar - shouldn't it be something *beyond* what we can imagine?) awaits martyrs beyond the grave.

[full text available from New Yorker if you sign up for accessmylibrary](http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32657700_ITM)

One day in September, 1962, a woman who here will be called Deborah Morlen showed up at the pediatric emergency room of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, carrying her four-and-a-half-year-old son, Matthew. He was spastic, and couldn't walk or sit up; as an infant, he had been diagnosed as having cerebral palsy and developmental retardation. The emergency room was in the Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children, an old brick building in the center of the Johns Hopkins complex, where a pediatric resident named Nancy Esterly saw Matthew. He had strange-colored urine, Mrs. Morlen told Esterly, ""and there's sand in his diaper."" Esterly removed the boy's diaper. It was stained a deep, bright orange, with a pink tinge. She touched the cloth and felt grit. She had no idea what this was, except that the pink looked like blood. She learned from Mrs. Morlen that Matthew had an older brother, Harold, who was also spastic and retarded. Harold was living at the Rosewood State Hospital, an institution for disabled children, outside Baltimore, while Matthew lived at home.

Since both brothers seemed to have the same condition, Esterly thought it likely that they had a genetic disease, but, if so, it wasn't one that she'd ever seen or heard of. Esterly also noted that Matthew was wearing mittens, even though it was a warm day. She admitted the little boy to the hospital.

Esterly took a sample of Matthew's urine, and both she and an intern looked at it under a microscope. They saw that it was filled with crystals. They were beautiful--they were as clear as glass, and they looked like bundles of needles, or like fireworks going off. They were sharp, and it was clear that they were tearing up the boy's urinary tract, causing bleeding. Esterly and the intern pored over photographs of crystals in a medical textbook. The intern asked if the crystals might be uric acid, a waste product excreted by the kidneys; however, cystine, an amino acid that can form kidney stones, seemed the most likely candidate. Esterly needed a confirmation of that diagnosis, so she carried the sample upstairs to the top floor, where William L. Nyhan, a pediatrician and research scientist, had a laboratory. ""Bill Nyhan was the guru of metabolism,"" Esterly told me.

Nyhan, who was then in his thirties, had been studying how cancer cells metabolized amino acids, in an attempt to find ways to cure cancer in children. ""It was one of my impossible projects,"" he said to me recently. Nyhan is now a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. ""I love working with kids, but dealing with pediatric cancer was depressing, saddening, and, in truth, maddening,"" he said. Nyhan ran some tests on Matthew's urine, using equipment he had designed. The crystals weren't cystine, or any sort of amino acid. They proved to be uric acid. A high concentration of uric acid in a person's blood can lead to gout, a painful disease in which crystals grow in the joints and extremities, particularly in the big toe. Gout has been known since the time of Hippocrates, and it occurs mainly in older men. Yet the patient here was a little boy. Nyhan had a medical student named Michael Lesch working in his lab, and together they went downstairs.

Matthew lay in a bed in an open ward on the second floor of the Harriet Lane Home. He was a spot of energy in the ward, a bright-eyed child with a body that seemed out of control. The staff had tied his arms and legs to the bedframe with strips of white cloth, to keep him from thrashing, and they had wrapped his hands in many layers of gauze; they looked like white clubs. Nurses hovered around the boy. ""He knew I was a doctor and he knew where he was. He was alert,"" Nyhan says. Matthew greeted Lesch and Nyhan in a friendly way, but his speech was almost unintelligible: he had dysarthria, an inability to control the muscles that make speech. They noticed scarring and fresh cuts around his mouth.

They inspected Matthew's feet. No sign of gout. Then the boy's arms and legs were freed, and Lesch and Nyhan saw a complex pattern of stiff and involuntary movements, a condition called dystonia. Nyhan had the gauze unwrapped from the boy's hands.

Matthew looked frightened. He asked Nyhan to stop, and then he began crying. When the last layer was removed, they saw that the tips of several of the boy's fingers were missing. Matthew started screaming, and thrust his hands toward his mouth. With a sense of shock, Nyhan realized that the boy had bitten off parts of his fingers. He also seemed to have bitten off parts of his lips.

""The kid really blew my mind,"" Nyhan said. ""The minute I saw him, I knew that this was a syndrome, and that somehow all of these things we were seeing were related.""

Lesch and Nyhan began to make regular visits to the ward. Sometimes Matthew would reach out and snatch Nyhan's eyeglasses and throw them across the room. He had a powerful throw, apparently perfectly controlled, and it seemed malicious. ""Sorry! I'm sorry!"" Matthew would call, as Nyhan went to fetch his glasses.

The doctors persuaded Mrs. Morlen to bring her older son to the hospital. Harold, it turned out, had bitten his fingers even more severely than Matthew, and had chewed off his lower lip. Both boys were terrified of their hands, and screamed for help even as they bit them. The boys' legs would scissor, and they tended to fling out one arm and the opposite leg, like a fencer lunging. The Morlen brothers, the doctors found, had several times more uric acid in their blood than normal children do.

Nyhan and Lesch visited the Morlen home, a row house in a working-class neighborhood in East Baltimore, where Matthew was living with his mother and grandmother. ""He was a well-accepted member of his little household, and they were very casual about his condition,"" Nyhan says. The women had devised a contraption to keep him from biting his hands, a padded broomstick that they placed across his shoulders, and they tied his arms to it like a scarecrow. The family called it the ""stringlyjack."" Matthew often asked to wear it.

Nyhan and Lesch also discovered that they liked the Morlen brothers. Lesch, who is now the chairman of the Department of Medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, in New York City, said, ""Matthew and Harold were really engaging kids. I enjoyed being around them.""

Two years after meeting Matthew Morlen, Nyhan and Lesch published the first paper describing the disease, which came to be called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Almost immediately, doctors began sending patients to Nyhan. Very few doctors had ever seen a person with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and boys with the disease were, and are, frequently misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. (Girls virtually never get it.) Nyhan himself found a number of Lesch-Nyhan boys while visiting state institutions for developmentally disabled people. When I asked him how long it took him to diagnose a case, he said, ""Seconds."" He went on, ""You walk into a big room, and you're looking at a sea of blank faces. All of a sudden you notice this kid staring at you. He's highly aware of you. He relates readily to strangers. He's usually off in a corner, where he's the pet of the nurses. And you see the injuries around his lips.""

William Nyhan is now eighty-one, a tall, fit man with blondish-gray hair and blue eyes. He has a laboratory overlooking a wild canyon near the U.C.S.D. Medical Center. One day when I visited him, two red-tailed hawks were soaring above the canyon, tracing circles in the air. In the years since he identified Lesch-Nyhan, he has discovered or co-discovered a number of other inherited metabolic diseases, and he has developed effective treatments for some of them. He figured out how to essentially cure a rare genetic disorder called multiple carboxylase deficiency, which could kill babies within hours of birth, by administering small doses of biotin, a B vitamin. Lesch-Nyhan, however, has proved to be more intractable.

Decades after the discovery of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, it is still mysterious. It is perhaps the clearest example of a simple change in the human DNA which leads to a striking, comprehensive change in behavior. In 1971, William Nyhan coined the term ""behavioral phenotype"" to describe the nature of diseases like Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A phenotype is an outward trait, or a collection of outward traits, that arises from a gene or genes--for example, brown eyes. Someone who has a behavioral phenotype displays a pattern of characteristic actions that can be linked to the genetic code. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome seems to be a window onto the deepest parts of the human mind, offering glimpses of the mechanics of the genetic code operating on thought and personality.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","H. A. Jinnah, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, has been studying Lesch-Nyhan syndrome for more than fifteen years. ""This is a very horrible disease, and a very complex brain problem,"" he said. ""It is also one of the best models we have for trying to trace the action of one gene on complex human behavior.""

A child born with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome seems normal at first, but by the age of three months he has become a so-called floppy baby, and can't hold up his head or sit up. His diapers may have orange sand in them. When the boy cuts his first teeth, he starts using them to bite himself, and he screams in terror and pain during bouts of selfmutilation. ""I get calls in the middle of the night from parents, saying, 'My kid's chewing himself to bits--what do I do?' "" Nyhan said. The boy ends up in a wheelchair, because he can't learn to walk. As he grows older, his self-injurious behaviors become subtle or more elaborate, more devious. He seems to be possessed by a demon that forever seeks new ways to hurt him. He spits, strikes, and curses at the people he likes the most; one way to tell if a Lesch-Nyhan patient doesn't like you is if he's being nice. (""I got beat up once by Matthew,"" Lesch told me. He had leaned over the boy and asked him how he was feeling, and Matthew had punched him in the nose.) He eats foods he can't stand; he vomits on himself; he says yes when he means no. This is self-sabotage.

A few hundred boys and men alive in the United States today have been diagnosed as having Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. ""I think I know most of them,"" Nyhan said. One boy, known as J.J., ended up living in Nyhan's research unit for a year, when he was eleven. He was a gregarious child, whose hands seemed to hate him. Over time, his fingers had got inside his mouth and nose and had broken out and removed the bones of his upper palate and parts of his sinuses, leaving a cavern in his face. He had also bitten off several fingers. J.J. died in his late teens; in the past, many Lesch-Nyhan patients died in childhood or their teens, from kidney failure. (Both Morlen brothers died young.) Nowadays, they may live into their thirties and forties, but they are generally frail and often die from infections like pneumonia. Occasionally, a man with the disease flings his head backward with such force that his neck is broken. Many Lesch-Nyhan patients die suddenly and often inexplicably.

A Lesch-Nyhan person may be fine for days, until suddenly his hands jump into his mouth with the suddenness of a cobra strike, and he cries for help. People with Lesch-Nyhan feel pain as acutely as anyone else does, and they are horrified by the idea of their fingers or lips being severed. They feel as if their hands and mouth don't belong to them and are under the control of something else. Some Lesch-Nyhan people have bitten off their tongues, and some have a record of self-enucleation--they have pulled out an eye or stabbed it with a sharp object. When the Lesch-Nyhan demon is dozing, they enjoy being around people, they like being the center of attention, and they make friends easily. ""They really are great people, and I think that's part of the disease, too,"" Nyhan said. Some Lesch-Nyhan people are cognitively impaired, while others are clearly bright, but their intelligence can't be measured easily. ""How do you measure someone's intelligence if, when you put a book in front of him, he has an irresistible urge to tear out the pages?"" Nyhan asked.

In 1967, J. Edwin Seegmiller, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health, and two colleagues discovered that in Lesch-Nyhan patients a protein called hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, or HPRT, which is present in all normal cells, doesn't seem to work. The job of this enzyme is to help recycle DNA. Cells are constantly breaking down DNA into its four basic building blocks (represented by the letters A, T, C, and G, for adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine). This process produces compounds called purines, which can be used to form new code. If HPRT is absent, or doesn't work, then certain purines build up in a person's cells, where they are eventually broken down into uric acid, which saturates the blood and crystallizes in the urine.

In the early nineteen-eighties, a group of researchers, led by Douglas J. Jolly and Theodore Friedmann, decoded the sequence of letters in the human gene that contains the instructions for making HPRT. It includes six hundred and fifty-seven letters that code for the protein. Researchers also began sequencing this gene in people who had Lesch-Nyhan. Each had a mutation in the gene, but, remarkably, nearly everyone had a different one; there was no single mutation that caused Lesch-Nyhan. The mutations had apparently appeared spontaneously in each affected family. And, in the majority of cases, the defect consisted of just one misspelling in the code. For example, an American boy known as D.G. had a single G replaced by an A--one out of the three billion letters of code in the human genome. As a result, he was tearing himself apart.

The HPRT gene is found on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes in each cell, and men have an XY pair. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that if a bad HPRT gene on one X chromosome is paired with a normal gene on the other X chromosome the disease does not develop. A woman who has the Lesch-Nyhan mutation carries it on only one of her X chromosomes--she doesn't develop the syndrome. Any son that she has, however, will have a fifty-per-cent chance of inheriting the syndrome, and any daughter will have a fifty-per-cent chance of being a carrier. (Examples of this type of disease include hemophilia and a form of red-green color blindness.)

Other genetic mutations have been associated with profound behavioral changes. Rett syndrome, which affects mostly girls, is caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for the MeCP2 protein. People with the syndrome compulsively wring their hands and rub them together as if they were washing them. Children with Williams syndrome have an elfin appearance, an affinity for music and language, and an extreme sensitivity to sound, and are very sociable. Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of a bit of code from chromosome 7. There is still great uncertainty, however, about how much of a role genes play in major conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Even where there is evidence of a family history of a disease, scientists are unsure how a single gene could choreograph a suite of behaviors. There are roughly twenty-five thousand active genes in the human genome, each with about a thousand to fifteen hundred letters of code. The genome could be thought of as a kind of piano with twenty-five thousand keys. In some cases, a few keys may be out of tune, which can cause the music to sound wrong. In others, if one key goes dead the music turns into a cacophony, or the whole piano self-destructs.

The havoc that the Lesch-Nyhan mutation causes can't easily be undone. Early on, Nyhan tried giving his patients allopurinol, a drug that inhibits the production of uric acid; it is effective with gout. It lowered the uric-acid concentration in Lesch-Nyhan patients, but it didn't reduce their self-injurious actions. The uric acid, it seemed, was another symptom, and not a cause of the behavior. Nyhan has experimented with other treatments, such as soft restraints, which seem to relax patients, and the removal of certain teeth. ""I'm profligate with those upper teeth,"" Nyhan said. Some dentists, though, refuse to extract healthy teeth, even when Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is explained to them.

I told Nyhan that I couldn't imagine what it would be like to live with the disease.

""You could ask someone who has it,"" he replied.

I first met James Elrod and Jim Murphy in the winter of 1999. They were living next to each other in rented bungalows in a somewhat marginal neighborhood in Santa Cruz, California. Elrod was then in his early forties, and Murphy was just over thirty. (Murphy died in 2004; Elrod, who is now forty-nine, is one of the oldest living people with Lesch-Nyhan.) The men were clients of Mainstream Support, a private company contracted by the State of California to help people with developmental disabilities live in community settings. Before James Elrod came to Santa Cruz, he lived for eighteen years in a state institution in San Jose. Murphy had lived for most of his life at an institution in Sonoma. Mainstream employees, called direct-care staff, stayed with Elrod and Murphy around the clock, to help them with daily tasks and to make sure they didn't harm themselves. Elrod and Murphy had the authority to hire and fire their assistants and direct their work, though an assistant could refuse an order if he thought that it would put the client in danger.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","That day in Santa Cruz, Murphy stared at me out of the corners of his eyes, with his head involuntarily thrown back and turned away, braced against a headboard. His hands were stuffed into many pairs of white socks, and his chest heaved against a rubber strap that held him in place. He started throwing punches at me, and he kicked at me. He seemed to be enduring his disease like a man riding a wild horse. The wheelchair shook.

I kept back. ""It's nice to meet you,"" I said.

""Fuck you. Nice to meet you."" Murphy had a fuzzy but pleasant-sounding voice. His speech was very hard to understand. He looked at Roth. ""I'm nervous,"" he said.

""Do you want to be restrained?"" Roth asked.

""Yeah.""

Roth placed Murphy's wrists and ankles in soft cuffs fastened with Velcro.

""I'm a little nervous, too,"" I said, and sat down on the couch.

""I don't care. Goodbye.""

I stood up to leave.

Roth explained, however, that this was one of those Lesch-Nyhan situations where words mean their opposite.

Later, Murphy tried to tell me what his disease was like. ""You try to tick everybody off, and then you feel bad when you do it,"" he said. ""If you get too close to me, I could--,"" he said; the ending was indecipherable.

""I'm sorry, what?""

""Coldcock you, Richard. I'll say, 'Get my water,' and I'll give you a sucker punch.""

A pair of red boxing gloves hung on the wall. Every day, his assistants placed him on a wrestling mat on the floor, where he rolled around and did stretches and then boxed with them. ""I could definitely whip you,"" he told me. I didn't doubt it.

There have been about twenty autopsies of Lesch-Nyhan patients over the years. Their brains appeared to be perfectly normal. ""It's a problem in the connections, in the way the brain functions,"" H. A. Jinnah, the Johns Hopkins neurologist, said. During some of the autopsies, doctors tested samples of brain tissue to see if they contained normal levels of neurotransmitters--chemicals that are used for signalling between nerve cells. In the Lesch-Nyhan brains, a lemon-size area containing structures called the basal ganglia, near the center of the brain, had eighty per cent less dopamine--an important neurotransmitter--than a normal brain. The basal ganglia are wired into circuits that run all over the brain and affect a wide range of functions: motor control, higher-level thinking, and eye movement, as well as impulse control and enthusiasm.

""People with Lesch-Nyhan have an excess number of involuntary movements,"" Jinnah said. ""It's as if they are stepping on the gas too hard when they try to do something. If you ask them to look at a red ball, for instance, their eyes go to everything except the red ball, and they can't explain why. Then, if you introduce a yellow ball into their field of view, but you don't say anything about it, they watch the yellow ball."" The moment you draw their attention to it, however, they look away.

""Lesch-Nyhan is at the far end of a spectrum of self-injurious behavior,"" Jinnah went on. ""We all do things that are bad for us. We'll sit down in front of the television and eat a quart of ice cream. We all have self-injurious impulses, too. Driving a car, we can have a strange impulse to drive it the wrong way and smash it into something."" Edgar Allan Poe called such promptings ""the imp of the perverse."" The imp may be signals coming out of the basal ganglia. Normal people feel the promptings of the imp, but most of the time they don't act on them. Lesch-Nyhan may suggest a way in which original thoughts and ideas seem to arise as impulses that aren't suppressed, and how intimate the terrain is between the creative and the self-destructive. ""Many people bite their fingernails,"" Jinnah said. ""They'll tell you it's gross and that they don't want to do it--'Sometimes I get nervous and start biting my fingernails,' they'll say. There are people who chew their lips nervously. Now let's turn up the volume a little: some people bite their cuticles. Turn up the volume a little more: some people bite their cuticles until they bleed. Now let's turn the volume way up. Now you have someone biting off tissue and bone in his fingers, biting off the whole finger, and chewing his lips off. Where, in this spectrum of behavior, is free will?""

In some ways, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome looks like Parkinson's disease reversed. People with Parkinson's have trouble starting physical actions, and are said to be hypokinetic. Lesch-Nyhan people start actions too easily, and can't stop an action once it starts; they are said to be hyperkinetic. Because Parkinson's is also associated with a deficiency of dopamine in the basal ganglia, scientists have looked to each disease for clues to the other.

In 1973, a researcher named George Breese, at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, was working with rats that modelled Parkinson's disease. He was treating newborn rats with compounds that changed the dopamine levels in their brains, when, to his surprise, the rats started chewing off their paws. He had inadvertently created a rat with Lesch-Nyhan symptoms. ""I'll not go further into the details of what the rats were doing. They weren't biting their mouth tissues, the way human patients do,"" Breese told me. If he gave the self-injuring rats another compound, they stopped biting their paws--that is, he found a way to reverse the symptoms. ""We treated the rat the moment we saw the animal make the first pinprick injury to its paws,"" he said. The compound, however, has never been approved for use on humans.

In April, 2000, a neurosurgeon at the Tokyo Women's Medical University named Takaomi Taira performed brain surgery on a nineteen-year-old man with Lesch-Nyhan. The young man was living with his parents in a district north of Tokyo. In addition to exhibiting self-injurious behavior, he had the spastic, stiff, thrashing movements of dystonia. ""These dystonic movements were getting more severe almost by the day, and his parents were getting desperate,"" Taira said to me recently. He decided to perform a procedure called deep-brain stimulation to try to calm down the movements.

Deep-brain stimulation was developed by doctors more than twenty years ago for treating people with Parkinson's disease. One or more thin wires are inserted through openings in the skull, and the wires are carefully navigated through the brain until they stop in a part of the basal ganglia called the globus pallidus (the ""pale globe""). The wires are connected to a battery pack, which is implanted under the skin of the patient's chest, and a faint, pulsed current of electricity runs through them into the globus pallidus, numbing a spot the size of a pea. The patient feels nothing. The procedure often helps to calm the tremors in Parkinson's patients' hands and limbs, and helps them walk more easily.

""After the surgery, the boy's dystonic movement completely disappeared,"" Taira said. He sent him home with the deep-brain stimulator, feeling that the operation had helped. Several months later, the young man's parents told Taira that he had stopped biting himself. He was still in a wheelchair, and his uric-acid levels remained high, but he was reading comic books and watching television, and seemed to be enjoying life as never before. ""It was completely unexpected, remarkable, almost unbelievable,"" Taira said. A few years later, the young man suddenly began biting his hands again, and the parents brought him back. ""I checked the device and found that the battery was flat. I replaced the battery, and his symptoms were controlled again,"" Taira said.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","A research group in Montpellier, France, led by a neurosurgeon named Philippe Coubes, has given deep-brain-stimulation implants to five Lesch-Nyhan patients. His method involves the insertion of four wires into the brain. ""So far, we have three patients who are doing very well and two who are having an intermediate response--the response of one of those is not poor but is not as good as the others,"" Coubes said. ""I'm not sure we will be able to control all their behaviors over the long term, but we are in the process of getting a better understanding of deep-brain stimulation for these patients."" The imp of the perverse can be put to sleep, but nobody knows how to make it go away.

Scientists aren't sure why deep-brain stimulation seems to work in some patients, or if it can help others; indeed, the results are a reminder of how obscure the workings of the brain still are. Nor is it clear what the risks might be. William Nyhan was cautious about the procedure's potential. ""I see these kids as fragile, and they don't respond very well to surgical invasions,"" he said.

At Johns Hopkins, though, Jinnah was anxious to begin a study on a group of at least eight Lesch-Nyhan patients using deep-brain stimulation. He still needs to secure funding and get approval from the federal government. (The procedure has not been specifically approved for Lesch-Nyhan patients.)

Jinnah has never had an easy time getting funding and attention for Lesch-Nyhan research. He says, ""People ask me, 'Why not study more common diseases?' My answer is that if we neurologists did that we'd all be studying Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and strokes. There are thousands of other brain diseases out there, and they're all orphans. But these rare diseases may teach us something new about the brain, something relevant to the common brain diseases which affect so many people.""

I went back several times to visit James Elrod and Jim Murphy, and began helping their staff with daily tasks. Elrod spat in my face a few times, and gave me a left jab to the jaw. Once, his Kevlarcovered fingers closed on my skin like pliers; he apologized while we both worked to get them loose. Murphy, at his thirty-third-birthday party, planted his face in his cake, and then punched me. Nevertheless, I came to like them a lot. Murphy had a passion for off-road driving, which he was not usually able to indulge. One day, in 2001, I showed up in Santa Cruz in a rented Ford Expedition with four-wheel drive. An assistant named Tracye Overby was with Murphy, while another, named Chris Reeves, was assigned to Elrod. I drove the group to a dried-out lake bed near Watsonville called College Lake, which we'd heard was a good place for four-wheeling. On the way, I stopped to get directions from a California state trooper. ""I would not advise going there with disabled people,"" he said.

College Lake turned out to be a mile-wide expanse of lardlike clay, covered with sand. The lake bed had a dark, wet-looking center, and was surrounded by thickets of willows. I edged the Expedition out onto the sand. ""Go faster,"" Murphy said. ""You're driving like an old lady."" I gunned the engine, the Expedition leaped forward, and we raced across the sand. When I turned sharply, the men roared with delight. I performed a figure eight, then aimed the vehicle toward the center of the lake and ran it up to full power. We passed the sunken carcass of a truck, buried up to its roof in clay. The Expedition slowed. Then it began tipping over, and I realized that we were driving across what you might call quickmud. If we stopped, we would go down. I floored the engine, but it was too late. The wheels began spinning, we came to a halt and sank up to the doors, and the engine stalled.

There was a moment of silence, and then Elrod and Murphy erupted with obscenities directed at me. The two helpers seemed unperturbed. ""This is just the nature of our work,"" Reeves said. ""Everything that you plan never goes as you planned it.""

After several tries on my cell phone, I reached a towing company that was willing to try to get us out, but it would need to be paid in advance, cash preferred, no results guaranteed.

""I'm nervous,"" Murphy said as we waited. Blood dribbled out of his mouth--he was biting himself. Overby lifted him out of the car, carried him across the sand to the shade of some willows, and sat down, holding him in her lap. She wiped his mouth with a napkin, cradled his head in her arms, and began singing to him. He began to laugh.

Elrod, sitting in the front seat of the Expedition, began laughing, too. The men were connoisseurs of what I had done: I had ignored the advice of a police officer and driven two disabled men at high speed into the mud. They saw something familiar in my behavior.

Three years later, in 2004, Murphy came down with pneumonia. When it became clear that he was dying, I called him to say goodbye. As he came on the line, I could hear voices in the background; more than thirty people had come to see him. ""I'll be all right,"" he said, and added, ""Take care with your driving.""

Another day, before Murphy died, I visited James Elrod. Tracye Overby, who was working as Elrod's assistant, needed to change the silk liners that he wears inside his motorcycle gloves.

Elrod did not like to see his bare hands. He asked me to hold his wrists while Overby removed his gloves. The hands that emerged were pale, with spindly fingers that had been gnawed close to the bone in places, and a finger was missing. ""Danger,"" he said. His eyes took on a strange, bright, blank look. He was staring at the right hand. His arm was tense and trembling. As if a magnet were pulling it, the hand moved toward his mouth. ""Help!"" he called in a muffled voice.

We threw ourselves on Elrod. It took all our strength to restrain his hand. As soon as we got control of it, he relaxed. Overby got the gloves back on.

""Nobody knows about this disease. Every day I'm hoping for a cure,"" Elrod said. ""I wanted you to see that.""","1220292886"

it's not about ""spreading democracy"" that's just one of the ""pillars of truth"" (aka lies) told to a nation in order to motivate it to act for a common goal.  The other ""pillar of truth"" is religion.

The idea of neoconservatism is that a nation is better off with an enemy so if an enemy doesn't exist then they need to manufacture one.  Having an enemy creates an US vs Them mentality and in their world view and theory unites the country against a common foe.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I appreciate your thoughtful response.  I suspect that whether we substantially agree or disagree depends upon details and subtleties that are too difficult to convey on an forum such as this.

A couple points:  there are statements that, in a logical sense, may be vacuous, but have emotional content that is not vacuous.  Emotions are real, and they contain information.  As such, the extent to which such a statement may be judged as ""true"" or ""false"" lies beyond the scope of logic and empirical testing.  This is the essence of what I am trying to convey.  We, in this society, collectively delude ourselves that rational thought is the only means of obtaining truth in any form.  This is our epistemological flaw.  While this is wildly successful at discerning truths of certain types, it is a dismal failure in discerning others.

If you have spent any time digging into your own subconscious, you may know that the various deities, which indeed have no external meta*physical* reality (in that point I am in full agreement with you), nevertheless possess profound power in ways our current level of scientific understanding cannot begin to imagine.  This is true, uncannily, at the resolution of the individual, and even more true at the social level of aggregated human behavior.  Because of my own (unexpected) experience in these matters, I have come to the conclusion that these *whatever you want to call them* are fundamental aspects of ""consciousness"", perhaps even fundamental properties of the cosmos itself.  I do not rule out the possibility of proving this empirically, though I strongly suspect for various reasons beyond the scope here that this is impossible.  It lies in a subjective domain that is apparently inaccessible to science.

FWIW, I am a scientist by profession, of the grant-funded, medical variety.  I am not ignorant of the methods of science, and it is perhaps for that reason that I am aware of the epistemological limitations and carry what I hope is a certain humility about what may possibly exist in the universe.

There is quality about this that you either see it or you do not, like one of those optical illusions that illustrate cognitive multistability.  I don't think there is anything *wrong*, per se, with not seeing things the way I do, but I feel very strongly that every individual should be free to explore this dimension of humanity without coercion.  The dominant theist voices in the political arena (you know who you are) are obvious offenders here, but there are atheists who would also exert a more subtle form of coercion in another direction.

In any case, I think it's a different matter from the atheism of Stalin or the Islam of bin Laden, because Hitler's reduction in his meat intake was largely spurred by concerns about his personal health. So it was less a matter of ""this is my moral philosophy"" and more a matter of ""when I do this, I'm not in as much pain""-- and therefore would be hard to connect to a vegetarianism done for morality.

Now, granted, there are actual studies that show that a human isn't mentally mature until well into their twenties. At the same time, though, the world pretty much opens up for you at 18. There's something seriously wrong with the way we, as individuals and as a national community, are preparing young adults for the responsibility of adulthood.

In Texas (where I live) the buffer zone is 3 years so seniors in high school can still have sex with freshman (AoC in Texas is 17). Essentially what I'm trying to say is that the age of consent is irrelevant. Getting pregnant at age 17 is generally undesirable, but it might be a cry for attention because politicians tend to be busy.

That's what I thought before I knew of this latest episode in the Palin family saga, but now I'm sure because McCain says he knew of it before he selected Palin.

This announcement is a ploy to make low-information voters think that liberals are anti-family. Don't take the bait, Dems! Palin is such a bad choice for the Republicans, there's no need to even think about her family (improper meddling in Alaska government by her husband excepted).

"religion","t5_2qh39","I understand all that you have written, and I have no argument with your theology as written.  However, there is a big difference between accepting the viewpoint of a fellow Redditor, and that of one who stakes their livelihood and reputation publicly in making the same comments you make.  For that reason, I asked for an outside source.

As to your second point, you say:

&gt;but I expect that all denominations can agree on what ""You shall not commit adultery"" means.

That is actually a matter of debate that extends beyond ""denominations"" going into historic disagreements with the Catholic Church (for example).  You may recall that King Henry VIII went against the Catholic Church by splitting the Anglicans off from them.  So I ask the common question (and I know this does not pertain to McCain): is it adultery to divorce a spouse and marry another, particularly if there is no sex shared with the new couple until after marriage?

Also, perhaps McCain is a purported ""sinner"", but can it be possible that he become ""forgiven"" of that sin, such that he is now suitable to be President in the eyes of God?

&gt;you're certainly welcome to your own opinion.

I do not subscribe to your final statement because of a number of reasons.  First, it implies condescension on the person uttering it, declaring with some end-of-argument kind of wording that ""I think I'm right and that you're wrong"".  Second, Since we are talking about ""sins"", the absolute nature of such things precludes our ""opinion"" from really mattering at all.  ...but I digress only for discussion's sake...

As to the ""relative virtues/sins"" issue, the Bible says ""do not be drunk with wine, for that leads to dissipation"".  If so, is Obama's teenage action as a ""druggie"" acceptable for one who aspires to the Presidency?

And while we're at it, Exodus 22:21-25 states that a man who injures a woman, who subsequently gives birth prematurely, must pay restitution for the injury according to the father's wishes.  But if the baby is injured in any way, then ""life for life"" applies.  That lifts the value of the unborn baby's life to being equal with the life of adults.  If so, then ""thou shalt not murder"" applies.  If Obama is supportive of abortion for pregnant women, is that not complicit with murder?  You can rule it out, but then you rule out one of the Ten Commandments.  Please keep in mind that modern law (largely derived from Scripture) values conspiracy to commit murder as equal to the act itself.

Also, since God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for their ""gay unions"", and cursed one of Noah's sons for same (gay and incestuous), then Obama is also supportive of an ""abhorrent"" act.

If you wish to rule these out, perhaps I can rule out McCain's adultery and his fits of anger, calling the latter a ""just behavior"" considering the ""war"" that his enemies are waging for the moral authority, etc. etc.","1220294106"

This is an interesting statistic if you can site your source, but right now I have no reason to believe it.  If you provide a reference, I'll read it.  

1)  You're right, and that's why communism doesn't work, but I didn't suggest communism.  I don't understand why you jumped to communism... just because you are extremely conservative doesn't mean I'm extremely liberal.  (I didn't mean that as a slanderous remark, I think you identify as extremely conservative and would embrace the label.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong there.)  
  
2) I agree there are always a few people that will try to game the system, that's human nature.  

When you live off the system it's not as if you have money enough to buy lots of toys or go out all the time, you just get enough to live on.  I'm pretty sure you can't buy an XBox with food stamps.  

But as I was saying... there will always be a select few that try to game the system.  In the case of extremely hands-off business policy, those few will be on the top.  This can have much more serious and detrimental affects to society, as gaming the system can be used to accumulate substantial power.  In a more controlled system, those gaming the system will be at the bottom and won't be able to do a substantial amount of damage as individuals.  

I don't have a ""disdain directed toward those with wealth"", but history has shown time and time again that the upper class won't take care of the lower class simply because they want to.  It just doesn't happen.  Sure there's the odd philanthropist, but I don't think that's the majority case.  The reason for this is pretty straightforward:  one method for accumulating substantial wealth is through extremely shrewd business practices.  You don't get rich by giving your money away.  

From my perspective, you seem to have a disdain for the lower class:  you exemplify this by making it apparent that you think that the poor are always out to get the rich:
&gt;there's ALWAYS somebody that makes less or has less than you that is content with living at your expense.

This is probably true for some individuals, but I'd hardly consider it the overwhelming trend.  Actually many people I know that come from low income backgrounds don't think this way and don't want to be on welfare for one simple reason:  it's an embarrassing and pathetic lifestyle.  You don't just get food delivered to your door when you're on welfare, you go down to your grocery store and you hand the cashier your food stamps.  You look them in the eyes and you feel judged, like you're worthless and they're looking at you with contempt.  People have dignity, but you seem to think that everyone is lazy and greedy.","1220294347"

&gt;I think you're being ignorant; not everyone has the same resolve and not all of us can choose to stop liking something

Look, I still like the feeling drinking gives me, and I like the feeling pot or coke or vicodin gives me. I don't claim to not enjoy those feelings anymore. 

Now, instead of downing enough to black out, I am proud of my sobriety, and wish to keep it that way. I wanna see the days, and months and years get added on to when I have last had a drink. That's what I mean my obsessive about sobriety. 

&gt;or fake ourselves into liking something that sucks.

Look, you can keep that attitude. Have fun being fat as balls when you are older, impotent at an early age, and immobile. I say fuck that. 

Guess what? Sometimes the process towards something good is sucky. You delay instant gratification for a greater whole. It's not as easy to be healthy as it is drunk. 

My advice doesn't apply to all, but your advice is self defeat and it sucks. I can't believe I was downmodded for saying ""We control our own destiny.""

"reddit.com","t5_6","As the child of a 16, and 17 year old, who is earning an ivy league graduate degree in a couple months I have to disagree. The reasons why people no longer have children at 17 are not moral, or biological, they are financial. Go back 150 years in your family, and take a look at when everyone was having babies. Seventeen was fairly normal. These marriages  had much higher success rates despite this fact. Biologically, and mentally a seventeen year old is quite capable of taking care of babies, they did it for thousands of years.

Where it is a huge issue today however is financially. Having a child so young makes it all but impossible to graduate college(my dad managed a law degree after having five children by the age of 26, but I have never seen another similar example). The odds that a 17 year old mother will end up lower class for life are quite high.","1220294484"

Of course you can add new methods: but you can add new methods in any sufficiently powerful language, regardless of the dispatch mechanism used. All multiple-dispatch does is make this more natural.

This doesn't break encapsulation (for most definitions of encapsulation), an object still encapsulates the concept; you don't need to know about its implementation; you operate on it using the defined behavior.

What you know about an object changes at runtime. If you can accept that there's more to the object than what you can see then the extension process is nothing more than learning more about the object. This is a powerful feature, not a problem to be solved.

If you want to talk about breaking encapsulation look at standard inheritance. It's been understood that standard inheritance breaks encapsulation in a dangerous way for many years, but that doesn't seem to bother anyone.


Polymorphism is latin for multiple-forms. How this is implemented is exactly that, an implementation detail. It doesn't effect the concept in any real way. There's polymorphism (dispatch based on the signature of the behavior) and polymorphism (dispatch based on the signature of the behavior).","1220294494"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Ah but the part where you're mistaken is that it's the DAUGHTER's fault. They did everything right as parents in my opinion.

Except that this is a story that plays itself out over and over.  At some point, it has to be asked, ""how's that working out for you?""  And the answer is, it's not.

It's like saying that I made sure my child knew to check for a green light when she crossed the road, so it's not my fault if she's killed by a driver who ran the red.  It may not be my fault, but my child would still be dead.  The way to avoid that is to make sure your child knows how to protect herself, even when things aren't happening the way they're supposed to - by watching out for traffic, or by using safe sex techniques.

A parent's responsibility is to try to protect their children and help them make good choices, not throw them to the wolves of their own biological urges and the underdeveloped executive function of the teenage brain.

&gt; Do you really believe a 17 year old girl doesn't know what a fucking condom is? Give me a break.

That's just ignorance on your part, I'm afraid.  It's been demonstrated repeatedly and conclusively that when children are taught safe sex techniques, incidents of unwanted pregnancy are significantly reduced.  It's not necessarily that they don't know what a condom is (btw for an upstanding moral person, you sure swear easily), but rather that making the leap to actually using contraception benefits from education.

&gt; I don't blame parents, I blame irresponsible teenagers.

More ignorance.  Study some human biology and psychology, and think about the implications of that.  We developed science for a reason, which was to help us understand the world around us, as well as ourselves.  Your self-righteousness does *not* do you credit.","1220294538"

In fact, I actually think we might be able to pull such a thing off. I mean, it takes only a couple of the greatest minds on earth to come together and throw around some ideas. And, there are so many people on earth that we could try a lot of things simultaneously. One group could focus on building the best (or the worst) nuke ever, while another group could experiment with bringing life to Mars/Venus/the Moon (even only a few micro-organisms), while yet another group would try to slow the earth down in its orbit around the sun.

Truthfully, I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean by this.

&gt;Culture requires outside influences in order to change. They don't ""evolve"".

[What?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution)

&gt;Saying British rule repressed an ""evolution"" of a culture is a complete pile of bull. These people held onto their culture throughout British rule. It was never distinguished.

Let's put it like this. The British people came and made the rules that the Indian people had to live with due to Western philosophy. While some of the elites of India learned Western philosophy and while there was some Western cultural influences that spread through all of India, for the most part Indians were kept ignorant due to the British wish for keeping opposition down. In this time, the culture in non-colonized places was allowed to grow in its own right and develop less repressing practices. On the other hand, in India, political and philosophical growth was hampered by the British wish to repress the Indian people. Instead, British controlled education focused on promoting teaching certain elites that the Britons were the ones who brought in all positive cultural ideas and Indians brought in all negative cultural ideas. This created a class of people Indians who held contempt for most Indians but full of admiration for England. Once the British people left, the Indian people had to restart the education and ruling system and had to restart Indian cultural growth. 

This same thing happened with the economic system. The British people created an economic system that functioned based off of British rule and feudalism with British companies at the head. Once they left, there were few people who were qualified to run the economic systems and the Indian people economically floundered because their entire system was based on producing goods and sending them to European nations. Since the Indian people only knew how to produce goods at first, they were forced to make deals with Western nations that exploited the Indian people (many of those deals are similar to ones that are currently set up in many previously colonized nations) and the Indian people suffered greatly.","1220294660"

Honor killings happen often in Pakistan, but once they're brought to light (and bringing it up in Parliament would certainly qualify) and start garnering bad publicity, the government steps in and does something about it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Could be either, as I see it...it's a bit of a silly distinction you're trying to draw, but I'll play along. To extend the sketch a bit:

Let's grant the existence of some ""platonic"" systems (denoted by P, P'), of which our logical systems are (partial) descriptions. We can't know P  (""the system itself) but through our own models of it (""our knowledge about our system"" like L and L', etc).

The (loose and sloppy) definition of emergence I gave above was about the logical systems, and made no claims about the systems themselves. We have *many* options to try extending the definition, listed in roughly ""strongest-&gt;weakest"" (for all of them: L is a (partial) description of P, L' is a partial description of P'):

*Non Probabilistic*

* P emerges from P' if every L emerges from every L'
* P emerges from P' if every L has at least one L' it emerges from
* P emerges from P' if there is at least one L that emerges from every L' 
* P emerges from P' if every L' has at least one L that emerges from it
* P emerges from P' if there is at least one L' from which every L emerges
* P emerges from P' if there is some L that emerges from some L'

...probably missing some options, and for fun repeat the list with ""every"" replaced with ""*most*"" or ""*almost every*"", and for even more fun repeat both lists and replace ""emerges"" with ""*usually*"" or ""*almost surely emerges*"".

It should be apparent there's a lot of ways to try and extend that loose, sloppy definition of ""emergence"" to cover not only logical systems (""our knowledge about hte system"") but also (""the system itself"").

Now to answer your question.

On the one hand, some of the above definitions are more consonant with your proposition: ""emergence"" is a property of L and L', not P and P'. For example, if we pick the ""P emerges from P' if every L emerges from every L'"", then we get the following scenario:

* to show P emerges from P' we have to show every L emerges from every L'
* if we only know of *some* Ls and some L's, and it's true that every *known* L emerges from every *known* L', then we can safely make the provisional claim ""so far as we know, P emerges from P'""...but this statement is contingent on our knowledge, and isn't necessarily true of the ""system itself"" (there could be efficiently-translatable L and L' that we don't know about, which'd undercut the claim P emerges from P' if we knew about them)

Some of the other suggested definitions would also allow you to make a defensible claim that ""emergence"" is a property of our knowledge about our system, not the system itself...details left as an exercise to the reader.

On the other hand, even there there's an underlying semantic issue that makes the distinction you're trying to make more one of aesthetics...using the same definition of ""emergence"" I just used to support your claim, let's look at it this way:

* to say P emerges from P' every L has to emerge from every L'
* all known L emerge from all known L'

...therefore, it is an abstract property of P and P' that coupled with the amount of knowledge we currently have (quantitifed, say, using some technique analogous to kolmogorov complexity, ie: shortest program that outputs our knowledge) that P emerges from P'. In other words: the fact that a property appears to hold, given K knols of knowledge, is at once a statement about our knowledge of the system and a statement about the system itself.

...with a lot of work I'm sure you can salvage some of the distinction you're trying to make -- and don't get me wrong, in an informal context I know what you mean in your statement -- but I think you'll be surprised how much work it'll be to formalize something like the distinction you're trying to make (and watch out for recursion: if you accept the distinction between knowledge of a system and systems, and assume systems are not directly knowable, you've got a tremendously deep infinite regress to watch out for).","1220294984"

You can't test my ""Nessie is a space alien"" theory - are you arrogant for calling me wrong?  There are plenty of untestable theories, either in principal or practice that most people are fine with dismissing.

&gt;But come on, man, you're honestly going to sit there and say ""I'm right about God, your position is wrong..."" like you have all the answers about the universe and existence, and then tell me you're not acting like an arrogant ass?

I'm saying I don't *have* to have *all* the answers to say a position is most likely wrong.  I believe that given the current evidence (none), that the correct position on the existance of God is *exactly the same* as the correct position for the existance of Vampires, unicorns and all the rest we have zero evidence for - ie. that it doens't exist.

&gt;You think you are the only one seeking the truth about reality?

Note the word ""If"".  I was responding to your question ""And what's wrong with believing that God could exist just as much as it could NOT exist?"" - explaining why some beliefs are better than others.

&gt;which is why why I hold the position that I cannot rule out existence or nonexistence. ...But do you hear me calling your beliefs as inferior to mine?

You just did.  ""Which is why"" implies that the reasons you hold that belief are because you think it is the best one for revealing the truth - ie. superior to mine.  If you didn't think my belief was inferior to yours, and *still* held it, that would be very odd indeed.

&gt;You choose to be atheist because you don't believe god exists.

Thats an odd way of putting it.  I don't believe God exists because of the reasons given above.  That places me in the category of ""atheist"".  If you don't believe in God, there is no further *choice* not to be an atheist.

&gt;Now, I could sit here and tell you that you are just WRONG (like you are to me), but that would only make me look like the arrogant ass. Why? Because you know damn well that I cannot absolutely prove you to be wrong.

And?  If you want absolute proof for *anything*, you'll be waiting a long time.  Here in the real world, we have to make judgements based on incomplete information.  The choice must be what we think is *most likely*.

&gt;And if you do think that this question is somehow proven without a doubt, then you're not just arrogant, but stupid.

""proven without a doubt"" is a complete misrepresentation of what I've been saying.  I think lying about my viewpoint is a lot more likely to make you look like an ass than just calling me wrong.  Here's what I posted above.  Read it again.

&gt;&gt;The words ""belief"" or ""disbelief"" do not require ""no possibility"" of being wrong - if they did, they would be pretty useless words, as you can't say anything with literally no possibility of being wrong.  A belief is simply something you currently consider to be true. a disbelief is something you currently consider to be false.","1220295288"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Not having sex has worked out fine for me.  I was even raised with the notion of ""If your gonna do it, be safe about it.""  

That analogy doesn't work because what can you control when you aren't around the child.  Also there is no ""Running a red light"" when choosing to have sex or not.  In that case it would be neither the parent nor the child's fault but the driver who ran the red light.

As a matter of fact your analogy better works as if you're saying the lights green you can go ahead and do it (Have safe sex), but there's a chance someone will hit you with a car (get pregnant, stds).  But in reality you should look for cars, not the light. (Don't have sex).

Who's protecting their child the one who says you can do it but there's a risk or the one who says you'll be 100% safe if you don't do it.  (Condoms aren't 100% effective, Contraceptives don't stop STD's).

Everything I have found to suggest Palin is against birth control seems to focus on her association with Feminists For Life, which [takes no stance](http://www.feministsforlife.org/FAQ/index.htm#contraception) on birth control, and recognizes that members may have differences of opinion on the subject.

- Her beliefs and upbringing condemn birth control and abortion. No doubt her 'sex talk' didn't include safe sex, but rather, 'no sex'. Her absolute belief in abstinence is likely to blame for this situation

"religion","t5_2qh39","First, let me thank you for your reasonable and intelligent response.  It's a rare thing to be able to have a mature discussion of any issues related to faith these days in a secular forum, especially on reddit.

I want to start by mentioning that my reading of your previous comment led me to believe that you were of the opinion that an average person's interpretation of Scripture was inherently not worth considering.  I think now that this may not be your opinion at all, but maybe just a misunderstanding of the intent of the post.  The real intent was to state my position, and see what other people had to say on the topic either way.  This is why I posted it in the religion subreddit, and not politics, because I wanted this to be a discussion from a largely Christian point of view.  So again, I thank you for participating in the desired manner, especially with this last post.

You have a good point regarding the definition of adultery.  I suppose I hadn't considered that instance because I didn't believe it applied to the topic at hand.  In McCain's case, it is my understanding that he was already sleeping with another woman while still married to his first wife, so the point about divorce would be moot in this case.  We could discuss the topic further but I believe it would be a significant digression so I'll leave that for another conversation.

I also appreciate your pointing out the fact that a person's forgiven past is not something we should hold against him, especially if he has repented of that past.  I have only seen minor reference to McCain's opinion about his adultery but what I did see made mention that he considered it to be a mistake, so I suppose I should not hold that against him any more than I hold Obama's drug use in his youth.

Unfortunately I have to cut this post short but please respond briefly to remind me to continue it later today, I would like to finish responding to all of your points.  The last thing I'll say for now is that my mention of having your opinion was not at all meant to be condescending and I apologize if it came off that way.

Until later...","1220295740"

A woman can walk into an establishment and command a literal army of penii. All the have to do is show a little interest and they are walking home with a penis. They don't even have to try. They have all the power and they know it. They play their helpless girl memes and get anyone to pay for them one way or another.

Oh, how they would be humbled if they did have a penis. No more would they command the attention they crave when they walk into a club or bar. No longer would they have the power to have sex with anyone, at any time, for any reason. They wouldn't understand the rejection after they put so much time and effort into a catch.

I really don't think women could handle the rejection. They are so used to getting what ever they want. Eventually they would slip into the repressed idea that all women are evil and should not be trusted, for any reason. Just like the rest of us. Treat em like meat and they will return the favor.

There was nothing of substance to attack Chelsea on and it's not about attacking Bristol, it's about pointing out Sarah's hypocrisy.

Bristol's unwed pregnancy makes framing Sarah's ""Christian values"" and character much, much easier. Bristol is the victim... Sarah's is the negligent hypocrite with a family that's out of control.

You forget that divorce was illegal, and that infidelity on the males part was a societal norm. Happiness for a women, or even the ability to choose a spouse, was never given any thought. It wasn't until the freedom of women through birth control that women were truly free, like men, and not slaves to their bodies.

You make the errenous assumption that woman a thousand years ago were raised the same way they are now.

A seventeen year old a thousand years ago WAS a woman. She had been raised and taught and treated like a woman. She would be dead by thirty, thirty five at the latest. She was an adult in her prime.

Today, we raise girls to be girls. We don't treat them as adults or expect them to be adults at seventeen. We don't give them bills, responsibilities or any of the pressures that adults have.

First comment:

Sue Williams (12:31:50) :

To the person who commented on Sarah’s hair - no, it’s what happens when one has hair extensions - which Sarah, at one time, don’t know about now, had.

Re: babygate - I don’t know what’s being reported. Here, however, is the truth. Trig is Sarah and Todd’s baby.

When Sarah first learned she was pregnant, it was shocking and overwhelming. While she and Todd had not planned to have anymore children, it is common knowledge among their family and friends that neither of them ever surgically insured that they wouldn’t have any ""late in life"" surprises/blessings.

This, to me, showed a disturbing lack of judgement. If you want to ask the citizens of a state to let you run the state for four years, to me she and Todd should have thought ahead and determined that the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy wouldn’t have been prudent for either the child, their family, their extended family (who are the ones who end up helping them raise their current four children) or the citizens of the state.

They either didn’t think this through, or didn’t care. Not sure. But, either way, to me and to others, it was a lack of foresight and judgement.

But it is the same vein - this lack of judgement - Sarah showed, on the campaign trail for governor, when asked who would raise her children should she win, she promptly stated that Todd would quit his job and stay at home with the kids (Todd works a ""Slope"" week on/week off schedule).

Sarah was elected and then - whoops. Todd didn’t like the stay at home gig - so Sarah, citing they needed money for the kid’s college (even though Track enlisted in the military) said Todd was returning to work. When asked about her statements on the campaign trail about how Todd would quit his job, Sarah said she’d actually never talked to him about what they would do if she was elected (in terms of his employment) and that she’d spoken out of turn when she spoke for him stating he’d quit his job.

Again, call me picky, but this is the kind of bizarre judgement Sarah routinely displays. Are you kidding me that she would run for governor and she and her husband would somehow not think to have a conversation about what to do with their four school aged kids? That’s insane. So, either her judgement is super goofy, or she wasn’t telling the truth. Either way, it’s not reassuring to now think this is someone who would be one 72 year old heartbeat away from having to call shots for the country/world.

So Todd trots himself back to work and Sarah is busy traipsing around the state and the nation. The kids are ""farmed out"" (this is the word used by thier associates in ""the Valley"") to family and friends to raise while Todd and Sarah are off having their respective careers (Sarah is famously quoted as saying, ""My mom does whatever I need her to"").

During this period is when Bristol, Sarah’s sixteen year old daughter, turns up pregnant. So, it’s kind of interesting to note that the Republican Vice Presidential Nominee and her sixteen year old junior in high school unwed daughter were carrying babies at the same time. Once Bristol’s condition became more obvious this summer, she was whisked out of sight and hasn’t been seen in public until yesterday in Ohio. This is why Trig’s blanket was strung across her entire abdomen and torso, but, when she walked down the stairs from the stage, in a profile shot, it was very clear to see she is well into her third trimester of her pregnancy.

It has come out in the past couple of days that she and her high school boyfriend had a quickie wedding and that she is home schooling her senior year.

The Anchorage Daily News has known about this for months - and haven’t touched the story. But I can’t imagine the national press or the Democratic Party will be as willing to turn a blind eye.

For me, once again it speaks to judgement. We all - every single one of us - even Sarah’s closest friends in the Valley (I know, I’ve been speaking to them) know she is in no way qualified for this position. At all.

But then, why would she accept the nomination, knowing that Bristol’s situation will come to light and knowing her hunger for national and international acclaim and attention will carry with it a mighty high price for her seventeen year old daughter who had absent parents last year and who turned up pregnant.

How embarrassing will it be for Bristol once the news (or the baby) comes out and not just the Valley, not just Alaska, not just the USA - but Bristol will be known the world over as the seventeen year old unwed - then quickly wed senior-in-high-school-homeschooled-teenage mom and daughter to the Republican Vice Presidential Nominee?

How hard will that degree of scrutiny and shame be?

How does one do that to one’s daughter?

How does one dash about the country for the next 66 days trying to pull off an image of the devoted mother of five when she, by and large, isn’t the one raising them and when one of them - her daughter, is in a truly vulnerable point in life; not to say anything about the needs of Trig. But maybe he doesn’t count, except as a talking point or a photo prop. But this is a person, a little boy who is going to require a tremendous amount of time and attention. From his mother.

After seeing how Repugnicants wanted to define contraception as abortion, and thus limit access to it, I have no doubt that they do not believe contraception is bad and must be verboten.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I think you're missing the root cause. Ideal body size is directly related to class. Prior to industrialization and our culture of overabundance poor people couldn't afford food and did hard manual labor, while rich people sat  around eating on sofas. Similarly, poor people worked outside in the fields while rich people got to stay indoors. So the ideal Victorian body is pale and curvy, because that's the upper class body.

In the modern era, most poor people work long hours in offices - some even have two jobs. The cheapest food is the food that makes you fat, not healthy food, and they can't afford the luxury of time to work out enough. Rich people spend their wealth on trainers and personal chefs, or even upper middle class can afford the gym and fresh veggies. But the biggest upper class resource is time; the wealthier my friends are, the more flexibility in their schedules they seem to have. 
That also translates into vacation/leisure time, which is typically spent outdoors. And so the ideal modern body is thin and *tan*.","1220296883"

I'm somewhat of an economics geek and this article pretty much sums up why I'm scared of an Obama presidency. 

Granted, an Obama presidency will easily and surely be magnitudes better than a McCain presidency simply by being competent, but that does not mean it'll be a good presidency.

Obama constantly touts that we'll be energy independent, everyone will be educated and covered under health care while taxes will be lowered for the vast majority of us. Well, where will all the money for these programs come from?

And don't say the savings from not fighting a war, because that war is being paid for on credit so there are no savings to be found there. My fear is Obama will continue this trend of simply printing money to pay for government programs. As an American who worked and SAVED my money, it  deeply concerns me that my dollar is worth less and less each day.

Even scarier is wondering how the vast majority of Americans who did not save money, including corporations, live. Is the vast majority of America waiting for their own bailout?

"reddit.com","t5_6","Jackass, you cited a definition of ""child"" that includes ""a person not yet of age""
and ""one strongly influenced by another or by a place or state of affairs""

Such as... being the CHILD of a governor! Heh.  And I love the absolutism of your way of thinking... because I said a teen girl might benefit from birth control must mean that I think they should all out fucking everything that can shake a stick at 'em.  And I *must* be in favor of abortion because I don't think a 17 year old should be getting married.  Of course.  You got me pegged.

We live in a society that supposedly believes in equality for women.  That includes a woman's right to self-determination of the path her life takes.  That means that she should be able to progress through adolescence and young adulthood and figure out what she wants out of her life, without the ""consequence"" of an unexpected pregnancy making her decisions for her.  No, teenagers shouldn't go out having free love like hippies.  But if a young woman wants to make a decision to become sexually active, she should have the right to have access to birth control, that she may still have all the opportunities in life to choose from for herself, much like her male counterparts.  Let's face it, the burden of an unplanned teenage pregnancy is always on the female.  Guys inherently have a (morally reprehensible) freedom to get away from an unplanned kid, and that is reality.

So yes, teenagers having sex should be practicing a multitude of safer-sex techniques.  Oral contraceptive plus condom, or oral sex, some other alternative, take your pick.  But abstinence-only education is not consistent with the reality of the human condition and never will be, so long as we are hormone-driven creatures.

Nobody governed by morals is ""in favor"" of abortion, and use of such terminology is highly indicative of a close-minded view.  In the event of an unplanned pregnancy, I highly oppose abortion as a means of birth control.  That practice is morally repugnant.  However, I do not claim to have the right to force any woman to carry any pregnancy to term and furthermore I claim that only the mother- and father-to-be in any pregnancy situation are even allowed to hold an opinion that matters.  In other words, personal liberty.  Fight abortion by advocating adoption or making women aware of resources that can help them with their unexpected child.  You cannot fight abortion by dictating family planning policies to individuals.

Teenage pregnancy?  A reality.  Family can group together to help raise it, or strong independent mother can overcome the odds to do it on her own.  We need to teach our young men that it's morally repugnant on their part to abdicate their equal responsibility to their child.  So in an ideal situation, your child from a teenage pregnancy will have both parents involved in its life.

All I'm claiming is that the notion of a woman needing to get married because she is pregnant is a misogynistic fallacy from our patriarchal heritage.  It stems from unwed mothers being a liability on the community (read your history books) and pressures our young women to be tied down with the first guy that happens to knock 'em up.  That's a system of built-in subordinance to women as it devalues their right to choose their spouse.  And when the relationship, as so often happens with teenagers, is built on physical attraction and not emotional compatibility, you've got an unhealthy environment in your ""nice wholesome family"" where kids are being raised with hostility between their parents.

To those of you who met, fell in love with, and raised a family with your high-school sweetheart and wouldn't change a thing, I'm happy for you.  Your situation is idyllic.  But  for your one storybook romance there's bound to be a thousand tales of teenage love scorned, and there ARE thousands of tales of teen mothers who just ""knew"" their baby's father wouldn't deny his child.

Teenage pregnancies are unfortunate but a reality.  Teenage weddings shouldn't be heralded as a fantastic solution for a sticky situation.

&gt; ""You know, when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices,"" Finkle-McGraw said.  ""It was all because of moral relativism.  You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others -- after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism? ... Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings.  And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices.  For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what [she] has espoused with what [she] has actually done.  In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of [her] views or the morality of [her] behaviour -- you are merely pointing out that [she] has said one thing and done another.  Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy. ... Many of the persons who held such opinions were, of course, guity of the most nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no paradox in holding such views because they were not hypocrites themselves -- they took no moral stances and lived by none.""

Ok, I'm not exactly familiar with Palin's particular theology, so maybe there's an especially hypocritical side to this. But unwed teen mothers are fairly common in religious circles (married teen mothers, too!), and this is how it is supposed to be handled: sin of abortion trumps sin of fornication; the baby should be loved, and the mother forgiven.

I'm not letting Palin off the hook, by the way. There's an enormous culture clash here, and I don't think Palin and her ilk appreciate the callousness of their position when applied to expensive-to-live places like the Northeast. Let alone the hardship faced by mothers who don't have a strong family and community to fall back on.

Sure, abstinence will never get you pregnant, or most likely not an STD (there are other vectors, but most unlikely), but lets be real. Kids are going to fuck. And they are going to fuck a lot. Notice that whole population growth thing? Abstinence only education fails because 17 year olds don't all have the self confidence, self control, judgement and , well, frankly, lack of hormones to make rational decisions.

Knowing about a condom and having one readily available, and feeling 'ok' with using it,  are two very different things.

Delivery is a dangerous event with severe consequences on the body.  I don't think that giving a pass rape victims is an extreme position at all.  When you are raped, you are denied choice about conception.  When you are legally denied abortion, you are denied choice about carriage and birth.

And if you have not lived in a small town, you may not understand the problem with getting prophylactics.

"science","t5_mouw","Well, it comes down to what you call flames. As far as I know, they are just made from CO2 and impurities in the material. The gases give off black body radiation, due to the high temperature, which is what we see.

It is a fairly understandable mistake to make, and more intelligent people than you or I have made it through the centuries. It used to be believed that there was something called phlogiston that was contained in all materials and produced the flame when they are burned.

This isn't in fact the case. A chemical will burn when the energy of a colliding oxygen molecule exceeds the binding energy of the current molecule. Once this threshold energy has been reached, the reaction occurs and usually results in a net increase in temperature. This means that the fire will spread, and grow in intensity.

But the visible flame is a symptom of the high temperature, not phlogiston escaping the material!

Now whether the colour used in the animation for the fire is correct, I do not know. If flames have colour according to the blockbody spectrum, then I would imagine that it would be quite a bit hotter than a candle flame! I don't know where the blackbody peak for those sorts of energies is - we have only briefly covered blackbody radiation so far at Uni. Given the implausibility of the entire situation, I wouldn't be surprised if the colour they gave the flame were wrong.

Now, if I were an eager beaver, I would go and work it out. But its late and I'm sorta reading a good trashy book, so I think I'll leave it :p","1220298216"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Of course, part of the problem is that the process of teaching right vs. wrong is usually one and the same with the process of raising someone within a particular culture.  Cultures encompass a lot of things, and one of those things is what you might call moral dogma.

Moral dogma, by the way, isn't always a bad thing.  When you're a kid, lying and stealing look pretty attractive, and it's hard to understand the arguments against them.  So you need a moral dogma and a moral authority to forcibly steer you (sometimes literally using force) in a certain direction.  And this is even the case for adults:  the group should actively discourage or forcibly stop adults who do bad stuff, for example verbally abusing their kids.  Or even simple stuff like talking during a movie at a movie theater.  There is a category of things which shouldn't be illegal but which are bad enough for society that some social framework should exist to enforce them.

So the question (to me at least) is how you maintain such a framework without it degenerating into honor killings.  Part of the answer is probably to teach people that the moral dogma is just that, dogma.  Hopefully that weakens it enough to stop honor killings but doesn't weaken it enough so that it's ineffective.","1220298262"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;I never, not once, tried to say how anyone else should live their life. That is something others are doing in this thread, yourself included.

Oh right. You just deamened everyone who didn't think like you, and commented on 'how far society has fallen' when in reality abortion and birth control have had some amazing, wonderful outcomes for our society.

Don't you try and play that ""I'm not telling people how to live their lives"" card. Saying ""killing babies is terrible, look how far society has fallen"" counts as telling us how to live our lives.

&gt;In fact, I have said repeatedly in this thread that it is none of our damn business.

I agree, but then why do you comment on how far society has fallen if it's none of your damn business? Why do you talk about killing fetuses if it's none of your business?

You're making it your business by interjecting your own negative opinion on the situation.

I'm not arguing this story any more. I'm arguing your perceiving hypocrisy by chastising abortion and liberal people, while minutes later claiming you're an innocent angel who would never interject his negative, asshat opinion into this conversation.

Just own up to the fact that you're pro-life and that you pushed your way into this conversation and this story by giving a negative opinion on the subject. That's all I'm saying.","1220298376"

Extreme? A search warrant is ""extreme""?

&gt;disrupting a political parties convention is in itself an act of free speech.


Disrupting as in flattening tires, blockading streets and ""shutting it down"" (ie creating a situation where attendees can not attend the GOP gathering) is not what most sane people would consider free speech. The right to free speech stops when you interfere with said right of others. 

For example you hate the ideals of Group A. You can talk about that, debate it, protest Group A but once you physically create a situation where you actively try to stop Group A from peacefully gathering, you have crossed a line.

""Group A"" can be the GOP, the Dems, anarcho-hippies, flat-earthers, free-masons or whoever.

It is hypocritical to say that free speech only applies to the parties not in power (ie the fringe groups like the one that got raided)
 

&gt;Because rebellion and civil disobedience is the american way. It is ESSENTIAL and intrinsic to our roots as a society.

That opinion is based off a handful of out of context 'founding father' quotes, logically examine your statement and you will see how it fails. There is no unifying ""American way"" that posits rebellion, lawlessness or disobedience. 

&gt;You are being downvoted because there are several problems with your supposition.

An older woman is at *higher risk* of having a down's syndrome baby. But since older women have far fewer babies, the overall majority of down's syndrome children are born to younger women.

Suppose balls in jar A are twice as likely to be green as balls in jar B. If jar B has four times as many total balls as jar A, there will be twice as many green balls in jar B than jar A, even though a ball in A is more likely to be green. If B has twice as many balls as A, the the total number of green balls will be the same for each jar. Only if they each have the same number of balls will the total number of green balls directly reflect the relative likelihood of green balls for each jar.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm an Obama supporter so I can't answer that in an unbiased way but here's how it impacts my thinking:

1) I don't for one second believe McCain was aware of this situation before picking Palin. This is additional confirmation for me that Palin was not sufficiently vetted before being chosen and reflects poorly on both candidates.

2) It shows that Palin is ruthless. I cannot imagine opening up my teenage daughter to this sort of scrutiny during what must be a very stressful and complicated time. I simply can't fathom it. I would feel the same if she was a male candidate (John Edward's presidential bid raised similar questions for me. He has young children, his wife will die. Did he really need to be running the nation at the same time too?)

3) She is in favor of abstinence-only education (fail numero uno) and has been quite vocal about the fact that she would not favor an abortion for her own child, even if she was raped. I highly doubt that her daughter really chose to have this child and get married. Yes, that's the party line, she might have even said it, but having been raised in a very controlling, very religious family with a powerful matriarch, I feel strong empathy with her daughter. I do not want this woman in any sort of position where SHE could start to make decisions for MY future daughter.","1220298472"

It seems to me what we really have is a group of art students trespassing on private property (a rail yard), getting arrested and, as part of the arrest, having their possessions (which happen to include computers) taken, and then screaming bloody murder as if the cops had nabbed them from the middle of a press conference.

You will note that even the article says the police are currently awaiting a search warrant to search the computers. Sounds like the cops are doing nothing improper here.

Much as I think a free press is vital to our society's long-term best interest, I'm not sure I really want people to be able to wander around my home or business and be immune from arrest just because they say, ""Sorry, officer, I'm a journalist!""","1220298824"

"politics","t5_2cneq","---There are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.

Is it inherited?
Most cases of Down syndrome aren't inherited. They're caused by a mistake in cell division during the development of the egg, sperm or embryo.

Translocation Down syndrome is the only form of the disorder that can be passed from parent to child. However, only about 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation. And only about half of these cases are inherited from one of the parents.

In these cases, the mother or father is a balanced carrier of the translocation, which means he or she has some rearranged genetic material, but no extra genetic material. A balanced carrier has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but he or she can pass the translocation on to children.

The chance of passing on the translocation depends on the sex of the parent who carries the rearranged chromosome 21:

If the father is the carrier, the risk is about 3 percent. 
If the mother is the carrier, the risk is about 12 percent.---
http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/down-syndrome/DS00182/DSECTION=causes

---Risk factors
Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Risk factors include:

Advancing maternal age. As a woman's eggs age, there's a greater inclination for chromosomes to divide improperly. So a woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age. By age 35, a woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 385. By age 40, the risk is 1 in 106. And by age 45, the risk is 1 in 30. However, most children with Down syndrome are actually born to women under age 35 because this younger group of women has far more babies. 
Mothers who already have one child with Down syndrome. Typically, a woman who has one child with Down syndrome has about a 1 percent chance of having another child with Down syndrome. 
Parents who are carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome. Both men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.---
http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/down-syndrome/DS00182/DSECTION=risk-factors

I quote:

&gt;The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, does not allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany and opposes it also in other countries but with less success. Owning and buying the book is legal. Trading in old copies is legal as well unless it is done in such a fashion as to ""promote hatred or war"", which is, under anti-revisionist laws, generally illegal. In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by §86 StGB that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organizations, since it is a ""pre-constitutional work"" and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany.[8] Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of Mein Kampf.","1220298996"

That's a big error of judgement. One has to understand what *choice and control* means. To do that, we have to turn back the clock a little bit on entymology and remember what the word ""hot"" used to mean, before it meant desirable.There was a day, when it was recognized that disastrous results were prone to occur when a naive person got his hands on  a ""hot"" control panel; these days technicians who see users struggle just shrug their shoulders and blow it off. Does choice and control mean providing ""hot"" control panels? My vision of ""choice and control"" is that a first time user can make his or her experience as simple as he wants it. And then, as he gains competency, he can add complexity which gives him more ability to do more different exciting things. These kind of parameters are exactly what end users want - the freedom to choose exactly how much complexity they want to deal with. Die hard power users want lots of complexity. They want the ability to work with the command line; they want a transparent boot process so they can tweak it to deal with extenuating circumstances of special hardware and so that they can give themselves a customized computer experience.

In other words, the iraqbodycount.org figure, which only includes deaths that were directly reported/observed by the media is pretty much a rounding error in the actual carnage. And yes, the *excess mortality* of 1 million means that Saddam was a million times better than the current situation, and the the invasion made things a million times worse. Just ask the relatives of the dead. 

PS: In case you're a bit slow about this --as many are-- the excess mortality figure includes people who died prematurely because of bad sanitation, lack of healthy food or clean drinking water, infectious diseases, insufficient medical care, etc. etc. But that doesn't change the fact that these 1 million people are dead because of the US, and they wouldn't have died without the invasion. Keep in mind that a lot of people, especially children, used to die anyway because of the sanctions before 2003 -- and yes, the illegal and not even properly declared war launched by the US and its aftermath are 1 million times worse than even Iraq under Saddam's brutal rule *and* crushing sanctions.

Second, I'll reiterate for the last time that there is a difference between being against condom use, and advocating abstinence only sex education. The quote I previously mentioned goes a long way towards explaining the difference (and it comes from an article you linked me to).

Look, I don't like Palin any more than the next guy on reddit.

But I do prefer accurate information be disseminated so that people can make good decisions when choosing how to vote. Your claim that the Palins are against condom use is, in my opinion, inaccurate.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event

...

The Tunguska Event, or Tunguska explosion, was a massive explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Lower Stony) Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at around 7:14 a.m.[1] (0:14 UT, 7:02 a.m. local solar time[2]) on June 30, 1908 (June 17 in the Julian calendar, in use locally at the time).[2]

Although the cause is the subject of some debate, the explosion was most likely caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of 5–10 kilometres (3–6 miles) above Earth's surface. Different studies have yielded varying estimates for the object's size, with general agreement that it was a few tens of metres across.[3]

...

Testimony of S. Semenov, as recorded by Leonid Kulik's expedition in 1930.[10]

""At breakfast time I was sitting by the house at Vanavara trading post (65 kilometres/40 miles south of the explosion), facing North. [...] I suddenly saw that directly to the North, over Onkoul's Tunguska road, the sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest (as Semenov showed, about 50 degrees up - expedition note). The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire Northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it, as if my shirt was on fire; from the northern side, where the fire was, came strong heat. I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few yards. I lost my senses for a moment, but then my wife ran out and led me to the house. After that such noise came, as if rocks were falling or cannons were firing, the earth shook, and when I was on the ground, I pressed my head down, fearing rocks would smash it. When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops. Later we saw that many windows were shattered, and in the barn a part of the iron lock snapped. ""

Testimony of Chuchan of Shanyagir tribe, as recorded by I.M.Suslov in 1926.[11]

""We had a hut by the river with my brother Chekaren. We were sleeping. Suddenly we both woke up at the same time. Somebody shoved us. We heard whistling and felt strong wind. Chekaren said, 'Can you hear all those birds flying overhead?' We were both in the hut, couldn't see what was going on outside. Suddenly, I got shoved again, this time so hard I fell into the fire. I got scared. Chekaren got scared too. We started crying out for father, mother, brother, but no one answered. There was noise beyond the hut, we could hear trees falling down. Chekaren and I got out of our sleeping bags and wanted to run out, but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The Earth began to move and rock, wind hit our hut and knocked it over. My body was pushed down by sticks, but my head was in the clear. Then I saw a wonder: trees were falling, the branches were on fire, it became mighty bright, how can I say this, as if there was a second sun, my eyes were hurting, I even closed them. It was like what the Russians call lightning. And immediately there was a loud thunderclap. This was the second thunder. The morning was sunny, there were no clouds, our Sun was shining brightly as usual, and suddenly there came a second one! ""Chekaren and I had some difficulty getting out from under the remains of our hut. Then we saw that above, but in a different place, there was another flash, and loud thunder came. This was the third thunder strike. Wind came again, knocked us off our feet, struck against the fallen trees. ""We looked at the fallen trees, watched the tree tops get snapped off, watched the fires. Suddenly Chekaren yelled 'Look up' and pointed with his hand. I looked there and saw another flash, and it made another thunder. But the noise was less than before. This was the fourth strike, like normal thunder. ""Now I remember well there was also one more thunder strike, but it was small, and somewhere far away, where the Sun goes to sleep.""

The value of a bachelors pursued in a university setting is that those that have PE degrees are limited to the athletic departments.  College instructors should at least have attained a masters in a field that is advanced in focus and demanding in its attention in that focus.  

There are plenty of people who have made livable incomes without degrees yet they top out quickly and become small cogs that can be used up by management.

&gt; Facts do not signify understanding.

uh, what?

&gt; The sentiment at the time was that the Samaritans are not Jewish, especially because the renounced many customs as well as married outside of Jewish bloodlines.

I understand they were seen as dogs as the gentiles were, but they still recognized the Jewish god.  Secondly:

&gt;""One of the biggest problems facing the community today is the issue of continuity. With such a small population, divided into only four families (Cohen, Tsedakah, Danfi and Marhib; a fifth family died out in the last century) and a general refusal to accept converts, there has been a history of genetic disease within the group due to the small gene pool. To counter this, the Samaritan community has recently agreed that men from the community may marry non-Samaritan (primarily, Israeli Jewish) women, provided that the women agree to follow Samaritan religious practices.""

If they married outside the clan back then, how did they get to this point today?

Samaritans were more traditionalist and didn't believe that the word of God could be altered, so they reject the Talmud.  So you're analogy does kinda work, if the Samaritans are the Catholics and the Jews are the Mormons.

Mormons have an extra prophet and a whole other book which adds the idea that when you go to heaven you become god of your own planet and their own forms of racism.  Their holy land is on the other side of the planet.

"programming","t5_2fwo","But don't you see the fault here? Reddit is a _discussion_ forum. Up-moding according to whether you agree or disagree with a line of thought is totally consistent with the goal of this site. The goal of this site is to capture popular, insightful opinion about the link at hand.

With Stack Overflow moderating _questions_ up and down is not conducive to the aims of the site. The aim of the site is to answer _all_ questions accurately and quickly.  Being able to moderate questions slants this.

To illustrate this, let's have a little thought experiment: let's say the Ruby community on Stack Overflow is slightly larger than the C# community.

Now, Ruby users like Ruby questions so on average they up-mod more Ruby questions. The C# users also up-mod their questions but there are slightly less of them.

Initially, the Ruby questions are only slightly more popular than other quality C# questions. But this slight imbalance means they get answered faster than questions about other programming languages. This means the site becomes a more useful resource for Ruby developers - at the expense of other communities.

The success of the site brings more Ruby developers in on to the site, causing the user-base to distort even more towards Ruby developers. 

The process feeds back on itself with such force that eventually the discussion forum becomes Ruby only.

I would argue that this process has nearly reached its conclusion with respect to questions about Stack Overflow. 

Any question about Stackoverflow is a moderation bananza for all concerned, while the other just as valid and imho much more valuable questions are ignored.","1220299905"

Rather than rush to a hospital, she gave her speech on energy policy. Then, she didn't go to a hospital, but instead got on an eleven hour plane ride into Anchorage, Alaska. Despite Anchorage's well equipped hospital she drove another 45 minutes to the small town she used to be the mayor of.

She spend a grand total of almost 18 hours outside of a hospital immediately after her water broke, risking the life of Trig the whole time. All of this so that Trig would be born a native Alaskan, rather than a Texan.

This is the official story of events. For a pro-life candidate to put the life of her unborn child at risk would seem to be attempted manslaughter under their own definitions. That seems fairly damning to me.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I think a rather salient point is you would have far less people willing (and excited) to kill themselves in suicide bombings, etc, if there were nothing to be personally gained by doing so.

I would say many islamic scholars consider suicide to be forbidden in the first place. But it is a point of disagreement, because there were simply no suicide bombers in islamic history until very, very recently.

Furthermore, Qur'anic verses are interpreted with reference to their *asbab an-nuzul* (understood as causes and contexts of revelation). By definition there's an interpretive leap to be made from the aya and its original context to the aya and a new context and its possible practical import. There's nothing unambiguous about that process. That's the reason why literally thousands of books, treatises and what not have been written about it by islamic scholars.

As for ""personal gain"", they believe they go to heaven because they died for (or defending) their people and religion. Regardless of the popular propaganda (or better yet: ridicule), I can't believe one is truly lead to die because of a particular worldly image of said heaven. I think it's a bold statement to claim that there would be any real difference in their actions if there was a completely different image of heaven. My concurrent bold statement would be: The image is irrelevant for what they do. The prospect of heaven in itself however might not be.

As for arguing that the Qur'an can't be from God for whatever reason, that's a whole other subject and ball game if you ask me. On a relate note though, I think it's understandable that a complex text of formidable length can be interpreted to condone different kinds of violence. Islam isn't a pacifist religion. And the Qur'an is anything but a book of clear-cut codified law. So differences of opinion on justified uses of force are to be expected.","1220300129"

""Obama on Palin

Politico's Carrie Budoff Brown reports: At a press avail in Monroe, Mich., Barack Obama on Palin: ""Back off these kinds of stories.""

""I have said before and I will repeat again: People's families are off limits,"" Obama said. ""And people's children are especially off-limits. This shouldn't be part of our politics. It has no relevance to Gov. Palin's performance as a governor or her potential performance as a vice president. So I would strongly urge people to back off these kinds of stories. You know my mother had me when she was 18 and how a family deals with issues and teenage children, that shouldn’t be a topic of our politics.""

On charges that his campaign has stoked the story via liberal blogs:

""I am offended by that statement. There is no evidence at all that any of this involved us,"" he said. ""Our people were not involved in any way in this, and they will not be. And if I thought there was somebody in my campaign who was involved in something like that, they would be fired.""""","1220300264"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; I'm not exactly familiar with Palin's particular theology

While her ideology is derived from Christian theology, the theology here is irrelevant.

What is relevant is only her ideology, namely abstinence education is a failed ideology, anticontraception is a failed ideology, antiabortionism is a failed ideology.

Why is her ideology relevant?  Look at the consequences: the three failed ideologies underpinning Palin's platform synergize to shape a daughter into an underage teen who is *obviously* going to fuck with no protection, suck up every single drop of baby jelly, and then (of course!) decide to not abort the product of her irresponsibility, because she has parents who can afford it.

Palin can't claim ""accident of nature"" and disown the act of her daughter here; she can't discount the consequences of what she professes and practices.  Why?  Because her actions and omissions related to educating her daughter are factors that played in that pregnancy.

&gt; But unwed teen mothers are fairly common in religious circles

That is congruent with other hypocritical acts of Christian churchgoers, yes.

&gt; and this is how it is supposed to be handled: sin of abortion trumps sin of fornication; the baby should be loved, and the mother forgiven

The last part is incongruent with what Christian churchgoers do.  What they usually do is destroy an unwed mother's reputation.  I live in a 95% Christian religious country.  I should know.

(No, I don't have kids roaming around my country -- not that I know of, at least.)

&gt; I'm not letting Palin off the hook, by the way.

Good.

&gt; Palin (if she's who I think she is, anyway) wants more babies in the world.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'm not sure I quote anyone who said Christians were ""the real barbarians"" in general.  Muslims have their share of barbarianism, as do Christians.  In fact, in my experience, the more they avoid taking their holy books seriously (and thus become less Christian/Muslim), the less barbarian they become...

[Well, Allah never actually meant that infidels should be killed, God never actually meant that if a woman tries to tempt you away from you faith, yours should be the first hands on her throat, Jesus never actually meant that all the old laws should remain unchanged, and god never actually deceives anyone... you're just misreading His perfect words.]


When a Christian celebrates the death of a Muslim, they are barbarian.
When a Christian takes pride in American soldier deaths because that's God exercising his will, they are barbarian.
When a Christian tells my 5 year old child she and her parents are going to burn in hell forever and that her parents are agents of evil, causing that child nightmares, they are barbarian.

"programming","t5_2fwo","First, anyone can see that this is a horrible job posting. No I have never created a job posting on craigslist, and I'm not saying I'm the best but I ""suspect"" I can do a bit better than this. Lastly, most companies who have those kind of environments have almost no problem commmunicating that. I'll give you a hint: You can tell the less than ideal work environments by how much they infer without the proper knowledge, if they say that the job is real ""rewarding"" or anything like that.

You can tell the ideal work environments based on a couple of things

1. They specify at least ball park compensation. A lot of these other companies will ask you for the world in these postings, and at the end of the posting for compensation they'll put ""TBD"". Those postings get immediately ignored.

2. They give you the information YOU WANT, upfront, succinct, right to the points. The less than ideal work environment postings will ramble about how there company is great and put that you should be comfortable working in a hectic work environment, and basically ramble on for pages about things of absolute no meaning.

3. How fast they get back to you. In my experience, all great companies respond to people within 2 business days, interested in them or not.

4. If they are not familiar with the business, they won't try to act like they are, like these people are doing.

Lastly, for something like humour, in any given case in life, it can't be ""forced"" or it is exactly that. Not only does this posting go against creativity, but humour is obviously fake and forced, and flexibility? They say no 9-5, but yet they omit any alternatives.

This only makes sense if you take for granted that many people naturally would like to have pedophile sex; you seem to consider that it goes without saying,  I beg to differ. Many social groups cover up whatever happens inside the group, and those covered up activities generally don't include pedophilia. The fact that among activities flourishing due to covering up, pedophilia is the one most typical of catholic priests indicates that there's something specific with their libido.

&gt; You can be asexual (or celibate) in this society without ridicule. You just have to keep it to yourself.

Yes, the way you can be obese / gay / out of the social norm without ridicule. You can overcome your social specificity despite peer pressure, you can pretend that it's a choice when it isn't (or the other way around), but nonetheless it's considered as something very special, something defining, about you. Most people don't want to act atypically, and those who choose to do so generally only do so in one field.

"science","t5_mouw","The word ""toxin"" has no definition that fits in a sentence such as how it was used.  The people who use the word toxin, don't know a definition.  It is used as a scare word or to represent absolutely anything they want. If someone tells you that your body is full of toxins and needs cleaning, you can be absolutely assured that they are deathly afraid of dihydrogen monoxide.

edit: Some more elaboration:

&gt;OUT of 13 brain-cancer patients seen by Dr Keith Goh in the last four months, seven were below 45

13 patients is less than a third of the amount of RANDOMLY SELECTED members of a populace that you would need to make statistically valid statement.  ""People who go to an oncologist"" are not a random selection.  People who go to a single particular practitioner who might very well be KNOWN for treating cancer in youngsters are not a random selection.  Any conclusions drawn from a non-randoms election are completely, totally, entirely, and incontrivertibly pointless.  They're bullshit.

&gt;""The trend is unmistakable. It was not like this 10 years ago.""

Human beings are DEPLORABLE at making observations such as this without statistical analysis.  The human brain looks for patterns and it very regularly invents completely fictional ones where they do not exist.  It is detestable that this cunt of a doctor would dare to make such an irresponsible statement.

&gt;In the past, the median age for patients diagnosed with brain cancer was between 50 and 60 years old. However, signs are showing that it has shifted to the early 40s.

What signs?  One doctors bullshit guess?  Statements like this should be immediately dismissed with extreme prejudice by anyone evaluating a statement for credulity.

&gt;Dr Goh, who is also a paediatric neurosurgeon, added: ""It seems that there is something in the environment that may be causing cell transformation, which leads to the development of cancer. The cells of younger people are more vulnerable to toxins and they can transform to become cancerous.""

Again, the bullshit ""toxins"".  There is no difference between adult ""cells"" and the ""cells"" of children.  If he had said ""organs"" or something, and said ""viruses"" or ""bacteria"" instead of the non-term ""toxins"" he might have a leg to stand on.  However, by saying toxins and by claiming that childrens ""cells"" are different from adults, he proves that he is dangerously ignorant and should immediately be removed from practicing medicine, assuming the paper wasn't just making him up.

We livein an age with a great deal of information at our fingertips.  For you to present this kind of detestable disinformation is downright repugnant.  People are exceptionally poor at critical thinking and analysis nowadays and the last thing they need is for you to help them along in being mindlessly scared.  You don't know how to objectively interpret information, so I would recommend that you just hold your tongue the next time you find some piece of pseudoscientific irrelevant piece of junk that you think validates one of your hunches discerned from a long term dedication to avoiding actual education and evaluating things critically before believing them.  

If you wish to learn how to read a paper and judge its veracity, I recommend you take a course or read some books on logic, debate, learning, and statistics.  These things are science, they are not mystery.  Anyone can learn how to evaluate claims that are made with skepticism and a desire to know only the truth, even if it means your guesses are wrong.","1220301148"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Compared to most undeveloped countries, the U.S. is ridiculously less corrupt and more fair. I shouldn't have to describe the differences between the U.S. and Nigeria.

Compared to the legal systems in developed nations, we have the benefit of a reasonably clear progression of rights and powers, as opposed to the mish-mash of documents that provides the backbone of British law, and we use common versus civil law, which means (theoretically) that two crimes cannot be ruled on differently once precedent has been established, unless said precedent violated other laws. In France, government statutes have to be reinterpreted each time someone is tried for a crime, which can be incredibly difficult for a legal defense to counter.

I'm certain that some nations have better designed legal systems than the U.S., but the list is short, and we should recognize the successes of the American model, while continuing to work on the flaws.

Also, I would disagree with you about U.S. law becoming unreliable and causing corporations to abandon American markets. The problem right now is that the opposite is happening, and that the measures intended to provide fairness for parties in a legal dispute have been perverted into financially backed loopholes, where multinational corporations can almost always triumph over the individual.

The only obstacle to corporate success in this country is the rest of the government, and the harshest legal blows for certain industries often come as a result of pandering to a political base, or to donors that have padded the pockets of a government official, who then put pressure on the courts.

Personally I would suggest that the court system is less corrupt than the rest of the government as a whole, but in this point, I am relying on anecdote and opinion, rather than fact. I would however like to see a greater distance between the executive and judicial branches in the future.","1220301274"

This includes women with poorly controlled diabetes, sickle cell disease, placental abnormalities, hypertension or **those at risk for premature labor**. (emphasis mine)

This was one month premature AND they knew the baby had Downs Syndrome and would need special care upon delivery. Giving birth on the plane would have caused critical time to be lost while getting the child the care it needs for its Downs Syndrome.

Also, the increase over the last few years in HIV and other STDs, including an explosion of anal STDs shows why education about condoms is essential to protect against infection. But conservatives won't have condoms because they are a form of contraception. And so kids are getting sick and girls are taking it in the ass to avoid getting pregnant. Now who's naive?

My mistake for not doing enough research. The only reason I actually care about any of this was that people were posting links that contained no data for women under 20, and claiming that the data obviously proved that a 16 year old girl had low odds of birthing a Down's baby.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","&gt; I can see the entire source on one screen. 

How is this helpful? Only the simplest of stylesheets is going to have only 41 rules, and most larger sites are going to have several stylesheets to begin with. 

Moreover, you didn't mention your resolution so ""one screen"" to you might be 1/3 or 1/4 of a screen to me, or vice versa. On the same note, I frequently use different machines -- my notebook is 1280x768 and my main workstation has two 1680x1050 screens, so again there's no advantage to having everything on one screen if that ""screen"" is going to change frequently.

&gt; I've grouped selectors by their application, and the properties are arranged in a consistent order (did the article mention that?).

I've found that ordering properties consistently is a huge productivity boost, especially compared to one-line rules. If I know that a certain property is going to be at the end of beginning of a dozen lines I've saved myself a couple seconds *every time I look through a rule*. The same applies to grouping rules by context. These two tips are more beneficial than half the recommendations in TFA.

&gt; To work on this file, I would have to constantly memorize and recall the screen location of hidden code. It is a tiny, but significant mental load.

Or you could rely on tools like Firebug that tell you exactly what line a particular rule or property is on. I can't memorize where a rule is on a site that has a dozen stylesheets regardless of how that file is formatted, so I don't try.

&gt; Would you write a page of copy with 3 words per line and expect it to be readable? Memorable? Useable?

If I was constantly trying to find one specific word out of thousands and making minute and sometimes arbitrary changes? I might. I certainly wouldn't get rid of every paragraph or line break, which is analogous to the original advice.","1220301996"

No true democrat would feel any differently than you. Of course, only those in the upper echelons would understand why they feel that way. So allow me to bestow upon you a boon.

The reason why, of course, is because for the democrats things are perfectly comfortable. They can't always be in the #1 spot, but even when they aren't... they're a very close second place. They're never ""cut out"" of the political process. 

If the GOP goes away though, the democratic party would be ruined as well. Sure, without any other major contenders, they'd get a few years of clear majority (even approaching 100%) in Congress, and they'd have the presidency sewn up for 12 or more years. But after that, they'd be as dead as the GOP. Never to return.

This is why Pelosi won't pursue impeachment. She's not a traitor... she is protecting the Democratic party from disaster.

Didn't you explain it in your first paragraph above:

&gt;OK. So then people should save up for their next home, car, and everything else and pay in cash. Clearly with the problems the housing market has had, it'd make far more sense, right? Of course you'd have to wait longer, but the delayed gratification would make people appreciate their large purchases that much more.

&gt; Also, really, delayed gratification is essentially tangential and has nearly nothing to do with the discussion at hand.  

Is it really tangential?  It seems very much related to the topic at hand.  Save up to buy that car and skip the interest payments (and negotiate a better deal with cash in hand).  vs. going to get a loan to buy that shiny new car and paying all that interest and committing future income to servicing that debt.

The other thing to consider is that if you've saved up to buy a new car you probably won't buy as much car since you realize how much work it took to save up that money - you'll more likely settle for a used car, for example, and save that much more money.","1220302546"

"politics","t5_2cneq","You didn't say ""the country as a whole.""  You said ""everyone in the nation.""  There isn't anything that benefits ""everyone in the nation.""  

I would think that the ""common defense and general welfare"" is a judgment call, voted on and adjudicated as necessary.  I'm no lawyer, just a student of history, and a poor one at that.  Making the claim, as I often hear it, that if it isn't in the Constitution, must be unconstitutional, or in your case, it has to benefit ""everyone in the nation"" seems to be contradicted by the evidence of the long traditions of legislation, the legislation enacted in the first years of the Republic, the writings of the founding fathers, and the finding of our courts.  

I would think that it means what it says, and that as such, it leaves open quite a bit of possibility for legislators to legislate on behalf of the nation.  To pretend it doesn't seems to me to be nonsense.  The Supreme Court recently rendered at least one verdict with respect to the work of the EPA, for example.  There's no mention of the EPA in the Constitution, nor is there an amendment creating the agency.  It was created by an act of Congress that the Supreme Court agreed has an established function in our government.  How it conducts its work does not have to ""benefit everyone in the nation,"" and in fact it can be shown to cost some people money who themselves don't feel benefited by its work.  Nevertheless, it's constitutional, its work is constitutional.  

It would not only be nice if everything the government did benefited everyone, and it would be even nicer if everything everyone did benefited everyone, but both are dream worlds that don't exist, that the Founders knew didn't exist, and the document they put into place doesn't envision its only function to create or preserve.  It's a very flexible document, even if changing it requires a lot approval and momentum.  

There are limits, but none of the ones being argued against in this forum have been found to be unconstitutional.  And there are no limits to the stupidity of legislators.  ","1220302802"

Google pays Firefox every time someone uses that little google search box you have in the upper right of your window.  It sums up to tens of millions of dollars every year.  It is what keeps Firefox going, in case you wondered.  And the number keeps growing with Firefox's market share.

This is about it being cheaper for Google to build their own browser than continuing to fund Firefox.  If it was about FOSS, they could contribute to Firefox rather than compete with it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Clarifying in response to your question about the second point - I mean privacy from *anybody* at all.

I guess I've read too many sci-fi books where wireless camera technology has shrunk below the level of sight, and since digital technology hit the camera market,they began to shrink. The smallest HD camera commercially available is now smaller than a 3cm cube. They are getting cheap to the point of disposability and I don't see any reason why this trend should not continue until we have dust-sized cameras, costing almost nothing. 

I think that acceptance of the inevitability of this kind of tech leads me to that conclusion, but I'm never going to say that this is a definite end result (that would be both arrogant and stupid) but we could just as easily see a culture of air filters grow in homes and workplaces to protect against exactly this.

I think in the end, either privacy will prove so important to people that we will positively engage in it's protection, or it's removal will, after a generation or so, just turn into normality. 

Think about it this way - on a nudist beach, the thrill of 'naughty bits' on display disappears very rapidly, despite years of those parts being private and hidden. The privacy of those parts of your body are only important while everyone else covers them as well. When everyone else is naked, you feel a bit odd wearing clothing. 

If you've never been on a nudist beach you may find this hard to believe, but I would never have believed until I was in that position that I would have stood naked in front of strangers without any awkwardness (I used to be very shy, physically) but after a couple of hours in that environment I actually felt awkward wearing clothes. That change, despite 30 years of conditioning at the time, took only a couple of hours.

I think that kind of clarifies a lot of what I've been trying to get over - that privacy is not natural, but a social construct, and because of that, is relative. In the west our bounds of privacy as regards (as an example) our displayed body, doesn't flinch at displaying faces, feet or shoulders, but in strict muslim countries, that visual privacy is not only seen as a right, but a cultural imperative.

I think if privacy were completely removed, the acts we consider private (sex, elimination, private conversation etc) would not be seen as  we see them now, but as we see other public acts such as eating and talking, but it might take quite a while for the generational switch-over to cultural acceptance of this loss. 

We already have lost huge amounts of privacy at work, with many employers monitoring emails etc, and most people have got used to that and accept it (one reason I work for myself - I haven't!). Unfortunately I don't see society as a whole caring enough to take the stand required, but I could just be being pessimistic there.","1220303421"

I even got free shit. I didn't have any change with me at a pastry store and the young man just let me have what I wanted and flirted with me. The same thing happened a few weeks later when I really wanted a bottle of water but didn't have change and the dude just gave me one.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Not having sex has worked out fine for me.

So it worked for you, good for you.  What do you think the implications of that are?

I, too, didn't get any women pregnant by accident, and I'm an atheist who doesn't consider sex outside marriage at age 17 to be wrong, as long as you practice safe sex.  So what can we conclude from this?  Based on the two individual outcomes in question, there's no more reason to impose your particular moral values on everyone else than there is to impose mine.

&gt; I was even raised with the notion of ""If your gonna do it, be safe about it.""

That's good.  We don't know if that's how Palin's daughter was raised, though.  Which is why you don't know enough to say ""They did everything right as parents in my opinion.""  It seems very likely that they didn't, in fact, do everything right as parents, given that their daughter ended up in this situation.  It's not as though this outcome isn't one that can be anticipated and guarded against.

&gt; You still can't prove they didn't use protection as well nor can you prove she has NO sex ed at all.

""Proving"" anything is impossible in this situation, since we're not police investigators with access to the people in question.  What I'm objecting to are your claim that they ""did everything right as parents in my opinion"" and that you ""blame irresponsible teenagers"".  You ""can't prove"" that those things are true either, and all the evidence we do have - including results of studies about things like abstinence education versus safe sex education - show that in fact it is possible to raise children so that getting pregnant by accident is quite rare.  This implies both that the parents did something wrong here, and that it's not simply a question of ""irresponsible teenagers"".","1220303457"

In all seriousness, I share your skepticism that harm by inaction is so far removed from harm by action.  But there are other factors at play - take the following scenario:  a homeless tramp is dying (from head injury) in a hospital, in your estimate, he's going to last 5 days, but almost certainly no longer than a week.  In the next room, you have two patients who need kidneys, one needing a heart, and one needing a lung.  All will be dead in 3 days without a transplant, and there are no organs available.  Do you speed up the first patients death?  What if all you had to do was withold treatment, to ensure those organs were available for the other patients? (rather than, say, needing to administer morphine)?

My problem with the Pakistan situation is not that there are some monsterously sick people in that country, but that their actively sociopathic, brutal misogyny is both institutionalised and widespread enough that such an issue is even considered 'debatable' in parliament.  There is no moral equivalence here.
Similarly, while there are westerners as well as middle-easterners who beat their wifes, on one side the practise is (often) defended by the law (indicating social acceptability), and on the other side the perpetrator is prosecuted and stuck in jail, and there is are support networks to help abused wives leave.

&gt; Second, how short sighted a comment is ""250gb should be enough for everyone"". It reminds me of another statement, ""640k should be enough for everyone"".

That infamous comment you mean is just a rumor: ""I've said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time."" was the answer when Bill Gates was once asked about that 640k statement. I'll stay with Bill and say, that no one involved with computers would ever say, that a certain amount of traffic is enough for all time. I just said, it's enough for **nearly** everyone, and of course I mean now, and not for good. That should have been obvious.

You're right with the benefits of high traffic volumes for low prices. But traffic actually costs money and the so called *powerusers* raise the prices for flatrates. I'd rather like cheaper internet access and (fairly high) traffic limits than expensive internet access and no limits.

&gt; Another application that would benefit from higher bandwidth is the very lucrative multiplayer videogame market.

In fact, most of those games use only very little data (some of them can still run over modem connections -- 56kbit/s) but need very short roundtrip times.

My argument was not, that there is no need for that much traffic. I just said, that 250GB is enough for **nearly** everyone. If you need more, pay for more.

"politics","t5_2cneq","This type of speculation is damaging to the political discourse as a whole and to reddit in particular.

I am a resident of Alaska and she has been our governor for two years. In those two years I have never heard of anything concerning anti-abortion or family legislation. What I have heard has been how she, despite her inexperience, has reformed the government and reigned in spending; something that was desperately needed after governor Murkowski's administration. During those years, and for quite a while before, the most wealthy state in the Union per capita was acting like the poorest due solely to very poor spending habits. Palin ended all that, and now after two years, the state's coffers are overflowing again. This is the reason that she has a 95% approval rating here which is absolutely unheard of, especially in this state.

There needs to be less focus on soap opera scandals in the media and on reddit. Most people in the country have only known who Palin is for three days and pregnancy is all they know about her. I recommend that for a reasonable and intelligent discourse about Palin's politics people do some research instead of attacking her simply because she is a republican. That kind of partisan hackery should be reserved for FOX news, not reddit.

While I will probably vote for Obama in the upcoming election I still support Palin. She is a good person with good ideas and I would appreciate it if people would do some genuine research on her ideas and policies before they start repeating the attacks of a minority of political bloggers.","1220304433"

They partner with microfinance institutions (MFI's) around the world to connect lenders with borrowers. The vast majority of these MFI's operate in developing nations where the only alternative credit available comes from local moneylenders that easily charge upwards of 120% interest. Yes, many MFI's are for-profits, but they provide a valuable service of providing credit (along with savings, business education, insurance, etc) that is extremely expensive to administer on such a micro-scale. Furthermore, Kiva tends to partner with smaller MFI's that can really use the cheaper interest-free source of capital. These smaller MFI's don't have the scale and cost advantages of the larger, more established MFI's like a Grameen Bank, and therefore tend to charge higher interest rates to stay afloat.

Of course, microcredit and microfinance in general isn't a panacea to world poverty, and it does pose challenges to balance between sustainability and exploitation. I've spent months out on the field and talked to Kiva personnel, micro-entrepreneurs and MFI loan officers, and I don't think I can scratch the surface of the complexities of the problems facing Kiva and their partners, but to for you to dismiss them as a scam is incredibly insulting.","1220304571"

It originally had Japanese voice-overs.  The YouTube video that was posted originally has been removed due to copyright violation, but here is a translated text:

(00:00)
How was the meteorite ( that hit the earth before ) collision? We simulated it.
 We assume this happend in modern earth to make the size of the meteor or the
 positional relation of the collision easy to understand.

(00:28)
The size of meteor surpass the width of the Hon-Shu ( main island of Japan. Its
 width is about 200km in most parts. )

(00:41)
The point of the collision is the Pacific 3000km south from Japan. The speed of
the metor is 70000km/h. It seems uncannily slow because the meteor is too huge.

(01:15)
Whole earth crust which is 10km thick is being peeled. This is the crust-tsunami.
 4000m depth ocean stick to the crust-tsunami looks like a thin skin.

(01:38)
Big fragments, which width is like 1km, soar. Japanese islands is broken into shatters.

(01:56)
The fragments soar thousands of kilometers through the aerosphere and then fall to earth.

(02:18)
The edge of the crater is 7000m high. It looks like huge mountain chain. The diameter
 of the crater is 4000km. It swallowed from Guam to part of China. But, it was only the
 begginning of this disaster.

(02:42)
Right after the collision, from the universe, we can see the major player of the abnormal
 incident. Burning colored huge agglomerate. This is the rock-atmo, agglomerate of
vaporized rock. The amount of vaporized rock is about 100-trillion-kilotonne.
After bulge quaquaversally, it spread to all direction at a burst.

(03:29)
3hours after the collision at south of Japan, rock-atmo reach Himalayan mountains.
The wind speed of the rock-atmo is 300m/h. It raid Himalayan mountains as 4000 degrees
C firely winds.In the world that covered with rock-atmo, snow melt at once and dry off
before making river.

(04:08)
(1day after the collision), rock-atomo reach Amazon, backside of the collision point.
Because of high temperature, trees break into a spontaneous flame one after another.
 Jungle turn into sea of fire in a blink. 1day after the collision, earth is covered
 with rock-atmo at last

(04:49)
Rock-atmo cover the earth over a year. It is the same that many suns appears close by.
 Sea, the home of life, is also gotten in the shift.

(05:16)
Short time after covered with rock-atmo, sea come to a boil violently. Vast amounts
of heat from rock-atmo makes seawater fly off. Savage evaporation makes sea-level
lower at 5cm/min.Bared bed of the sea is exposed to the heat and begin to melt like lava.

(06:00)
1month after the collision, this is the earth's surface taken away rock-atmo. Sea ,
which average depth was 4000m, disappeared without a trace.

[the Mediterranean Sea]

(06:22)
At that time ( this indicates the real collision happend before ), it was not long
since the first life on earth was born as microorganism. They must be suffered a lot.

(06:56)
The earth seems to be full of nature and peacefull at first glance. But there were
many meteorite collisions. We - life on the earth survived through the repeated suffering.

The timing was based on the original video.","1220304632"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","United Russia takes 315/450 places from the Russian parliament, it has the power to change the constitution and all laws unless vetoed by the Federal Council or the president.

The problem for other parties is that they can't get credible financing as you are either forced in to exile like Boris Berezovsky, or find your self in Siberia like Michael Khodorkovsky. The other problem is that there is no independent media in Russia. If a TV station is not in the hands of Kremlin its in the hands of Gazprom. If other parties could get financing and had a possibility to get press coverage then they would have a change.

I also disagree on the effectiveness of Putins policies. Russia has had economic growth, but that growth has come from the increases in energy and raw material prices almost alone. In Putins time there hasn't been any major investment to industrial production or to infrastructure. Putins years have also more or less made sure that foreigners can't invert or want to invest to Russia. But the worst thing about Putins time has been that nowadays the government in Russia is responsible for more GDP than it was pre-Putin: bad, back to command economy.

I have for long said that Russian economy is a bubble. That bubble is bursting. Decline in both oil prices and in oil production will more or less lead to depression in Russian economy. You should note that the Moscow stock exchange has already lost over 30% over its value already in this year.","1220304665"

The villain can kidnap a bunch of people, take them to an island, have them genetically engineer a gigantic fake alien despite the fact that the kidnapees' skill set includes things like *writing and drawing comic books*, and then teleport that alien into the middle of a city.  Once it arrives, it will, oh I don't know, *get really scared* and die, at which point it will shoot out magic brain powers in all directions, killing everyone.  The end.

Not true, people carry weapons, it's perfectly legal for them to do so in most parts of America.

&gt;Shooting someone in the back as they're running away is a different scenario than you said at first.

From your earlier post:

&gt;If they're carrying a gun and you shoot them it's not excessive force. It's equal force by definition.

I gave you an example of someone carrying a gun. Even without running away from you, just because they have a gun does not give you authority to shoot them. If I carried a gun with a proper permit, and came over to your house, and you didn't recognize me and shot me, you would be in a heap of trouble. Even if we were having a heated discussion while the weapon was holstered on my hip. Not until I either pointed the weapon in your direction, verbally threatened to use it, or had fired off a round would you be able to use a gun in self defense.

&gt;The use of excessive force is warranted if you feel your life is at risk.

That's silly, people with guns could just shoot other people who looked scary while walking through a dark alley, or kill a security system repair man who let himself into your house to fix the system because he thought you were on vacation and there was a problem.

&gt;In your third scenario, it would be easy to argue the woman was in imminent danger from the larger man with a knife, and the use of a gun to defend herself would most likely be found completely valid.

What did you think it meant, then, to be a successful politician?

Being good at politics means you have the ability to persuade people, communicate effectively, and get things done without compromising your core beliefs - and to do so *honestly*

Like any profession, you can be successful without being honest. But that doesn't make you good at what you do. Politics are very similar, albeit the pull of the dark side is much stronger.

Obama appears to be a generally good politician. So does Ron Paul. McCain, by contrast, is laughably awful. He has flip-flopped so many times, made so many gaffes and so many poor choices, been linked to big oil and industry lobbyists, it's mind boggling that his numbers are so high.

I tend to attribute McCain's success to the mass media brainwashing machine that has slowly tightened its grip on America the past 8 years.

I will be very curious to see how history remembers this election.

Factoring in margin of error, all of the changes to McCain's standing among everyone *except* the base is statistically diddly.  This choice has done virtually nothing to convince people who weren't already going to vote for McCain to vote for him.

And with him constantly running in second, that means his strategy *failed.*  Not unless something really spectacular happens in the next few days, but so far, the McCain campaign seems to have lost *all* control over the media and how they're handling her nomination.  Fundamentally, the ""base"" does NOT matter, not except for fundraising.  What his VP (what *any* VP) needs to do is put a candidate into first place. (or keep him there.)  Obama did this, McCain did not.

Every day that passes and the McCain campaign is forced on the defensive - such as admitting Palin's daughter is pregnant - rather than going out there and telling voters why they *should* vote for her is another day that initial bounce is going to erode.

However, I cannot side with MADD in this day and age. MADD has turned into a monstrosity, the modern day Women's Christian Temperance Union. It seeks to demonize alcohol into a new prohibition. 

I believe countries like Germany do a much better job of avoiding stupid binge drinking problems. Their drinking age is much lower than ours (16 for beer and wine, 18 for hard liquor), but they don't have the same culture of getting trashed in secret that we do. If drinking was out in the open, where teens could seek the advice of adults and avoid mistakes, I think the situation would be much better.

from Department of Law Print Now Printer Friendly

No. 08-141

August 13, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska – Governor Sarah Palin today announced she will turn over findings of an inquiry by the Alaska Department of Law regarding the termination of former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan. The findings were made available to Steve Branchflower, a retired state prosecutor, who was selected earlier this month by the Legislative Council to investigate the termination of the former commissioner and allegations it might have been related to Monegan’s refusal to fire State Trooper Mike Wooten, the Governor’s former brother-in-law.

Immediately following the Legislative Council’s move to hire Branchflower, Attorney General Talis Colberg ordered the preservation of all state documents that might be relevant to the investigation. The Department of Law has conducted informal interviews with staff from the Department of Public Safety and the Office of the Governor. Branchflower has requested that interview notes and tapes resulting from the meetings be delivered to his office.

Governor Palin this afternoon released a recording of a telephone conversation between Boards and Commissions Director Frank Bailey and an Alaska State Trooper from Ketchikan. The recording shows Bailey acted inappropriately by suggesting that he was speaking for the Governor and the First Gentleman.

“I am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the Department of Public Safety regarding Trooper Wooten,” Governor Palin said. “At no time did I authorize any member of my staff to do so.”

“It is apparent that comments I made to a Department of Public Safety official regarding Trooper Wooten improperly and incorrectly implied that I was acting on behalf of the governor and/or her husband,” said Bailey. “That was wrong.”

“At no time did either the Governor or Todd Palin direct me, or imply that I should try to influence any employee to have Trooper Wooten fired,” Bailey added. “In fact, with the exception of the briefing with the Governor’s security detail immediately after the election, I have never discussed Wooten with the Governor.”

Governor Palin has directed all of her staff to cooperate fully with Branchflower.

A copy of the recording can be found at:

I manage to stand up and everyone jumps back. I step towards the closest person to me and straight punch him in the face, he falls back, hits a window, breaks it, and lands on the ground.

I got suspended for 2 days. He has a scar right below his left eye.

A couple months later one of the hoodlums who wasn't there that day started heckling me. I said 'Fuck this shit' and jumped on him. We were writhing around on the ground and some students got the nearest teacher to put a stop to all the commotion.

The teacher told everyone to step back and let us work it out. I am sure he was aware of everyone picking on me and was happy to see me standing up for myself. After a few minutes we eventually gave up. The kid invited me over to his house and we have been best friends ever since. This was 15 years ago.

ok,  so:  

&gt;  A brutal poisoning of most male population to create polygamy society 

No need for that;  we'll start with an optimal male-female ratio (to be determined,  but I reckon 1/20 would be a good starting point);  again,  we don't need a large crew anyway,  most human genetic material being frozen with the rest of the DNA library (so genetic diversity wouldn't be a problem -- even though polygamy has never really been much of an issue historically as far as inbreeding snags are concerned -- just look at how many people today can claim Gengis Khan as direct ancestor);  just an essential crew to keep things running would limit risks of conflicts.  I am not planning for a democratic system,  too much hassle and unpredictability.  Conflicts are more easily revolved in a purely dictatorial system.

Do you mean, a way to convince people to contribute to the fund?  easy:  it would be a lottery;   you'd buy a one in a (mostly undisclosed but very large) number chance to get on the ship;  with consolation prizes (at least get *your* DNA in the library);  I have no doubt about finding enough suckers for such a scheme.

The choice of webkit is excellent. This will provide another mainstream open source browser for the world to use, alongside Gecko/Firefox. In many ways, Firefox will have some true competition, because IE isn't really a competitor -- it's used by a completely different userbase (usually uneducated users).

Webkit has proved its worth -- I'm using it right now in the form of Safari to write this, and it's never failed me in years of use. 

Trust me, Google Chrome is a huge announcement. It will take us one step closer to having our apps online. Microsoft must be crapping themselves, because this pulls the rug right from under their feet. Microsoft has never been so completely out of it when it comes to pioneering technology. They've never been so completely irrelevant. The future belongs to Google. No question.

The only worry I have is that Chrome will underline Google's monopoly. Google already own nearly all my data, and recently I've started using Google Docs (it's so damned useful having a cross-platform/computer word processor), so they own my docs too. Very cleverly, they made sure that Google Gears is open, and can work with other online apps. I'm reasonably sure that Chrome will be able to do this too -- it won't just work with Google's apps. That way they can avoid all those irksome monopoly accusations, which, if the democrats win next time, will almost certainly come to the fore (expect Microsoft to be broken up in the next 4-8 years too).

Convincing people AND getting them to act on that decision is hard. It is damn hard. 

The first sign that people will vote for a candidate is when they contribute. When people bet their dollars on a candidate's success, they will show up to make sure their investment pays off. The contributions are not just funding. They're a sign that the number of people that will show up to the polls in favor of that particular candidate is firm.

Additionally, the base are the people that will give a candidate money to win the people in the center. National campaigns that forget about their base simply cannot win the center. The base are also where a candidate's volunteers will come from.

In addition, criticism from the greater world is also starting to change the directions that the governments are moving. However, claiming the people and the culture as evil outright won't help the change and will most likely hinder it as can be seen in instances such as Iran's political movement. Iran was moving in a more modern and liberal direction but started moving in the opposite direction as soon as America started calling them as part of the Axis of Evil (which was a stark contrast to the candlelight vigils that Iran held after 9-11 and to the help they offered to chase down the Taliban.)","1220307054"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I'd say right now the country is distracted by Gustav. Give it a week to see what happens with the Palin nomination. Elections are marathons, not sprints.

The person who was just bragging about how much money they took in in a three-day period immediately following her announcement should be careful about bringing that issue up, don't you think?

At any rate, even though the republican base bitches and moans a lot, at the end of the day, *they constantly show up at the polls.*  Motivating the Republican base has far less direct impact on voting day than motivating the Democratic base because, fundamentally, the Republicans are more likely to show up.

And, again, we're talking about the *second place* candidate here.  It may be a marathon, but if he doesn't sprint *somewhere* in there, McCain will still lose.  To paraphrase Patton, he can't just be holding the line.  He can't be holding anything.  If he isn't advancing, he's losing.

Also, did you notice that in the polling, more than fifty percent of people polled *have no idea who she is*?  So all of those ""favorable"" reactions to her?  Statistically speaking, they're meaningless.  The only thing polled there is asking people ""Do you support (random hot woman) as vice president?"" and seeing whether they are more naturally inclined to say ""yes"" or ""no"" with absolutely no other data to go on.

And with the McCain campaign, as I noted, utterly and completely failing to get control of the media coverage, the number of people who just said ""yes"" because they have no idea who she is are going to dwindle as more and more of them are exposed to the negative publicity.

Seriously, if McCain doesn't regain control of the media spin RIGHT FUCKING NOW, and start redefining Palin in a positive light, he's doomed.","1220307455"

I don't disagree that when a woman is raped, they don't have a choice in the matter as to whether or not they become pregnant.

Assuming murder is something that should be illegal and punished (I happen to think that it is, whether or not punishing murderers for their crimes results in fewer murders), then abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape.

I am not sure how I feel about the fetus/human question, but I do realize that that is decided one way or the other, it presents clearly that abortion should be illegal or legal in cases of rape if and only if it is illegal or legal in all cases.","1220308187"

Different states regulate things differently. Wikipedia has excellent articles on Castle Laws and use of force. What is legal in Texas, may be Illegal in Delaware.

&gt;Which part of America is it ""perfectly legal"" to rob someone's house with a gun?

Erm, nowhere. It it however, in most states, illegal to shoot someone who is burglarizing your home unless they have threatened you with a gun, or are a huge guy with a sword or something who is also threatening to use it, either physically or verbally.

&gt;In fact, what you described is called ""Armed Robbery""

Armed robbery is walking into a 7-11, pointing a gun at the clerk, grabbing stuff, and running out.

What I described is walking into a 7-11 with a gun on a hip holster, avoiding the clerk, grabbing stuff from a rack, and trying to flee with it. Or alternately, walking into a 7-11 with a gun on a hip holster, and being hostile and insulting to the clerk without making a motion toward the gun on your hip, or telling the clerk, ""I am going to shoot you in the face now.""

In that kind of scenario, the clerk can't just whip out a shotgun and plug the guy.

&gt;Having a license to carry a gun doesn't make it ""perfectly legal"" to carry your gun in the commission of a crime.

No, but having a gun is not the same as threatening to use the gun to commit harm. Guns are perfectly legal to *CARRY*.

The burglar can still get arrested for stealing your things, or for any other crime they might be committing, but you will get arrested too if you shoot him, unless you live in a minority of U.S. states which have enacted laws allowing more extreme measures to be taken by people in their homes.

They are mutually exclusive to each other. We have the right to determine our own religious beliefs. We have the right to determine our own political principals. But neither should be used to influence the other. *They just don't go together*. You seem well informed so I don't think you need me to explain why this (mixing the two) has always been a bad idea. But as you have rightly pointed out they are very much in league with each other and perpetuate the existence of the grand deception ad infinitum. Where one fails, the other steps in. One exists within the heart of the other (think yin-yang). Religion is a particularly hard vice to break. People will cling to it with a ferocity equal to any drug. I think because the finite nature of our existence is too much for most to bear and the ability to deal with that alone is a personal journey in itself. Compounded by the threat of purgatory (they all have there version), it makes heaven the sweetest sale ever pitched. Point is people just cant let go of their religious doctrines easily. This is what I was pointing at with the ""go for the mortar"" idea. Rather than try to dissemble their religious belief directly, look for what holds it together for them. You can zoom in or out to whatever is appropriate to each person/conversation. Eg you could try discussing the need to believe in an a afterlife: Explain to them how much more valuable life is, and how much more determined people would be to make something positive of it, if they didn't have the afterlife to fall back on. Same goes for political mechanics, do not tell them that the election process is a sham when it is all that they have to believe there is some order to the society they live in. Start with the methods used to incite ideas via the media, citing examples of media ownership and news media as a business. These are just loose ideas, shape to suit.

I think I get the gist of it and if I'm right the answer is ""yes, that's the right idea"", but I also thought I got the gist of what I wrote earlier and in writing the rest of my response I realized I needed to clean that up a bit, too.

What I figure I'll do is review how I got to where we are now; if this explanation makes clearer what I'm saying, you'll have your answer, and if it doesn't maybe you can take another stab at what you're saying. The story so far:

Someone claims: ""emergence"" is ill defined.

I agree, then attempt to construct a loose, sloppy, and very provisional ""rigorous"" definition of emergence.

My definition only applies to formal systems: it means true facts in each system get mapped to true facts in the other system, and proofs in each system are in principle mappable to proofs in the other, but the length of a ""translated"" proof may be impracticably huge, limiting the ability to reason about one system in terms of the other.

Let's pause here and work through a concrete example. Suppose I know that substance A and substance B will react and form substance C and D, if mixed together in a water solution and left to react; suppose the reaction will be 99.9999% complete after an hour. Here's a summary of our knowledge:

* in CHEMISTRY, I know that my starting configuration (A + B) and my ending configuration (C + D) are valid (possible) conditions.
* in CHEMISTRY, I know that (A+B) -&gt; (C+D) 99.9999% after an hour.
* I can translate the situation (A+B) in CHEMISTRY into a description of a (large set of equivalent) physical state(s) in PHYSICS (state AB).
* I can translate the situation (C+D) in CHEMISTRY into a description of a (large set of equivalent) physical state(s) in PHYSICS (state CD).
* I have a very short proof that (A+B) -&gt; (C+D) in CHEMISTRY (say: acid-base laws).
* I have a computationally intractable problem in PHYSICS to show that AB will evolve into CD over the course of an hour.
* ...and that's with the assumption I have a computationally-feasible method of mapping (a member of the set) AB -&gt; (A+B) and (a member of the set) CD -&gt; (C+D)

(note: in writing this up I realized the definition I gave for emergence is a little off; I will post a tweaked definition at teh end of this post).

Thus we want to be able to claim CHEMISTRY is an ""emergent"", and my definition of ""emergence"" was intended to capture more-formally my intuition for what makes the CHEMISTRY:PHYSICS relationship interesting.

* We resume our narrative of this thread.
* After posting my definition of ""emergent"", llimllib asks if it makes ""emergence"" a property of ""our knowledge of the system"" rather than the system itself.
* I answered by point out that my definition was *only* about formal systems, and had nothing to do with what the formal systems were designed to describe.
* I then offered a lot of possible definitions for ""emergence"" as a property of ""systems"" independent of particular formal systems that described them; these possible definitions ranged from the very strong (all logical systems describing the systems under investigation have to satisfy the emergence property) to the very weak (only a single pair of logical systems has satisfy emergence).
* I then explained how you could make these proposed definitions ""work"" with llimllib's definition.


...and then I tried to say that it was all a bit abstract anyways, and possibly the distinction between ""the system itself"" and ""our knowledge about the system"" was an ill-founded distinction. A rephrasing of that argument, including some assumptions not mentioned the previous time:

* For llimllib's proposal to even make sense, we have to be able to make a clean distinction between ""the system itself"" and ""our knowledge of it"". If they are the same thing, it's a distinction without a difference.
* We will assume something like the basic Platonic outlook: there are ""real systems"" out there, which we cannot experience directly but about which we can build mental models and thereby come to have (indirect) knowledge of them.
* More specifically: it is impossible to directly experience or ""know"" ""the system"" as such. What you can do is experience sensori stimuli and mental states and decide to attribute them to (somehow being on account of) that system.
* You can develop a logical framework for interpreting the stimuli you are attributing to the system. Depending on your preference this can be a very, very informal framework or it can be quite formal (quantitative and robust), and even capable of making predictions (such and such stimuli now mean there's a high probability of such-and-such other stimuli later).
* There's no need for your model to take into consideration every possible stimuli you may receive; it's expected that much information may be ignored or simplified (this is a good thing: it's what science does, for example). We expect most models to be only partial descriptions of their associated system.

All of those are basically necessary consequences of any framework robust enough for llimllib's proposed distinction to even make sense.

So, I then try to point out that even if we accept all of the above at face value, we don't get near where llimllib's proposal needs us to be: at the end of the day the fact that, say, for such-and-such systems such-and-such definition of ""emergent"" holds given such-and-such knowledge is as much a fact about our knowledge of the system as it is a fact about the system itself.

IE: is the statement: ""with such and such knowledge, such and such system appears to have this property (but maybe doesn't really, if you had more knowledge)"" a statement about:

* your knowledge of the system
* the system itself
* both
* or neither?

...we report, you decide.

Complicating things further is: we'd just been being nice and assuming you could sensibly talk about ""systems"" independently of the ""logical systems"" (really: mental models) used to describe them...but if you can't actually directly ""know"" the systems (which is our baseline assumption, as a way of distinguishing them from mental models), then all you have are models, and it's models all the way down.

And yeah, it is a bit tautological: define a system as ""a system"" if it's not directly knowable, and a ""mental model"" as something that is knowable + a mental link associating it with an unknown ""system"", and it should be no surprise that it's hard to characterize distinction between ""systems"" and ""mental models"" without infinite regress (b/c your ""system"" for such understanding is just a ""mental model"").

And now the revised definition of emergence: we assume E is a category with objects corresponding to, say, ""states"" and morphisms g:e-&gt;e' corresponding to proofs (in some associated formal system) that for some definition of ""goes to"" the state e turns into the state e'. (For example: e could be ""such-and-such amount of A and B in solution in water at time t"" and e' could be ""such-and-such amount of C and D in solution in water at time t+60 minutes"", and g:e-&gt;e' would mean ""A and B can react to form C and D in 60 minutes). We assume we can measure the length of a proof, which we write L(g).

Let C be another category (with similar ""semantics"" for its objects and morphisms), and F:C-&gt;E a functor. We say E emerges from C if:

* every e in C has a nonempty set e(C) = {c in C | F(c) = e}
* given any e in E, it is computationally tractable to find at least one concrete representative c from the set e(C)
* given an arbitrary c in C, it may be computationally infeasible to calculate which e it is that F(c) evaluates to.
* given any g:e-&gt;e' in C, we know that for any c in e(C) and c' in e'(C) there is at least one f:c-&gt;c' such that F(f) = g, but any or all of the following might be true: 
** L(f) might be ginormous compared to L(g) (eg: ~2^2^2^2^(L(g)))
** every combination of c,c', and f might be computationally hard to find or hard to evaluate
* given an arbitary f:c-&gt;c', it may be computationally infeasible to figure out which e,e', and g it is that F maps them to

The point of the above is to capture the notion that if E emerges from C then the following kind of reasoning needs to be frustrated:

*Proving Facts in E via C*

* start with some facts in E (easy)
* convert to facts in C (possible)
* find a proof in C (not guaranteed to be computationally tractable)
* map the proof in C into a proof in E (not guaranteed to be computationally tractable)

*Understanding How Proofs in E ""Work"" in C*

* take a known proof g:e-&gt;e' in E (easy)
* convert to a proof f:c-&gt;c' in C (could be insanely long or insanely time-consuming to find ""lucky"" c,c', and f in C for which it's short)
* understand how E and C interoperate (frustrated at more than a superficial level by the insane length of f:c-&gt;c', or frustrated due to the lengthy time it took to find f, c, and c').

This definition isn't quite right, either, but it's closer to the correct definition; I think the proper definition would replace F with a category of functors from C-&gt;E; this'd complicate things further but give you flexibility to handle the case that usually situations in C could be mapped into multiple, distinct -- not contradictory, just different -- statements in E.

It's an equitable defense, meaning there are a lot of factors that figure into it. A major factor would be ""was the plaintiff in a position to *know* about the infringement?"" Consider the Ex nihilo case in *Devil's Advocate*, where the sculptor first saw the adoption of his work in the finished film - he's a retired sculptor and has no reason to be screening what Hollywood puts in their movies, so filing suit as soon as he saw it in the finished works sucked for the studio, but such is life.

In this case, Fox is a freaking movie studio - they have lawyers on staff whose job it is to watch for infringement. Watchmen has been a loudly announced project for years. Fox should have filed their injunction as soon as the movie was greenlighted, not when it was almost finished. By waiting until this point, they are holding a gun to Warners head through no fault of the Warners Studios. 

As a result, the laches defense (which is very, very rarely used, btw) absolutely should apply, at least on this injunction. Fox just sat around watching the movie made until they felt they could extract the most cash from Warners. The proper holding is ""you don't get to do that - you file when you're aware of the infringement or you lose.""","1220308697"

Yes, if we suddenly had science fiction technology, it's awesomely amazing. But until the beta reticuleans stop by and sell us Super-Mega-Awesome solar panels, it's perfectly meaningless.

&gt; At any given time you could power the entire world from solar energy and not have to seriously worry about when it's going to run out.

So flip the switch already. Oh, wait... you mean if only we had, say, a few million square miles of solar panels, and magical technology that could switch out failed ones without trouble.

&gt; The jet stream constantly has winds at over 300mph (I believe) and could also provide a near-limitless energy resource.

How do you expect to harness this? Look at the fucking headline. ""Without the need for breakthrough innovations"". It's right there. Do you see it?

And if I were going to be stupid and hope for breakthrough innovations, it wouldn't be magical hippy jetstream windmills. It would be fusion, or room temp superconductors, or a self-healing smart electric grid, or any of a dozen other things.","1220308982"

You could almost take a picture of the hypocrisy surrounding this situation.

People in alaska say, ""i haven't heard anything regarding anti abortion here"" because she hasn't had the power to appoint supreme court justices in alaska, how is that relevant at all?  Its not.

And it is not unfair to punish her kids when you see who is doing the punishing, it is her who accepted the nomination and should have known the consequences of her actions, letting her get away with it is only continuing the immorality of the situation.  She is soley responsible for any vetting, any prying into her life because no one forced her to take the nomination for vice president.  She should have known better and it is our duty as media or part of it to look into that.  No free pass, sorry, but it is 100 percent her fault for putting herself and children in this situation.  Gotta know where to place blame, obama can't blame her because he doesn't need to, he is winning and will lose the moral high ground if he looks into it, its a good move not to and avoids the trap that has been set.  Good job obama, but it would be a bad job by us as media participants to overlook it.  If you like obama, respect him for being smart enough to take the high road, but respect yourself enough to keep going at this to find the truth about it and hold those accountable who wish to make changes to laws.  There is no facial beauty, race sex or situtation that gives anyone a free pass who will make laws, as tough and sad as the situtation is.  Yes feel for the kid, of course, but be smart, palin, what are you thinking getting into this race?

Again though, that is a biased sample because these families at least can tolerate Western cultures enough to have their relatives go to America.

In terms of religious diversity, while there may not be that much in Pakistan, I think that the government can at least benefit from the cultural diversity brought about by the many ethnicities that make up the countries. While it's not the same and it would be great if there was total religious freedom, I think the different cultures brought by the ethnic diversity can push the country in the same way that religious diversity does in other places.","1220309534"

Replace ""Hope and Change' with ""Earth, Peace and Wealth"" and you may have something. The point is that it has to be really simple and speak for itself. The problem with senators running in Presidential elections is that it's just hard to pinpoint them. As you probably already know, voting on a bill is not as simple as yes or no.  That is why it is super important to communicate your message as concise as possible. 

""Hope and Change"" just doesn't do that. It muddies the real message that your are trying to get across. If you asked me about the environment I would literally just something short of ""we are all going to die under the McCain plan."" Then don't be afraid if people ask you if it's going to cost money, just grow a pair and say ""yes, it is going to cost a lot, but we are going to die if we don't do soemthing."" That simple. Rather than uhmm uhmm uhmm uhmm... we need to do this... uhmmm...blah...blah...blah...Hope and Change. By the way, Obama uhms way too much, which is why he doesn't do very well in debates. He is like the opposite of Bush, he has a hard time keeping it simple.

Also he should have stopped voting a long time ago. And why in God's name did he vote for FISA. That was a huge mistake that till this very day he has not acknowledge. That anit-FISA group is still the largest group on his website. At that point, knowing that people are paying attention, I would have just stayed away of a senator VP. But then he goes out and gets one that has been there forever. So know the ticket reflects Biden's voting record which just sucks. Pro: Nafta, war, FISA, Patriot Act and etc.etc... Then Biden was praising McCain not too long ago. I don't care how you rationalize it, that is not good. So the Democrats message gets more complicated to understand as the campaign goes on. The only thing they have left to go on for the last two months in a ticket that contradicts its own message. Muddy and not efficient.

&gt; Occam's razor prevails here. 

Premature appeal to Occam's.

&gt; Why would anyone or any group go through the effort to create the illusion of two parties representing the majority of US political beliefs?

They might not need go to the effort, it might occur naturally, given the correct initial starting conditions.

But if they should choose to, it would be a convenient way to sew everything up. The two parties become symbiotic, guaranteeing them a place on the national stage. True, they aren't guaranteed first place, but at minimum they'll always get second place.

You might as well as ask why some people don't always invest in the opportunities with a high rate of return... the answer is simple. The low rate of return is plenty, assuming they don't have to worry about the risk of losing it all.

&gt; If they had that much power, why bother, why not just make a totalitarian dictatorship ala INGSOC?

Why? Well, again, I'm not saying it's a conspiracy. I lean towards believing this is all happening naturally, without a need for a large-scale or sustained conspiracy.

But this works, apparently. You're willing to believe nothing is happening. Would you be as complacent if we had INGSOC?

Prove it.

&gt; I was only saying that they do not represent the majority of Americans. 

Circular argument. You claim that they do not, because they clearly aren't of the two parties that do represent the majority. And that we know they represent the majority because they represent the majority.

&gt; If they represent a majority I have no problems with them.

Actually, it sounds as if you do have a problem with them, even if they did represent the majority. Only then, you'd be part of the minority.

Perhaps you are part of the minority, and this sort of behavior of yours shows how you'd act to keep the majority down.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I think Ron Paul is a right-wing demagogue

There's nothing about being as anti-war as Paul has been that is ""demagoguery"". No, Paul was the one telling off Rudy and McCain when they were practicing demagoguery at the debates. Of course, I take demagogue to mean ""talking and providing policies that pander to the short term wants of the people"", when in fact, I feel his career has been made on upholding the constitution.

Now, I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but I am saying it's true.

&gt;If the Ron Paul people really want to help America, they should support an anti-war candidate who has a chance of winning. (He's from Illinois.)

Interesting. I personally don't feel he's the anti-war candidate. In fact, I feel to make up for wanting to withdraw from Iraq, he's hyping war up more in Afghanistan (as well as the Pakistan bit). Many will say he's gonna attack Iran because ""his handlers tell him too"" but I'm not so sure.

I'm also not sure he'll completely get out of Iraq. He says no permanent bases, but I think he just won't physically authorize them. 

Thanks for posting here, there needs to be more crossover debates, it's easy to get stuck in a subreddit echochamber. 

I will probably begrudgingly vote Obama. He's less worse than McCain or Barr. 

Edit: Also, Obama seems like a pragmastist. As in, if the republicans want war with iran, and democrats want peace, he will use strategic bombing to make both happy. ","1220310123"

A similar thing happened with skin tanning, at least here in the UK. For hundred of years or so tanned skin suggested you worked outdoors, likely as a labourer. Pale skin was desirable as can be seen in make-up from the era, it showed you worked indoors and were probably important. Then with the advent of foreign holidays in the last fifty years ago tanned skin has switched to be desirable, with people applying fake tan when they once would have used make-up to lighten up.

And no it's not a family issue, when you hide it under a blanket on the ""national stage"". It's a family issue when you aren't running for the top job in the nation. At the minimum this shows poor executive ability, certainly of McCain's people, at the minimum.

A qualified executive would have been marketing the pregnancy well before now, without even the nomination in question. As a governor, you're not a professional polition? Are you kidding me? This whole baby fiasco is amateur hour. And frnakly we've had eight years of amateur hour and I'm sick of it. Executives make negatives positive, they don't hide their daughters on the stage behind a blanket. 

And frankly your dodge on absitnence education is a huge problem. The statistics are that abstinence only education leads to higher rates of teen pregnancy than sexual education. This ia a plank she has certainly advocated in her run as Govenor. And it's typical of the modern conservatives movement. It lacks the courage to confront the complexity of modern reality. It prefers to project an orwellian donna-reed righteousness and conception of the world that leads to oversimplification of situations which cause disaster after disaster when these concepts are implemented in the real world.

Obama's campaign has already stated that family is off-limits.  There are realpolitick reasons for this beyond simply being a standup guy.

The pregnancy of the VP's daughter shouldn't matter to any progressive voter as a matter of course.  But if there are those who think they can play hardball with this and use it against the McCain/Palin campaign in terms of stirring up discontent with, for example, religious fundamentalists, they are fundamentally mistaken and horribly foolish.

This merely *humanizes* the VP and her family.  The pro-life people will applaud bringing the child to term.  It will make everyone who tries to make this a negative look hypocritical and nasty.

The number of crews can't be more than 150 (Dumbar's number). Terraforming may take 10000 years or more. For such a long time it requires many generations. The only way to maintain proper male female ratio in each generation has to 

1. Encourage male homosexuality or bisexuality of
male population. 
2. Killing extra males with any excuse.
3. Suppress female independence.   
4. Suppress anyone with potential revolutionary ideas.

And unless the founders brain wash crews to turn their goal mission into a religion, because you picked up the most intelligent, beautiful and handsome human beings, they are usually highly selfish and irreligious and may decide to give up the mission and even just destroy the frozen human DNA library.

Therefore unless the founders device a mechanism to isolate nonconformists, such a tribe will not be stable for 10000 years. If founders allow killings, then it may create civil wars among station resident, that may endanger survival rate. A peaceful way they may adopt is to regularly spin off dissidents in a new ship. (So the station requires mining capability from earth or moon to create new stations) But this also may in the long run creates wars among stations.

With such a low number of crews, the problem is any innovation and progress may not happens after
the station is found. The old world may just look at Atlantis, full of wonders. Current fast progress of science, technology and economy can be attributed to population growth in last 200 years plus we are able to accumulate more information than 400 years ago. In the stations, if we only have very few crews, it is impossible to have significant progress in the voyage.

Here’s a summary made from a CNN article, with a headline that simply parrots the claim that McCain is in “excellent health”.  The full article is at:  http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/05/23/mccain.health.records/

* He has had more than four malignant melanomas.  Four cancerous things have been removed from the aging candidate.  Also, several “Less serious cancers” (see below) have been removed but doctors haven’t said how many.

* Removal of one melanoma involved removing a patch of skin as well as an underlying carotid salivary gland from McCain's face.  McCain developed swelling beneath the skin and had to be taken back for a second operation.

* McCain has many of the risk factors associated with the cancer: light skin, light-colored eyes and a history of excessive sun exposure, she said.

* Less serious cancers - McCain has also been treated for other less serious skin cancers, but Eckstein did not specify how many.

* Has had four kidney stones (takes hydrochlorothiazide to prevent more)

* Has or had a number of small benign cysts in both kidneys

* In 2001, doctors found stones in his bladder

* Even with high-blood pressure medicine (reputedly he takes this for other reasons), his pressure remains somewhat high

* McCain had an adenomatous colon polyp removed (These are polyps that start out as small nodules on the bowel wall.)  They are “potentially precancerous”.

* high lipid levels... treated with medication simvastatin

* McCain takes a daily aspirin to prevent formation of blood clots

* He takes “an occasional Zyrtec”, an antihistamine used for nasal allergies

* McCain takes the sleep agent Ambien CR for treatment of insomnia when he travels

* One of his records showed his fasting blood sugar value was described as ""impaired.""

* Experiences occasional dizziness

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;It doesn't take a genius to be a VP, let alone run a country.

Yes, yes it does.  Looking at the 'non-hoax' version of presidential IQ estimates, the dumbest-by-estimate president on record has an estimated IQ range of 107-139... W is estimated slightly smarter, between 111-139 (avg. est. 125).  But, when you look at the better presidents, you see at least 2.5 or 3 standard deviations above the normal... which *clearly* qualifies one as a ""genius"": Washington (avg. est. 135), Jefferson (avg. est. 155), Lincoln (avg. est. 145), FDR (avg. est. 140), JFK (avg. est. 145), Clinton (avg. est 150).

Don't confuse these with that hoax that was going around claiming W. had an IQ of 90... these are real estimates from a real scientific journal.  They should be taken with a grain of salt, of course, but not with huge amounts of skepticism.

Regardless, the point is that anyone with any reasonable level of intelligence can see why one would want an intelligent President.  It is the toughest job on the planet, and you need to both have enough knowledge to think on the fly about a wide variety of topics, and enough intelligence and judgment to make the correct decisions.

You can keep spewing bullshit about ""advisors are for informing the president"".  How much can a science and technology advisor advise John McCain?  *He doesn't understand science or technology at all!*  As I said before... a President doesn't need to be an expert in everything, but he needs a broad base of knowledge that allows him to understand the issues at hand *when his advisor is giving him advice*.

See, here's an example.  You, by what you're writing, are uneducated, and I have a Masters in Computer Science from MIT.  If you were made head of a company, and I was your Technology advisor, I couldn't, by any means, convey how impossible it is to write a computer program that checks to see if another computer program will stop running or loop forever... because you simply don't have the base of knowledge that would enable you to understand me.  But I could explain that to a first-year undergraduate easily, since while he may not have the expertise or depth of knowledge, he at least has the base that allows for efficient communication.","1220311647"

EDIT FOR ADDITONAL COMMENT:

Her family goes to the very core of her flaws in leadership. No birth control results in having a kid... at 44 years old... which turns out to have Down's Syndrome (which is related to the age of the mother). There are reasons why 44 year old women either use protection or get themselves or their partner sterilized.

Abstinence education (plus no birth control) is directly tied into her own daughter getting pregnant at 17 years old and out of wedlock.

Her questionable judgement has put her entire family at risk, and she wants to see her judgement exported at a national level.

Probably not.  It's too late now: she has a kid.  Her only real choice is to give it up or raise it, and if she chooses to raise it, do so single or married.  Of those three choices, marriage is probably the least bad.

And no, abortion isn't a choice anymore than smothering the kid after it's born is.  Once you've created a life, you have to take care of it, whether directly by raising it or indirectly by giving it to a good family.","1220311907"

"science","t5_mouw","At some point in ancient history all life functioned with and was comprised of RNA.  DNA and proteins made of Amino Acids are a later evolution.  RNA enzymes and transcription systems are incredibly slow - the same enzyme made of amino acids, the present building block, perform reactions a thousand times faster while taking the same basic shape.  In my opinion, which is worth I don't really know, a planet full of RNA life probably functioned more as a single giant organism, as no particular cell could metabolize the stuff of life at a rate faster than diffusion.  I don't think the kind of cell versus cell competition we see could have gone on.  Rather, there would have been large regions of RNA life mass, much larger than cells, and not necessarily separated by membranes into strict cells; that would perform functions - a group of RNA enzyme mass all breaking fructose and that product diffusing to a different location in a non-cellular Creb's cycle.  

The history of DNA life is of this one giant RNA organism differentiating and specializing.  Viruses still play an important role in this process of evolution.   There were once RNA viruses playing some role in the previous life form's evolution, perhaps one quite different.

As far as I see it, if you have an artificial object, be it a collection of cells, an electronic device or a program, that works exactly the same way as a human brain (from the ground up i.e. on the neuron level) in all measurable ways, and behaves like a human being, it is equivalent to a human being.
As far as I understand John Searle wouldn't think so. 

But humans *also* only act as if they were self-aware, sentient, sapient and conscious. They *also* only seem to be intelligent. If you apply the same criteria to humans that Searle applies to AI, nobody can convince you that he/she *really is* any of the above, just that by all measures they appear to be.

*EDIT*: oops, it was [dradetsky], not [you], erokar.

Also, I see now, that I didn't really answer your comment. Saying there are biological properties we can not measure or observe is the same as calling them magic. There might be properties we don't know of now, but when we do, they are probably artificially reproducible. They may not be. And these ""may not be""s are reasons why ""real"" AI might be impossible, but they are no arguments why it definitely ""is"" impossible, it doesn't even seem likely that there could be biological properties that we can measure but not reproduce as software.","1220312203"

Her first thought could have been to cover up the pregnancy.  Now that she has major GOP spin doctors working for her, she's going to have a very different style.  This could hypothetically work, and therefore, could be tried.

It's far better than admitting that she did cover up the first one or being found out.  

And you said it yourself ""it makes no sense"".  So now people are dismissing it, and they'll continue to dismiss it, even if she has a miscarriage.

This is a mindset created by the religious right, and is simply not true. It denies every reality of child rearing in favor for some God-centric peachy view of the world.

&gt;If you believe the mother should have an abortion then aborting herself is the most responsible thing to do.

That's just sick. 

&gt;There is a third, most responsible option: adoption.

Right, because there aren't hundreds of thousands (or millions) of kids sitting in the foster system, hoping to go to homes.

If our foster system wasn't already multitudes over capacity, I may agree. But as it stands, sending a child straight into the foster system is not a pretty fate.

We have to base our opinions on the fact that people are going to fuck. They will. You can never stop the fucking. 

Ever.

They'll fuck as soon as they can. As much as they can. Whether or not they're married.

No amount of God or morals or laws or rants will ever change the fact that humans will fuck their tiny little brains out.

So the question then becomes, what the hell do we do about it?

The prolifers opt towards ""Stop the fucking"". That, of course, is futile.

So what do we do when people fuck? Hope they don't have kids? People will get pregnant. Adoption can't handle what they have, or half of what they have. What do we do?","1220312487"

I'm no Obama fan, and I care even less for McCain. But the amount of anti-Palin junk that has been spewed all over Reddit has made me more or less lose faith and be disgusted with the pro-Obama Reddit crowd. 

She's a [Ron Paul fan](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6yqk2/newsflash_in_a_dramatic_turn_of_events_from_a/). That's of no significance.

When it was discovered that Ron Paul did not believe in evolution, the Reddit crowd bent over backwards to point out the irrelevance of his belief on evolution. Contrast that to the Palin stories.

When Obama did a U-turn on telcom immunity, Reddit was full of Obama defending.

And most importantly, when Obama himself was accused of nonsense, Reddit was in uproar. Now almost the *exact* techniques are being used by the Reddit crowd against Palin and McCain. Such as attacking her for her lack of foreign policy experience.

Y'all are just a bunch of fanboys (including the females). Anything in favor of the One you like is fantastic. Anything against, no matter how true, is heresy. 

Disgusting! Obama aint my candidate, but I'm glad he's nothing like his fans here. 

**Edit**: Just to counter some of the comments I'm getting, I'm not suggesting she is above criticism. But I would say over half of the front page anti-Palin stories on Reddit I've seen are unfair criticisms. 

And second, the general trend I'm seeing is that criticism of her shoots up to the top, whereas recent criticism of Obama has trouble staying above 0. *Even* if the Palin criticism is all valid, this behavior (if by the same Reddit folks) is fundamentally unfair. If you want to criticize, be open to criticism of both, not just of one. ","1220312681"

Your view of the world is so peachy and fake. Let me correct your statement to better show you reality.

She has the option of:

1) Keep the child, get married. Since this is what her rich Christian parts support, they will help her with their money. Most families in the America don't have the money to help much, unlike the upper class governor.

However, as the vast majority of shotgun marriages end in divorce, she will most likely be divorced in short order.

Her mothers political aspirations may prevent this, so she'll be trapped in her own personal hell, forced to stay with a husband she hates, raising a child at a young age, trapped by her mothers aspiration.

Or, leave her mothers umbrella, become poor and a single mother, no money, trying to raise a child while working shit jobs. She'll statistically be lower class the rest of her life.

Or give her child up for adoption. AKA, send her child into the foster system, where the child will most likely bounce between homes and orphanages, and statistically develop behavior problems and remain in the lower class.

Or, abort the fetus. Let the mother continue her life. Go to college, get a degree. Instead of becoming a lower class citizen, or a leech to her mother, let her actually give back to society.","1220312785"

"science","t5_mouw","I should have been more specific.  One of my college professors did research into ancient RNA life forms.  He studied enzymes involved in a nitrogen reduction cycle and found particular RNA and protein enzymes that perform the same reaction in the cycle and have ostensibly the same physical shape.  The nooks and crannies of the enzymes are in the same places.  The active sites are in the same place.  One enzyme transfers an intermediate from one active site to another, the channel is the same length and takes the same turns.  In general, for the particular enzymes my professor studied, the protein enzyme could perform 1000 versions of the reaction in the time it took the RNA version to perform one.  

Your global point about the function of RNA in the present life system is correct.  RNA enzymes do not exist in the ordinary environment because they cannot compete with protein enzymes.  I think that the history of life on Earth probably includes a period in which a large ostensibly singular life form using slow RNA enzymes was dominant.  ","1220313116"

"programming","t5_2fwo","To channel Alan Kay... Java was originally designed to run on toasters (or set top boxes...).

Another quote said something like ""James Gosling made a language for people less intelligent than him"".  So since the core language sucked so much (even Gosling later said he wouldn't have included abstract classes) they started adding things in.  First anonymous classes, then enumerations, generics, etc.

It seemed like each time they added something they did it half assed.  They went with type erasure for generics because they didn't want to change the class file format... which they eventually did anyway with Java 5 (or 1.5).

However, because they pulled the StrongTalk and Self guys over to make a VM that actually worked, eventually it started to run pretty fast.  At this point it gives C++ a run for its money in some environments, and is simpler to program in given the standard library, unicode support, etc.

So now we have this language that has succeeded seemingly on marketing and CTO naivety.  There was no reason for it to succeed initially, but since so much was put into making it actually work and run decently fast we're now stuck with the backwards compatibility question again.  We have all this stuff written in Java... what do we do?  Go back to C/C++?  There doesn't seem to be another company with the balls to invest any money in R&amp;D because ""we already have Java""...

Now we have all these new ""JVM languages"".  The problem with that is, the JVM was built up very specifically to make *Java* go fast.  It is built around the concepts of the Java language.  Look at the Scala compiler and the Function class for a crash course in how ugly the JVMs notion of generics is.  There is some work underway with invokedynamic to move away from this, but it is kind of late in the game and there is a lot of baggage the JVM has to tote around.

I say all this out of frustration, because I spend most of my time in Java.  There are so many things that would make my life easier (C# style properties, for starters) that have been 'under review' for what seems like forever.  It all goes back to the language starting with a poor foundation.

Never mind that the room itself, in order to be convincing, will have state, which is something Searle conspicuously doesn't mention.

He also equivocates between the room and the person inside it. He claims : ""he understands nothing of the Chinese, and . . . neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the system that isn't in him. If he doesn't understand then there is no way the system could understand because the system is just part of him"" - Despite the rules (of which if we understood Chinese would indeed be inside our head) existing outside the roomed individual. Rules which, in order to be convincing must not only parse and transform Chinese but in effect be simulating some convincing person (NLP =~ the whole of AI)

Instead, what's wanted is good leadership.  This is why international interest in the current presidential contest is so overwhelming.

And this argument about saving trees?  The vast vast majority of trees cut for paper were grown for that purpose.  The paper and logging industry in North America and Europe has been singularly responsible for a 40% increase in the number of trees since 1900.

The FISA vote was depressing, but he has been very vocal against it for a very long time and even *as* he voted for it. You could say this compromises his beliefs, but in the end he knew it would pass anyway and he made a political decision which most all of his supporters sorely regret.

Obama voted for the patriot act when it was introduced, but is now against it. This is a valid position change.

Obama's stance on oil drilling is calculated and complicated. He has stated that he knows it will not affect gas prices, but is willing to adopt the position (*in addition* to his own energy plan) in hopes of swaying many right-leaning independents. It's eliminating an extra barrier and adding to his ""compromise"" image.

Obama's stance on drugs is VERY different from that of McCains. Where Obama looks more towards treatment of drug offenders, McCain wants more law enforcement.

You can read up on the differences here:
McCain Drugs: http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Drugs.htm
Obama Drugs: http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Barack_Obama_Drugs.htm

chose this target is obvious. It was an attack on a symbol of the
entire capitalist system of exploitation. Primarily, however, we chose
to carry out this attack as an act of solidarity with our friends and
comrades who are fighting in Denver and the Twin Cities against the
conventions. For those of us who cannot be there, this is the least we
can do to stand in solidarity with you. We hope that this action
inspires you and lets you know that you are not alone. We know that

This is exactly what I was talking about: Taxpayer money is being taken from places far away from the coast or rivers, and is being given to those who live in flood areas.

It creates a moral hazard by continuing to allow bailouts of those who live in risky areas without purchasing private flood insurance.

I'm not wrong; you made my point further. Someone in Alaska shouldn't have to pay for this.

The thing that's odd about the libertarian philosophy it that it holds the individual person as an end in himself, as the most important thing, and that this is a self-evident truth.

Most libertarians don't have specific agendas or desires other than liberty. People of other persuasions opine about their agendas and goals: education, jobs, welfare, etc. They make all sorts of arguments to support their goal, appealing to the desirability of that goal.

A non-libertarian person might think education is not important, but he probably won't down-mod a well-written argument about public schools and their importance. This is desirable behavior to you, right? Follows your modding rules?

To a libertarian it doesn't matter how well-written an article is if it's anti-individual. It's automatically ""flawed"" and ""innacurate"".

Are people not supposed down-mod inaccurate articles?

I can see your point. What if every Muslim down-modded every Christian article and vice versa? It would just be a down-modding holy war.

But libertarianism isn't a religion like those. There's only one belief: that people own their own lives. When other people act in violation of that axiom they are literally invading someone's freedom.

Simply being a Muslim doesn't hurt Christians, but stealing money from one person to give to someone else is a real harm. If an article supports that, then it deserves to be down-modded, just like articles that encourage any sort or theft or other crime.","1220314666"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","The situation is different -- with a Mac, you are buying a combo; the hardware and the OS come from the same company. Lenovo does not make OSes for sale; they relicense them and bundle them as a courtesy to those users who want one. The MS EULA *explicitly say* you can get a refund. So  it's not like the guy is trying to do something outside of the box. What he wants to do is buy a blank Lenovo system, but Lenovo doesn't sell that way, so he *has* to buy the system with windows, then ask for a refund. He's not trying to stir something up, he's trying to use Lenovo hardware (which he likes) with a Linux OS (which he also likes), but Windows is getting in the way.","1220314786"

For those who believe that life hasn't actually started until the third trimester, they might argue an abortion is on the side of caution... as they are preventing the eventual creation of a life doomed to a dismal and painful future.  Heck, why go through the risk of death or permanent change to the mother... err for caution.

For those who believe life starts at conception, ""caution"" might dictate imprisonment of any pregnant woman suspected of potentially wanting an abortion.  Remember, clinic bombers (Christian terrorists) are still supported by many folks.","1220314866"

Who is anyone to say that 17 is too young to have a baby and get married? They could go on and live a happy life, with beautiful kids and a strong marriage. This nation is filled with those who married in their 30s only to divorce once, twice, or thrice. In context, is 17 young? Sure. But some may think that 21 is too young. Others say 25 is too young. Some want to be in their 30s. It's a personal preference.

Best of luck, Bristol.","1220314941"
