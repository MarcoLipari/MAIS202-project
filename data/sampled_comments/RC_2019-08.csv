"Pizza","t5_2qlhq","I've read TXCraig's recipe, but I assumed a lot has changed since 2010. I knew Mangieri did a 24 hour rise in SF, so I just assumed it was cold ferment.  
 
However I just found this interview from 2018, he specifically says ""never refrigerated"" and the dough ""sits unrefrigerated ... no longer than 24 hours"". I might experiment with this.  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Qp5fKkavM&amp;t=105  
 
I've seen a lot of recipes that have you drop the starter right into the mix. If done properly, it might have the same outcome. But the levain lets you make last minute adjustments before you're forced to commit. I'd rather waste 200g of flour and 1 day on a bad levain than 1.5kg of flour and 3 days on the whole deal.  
 
That's awesome you got an Ischia culture. I've heard (from Mangieri actually) that the culture matters less. As you feed it, it'll be taken over by your local yeast cultures anyway. Not sure how true that is. Maybe we can compare starters some day to find out!  
 
We followed the Tartine starter recipe. So ours was cultivated from scratch in San Francisco. We keep it refrigerated, feeding it every week. Feeding goes like:

 * 100g existing starter
 * 100g water
 * 50g whole wheat flour
 * 50g white flour
 
We keep it cold simply because we're not very responsible.  We'd kill the thing if we had to feed it daily.  
 
After feeding, I let it rest for at least 8 hours. After that, the starter is bubbly and develops a slightly acidic smell. So not super active, but alive and hungry. Then I'll make a levain from that. The remaining starter goes back in the fridge.  
 
Before using your starter for pizza, I would recommend making a sourdough loaf in your home oven. If you can do that, then you know your starter is ready. One less variable. Can't recommend the Tartine book enough.  
 
Oh, you're going to love the new oven. Game changer. Honestly, the oven is the most important thing in all of this. In my home oven, I tried recipe after recipe, and the slightest variable would ruin the whole thing. At 900 F, those variables have far less effect. A year ago I was very scientific about all of this. Now I have breathing room. Every pizza I've made in my Roccbox has been phenomenal, literally since the first one. Same with the Napoli oven (though I'm still a Roccbox Stan). Now I'm able to focus on perfecting the technique without worrying about ruining pizza night 😂",1564617602

Saved this comment to my favourites list, that’s for sure... oh my god wow, I couldn’t ask for a better reaction. I am so flippin psyched that this was somehow your dream scenario! That is the beeeeeesssssssst

How I came am up with it was more or less something like, “hmm why aren’t there any cousin audios? that’s almost like, a kinda more socially acceptable form of incest (since even royal blood lines contain many marriages between cousins)... plus, everyone has at least one hot cousin, right?” 

Once I sparked that thought, the idea for the set-up came easily and I just ran with it! I think I wrote it out because I didn’t have the privacy to record in that moment, and I didn’t want to forget it or lose the inspiration. Otherwise it likely would have been recorded as an improv audio, and could have wound up being completely different!

Gotta say, if I somehow seem to know your sexual desires better than you do, well we must be pretty damn sexually compatible ;)

It’s rare to get a comment like this publicly... usually it would be a PM if anything. I really hope you don’t delete it, because I think this comment serves as a really great example of a special and highly memorable response. I especially appreciate the way you sandwiched in some sweet sentiments that show me that you think of me as not only a sexual object of desire, but as a real flesh and blood human being, with actual thoughts and value and dreams. 

*”What kind of sorcery is this?”* is my absolute favourite. I’ve heard it only once before in my life, and it will never cease to make me smile.

If a real adult has physiological features that are similar to a child's it is rarely ever the result of anyone's choice. They just happen to look like that. And if a real person is photographed or filmed in a sexualized way then it had better have been the uncoerced, consenting choice of that person. Otherwise there's a problem and maybe even a crime.

This isn't the case for characters that aren't real. If a character is drawn with physiological features similar to a child's it's because the person drawing them wanted them to look that way. And if a character is drawn in a sexualized manner then it could only have been the choice of the person drawing them.

An adult with a baby face wanting to take nudes of themself isn't really a big deal or all that odd. An artist wanting to draw a childlike character in a sexualized manner is at the very least a major red flag for that person either being a pedophile or producing content for pedophiles.",1564617605

Oh man but it's getting worseee~~... women are getting more bitchy, nobody employs you without a degree,...

I doubt I will ever reach retirement... they heightened the retiring age again.
And you can't even do stuff like martial arts or part time jobs because you can't be both at school and at the workplace.
Besides hobbies like self-defence or art or sports are expensive ... and you can't get expenses because you're uneducated.

I had only 2 part time jobs... the first one scammed me of 20 Euros and gave me no money back.
The second part time job was a garden department in Hornbach during heat waves. I was surrounded by a bunch of entitled women who worked there and they even wanted to ditch me away for not handling the Manly work well enough.

So for instance on mon-fri have something like ""One for All"" and on the weekends(sat-sun) have a ""brawl"" that either randomly selects or lets you select one of the smaller game modes like Overcharge, Odyssey, or the star guardian event, etc.

This way people can have alternatives to SR or take breaks from SR without feeling obligated to do so. Right now, any time a new mode comes out, people swarm to it because it'll go away and they need to get their playtime in before it's gone for another 4 years. If they came out with a consistent system it would be healthier for the game, people could casually take their breaks from SR while still playing league, and the ""impact"" on queue health wouldn't be overly effected because people aren't swarming the gates of any one specific queue.",1564617605

Béla IV (1206 – 3 May 1270) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1235 and 1270, and Duke of Styria from 1254 to 1258. Being the oldest son of King Andrew II, he was crowned upon the initiative of a group of influential noblemen in his father's lifetime in 1214. His father, who strongly opposed Béla's coronation, refused to give him a province to rule until 1220. In this year, Béla was appointed Duke of Slavonia, also with jurisdiction in Croatia and Dalmatia.

We don't know where they will appear to be in a number of years equal to their distance from us in light years (where they are now if you like).  

Predicting the movement of cosmological scale structures over hundreds of millions to billions of years is difficult.  Models are chaotic (small initial state variance compounds into huge long term differences) and our initial measurements are almost non-existant.  The distances are so vast - and our measurement window so comparatively short - we've only just started detecting motion of galactic clusters (relative to expansion that is).  Furthermore the phenomena of dark energy and dark matter are poorly understood yet we know they will have a significant impact.

Finally over scales this large how the objects themselves will change can't be ignored.  The life-cycle of celestial objects, collisions, black-holes...too predict where everything currently is would require being able to perfectly model the universe.",1564617607

Mine went out at ~75k, replaced under warranty. Had a clutch assembly go out around the same time, also warrantied. About a year ago I had a clutch master cylinder die, wasn’t warrantied but it was a fairly painless fix (minus the 2or3 times I had to get it replaced AGAIN in the following months but that was because the O’Reillys part was doodoo so I only paid for it once). Biggest pain I’ve had is when my cat went out.

There were a few (namely the ‘04 automatics) that broke left and right. Honestly I don’t think rx-8s break any more than a lot of other cars if they’re oiled and taken care of they just get a bad rep.

Yes, you can give Longstrike that many wounds with a unit of three crisis bodyguards, for the bargain price of 90 points if you take all the guns off (where did you get 96 points from?). That's if you never want those bodyguards to be able to fire a shot because nothing is ever going to come into range of them - that's why you took a Longstrike and Hammerheads, they're long range heavy support platforms.

Yes, you can even give them a 6+++, but now you're also dedicating an Ethereal to your Longstrike protection detail. It sounds quite a lot like you're just building a castle now, and any troops choices you have on the table are either going to be denied Storm of Fire/Sense of Stone and the Ethereal's leadership buff, or you're paying for a second Ethereal.

As for the damage output of the Broadsides versus the Hammerheads, I did misread the BS but I strongly disagree with you about their damage output. In your army, you're relying on Longstrike to buff their overcharge and damage output, but Longstrike is a character with &gt; 10 wounds and will die on turn one against any army with some damage output of its own. You have the pleasure of easily overtaking the Broadsides for exactly one turn against most armies, and possibly not even your own first turn. It doesn't really matter that he has Fly, because he's going to be blown up from a distance - he only has a 3+ save, no invuln, and the game's most expensive ersatz shield drone posse to take wounds for him. The game currently punishes single large targets hard because it is so easy to just focus them down, and Longstrike represents a large target that has no cost-effective way to survive anywhere into the midgame.

That, and put Longstrike against the current termagant/poxwalker spam that's becoming hilariously popular, and you can look forward to making a few dozen models extremely dead each turn against an army with 200 of them. :v",1564617610

I'm a photographer, which to be fair is better than many other jobs I could have chosen, but I ended up with a lot of not so great clients who either don't pay me on time, or aren't willing to pay me enough for what they demand of me. On top of that, I'm tired of having to drive an average of 1.5hrs-4hrs every time I have a job to do, and I'm tired of carrying multiple pounds of gear and being on my feet for sometimes 8 hours straight without being able to take a break. The particular industry I'm in can also be very pretentious and a kind of self centered. All of that has slowly been chipping away at my enjoyment of it, and I'm now at the point where I dread every single job I have, and instead dream of being home with a brush in my hand.

My heart's just not in it anymore, but painting is something I have been drawn to my whole life, and my experience so far (I've been at it for about 2 years) has been a million times more enjoyable than photography ever was. I've met great people, everyone is supportive of everyone else's work, and it's a much more welcoming community in general.

Not enough to call them winners, but certainly in the middle of the pack, and the obsession some have with ""THE GIANTS DIDN'T SELL SMITH OR BUM"" just misses the forest for the trees.

I'm just saying that YOU don't know for a FACT that it means before 8/13.

Which is entirely the whole catalyst for this conversation between us.

YOU made the absurd factual claim that the list is being released prior to 8/13.

YOU reinforced that claim by posting the same source we all have and gave us YOUR INTERPRETATION of the announcement and ADMITTED that you were only assuming.

YOU then doubled down after being called out and are trying to deflect.

I'm in the corner of ""We don't know""

You're jumping from the ""I know it's coming before 8/13"" corner to the ""I just assumed"" corner to the ""Well the odds say"" corner.

Just give it up. You claimed you KNEW when it was coming out. You've been called out. Take the L and move on.",1564617612

"VulgarLang","t5_3piij","Welcome aboard! You will find that languages have different approaches to various aspects such as communicating about time, word order restrictions, how they show grammatical roles and relationships in a sentence, how they write symbols etc.

I hope you enjoy the learning journey and the resources mentioned earlier in this topic are a good start, along with Wikipedia articles on language and just general Googling of course. Ask questions here when you need to. Be aware that even linguists don't always agree on how certain things work in language or the best terminology to use.

It's too early yet (I think) to give you anything other than very general advice. So here are two suggestions, recycled from people with more completed languages than I have.

1) For your personal language, if you understand it and enjoy it, then job done. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

2) If you specifically want a language that looks natural (real worldish) then a more sophisticated approach based on linguistics knowledge will nearly always be better. The main trap appears to be to incorporate every cool idea you come across without checking that you need it and that it doesn't create difficulties somewhere else in your language.",1564617614

To that, I responded with ""right for me for what?"". And that was for relationship/marriage, of course. So I told her that the marriage is a scam and got the usual ""Ah, you're one of those"" bs. And then I said, ""Yes, I'm one of those and that's why I paid cash for your condo."" No further questions, your honor.

A pod landed twenty meters away. Its sides uncurled like the petals of a flower. Jackals in black-and-blue vacuum suits drifted out. Their boots adhered to the station’s hull.
“Let’s pave a path out of here, Blue-One.”
“Roger that,” she said.
Linda targeted spots their energy shields didn’t cover—boots, the top of one’s head, a fingertip. Three Jackals went down in quick succession, their spacesuits ruptured by her marksmanship. The rest scrambled for cover inside the pod.

&gt; The setting sun just touched the edge of the horizon when the guards on the roof of the bunker twitched and crumpled. It happened so fast, John wasn’t sure which Linda had targeted first. A heartbeat later the two on the ground were dead as well.

&gt; Two Jackals screeched and primed and chucked plasma grenades at Fred.

&gt; Linda tracked them, fired once, twice, shooting both projectiles midtoss.

GoO Ch 24

&gt; “We’ll take our best shot at range,” Kurt replied. “Hit it with two SPNKr missiles, which will hopefully weaken its shield enough for Linda to penetrate with a few shots.”

&gt; “What range?” Linda asked.

&gt; “They never get closer than two kilometers,” Kurt said.

&gt; It wasn’t an impossible shot. But given variable winds, a moving target, and trying to combine fire with missile strikes . . . it would be highly improbable. Still, Kurt had to try something to get one step ahead of the enemy.

&gt; Linda considered a moment, then replied, “I have an eighty-three percent accuracy rating at that range.”

GoO Ch 28

&gt; Will reported over single beam: “Overwatch spotted, eleven o’clock, elevation twenty-four hundred meters. Wind is three knots from the northwest.”

...

&gt; Linda’s rifle muzzle flashed. Without seeming to move a molecule she fired until the magazine was empty.

&gt; The missiles impacted—smoke and flames ballooned about the Sentinel.

&gt; A heartbeat later, the winds blew the discharge cloud aside . . . the Sentinel jerked, and plummeted.

GoO Ch 29

&gt; “Hold your fire,” he said over TEAMCOM. He scanned the advancing line, and then past them spotted three teams of Grunts setting up energy mortars.

&gt; “In back,” he said. “Take out the artillery.”

&gt; Linda fired twice. A trio of Grunts assembling one mortar fell.

In our world, sulpher can be dug up around volcanoes. In yours, maybe a rock-golem has sulpher for brains. There might be remnant planar fissures where sulphur spews out of the Infernal Realm, but only when the planes are close together.

In our world, limestone forms from sediments dropped by rivers (or aquifers). In yours, it might be the result of reverse-baking marble, which is why it is found in ruins deep underground where magic anomalies are common.

In our world, you can use sulpher and limestone to make fertilizers and poisons. In your world, they might react to form a glass crystal, very pretty, but too brittle to use and definitely not game-breaking.

If it doesn't *seem* to make sense, then it must be because magic. That's the DM's secret weapon.

Then you can create lore to explain why it is the way it is, which makes the world interesting.

Be sure to check with your servicer about your payment schedule under a standard 10 year repayment plan before your IDR expires.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked in a fast food store until march of this year, I quit for soon to be obvious reasons. Anyways, in January of this year was working a café open shift (4am - 12pm). It was 9am and I still hadn't been sent on break despite asking, I was taking coffee out to a customer and on the way back it I had this feeling like I'd been disconnected from reality. Next thing I knew I was back in the café, I couldn't remember walking across the store and had an awful feeling. 

I told my supervisor I felt like I was going to pass out and stumbled out the back so customers wouldn't see anything. I got to the break room where I collapsed in the doorway and (according to the other people in the room, I was unconscious at this point) began convulsing violently on the ground. Nobody knew what to do as I didn't/don't have epilepsy and no one was trained regardless. I woke up slightly when the paramedic came and was later diagnosed with a heart/adrenal gland disorder.

Sad thing is, the same thing happened to me again in March. This time I knew what was about to happen but the manager hadn't been briefed on my condition (or maybe thought I was trying to get out of work, idk), and I had a second episode. I quit later that month.",1564617621

I have an app that tracks that stuff for it's been really helpful. I've lost at least 10 lbs post diagnosis, and when this started I was in the low 300s-mid 200s all the time. 

And it's kind of you to say ""it's not your fault"" and for most people that's likely true...but dude this is 100 % on me. My diet was literally nothing but pasta and soda. I fucking hate and have always hated exercise. Fucking. Hate. It. My continence is sorta hot or miss bc my rectum is surgically reconstructed...and moving a bunch tends to agitate 

Oh, as to time...for the past week or so, most of the time? I'll wake up in the high 130s, go to bed around 148. Havent figured out what's aggravating it, bc it hasn't really changed from home, where i was eating well...and vacation, in part of the Caribbean that hasn't been fully restored since the storms last year so food choices are kinda ""everything is fried!""

Mess around with DX12, that can help some performance issues if you're using DX11.

If you have MSI afterburner + Rivatuner, monitor your GPU usage while playing. If you're GPU usage is dipping down during these drops, that could mean your CPU or RAM is the bottleneck, although I don't think that's likely. If you're GPU usage is near max when these frame drops happen, than there's not much you can do except lower your settings or accept the drops.

I've gotten sick of the annoyances and bullshit things that happen each time a patch is introduced, including ever-increasing performance demands. Future patches may help with stability, but I'm sure they'll break more things along the way.",1564617623

Playing WoW maxed out 4K and the CPU never got over 36C.

There's a huge difference between investing in stock/etf and being a landlord. It isn't for everyone, and since I am not handy and incredibly lazy, I know it isn't for me.  

The other issue is the concentration of risk. If you own a home, you are already highly exposed to real estate, adding a rental property will only further concentrate your investments.  On top of that, you are concentrating all your investment into one asset, not even just an asset class.  Can it pay off? Sure, high risk, high reward but it's not really for many people.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Psychiatrists are the worst at dealing with people's psychological issues. I know that sounds contradictory, but they know pills and brains, they're doctors, but they're not therapists. The same shit happened to me, I was basically scolded for wanting to get tested quickly (same as you, took me months to convince myself and then of course when I finally made the decision it had to happen NOW NOW NOW). The lack of compassion for wanting to get tested asap (""are you suicidal? You know this is for urgent matters, right?"") and needing to prove how this is truly affecting my life in a severe way (""you have a nice job, I don't see the problem"") really pushed me back into my imposter syndrome that I'm probably just lazy. 
My advice: take the test with the psychiatrist (they're the only ones who will be able to prescribe you medication), ask around for a therapist with experience in adhd to treat you afterwards. The test is quite clinical anyway, they don't need to be compassionate, if you have adhd, it'll show in the test and you can move on.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","&gt;Any advice?

It can come in cycles and it can get stronger over time. Going into the direction it points to, even when it is weaker at times, may be a good idea.

And persistently and in depth questioning gender assigned at birth can be a sign in itself. Cis people usually do not do this. For them its a few short thoughts of how it might be, and they move on.

It may be an idea to listen to what you feel would make you genuinely happy, and to try to go there step by step.

A number of things from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b9o7dq/how_to_begin_possible_transition/ek8vfhd/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/a866ie/im_a_13_year_old_boy_but_i_want_to_be_a_female/eck0x9i/) post might help you too.

There is a vid with questions in the resources. Answers could help talk to a therapist, or they could help get a better view. And there is a vid there with  things that can be tried out, there are hints concerning looking for a gender therapist, and there are also hints concerning looking for support in the second link.

And some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.

"charmed","t5_2sku9","What I don't understand is people that compare a reboot show to the old one and hate the reboot because it's so different. The reboot show is an adaptation of the original. It's purpose is to bring in elements of the original show to give the reboot a familiarity aspect, but present it in a different modern way so you aren't watching the same show. I love the reboot because of it's potential to be like the old series. Charmed got much better as the seasons went by because the actresses fell more into their roles and you could see the sisterly bond become stronger; the roles became much more natural for them. That's why I'm holding out for the reboot because I think if it runs for a few seasons, the actresses will fall into their roles much like the original and the dynamics within the show will feel more natural, than forced. I also think the writing will get much better as well. I love how they went fairly in-depth with Macy and showcased her past, how she came to be, struggles she has and how they play into controlling her powers. If they do this, but better and with the other two sisters, I have high hopes for the reboot. I just hope other Charmed fans will not hastily criticize the reboot for it's first season hiccups. No show is perfect in it's first season.",1564617626

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash "" - "", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:

"TechnoProduction","t5_2v4k9","Elektron RYTM MK2.  Seriously, it's more than just a drum machine.  It's a sampler with analog filters.  It integrates with over bridge tightly to Ableton.  It has cc's for everything and midi over usb.  It has parameter locks.  It's inside your budget used.

To put this in perspective, I have owned all the Elektron boxes aside from the Digi's and the Analog Heat.  The RYTM is making me feel back to when Machinedrum came out, because that revolutionized my game.

Also, the thing can do chromatic analog stuff.  It sounds like a synth if you want it to.  It makes thick chunky bass, hard kicks, and the filters are great.

If you learn to work with Push2, the chromatic mode is like an accordion in the layout, but it actually works pretty damn well.  I haven't used an actual keyboard in years any more.

"NextCloud","t5_3ev3e","The convenience level is completely different.

You can set up Nextcloud apps on all your devices and sync all of them so if you upload a file, they get automatically made available. You also don't have to lift a finger.

You also get the Nextcloud web page itself, where you can access all your files, listen to your MP3's, use an Office app (if you go through the hassle of installing one, like Collabora), sync your bookmarks and so on. 

OpenVPN is great and all but it's a different use case altogether. 

In fact, Nextcloud can be installed on a server in the cloud instead of in your home. Scaleway, for instance, has dirt cheap 2 core 2GB instances with 20 gigs of storage which is perfect for a basic Nextcloud, $2.99 a month. Then, you get external storage from Wasabi and connect that to your cloud instance, Nextcloud has direct support for it; $5.99 a month per 1 TB. Boom, now you have both a way to get at your stuff wherever you are, and a way to back your stuff up (or at least have a second copy, even though Nextcloud in and of itself isn't a backup).

Yes, it's not 100% free, but neither is buying hardware and paying for electricity.

Although, another valid option is to just pay for a cloud storage solution, like Dropbox or Box or Resilio. Even easier, if less capable and probably pricier if you want to store a lot of data.",1564617629

Science is great, but doesn't get to provide absolute truth, more like a pragmatic approximation of truth that we get to keep refining to increase our certainty. Pragmatism is then applied.

Neither maths nor science provide any basis for morality. They're deliberately neutral on the subject, though science and technology frequently create scenarios in which we need to consider morality.

Morality derives from life and lived experience, individually and collectively. Some of it is so ancient and deeply ingrained that it is inherent in our evolved biology, some is stories passed down, and some is based on abstract philosophical reasoning. Morality is inherently subjective, and may not therefore be absolute.",1564617631

If you look at the West Virginia Lumber Company they clearly had several power armor stations (and no doubt multiple suits of it, too). It stands to reason they were using power armor to lift and move wood around like power loaders.

Likewise, the Garrahan Mining Company also had a ton of power armor judging from all the power armor stations around the area and at their HQ. They were no doubt using power armor in the mines while they were also reverse engineering West Tek's designs to make a highly efficient, mining-specific variant of power armor (Excavator).",1564617631

"illnessfakers","t5_g49g0","These are my opinions on Ren (sorry it's so long):

I think that they know for a fact that they do not have hEDS or POTS. I think they know for a fact that they did not dislocate their ankle (note that they were on crutches for a couple of days, and didn't post pics of any imaging results, which we know they would have done if there'd been something serious like a dislocation). However, I believe that what they're doing is taking minor, everyday little aches, pains, and common problems and twisting them into these wild exaggerations in order to provide ""proof"" for the above diagnoses that they are consciously faking.

I think they thrive on the attention they get for being ""special."" Notice how they milked their pneumonia-related hospital stay. I believe they had pneumonia, but again, I think they turned it into a big dramatic saga (look at my catheter! I'm in ICU! The nurses had to bathe me because I can't do it myself!) to obtain maximum attention. 

The only claim of theirs that I believe is their BPD diagnosis. Ren doesn't seem to have a stable self-image. They want everyone to love them, see them as some strong heroic warrior, and to be special. They've adopted this identity of chronic illness patient because it works for them. I think they're being enabled into disability.

I also think that Ren doesn't want to put any effort into their health (like following a balanced diet, exercising, or practicing good sleep hygiene). To them, the idea of a feeding tube takes all the effort out of having to prepare and eat a meal; IV fluids mean they don't have to drink; a wheelchair is great because they don't have to walk. And instead of limiting screen time and following a sleeping schedule, it's easier to just pop a pill and claim insomnia.

I find Ren's case to be very sad, because I think they're totally capable of doing extraordinary things and being a productive member of society… but they're choosing not to because it's too much work, and they've been rewarded for being ""sick"" (positive reinforcement). I think they feel lost, small, and inadequate. It's frustrating to watch them throw their life away and refuse to grow up when they are absolutely able to do so.

Sorry for saying ""I think"" so much… just wanted to make it clear that these are just my opinions. I do not know Ren and can't get inside their head; these are merely observations.",1564617631

Scary thought I’ve had is that the ruling class isn’t even actually in control, they’re victims of the system too (even if their victim-status is massively overshadowed by the amount of harm they gleefully inflict on other less-privileged people) and they’re rarely even cognizant of the forces that direct the vast energies of modern society, above and beyond the petty power squabbles that occupy the political elite.

Stalwart Golden Lion: increased threat &amp; up to 16% damage buff*

Dread Warrior: +5k power &amp; +10% party damage buff

*2% per stack, up to 8 stacks, though difficult to get more than 2 stacks without Legendary Lion mount equip

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt;Sense of pride and accomplishment right there.

I wonder though... would seeking pride and accomplishment in a game item not be another of the issues discussed here, either as a predatory practice or at least an unhealty game practice?

In other words, is 'Fight not for good or evil but for the awesome' predatory?

I know that the MMO genre is built upon the tales of legendary heroes with named items and tries to emulate that. So I guess there has to be something of the sort. But it is different to speak of a mythical item for lore reasons (think Caladbolg) or a mythical item for reasons of exclusivity.

The latter seem to be a difficult issue to solve. There is not much that can be done so that special players (so, about what, half the player base?) have the special item nobody has (and mind you, there is no satisfaction in having a million unique items for everyone to have their own either).

So what are you going to do to give a sens of pride to those who could not care less about slaying dragons to save the world? Ultra-rare RNG loot? Insanely hard achievements -the sort of which cannot be trivialized in any way and only a handful of players will ever succeed? Ultra-temporary rewards (such as achieving the first kill ever in a raid)? Very (very (very)) expensive items (in either ingame or premium money)? Extra-long grind counting thousands of hours of play time?

None of these options, from my experience, will be greeted with anything but dissatisfaction (either 'the amount of grind/money/luck/... is outrageous' or 'please focus your efforts on content that everyone can play' -or like here 'you are basically forcing players to trade their health/sanity/wealth for items').

What does the player seeking pride and accomplishment in an exclusive game item *actually* long for?",1564617635

So Basically NYR is prolonging 8.6M over 4 years which turns to be 2.15M over 4 Years instead of paying him the hefty 6.6M this year. Which he was already quite the liability, but they couldn't do anything about it 2 years ago with a full NMC, and it was only until last year his M-NTC kicked in, but didn't nullify the Buying Out of his Contract, but now he was bought out with the Clause of No Buy Out is over.

Something like pizza dough or a babka are a bit more advanced.  A lot of this just depends on what you like.

I think I might not necessarily recommend a new kind of bread so much as any kind of bread that uses a preferment like a poolish, which you can really apply to a lot of things.  If you don't know baker's math yet, that's something you should really get familiar with too...bread makes *soooo* much more sense when you start thinking about it in percentages.

EA's obviously doing shit on Switch because EA's not giving it proper support. It's like dipping a toe in the pool and then pulling it out, shrieking that it's too cold and there's no way you could go in there.

You have to put in more fucking effort than that or of course the result will be poor sales.

Other triple A games have done quite well on the Switch, including Activision's remakes. The problem isn't the games or the Switch. It's EA. It has always been EA.",1564617636

Great. Cool. If a girl wants to do the same? Great. Cool.

Men and women are built differently (psychologically speaking—not just physically). Men are typically drawn to certain things, and women to others. This isn’t a bad thing.

&gt; Masih Alinejad founded the &amp;#039;White Wednesdays&amp;#039; campaign in Iran to encourage women to post photographs of themselves without headscarves online as a way of opposing the compulsory hijab.

&gt; The semi-official Fars news agency on Monday quoted the head of the Tehran Revolutionary Court, Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, as saying that &amp;#039;those who film themselves or others while removing the hijab and send photos to this woman ... will be sentenced to between one and 10 years in prison.

&gt; The Islamic headscarf is mandatory in public for all women in Iran.Those who violate the rule are usually sentenced to two months in prison or less, and fined around &amp;pound;20.Lately, a few daring women in Iran&amp;#039;s capital have been taking off their mandatory headscarves in public, risking arrest and drawing the ire of hardliners.

"ModelSouthernState","t5_37x1y","I am extremely mixed on this docket as a whole.   


**B175:** While I respect my colleagues intent to ensure that every Dixian has their second amendment right guaranteed, I have qualms with the section which repeals the armor piercing ammunition ban. That statute was put into place to protect our police and those who put their lives on the line to protect our community. Making such ammunition will put these officers needlessly in danger. This is especially relevant when we are considering an item which affirms police rights.   


**B176:** Another great bill which will ensure that our higher learning institutions will not use race to consider an applicant. The fact is our state has a disturbing history of using race as a factor for many things, I am glad to see we are breaking down the barriers. However, I will be moving to amend this act to apply only to higher-education institutions that receive state funding. If an institution wants to focus on educating minority students and is completely private, the government should not take any action in stopping them from having the liberty to do so.  


**R018:** Should not even be controversial. We are supporting our constitution here.   


**R019:** Our police do so much for our state, it is about time we recognize the good they do.   


**B178:** I cannot in good faith support this item. It is important that we keep guns out of the hands of people who show clear signs of putting someone's life at risk.   


**B180:** This act is a no-brainer. It puts e-cigarettes on the same playing field as dangerous cigarette. Little is known about the health risks associated with e-cigarettes,” “nicotine dispensing devices, and  and the health risks associated with secondhand exposure to the vapor from e-cigarettes, including the chemicals in the aerosol from e-cigarettes. A recent review of scientific literature found that the[majority of scientific studies determined that secondhand exposure to vapor from e-cigarettes may pose a health risk to bystanders](http://www.phrp.com.au/issues/april-2016-volume-26-issue-2/a-systematic-review-of-the-health-risks-from-passive-exposure-to-electronic-cigarette-vapour/). [Measurable traces of cancer-causing chemicals, such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have been found in e-cigarette vapor. We must pass this to discourage the people from using these terrible products.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110871/)  


**R023:** While I agree there should have been a vote on the rules when they were first introduced, this resolution will strip away the assembly of all of the progress that has been made over the last few months. This assembly was not even around when this was approved, so what does it matter that it was voted on last assembly? In response, I will be introducing my own resolution which formally approves the rules and suspending the rules to pass said resolution. I will also tie that motion into failing this item.",1564617638

"tampabayrays","t5_2s2cl","Copy/pasted comment I made in the Marlins game thread yesterday about Nick Anderson: 

""Nick Anderson played college ball at a team in my conference. The way their field is laid out, I could talk to their head coach while he manned the 3B box from my spot in the bullpen this past spring. I talked to him for a bit about Anderson, and it was interesting.
Said he's a really good guy, but was not immensely promising in college. Had some MLB attention, and the Brewers were going to draft him in a late round as a starter, but then he got into legal trouble (while implying DUI), so he went Indy ball instead.
Then as a starter in Indy ball he was really bad, and was out of the game for awhile. Came back as a reliever, was lights out, and then got into affiliated ball with the Twins. Rose up the ranks and then we gave him to you guys last winter. I'm glad to see him doing well, especially since he came out of a team that I play regularly.
That coach is an old guy who has been there forever, and it was fun talking to him about it, and he seemed happy that I knew about Anderson.""",1564617639

I will tell you how I start them out and maybe you can find the motivation to keep the ball rolling from there. If you get stuck you can contact me and I can provide ideas on where to head next on your journey to a complete lifestyle change.

The first thing I would like you to do is start journaling....an old fashioned diary. A daily ritual. Either AM or PM, but you must write something every day. I prefer hand written. The less you use digital outside of work the better.

You can write about whatever comes to your mind, no less then once a day, but as many times a day as necessary. Always date your thoughts. 

If you are in a situation where privacy is a concern, then get a lock box.

Keep it clean, no pornography, no detailed graphic fantasies..nothing that if some actually read it would traumatize them forever. At some point in your life, you will revisit these journals and you will remember all on your own the details you omitted, you won't need to actually read them.

Use these journals as a kind of therapist, write about your deep memories, the odd things that may have happened to you in your youth, the first time you ever remember seeing a naked person...your first ejaculation, the first time you fell in love. 

If you have had a bad day at work, vent..if you want to jerk-off to relieve the stress...write about your craving, If your bored and want to do the same thing, write about it.

The whole point of the writing is to be able to gather information about who you are and what makes you tick. This information will be invaluable when you are looking inward for the answers as to how to control the addiction.

Your journal is your DIY therapist.

Now go thru this link and make it your job to achieve as many of these suggestions as you can.

"gurps","t5_2s3if","Ok, there are two paths that you can take here.

The path of madness which is aided by the Low Tech Companion series. With those books you can find information on everything you need to build cities and launch military campaigns at TL 1-3.

The path of Sanity is simple. You declare one of the NPCs to be a quartermaster. Figure out the food costs for everyone and the horses, then add 20%. Bill the PCs. Then look up a bunch of useful gear, Eyeball a price for everything you'd think they need ad 50% and bill the PCs. 

When the PCs need some sort of anything they go to the quartermaster. If it's anything from your list then he has it, no rolls required. If it's something that you think he should have but you didn't think of it, well, that's where the extra 50% comes in. If the PCs want something and you don't know why, then give it a simple roll and maybe the Quartermaster thought to buy it. Otherwise the Quartermaster buys cheap and keeps the extra money in a lock box for future need.

This also lets you slip useful gear to the PCs because the Quartermaster found a back ally deal.

You could develop the character to be truly memorable. For example he's laundering money from the PCs but at the same time he always comes through on critical items and occasionally comesup with knock off products. Like ""Healing potions"" They work, they heal you, but they also cause 2d6X10 seconds of retching when used. Second hand magic items that might not be 100% real. Like the winged knife that can only be used once before the enchantment dies.

Usually first names containing either lots of vowels or ys. For example Sydris, Dalarand, Elondil. Those sorts of names need to flow off of the tongue.
The surname I often go with combining an adjective and an object: moonwind (ranger), sunstrider (monk or wizard), Nightsbane, 

Sometime just generate obscure syllables and try to fit them together: Dol’Dari. El’Fayen. Del’Doro (bard)

Multisyllabic names really work for non (human,dwarf, barbarian, orc, etc) races 

For dwarves I like to use simple, short names, things that you can spit out at people; I’ve used Orm, Doug. Ordun.

Generally I find just note down names you like from various media, add or subtract vowels and it sounds very fantasy :)

If she would have 50/50, L/OH combos or OH starters as some rushdown chars she would be broken, if she would have teleports, downwards projectiles or parry like zoners she would be broken, she has a great mid-range/punish/counter game, with some tools for playing rushdown/zoning, as any 'jill of all trades', but again, she is an honest character with no broken moves, and as I've said before, a model as a balanced top tier should look.",1564617646

I have to say their name, sometimes repeatedly and if they don’t respond I have to go to them and get to their level. I say “_____ I need you to put your laundry in the dirty basket please.”

If they don’t do it after I know I have had their attention then it’s time for consequence. Depending on what it is I either follow with 1,2,3 logic or natural consequence.

Clothes don’t make it to the basket - laundry doesn’t get washed. (Easiest to put my foot down in the summer on this one when they don’t need clothes for school.)

Coloring supplies don’t get put away and 3 year old brother gets ahold of them and ruins them. Oh well. You left them out.

Hitting (or in our case today kicking) each other means immediately being moved to their bed to sit for 5 minutes, then talking to them after and repeating that we do not hurt people. “But she..”

“No. No excuse. We do not hurt people.”

“But mom I just...”

“No. We do not hurt people. For any reason. If you still do not understand you can stay here for another 5 minutes.”

Then an apology.

“I’m sorry ____ but you...”

“No. It’s not ‘I’m sorry but...’ just ‘I’m sorry. I should not have hurt you. Can I do anything to make it better?”

After they have accepted the apology I tell them they can tell them why they were upset but that it does not ever mean they can hurt each other.

She's living at home right now (at 21) because of health issues and even though we never spoiled her she sometimes acts a little entitled because we're paying for gas and providing everything else, but I'm sure once she's back to work she'll get past that.

&gt;Donna Brazile got fired from CNN and had to step down as the head of the DNC for giving Clinton debate questions.

Are we really still doing the job of the Russians and parroting Wikileaks bullshit?  [Tad Devine said Brazile helped the Sanders campaign as well](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303868-sanders-aide-defends-donna-brazile-after-leaked-emails).  

And Brazile was the acting head of the DNC.  She stepped down when a permanent head was elected.

&gt;They also gave Trump like 5x the airtime as Clinton

Your numbers are way off.  [Here is a helpful tool that measures the mentions of all candidates from 2015 to the election on many news outlets](https://television.gdeltproject.org/cgi-bin/iatv_campaign2016/iatv_campaign2016?filter_candidate=&amp;filter_network=CNNW&amp;filter_timespan=ALLTILLELECTION&amp;filter_displayas=RAW).  CNN mentioned Trump about twice as much as Clinton.  Not surprising when Clinton ran a pretty quiet campaign for much of 2015, while Trump was going nuts.

&gt;Clinton got about 5x the airtime as Bernie.

Actually, Clinton got about 3x as many mentions as Bernie from 2015 to Election Day in 2016.  And that's remarkably high for Bernie.  Of course, Bernie got virtually no coverage in the five months between when Clinton clinched the nomination and Election Day.  So think about how much coverage he must have gotten during the election to get as many mentions as he did despite getting virtually no mentions after he was eliminated from the primary.",1564617647

I think we should start cleaning by ourselves helping each other and reform the local governments changing the mayor's etc.
Police should be more strict not only to people but mostly to other police and government workers.
Also in hospitals the medics don't even know how to sew a wound correctly, a kid was wounded by a metal in the streets and a big part of his leg was opened and it was horrible, when a familiar He took it took it to the hospital of our village the police delayed him by asking what happened and who did it, (really?) when he gone to the medics they were critisising the kid and talking about how he did that. At the end they sewed him ba  and the familiar ended taking him to an hospital in mascara.

George Wallace ran for president and won five southern states by campaigning on restoring segregation in 1968, the year Nixon got elected and Reagan got involved in presidential politics. The so-called Southern strategy of dog-whistling what almost all whites believed about race yielded huge electoral landsides from then up until the 90s for Republicans.

Instead of fighting for what they knew deep down was true, the two of the them collectively allowed desegregation and integration to go forward, did nothing to repeal Hart-Celler and gave amnesty to illegals. Not to mention the complete degenaration of American families, society and morals at the hands of (((liberalism))) that happened on their watch, despite the rhetoric of ""law and order"" and ""family values"".

At best these were men who knew the truth in their hearts and were simply overpowered by certain pervasive powerful influences. At worst they leveraged legitimate grievances of whites for their own political gain and to enrich themselves and their cronies.

&gt; Jul 31, 2019.Four inmates allegedly involved in deadly clash between prison gang died of asphyxiation while being transferred to a safer lockup, authorities said Wednesday, as families of victims began to bury their relatives.

&gt; State officials said clashes erupted in Altamira early Monday when the local Comando Classe A gang attacked a wing of the prison holding members of the rival Comando Vermelho, or Red Command.

&gt; Deluchey said it is hard to confirm with certainty, but initial reports indicated that Comando Classe A, a local gang thought to have been created recently inside the Altamira prison, is linked to another powerful Brazilian gang, First Capital Command.

However my dad was never emotionally distant per say. We did plenty as a family. And after I started college and became more of an “adult” we got along as friends pretty well despite our differences. We just don’t talk about politics or religion. He’s accepting of my being gay so that was never an issue. We share a love of cars, so that’s something we can talk about and bond over. But as an adult, I only see him maybe once a month or every other month despite only living a few minutes away. Neither of us goes to extra effort to spend a lot of time together. But we always have a good time when we do hang out. 

As a role model? I don’t really consider him that. Due to his shortcomings as a father, and as a husband to my mom (he cheated, they divorced), as well as some money issues we had in the past (long story) I consider him more of a friend than a role model. He’s intelligent but I find him close minded and stubborn a stark contrast to my open minded liberal nature.",1564617650

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","&gt; Can't tell if this is a dig at Israel's parliamentary system. Electoral college and two-party system is not good IMHO.

No it's not a dig at it actually. Electoral college and two-party system is pretty bad, what I meant was that when right wing lunatics are elected in the US it's more understandable relatively speaking (due to the flawed system) than when they get elected in a parliamentary system like Israel's, because in the latter there are way less excuses and it says more about the population imo.

&gt; Israel's healthcare, which is by the way a really good mix of socialism and competition, is excellent. But it doesn't affect Americans so sitting in the USA it's easy for CTH to complain about Israel being 100% right-wing and not at all progressive when really Israel is quite progressive on lots of things.

I think that says more about the US than it does Israel. There are third world countries with better healthcare than the US. I don't think socialized/public healthcare is a right-wing/left-wing (with some exceptions) issue anymore, they may disagree on the details but many right-wing governments today seem to have no problem with socialized healthcare.

&gt; Good luck. You should be able to do both, as long as you have a euro acct. and a/an usd acct, do not link them. Keep one “based” in Ireland and the other in the states.

*If* it is true that Vigs tells a story that happens in the main story’s universe, then why does the characters there have powers that completely overpowers *the top heoes in the main series* all while *having these characters be completely unknown and don’t place in the top heroes leaderboard?*. Why don’t someone like Capn Celebrity place in the top 10? He can fly and he has super strength. *Not even All Might can fly*. In the short time he heroes around in japan, he *should* have made a huge impact, moreso because AM have retired. And then there’s O’clock, who’s supposedly *even faster* than the fastest speedsters in the main series. *And yet his name is pretty much unknown too*. Seriously, the Iida family got nothing on O’clock because he *will* run laps around them. And yet Iida family is a big name while O’clock is a nobody? Something isn’t right.

Compare these two characters to the top 10 heroes in the main series and the first thing one would question is “why aren’t these people in the top 10? They’re way more powerful than them”",1564617652

He brings nothing to the table that other more experienced politicians don't already have and he's a wild card on a lot of issues, in the sense that he doesn't have a voting record or strong policy record as mayor to look at. I would feel very unsure of how Buttigieg would govern as president stepping in after the death of the elected president Sanders or Warren. 

Buttigieg needs a few more years and a national position or two to gain a track record and trust with national voters. He would make an excellent House Rep or Senator at this point in his life, which is what he should have run for. Hell, even governor would have been great experience for a potential president. But as the mayor of the 4th largest town in the 17th most populous state in from middle America, Buttigieg pretty much only has good stage presence and wonderful public speaking skills.

"internetparents","t5_31jj6","Yeah, I would look for job opportunities first, and then index them on cost of living, weather/climate, and lifestyle alignment. Maybe think about which of those 3 categories are most important and weight them accordingly?

I would suggest you try out west. Colorado is great for the outdoors and the economy is booming (but the CoL is going up). Same for the PNW in WA or OR. 

Would also suggest Texas. Austin is a great place to live and the surrounding areas will give a lot of the same atmosphere for a lot cheaper. I'd also say the Charlotte or central NC is a great place to live as well. 

The easiest way I've found to move across states is to apply to a bunch of jobs remotely and when you get to in-person interviews, travel down and take a day trip to see the area. If at all possible, find a job first. You may get help with moving expenses and you will have an income level to budget expenses like rent. When I've moved for a job, I will often do a short term rental for 2-3 months to figure out the area and where I really want to live (or if I even really like the place) before signing a lease.",1564617653

Many of them are people that are having something awful happen be it sexual assault, rape, physical or verbal abuse, etc and part of the process with dealing with those heavier sorts of issues is first really coming to accept those things are happening and real. That's why so many posts are 'this very clearly awful thing is happening, is it okay for me to be upset'? From there all those other steps can be taken, but if they are so off balance they can't even fully accept the problem no progress can be made. 

And yes, unfortunately we do get a lot of karma farming. They will typically focus on a popular topic, write something plausible, I get it. My personal stance is that we can't actually tell either way, and that there is a chance the person writing the post is real and thus I play to that chance. If nothing else I've also had people that aren't the OP find my responses and say 'I have a similar issue to OP, I find this advice helpful'.

"theydidthemath","t5_2x23b","A thousand total so 1000 can be representative of the total units of puzzle piece area.

For the sake of simplicity (at expense of accuracy) i will assume each puzzle piece is a perfect square. (This will make the calculated piece size slightly smaller than it actually would be because of the interlocking aspect.

So A = L*W

X= puzzle piece/puzzle piece area in inches

1000*X = 26.625in * 19.25in
This gives us X = 0.51253125

The square root of this area will give us the approximate side length of each individual puzzle piece(0.715912878777858in).

The it as easy as 26.625in/0.715912878777858in
Approximately 36-38 pieces wide

19.25in/0.715912878777858in is approximately 25-27 pieces long

||36|37|38|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|25|900|925|950|
|26|936|962|988|
|27|972|999|1026|



My best guess after just blindly trying a few of those numbers is either 27 by 38, 25 by 40 ( the math is a little off for this, but it would make sense if the pieces were slightly rectangular/irregular), or 27 by 37(with an issue of only coming to 999)


Tl;dr: it’s probably not 1000 pieces. Likely its 1026 and 27\*38 (or 999;27\*37 or actually 1000;25*40)


Edit: if i had just done a quick google this would have been a lot easier 

    The most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for a total count of 1,026 pieces.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Six U.S. agencies created a stealth task force, spearhead by CIA’s Brennan, to run domestic surveillance on Donald Trump's associates and possibly Trump himself.

To feign ignorance and to seemingly operate within U.S. laws, the agencies freelanced the wiretapping of Trump associates to the British spy agency GCHQ.

The decision to insert GCHQ as a back door to eavesdrop was sparked by the denial of two FISA Court warrant applications filed by the FBI to seek wiretaps of Trump associates.

GCHQ did not work from London or the UK. In fact the spy agency worked from NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, MD with direct NSA supervision and guidance to conduct sweeping surveillance on Trump associates.

The illegal wiretaps were initiated months before the controversial Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

The Justice Department and FBI set up the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner with controversial Russian officials to make Trump’s associates appear compromised.

Following the Trump Tower sit down, GCHQ began digitally wiretapping Manafort, Trump Jr., and Kushner.

After the concocted meeting by the Deep State, the British spy agency could officially justify wiretapping Trump associates as an intelligence front for NSA because the Russian lawyer at the meeting Natalia Veselnitskaya was considered an international security risk and prior to the June sit down was not even allowed entry into the United States or the UK, federal sources said.

By using GCHQ, the NSA and its intelligence partners had carved out a loophole to wiretap Trump without a warrant. While it is illegal for U.S. agencies to monitor phones and emails of U.S. citizens inside the United States absent a warrant, it is not illegal for British intelligence to do so. Even if the GCHQ was tapping Trump on U.S. soil at Fort Meade.

The wiretaps, secured through illicit scheming, have been used by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election, even though the evidence is considered “poisoned fruit.”",1564617655

 No one *deserves* a freaking Tesla.  Maybe you could give your daughter the budget parameters and tell her to research and choose the car herself -- parameters being price, year, mileage.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Yeah, my method to picking up chicks is pretty good, its unique.

I go to a popular bar and find a girl who looks around my age sitting alone. I dont really care about looks or anything, as long as she a female amiright? I start off with a cheesy pickup line (they know I'm joking, it's usually a light line) and I offer to buy them a drink (or another if they already have one). I use my charm, light humor and soft tone to keep conversation interesting and keep it going.

We laugh, talk about ourselves, share some personal thoughts, secrets, drink, and eat. We have a good time in general. When I talk to them, it's like were already on our 5th date! She gets super into me, touchy, laughs way too much at small things I say but I go with it. To her, with some small touches back, getting close and good eye contact, I'm also into her.

Eventually our fun ends at the bar, but I smoothly offer to go back to my place and continue the wonderful night we've already been having. Some girls say yes immediately, others are reluctant but I push and push and they cave.

We go back to my place and bust out a few snacks and drinks. I show off my amateur bartending skills, making a few decent mixes and we get back into it.

Our conversations are very personal now. Regardless, shes into me, my home, and very happy shes spending time with me, like we've already been together for months now. Shes getting all excited and extremely touchy, taking off her sweater, pants, socks, because my house is ""hot"".

We start to undress each other with our eyes, get very close and start to kiss. I always ask:

""Are you a virgin?""

If she says no, I make out with her a little longer, ask her other questions and slowly back off. I tell her shes extremely beautiful, a wonderful person to talk to, but I'm ""not like that"" and we should go out first before we regret anything. It turns them on more, but they comply, grab their things and leave.

But if she is a virgin, I slip something into their drink and they end up passing out.

"idlechampions","t5_3m36u","Ok, I pushed as far as I could and tried it again.   This definitely isn't an idle wall because it took some manipulation with documancy and ultimates to get there.  I'm a newb so I don't have the kind of debuffers that would allow me to push further that way.  My ultimates were now at a point that they didn't do much more than the health of the enemies at best.

Theres something called a simple cyst on my left ovary, but she said that she was only focused on my right side during surgery. She didnt do anything for the endo or the cyst that's on my left ovary. She said that my surgery was very complicated bc the torsion and that she could refer me to an endo specialist if the birth control doesnt help. 

My thing is... would another doctor have to do another laparoscopy if we dont have pictures from the last one? I don't wanna go thru that again... or pay for it, for that matter, if those pictures would have been sufficient.

Providing more access by eliminating encryption isn't the answer, and anyone with basic intsec knowledge knows that.

&gt;it's your prerogative to disagree with consensus in the same way it's an antivaxxer's prerogative to think vaccines cause autism.

This comparison is so ridiculous I'm genuinely shocked by it but okay, say what you will. 

&gt;Gender and sex have been considered two separate things for nearly a century by psychology

I disagree. This theory has been around for about 40 years. I read quite a bit of  Judith Butler in college including her essay ""Performative Acts and Gender Constitution"" which was written in 1988 and was [one of the first works to claim that gender is a social construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender#Applications_of_gender_performance). This is not a centuries old notion and it wasn't theorized by psychologists, it was sociologists. 

&gt;I said ""in general"" because I was referring to *intersex*people; that's it, not trans people.

I am fully aware that these people exist but the fact of the matter is, in many cases, the delivering doctor will make a decision based on which genitals are most developed and the person will live as one sex or the other. Also, according to your own source, this affects about 1 in 80,000 people. I'd hardly consider an extremely rare condition grounds to give a caveat to the sentence ""males have penises, women have vaginas"". 

All things considered, I couldn't care less about how people identify and it will never change the way I treat someone. I wish nothing but the best for every intersex person, every trans person, every non binary person or whatever other identity you want to use. I ONLY took issue and joined this conversation because someone said that conservative views are not being targeted on twitter and I pointed out Meghan Murphy being banned for saying ""men can't be women"" is an example of that. The conservative view is ""adults can do whatever they want to their bodies but I will not yield the fact that a human with a penis-- who may identify as whatever they'd like-- is a man"".",1564617663

The Customs Prosecutor  informed court that Mohammad Hafiz had in possession 11 boxes of  smuggled cigarettes – consisting 640 cartons – while Mohammad Redzuan  had in possession eight boxes of smuggled cigarettes containing 430  cartons.

Let’s say majority means 75%, Again to be generous. As though it makes a difference to the late term fetus, when it doesn’t.

1250 instance of exactly what I’ve described, per year, in the USA alone. 

1250 necks snapped annually doesn’t bother you, but you’re all outraged by a slap.

For Paladins, Prot wasn't viable until BC. BC brought Avengers Shield and solved a lot of the mana issues (I don't think Paladins got a taunt until 3.0, though). Ret also became more viable with lots of group buffs and Crusader Strike. Holy was arleady good, but became much better.

Here is a list of things that came into existence in BC:

Druid: became viable Bear tanks - the best tank on some bosses. Resto got huge buffs. Feral became really viable.

Hunter: buffs across the board. BM was insane ('big red pet' memes) and Marks was decently good dps with a one click macro.

Mage: Dragons breath, Water elemental, better balanced arcane tree.

Priest: Circle of Healing (so OP) for holy, Shadow became hella viable, Disc became (sort of) viable (sometimes).

Rogue: One of the classes that changed the most -- but without any fundamental class changes. Mutilate brought a whole new vibe, same with shadowstep/cheat death.

Shaman: Well - alliance got them. Enhance became viable (albeit 2nd tier). Resto became top tier ez-mode with earth shield, chain heal and infinite mana. 

Warlock: Class fantasy fleshed out a bit more with all specs being pretty viable. shadow destro became so good by tier 6 it should have been illegal. Felguard, UA - introduced in BC.

Warrior: All specs became more fleshed out, and warriors were still the best dps and tanks most of the time. At this time, you could still rotate shamans into the melee group for windfury and hero so dps wars could be perma-heroism'd nuking stuff. BC brought imp MS, Rampage, devastate and other QoL improvements for prot.",1564617667

Their is also those cultures that had third “gender roles” for specific people, many of which would prolly just be drag queens today. Some birds have mutations that occur often enough to have a third gender. Although this is normally males acting like females or vice versa. 

Gender is the role you play, like male lions eating first, females hunting, while sex is what genitalia is between those lions legs. They describe different things but are usually quite related. To the point where sex differences (like male lions having manes) plays a role in what their job is, or at least helps them achieve it (manes defend their necks during fights with rivals)

It think it was firstly used so people don’t pray on the sand, but now I only use it on dirty floors and it’s more comfortable for your forehead when you get on the ground, some people also find it as a good way to focus the direction of the prayer. Which lead me to my second point, a common misconception anti-islamics love to bounce around is that we worship the Kaaba and the Black Stone because we directs our prayers towards it. We believe the Kaaba to be the first worshipping monument to ever be built in history of prophets and was built by Abraham (pbuh) and the Black Stone to be a rock from Paradise thrown to Earth by Gabriel (pbuh) for the completion of the Kaaba’s construction, and it got black from the sins of mankind. The purpose of directing the prayer towards it is to unite the Muslims in their prayers (since in that logic, it only gets separated from the same direction if you get really far which really destroys the whole “united prayer” thing anyways) and we respect and kiss the Black Stone during Hajj for the sole purpose of respecting the only item in this realm from a place we obviously want to enter so badly. The purpose of prayer itself is for the individual to stay close to God by kneeling to Him and reciting his words, it’s done 5 times a day, a morning one (the most important for the difficulty of getting up 4:00 am to splash yourself in water and pray) one in the noon, one in the afternoon, one during the descent of the sun, and one during the night. In case you don’t know this too, when I mentioned splashing yourself in water, it’s something we call wuduu which is a necessity before praying, it has multiple steps and it’s purpose is to be clean when praying. Bathroom business, farts and falling asleep deletes the wuduu’s effect and you have to do it again. Also after sexual activity, you have to take a full bath before having the chance to be able to pray again.

An interesting fact, you might find a verse in the Quran that states not to pray while drunk, and it might confuse you since Muslims aren’t allowed to drink alcohol to begin with. In the beginning, alcohol was still allowed because moving on immediately is impossible, and that verse forced Muslims to drink at around 10 pm because no more prayers are in the way, and other verse discouraged drinking for obvious reasons, which made Muslims more and more discouraged to drink as it’s not worth it anymore and might as well go to sleep at a time like 10 pm. And then the verse that forbids alcohol entirely was revealed and Muslims threw all their stored alcohol on the streets",1564617667

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Translate harmonics into repetitive, near identical motion.  Now consider that a body in motion tends to stay in motion.

Steering geometry is impossible to explain to a 5 year old, but in a motorcycle it's extremely critical because you have a single tire to steer with and most of the time, you steer that tire in the direction opposite of turn.  

In steering you have a trade-off between stability and maneuverability.  Race bikes and the sport bikes built to mimic them have been designed and built with ""flickability"" in mind and thereby giving up stability.

Back to the repetitive, identical motion that tends to stay in motion.  Pair it with the relative instability in the steering of sport bikes and wobble happens.

Much more goes into it than that.  There are engineers that have retired after having done nothing other than work on motorcycle steering and suspension their whole lives.  

Rider experience has a lot to do with avoiding things that induce harmonics and how wobble is handled.

A lot of time, young riders with sport bikes will lower their front ends, which throws off geometry.  They screw with the slipper clutches, which are safety features and without experience can be a lethal decision.  Inexperienced riders will also tend to favor one brake over the other and hammering your front brakes will make wobble much worse.",1564617668

Halo: The Flood

Ch 8

&gt; The reanimated Marine, now possessed of superhuman strength, struck the Chief with such force that it nearly knocked him off his feet, and triggered the suit’s alarm. Mendoza—or rather, the thing that had once been Mendoza—waved a whip-like tentacle and lashed out again.

.

&gt; The thing’s right arm was still functional, however. A twisting column of tentacles burst from the creature’s right wrist and he could hear the bones inside break as they forced its right hand roughly aside.

&gt; The tentacle flashed out, cracked like a whip and hurled the Master Chief to the floor. His shields were almost completely drained from the single blow.

.

&gt; During the first moments of the attack the Chief wondered if a corpse had somehow fallen on him from above, but soon learned the truth, as more of the horribly misshapen creatures appeared and hurled themselves forward. Not just ran, but vaulted high into the air, as if hoping to crush him under their weight.

&gt; The creatures were roughly humanoid, hunchbacked figures that looked partially rotted. Their limbs seemed to be stretched to the breaking point. Clusters of tentacles protruded from ragged holes in their skin.

&gt; They were susceptible to bullets, however, something for which the Chief was thankful, although it often took fifteen or twenty rounds to put one down for good.

Ch 9

&gt; Then, as part of what would become a familiar pattern, combat forms leaped fifteen meters through the air, only to shrivel as the 7.62mm slugs tore them apart.

Ch 10

&gt; The first hint he had that a Flood form had come up behind him was when it whacked the Spartan in the head.

&gt; The blow would have killed anyone else, but the armor saved him, and the Chief rolled in the direction of the blow.

Ch 11

&gt; The combat form he’d been shooting leaped fifteen meters into the air, wrapped his legs around the Marine’s waist, and caved in the side of the soldier’s head with a rock.

Ch 12

&gt; Without warning, a combat form leaped on his back and smashed a large wrench into his helmet. His shield dropped away from the force of the blow, which allowed an infection form to land on his visor.

Ch 6

At the end of the day, there is a tipping point where it's just not worth it financially to serve the cash-paying customers, since they make up such a small percentage of your base anyway. It costs money to handle cash, have someone count it and lock it up, take it to the bank, fill the register the next day with cash to make change, etc.

As a Half-Korean, the demand from Koreans (not govt) is that Japan remove any war-criminals and families from power in govt and corporations and remove shrines and any statues that celebrate war criminals. Other demands were mainly for Japan to teach their past mistakes with Korea and other countries instead of glossing over it or downright denying it. Furthermore after the Asian Boss interviews to the common Japanese it would seem obvious that the common Japanese population have no clue on Japanese War Crimes of the past. Personally I do think it is wrong for future generations to pay for past generation crimes but the common Japanese seems ignorant in passing over Korea's demands as a ""fit"".

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","So [this](https://aetherhub.com/Deck/Public/144282) is the list I'm currently playing with. It's a bit of a work in progress, specifically in the sideboard. Trying to decide if I like 2 Ceratops in the board against Esper and Simic Flash, or any copies at all. Being a 4 drop it usually feels like too little too late by the time it sticks. x4 Veil feels like too much to me, I'm comfortable at 3. It's great against Esper and Simic but doesn't really do anything in most other matchups, though I have been finding myself siding in a copy or two against Scapeshift sometimes since they're likely to side in Veto. But usually you just want to be killing scapeshift as quick as you can while keeping a Flame Sweep in hand to create an opening to finish them if they go off. 

As far as tips against Esper your best mainboard tool against Baby Tef is Thorn Lieutenant, which is a card I can see the argument being made for living in the sideboard but I think it has enough play against everything else to be fine. It just always makes your opponents removal a little bit worse. Your haste creatures are also a big asset against a turn 3 Baby Tef, you can usually bait the bounce with an Arcanist and then use a [[Tenth District Legionnaire]] or [[Gruul Spellbreaker]] to get Tef off board. If they stick the Tef in later turns then usually Domri's Ambush is your best answer if they're got blockers. Also keep in mind it's not *always* correct to Gods Willing in response to Baby Tef, usually only do that if you know you can kill him when you untap. You can also just side in shock to finish off a Baby Tef when you untap after they bounce something with it, and shock also just kills Hero. Fry also just kills both Tefs whether they uptick or downtick. 

As far as what to expect from them, they're likely to side in: Kaya's Wrath, Dovin's Veto, Enter the God Eternals, and sometimes Duress sometimes not. So don't over commit to the board, and ideally you want to have Veil to handy to brick Thought Erasure/Duress. And just as general advice against Esper no matter what you're playing, don't keep opening hands that are super soft to Erasure/Duress if you can help it. You *usually* don't have to worry about Cry of the Carnarium since it doesn't actually kill anything you play aside from a Legoinnaire with no counters on it they won't side it in. I have seen it so keep it in mind as a possibility I guess, but your real worry is Wrath. 

As far as other matchups the sideboard is pretty straight forward: 

* Tocatli for Elementals and Simic Flash (Frilled Mystic and Merfolk Trickster are both ETB triggers) 

* Cindervines for Nexus 

* Flame Sweep for Scapeshift and Aggro 

* Veil for Esper, Flash, and Mono U 

* Fry for Esper and Mono U 

* Shock for Elementals and also Esper if feel like you need it. 

* Ceratops for Esper, Flash, and Mono U 

The only matchups I don't really have any advice on are Orzhov Vamps and the mirror match, since for whatever reason I almost never see them. I'd also recommend looking around on MTG Goldfish, or wherever you prefer, at the league and tournament results and looking at as many variations on the list as you can. You might see some cards that jump out at you as something you want to include. Hope that helps.",1564617670

A theory I have to back all this up is: When you start the boss fight, there aren’t any zombies spawning. This is because Pernell has left the APD, he no longer has control over the zombies, but due to all the electrical experimentation at Camp Edward as the Avogadro he retains control over the mannequins and that’s why you only fight mannequins in the boss fight.",1564617670

The Republicans had RECORD deficits, and still used accounting tricks to make those record deficits looks smaller then they actually were.

President Obama, in his first week in office ended those accounting tricks. Which instantly made the Deficit look higher in 2008

She also spread rumors about him cheating on her with Brittany in Special Education (and not based on any real proof either) without talking to him about it first.

&gt;Again, there is no evidence of Russia collusion or obstruction after a 2 year investigation. It's not a winning strategy for Democrats to keep banging this drum.

Fuck me.  There are 10 points of obstruction laid out in the second half of the report that include the president telling the White House Counsel to fire the Special Counsel.  When investigated, everyone lied about it.  The fucking campaign head is in prison.  The president's personal lawyer is in prison, the National Security Advisor is awaiting sentencing.

If you can't understand the report, watch the testimony of Mueller.  He says the president can be indicted after office and preserved the evidence.....much of which is still redacted because of other investigations.

We both started really early with RE and were very lucky to buy before the markets went nuts (I'm talking 15-20 years ago). 

We also sunk money into managed funds and set up DRP on them so they're in ""set and forget"" mode - this was all pre ETF so we've paid some hefty fees but overall it's done remarkably well considering how many corrections have happened over that time period 

So now I'm doing a lot of reading on ETF's, LIC's, P2P and bitcoin to see how we can structure our investments so we can actually reach very comfortable FI.  Not really interested in the RE part as we're both working part time anyway.

Remember, your players aren't Narcissus, cursed to stare at his own reflection, or Arachne who was turned into a spider after having the hubris to challenge a god.

You're players are Heracleas, Odysseus and Perseus.  The meddling of gods should put challenges in their way, to make their legend grow.

"bulimia","t5_2tmc8","Hi, I’m sorry that your girlfriend is going through this, it’s not a good time at all, and I think that’s the first thing you should know. We may be doing this to ourselves, but deep down inside there something that we’re trying to control, or fix, or run away from, it’s not something we do just for the hell of it. 

Second, I would say that maybe it’s not the best idea to go on a diet with her. I know when I was in my last relationship, I hated when my SO would try to keep me to a plan of what to eat and when to eat it, and that was so triggering. I don’t know about your girlfriend, but a lot of my eating disorder has to do with control, so having that taken away from me made things worse. 

Third, when it comes to her behaviors, this kind of goes along with the food thing, don’t try to police her and get in her when she uses them. That only makes it worse (at least it did for me). 

And lastly, don’t try to pry information out of her when it comes to this. Let her go at her own pace when it comes to telling you about what’s going on with her. It’s really hard to be honest with people about something like this, so don’t expect her to spill everything.

I am in the process of making my first short ever. So I don't have much credit to my name. I wore too many hats in the production because of lack of budget. I felt less willing to be insistent on the set since most of the cast and crew were donating their time and talent to help me for nothing more than food, credit, possible networking etc. I felt bad when they had to wait in the sunlight during set ups, find parking spots at the locations, etc.

That all might change once I had credits to my name. But at this point a budget that allows me the things I mentioned above and gives me credit and a chance to network, make connections etc., I would definitely take that deal at this point in my career.",1564617676

I *know* that I shouldn't feel this way. I *know* that my life has some sort of meaning and that people care about me, but those thoughts are always the front runners, no matter what.

It doesn't matter how much I sit there and talk myself up, or how great a day is going for me, my brain will just suddenly shut it all off and everything blurs together from there until finally it tells me it's time for bed. My motivation and energy fades until even speaking feels like it's a huge chore.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","In my opinion, this isn't really about his interest level. You mention how caring and considerate he is when you are together. You have also said that you spoke about it and he told you flat out he is not good at it. Instead of using the lack of texting to gauge his interest level, why don't you focus on what it is that makes him bad at texting. You can ask him if it is that he doesn't enjoying being on his phone often, maybe he doesn't like texting as a medium or maybe he's actually very busy.

After you get that information, you can ask how open he is to making an effort to meet you half way. If you are someone that ""needs"" constant texting and/or validation then it can just be a case of you guys not being a good match for each other. Many people think that if you get along well with someone and you have fun that it means you should continue dating. Dating has various components to it and compatibility is necessary.

Take for instance 1 person wants to hang out once or twice a week well then would need to find someone that also wants that frequency. On the other hand there are couples that are extremely busy or don't feel the need to see each other that often..if that works for both parties then they are also compatible. Compatibility isn't just based on how much fun you have together or how you look on paper. If you need something from your partner and they can't provide it, regardless of what it is or how irrational it might be then it won't work.

It's a matter of how much YOU are willing to compromise and how much he is willing to compromise..if you can meet somewhere in the middle then you can work it out.",1564617678

&gt; ...at the same time, my God, if you’re 3 years old and you’re saying you’re feeling a certain way or you think you’re a boy or a girl or whatever the case may be, I just think it’s dangerous as a parent to make this determination then, well, OK, then you’re going to a boy or a girl, whatever the case may be … It’s sort of alarming and my gosh, I just think about the repercussions later on.

&gt; ...When you’re a kid … you don’t know anything about sexuality yet. You’re just a kid.

&gt; ...I think parents need to allow their kids to be kids but at the same time, you gotta be the adult in the situation. Pause with that and — I think the formative years is when you start having those discussions and really start making these declarations

""I just think about the repercussions"" and ""you don't know anything about sexuality"" are, at minimum, gross misunderstandings of what being trans actually means, and ""gotta be the adult in the situation"" seems to imply that parents ought to be suppressing potential trans identity in their kid. I admit I'd initially responded assuming the standard ""well if you're an adult do what you want but kids are too young"" comment and the context makes it somewhat less bad, but I still think he's at best quite misinformed.",1564617679

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","In Tolkien the elves are meant to represent men before the Fall (i.e. being outcast from Eden), being immortal, powerful, immune to disease and so on. Tolkien didn't like labouring religious parallels into his stories (one of the reasons he disliked his friend CS Lewis's **Narnia** books) so he changed things around a lot, made them a different race and so on. But his idea was that the elves were in decline because of a slow birthrate and because of the massive wars they put themselves at the forefront of.

Other fantasy writers have done the same thing, so elves are, generally speaking, more powerful, stronger, faster, wiser etc than humans, but they are also more complacent, breed far more slowly, are slower to react to threats and much less reckless, but also less capable of dealing with rapidly changing circumstances. In any one engagement the elves are very likely to win, but the elves are effectively unable to win a long war of attrition against superior numbers. Literally hundreds of humans can die for every elf killed and it's still a great achievement, because the humans can go away and come back twenty years later with hundreds or thousands of fresh troops, and the elves may have exactly the same number as last time.

For settings that play around with this, there's the **Malazan** series where the elf-analogue race, the Tiste, are far more powerful than humans but also not overtly at loggerheads with them. The Tiste mastery of sorcery massively outstrips human magic and makes up for the deficiency in numbers.

In **Forgotten Realms** the surface elves are still around and powerful, and have integrated with human societies in some places so you have a lot of half-elves running around, but otherwise are somewhat in decline as is traditional. But you also have the dark elves who have been banished to the Underdark, who are shorter-lived and faster-breeding than their surface cousins and a much more serious threat.",1564617680

That could mean there’s a disconnection of the leads from the contacts or the circuit board -or- the contacts in the pod are disconnected from the coil. You have tried different pods which would rule out the latter. 

As long as you have determined to the best of your ability there’s nothing obstructing the pod contacts from solid connection with the battery contacts then I’m inclined at this point to say it’s the battery section that’s at fault and you should contact the seller first to see if you have any recourse with them then try Uwell themselves.

This woman was very stressed at the time, and she made an angry phone call to the correct bureaucrat explaining that it is physically impossible for her son's sight to have improved in the slightest because he was born without eyes, the bureaucrat was very embarrassed and made it so he didn't need to attend his appointment.

No, it doesn't. There are diminishing returns when you have almost half of the population with higher education degrees. We also import many skilled immigrants here, removing the need for educational spending.

It also depends on what you spend the money on. Spending it on English majors is not as effective as computer scientists and engineers.

&gt;Healthcare can in that a healthy populace is more productive and in turn increases economic activity.

That also has diminishing returns. It isn't a linear rate of return. Also, a universal model that emphasizes broad coverage as does our own does not concentrate healthcare resources in the most productive citizens, leading to optimal resource distribution. It distributes resources equitably unlike the United States. That has costs in terms of efficiency. For example, making a very productive citizen wait for surgery in a line with others who are less productive to be equitable costs the economy more in terms of productivity relative to a system where that person can pay to have surgery earlier and go back to work sooner.",1564617680

Usually, the presentation method is not mentioned in the description, or it's vague enough to think ""We get plates to put it on, right?"" We are also here to point out unappetizing trends. Sure, a shovel can be sterilized, but cutting meat on it is a pain in the ass, looks clunky and stupid, and really doesn't make most think ""mmmm, food."" This is an interesting presentation, but it's not sanitary, and the lack of plates to put it on means it's gonna be hard to eat without consuming part of the inedible stuff. 

Yeah, some are karma whoring. Who cares? If it annoys you, maybe don't follow the sub or click in to look at things? We are here to bitch and complain. If you don't like that, this probably ain't the sub for you. I mean, it could be argued that you are commenting in this manner to karma whore as well. A lot of ppl like to comment ""Why is this even posted"" then complain about what the sub should be about, which means they likely didn't read the rules for posting, or are being contrary for karma. 

This belongs here. There are no plates, no sign this is themed, is unsanitary, hard to eat, and if serving method is mentioned in the menu, it is not the first kind of basket that comes to mind when in a place to eat. I see ""served in basket,"" I think plastic or metal food basket forfried foods, not a wicker basket. Or if combined with bread, sure, makes sense for wicker baskets, but usually a napkin is there to keep basket and bread from touching and contamination. This, if a food inspector saw it, would likely get the place a bad rating or shut down for unsanitary food practices. Also, if you see ""served in basket,"" many tend to assume that the food, if not fried, is served in it for presentation and they give you plates to eat from.

The evidence was spotty at best, and didn’t paint any kind of picture where this guy was just walking around Iraq murdering civilians at random.

The second one, there are non composite pictures of Earth from space, just non in great detail due to the scope and size of the Earth. 

Van Allen belts are no where near as large as you are expecting, they only go to ~60,000km which is less than 1/5th the distance to the moon. Apollo 11 took around 3 days to get into lunar orbit. According to wiki, 1 year in the belts with 3mm of aluminum shielding exposes the craft to 25sv, or 5 times the normal lethal dose. Now the astronauts only spent probably only 1 day (actually less since the farther you get from Earth in an orbit, the slower you travel) in the belts, so that is .07sv which is like 7 chest xrays (.01sv).

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","Wouldn’t introspection leading to a true understanding of what the underlying causes are, that produce the symptoms be the biggest step in making progress? Especially compared to me brushing them off as before.. 

The causes for me personally &amp; only from small realizations so far are the following. 
 
Fear would be related to my growing up in a tense household as my dad was a violent alcoholic. Me recently falling out of religion is a tricky one (I was a very extreme Christian, took the Bible very literal) what I once believed 110% is still engrained in me, though I see life from a different perspective now, plus it’s only been about a year since I’ve changed my views so it still lingers. Thought patterns are real though &amp; the fear of hell &amp; all that comes with falling away from faith appear. Do I think these fears are legitimate? No. I think it’s an inevitable part of such a big transition to an ideology that I took so literal. I have nothing against innocent religions, they can be great it just turned out unfortunate for me personally. The Bible says “god made man in his own image” but there’s a quote stating it seems more fair to say “man makes god in his own image” all this turned haywire with my perspective through which I seen “god” &amp; the whole ideology of it, especially being influenced by so much fear throughout childhood. I now feel so much more at peace &amp; free admitting I don’t know what the hell the future holds, &amp; being honest that I don’t know everything pertaining if there’s a god &amp; it’s clear the Bible has a fair amount of hiccups, I was also ignorant to evolution lol. If there needs to be a label I’m agnostic. 

Luckily I don’t have anger issues just the normal anger everyone experiences, my guess is it’s rooted in selfishness &amp; wanting to have control over how life goes. That’s why I’m being more open to surrendering to the reality of life &amp; the perspective that it really is beautiful. 

For sadness, it seems to link with a lot of the things i mentioned about fear, my childhood, how people are raised seems so important to me now. All the guilt &amp; shame I put on myself through religion, I would tend to feel disappointed in as I was so young &amp; it was just way to strict of a life to live up to. &amp; also acne. Bad acne, that I still have lol. 

I’ve had a profound change through meditation &amp; facing issues that I once used to avoid with alcohol. Now no alcohol, meditation, very into fitness &amp; a optimistic perspective. 

Also by no means do I consider my life to be difficult, these are all very minor problems compared to what others go through. I’m very happy where I’m at these days &amp; believe that everything happens for a reason. 

To your last question I’d say the suffering that is not necessary. My problems really wasn’t why I got into meditation it was more through trying cannabis &amp; it opening up my interest in the mind &amp; mental health. Meditation is really enjoyable to me in &amp; of itself. The benefits just add to the enjoyment!

"goth","t5_2r505","&gt;Calling it cybergoth is a misnomer as there is no link to goth.

Eh... I'd say both yes and no, to this.

There *is* some form of historical precedent to ""Cybergoth,"" in the form of the early '80s ""[Futurist](http://www.scathe.demon.co.uk/histgoth.htm)"" scene, as described by Pete Scathe's old-school HTML Framed oral/natural history of Goth, and its relationships with other music scenes of the early 1980s UK. Apparently, in 1981, it could be called a ""microscene,"" at its height of popularity, and seemed to just sort of absorb into Goth, by the middle of the decade, but it have a tenuous sort of identity, with music that leaned heavily into synthpop, avant-garde dance (or whatever you'd call Fad Gadget), and some staples that clearly crossed over with Goth. 

The ""emergence"" of Cybergoth in the late 1990s, at least in the States, took off as a direct co-mingling with the cyber-/techno-rave scene in large cities, especially cities with an established history of contributions to disco and other electronic club music that emerged in the 1970s (like Detroit, Chicago, Brooklyn, etc...) which *does* make sense, if only on a broad local culture level; it's also noteworthy that the 1990s saw a relative ""mainstreaming"" of a few industrial bands (or at least a couple of metal/hard rock/???? bands that have strong influences from industrial music — like KMFDM, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Heels, arguably White Zombie &amp; Rob Zombie), while a similarly tiny handful of Goth bands enjoyed similarly low-key mainstream success in the 1980s (Siouxsie, The Cure, Fields of the Nephilim had a song featured in an episode of *Miami Vice* and The March Violets had a cameo in the John Hughes film, *Some Kind of Wonderful*). 

Then consider that about half of the ""Futurist Playlist"" on Scathe's site are also widely considered early/proto-goth songs (and, of course, ""Whatever the hell Frank Tovey was doing"" — damn, I loved that man), in addition to what most of this sub would say is firmly Synthpop, albeit synthpop that's had a long-established popularity amongst Goths, and we see that not only did ""Cybergoth"" not come out of no-where, but it does have its own clear connections to Goth, and is a legit branch of the subculture.

Furthermore, to my understanding, the influence of 1980s Industrial music and early EBM was a lot stronger in Germany's, Belgium's, and Scandinavian Goth scenes, and I've seen the band Poisse Noir(sp?) variously described as both ""early EBM"" and ""early electronic Darkwave,"" and frankly, even with an education in music theory, I'm not sure which term I'd use to describe most of their music. 

Like, OK, I'll agree that Cybergoth fashion took far more influence from 1990s ravers, and those goddamned tube falls so many people had in their hair are best remembered as The 2001 Goth Hair Blight, and thus a piece of our history that's best learned not to repeat. Still, I do think that a lot of the arguments I see on here against Cybergoth are not only inaccurate, but practically revisionist in that ""Cybergoth music"" is best defined as a mix of more danceable varieties of Industrial music, such as EBM, and also synthpop, and some Darkwave (like Unwoman's first album, and most of Yendri's work) — a lot of it being music than many Goths do tend to like more than we dislike (such as Depeche Mode), or at least may pass an individual's arbitrary definitions of ""Goth-adjacent enough"" to let one abstain from whinging over social media about it being played at the club's Goth Night (like, I dunno, maybe anything from VNV's first three records). Now, I'll give that ""Cybergoth"" isn't exactly it's own distinct sub-genre of Industrial, Synthpop, or Darkwave music, either, and the development of its fashion sense and other stylistic and artistic choices owe as much to the Cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction as it does to raves, and it arguably owes less to Goth — but if that's enough to make it ""not Goth,"" then the drawing of the late-80s/early-90s Anne Rice Krispies owes more to the vampire media trend of those years than it did to Goth, so by logic that would make Cybergoth style ""notGoth,"" same would thus apply to all those velveteen Begotten and Jeannie Nitro dresses from 1996, so that's not goth, either! 

Unless, of course, we'd like to admit, for a change, that there are stronger links between *the Goth subculture* and *other Gothic artistic movements that came before the 1978-originating sub-sect of post-punk* than this sub generally is willing to concede to...? I mean, you can't have it both ways. If the logic goes that ""Cybergoth isn't goth because [insert music reason],"" then why the hell are ""Every Day Is Halloween"" and ""Black Celebration"" cheesy old Goth night staples? If ""Cybergoth isn't goth, cos [insert stylistic reason],"" then only the ""trad Goth"" look is Goth, and everyone else is some kind of poseur.

There is no solid argument that both strips Cybergoth of its shares in Goth, and leaves everything but the Traddest of the Trad Goth music/fashion/art/etc... completely untouched by the Poseur Police.

Just... Give up. I mean, I also got sick of the same five VNV CovApoptyCoil 23 songs played every week at the clubs, circa Y2K-2007, too, but if I could get over it, so can everyone else.",1564617683

You would face an issue budgeting for tuition even if you were paid every month, because of the variable timing between payments.

Using three categories, as you are for tuition, does cause excessive front-loading. It's not difficult to figure out consistent monthly budget values, however, that does not tie up excess money. It's simply a cash flow analysis within that category, or maximum drawdown, depending on how you think about it.

Ultimately, you want the total tuition savings to go to 0 at some point during the year.

Instead of a Git commit message which usually describes what the code change does, a PR is usually better describing why the commit(s) is necessary or the reasoning for it.

Also pertaining to the description of a PR, you can add images, links, code examples, etc that you would likely not be able to do with a Git commit message, or at least in a nice Markdown format.  Also, IMO a PR would have better messaging as most commit messages are short.

Kuykendall said, “The CIA didn’t give a damn about anything but Cuba and the Soviets. Indirectly, they (the CIA) have got to take some of the blame.” He alleged the CIA “protected the DFS for decades,” and stated “The DFS just got out of hand.”",1564617687

It's unlikely the scammers will escalate to local PD, as what are they going to say ""We sold some illegal stuff to a guy, he paid us, then won't pay more.  Please arrest him"" - what are they going to do? Provide their website and order info as 'proof'?

Theoretically you *could* be on the hook if the website gets raided or something, and they find your order. But that would be a long stretch.

Just don't accept any packages from people you don't know (refuse if you get one) or send back w/out opening if you get one left on porch. Don't take into home, that's for sure.

He had already WRITTEN most of it in 2005, but he didn't publish it until 2011. I mean honestly I don't expect Winds until maybe 2021 at the earliest.

"Waxpen","t5_30gcq","I think the quartz tail may help with the even heating ... but I'm not sure that's where the Sai TAF gets beat here ... the Sai TAF's screw mechanism snugs the quartz cup down very nicely to the heater, that in the case of the Sai TAF, does not have a hole (its a flat disc, not a donut), so I expect the bottom should heat well and evenly.  I think there may be some thermal mass benefits with the tail and the size of the v4 bucket, and I'm sure that helps quite a bit, but the airflow I think is one of the really defining factors (the Sai TAF works better if used with a poseidon type setup and a bubble cap ... but the cup is still so small it's tough to get much direction to the air flow and I still feel it tends to climb the walls ... which just doesn't really happen with the v4).

&amp;#x200B;

My Sai TAF, I am always wiping up some liquid ... with my v4, in 1-2 hits, it's just a sticky residue left from the rosin ... much more complete vaporization (just my 2 cents ... as I don't want to knock the Sai TAF either which is a great device ... I just REALLY like the v4 so far ... hats off to Matt @DivineTribe :) )",1564617690

I would also apply directly to a PhD program in school psychology, if that's what you eventually want. Also, school psychology is a very broad and non-limiting career. You can often work outside schools or in different positions than you think. 

Finally, school counselors in elementary schools and maybe middle schools do a lot of social-emotional work, at least where I am. They don't do as much testing, consultation with teachers, or meetings. Are you more of a writer/numbers person or a people person?",1564617690

Moving costs. If you are going to use a company or rent a truck, make sure to call and schedule it sooner rather than later. Also note that the prices that are advertised are rarely the price you are actually going to get. Best bet is to call or go in person to the company to get an actual quote and schedule your move. 

Something that will require cash or credit the day you close, changing or re-keying the locks and garage door opener. There isn't a way to be certain that someone has turned in all of their keys, and maybe they gave their neighbor a key at some point and forgot about it.

That experience was really all I needed to get a CDL. (For better or worse)

Because of those trucks, I had the shifting down, and the rest is common sense. 

I was able to do a “same day” train and test, and passed without issue. 

The same day training consisted of the guy taking me on the route the DMV would, and taking to a yard he had set up, showing me how to pass the “skills” portion of the test. 

Obviously the availability of stuff like I did will vary by area. However, if you find what construction guys do around a big city, it’s most likely not full truck schools.

Which ones?

The equivalent grade to an attending physician in the UK is a consultant, where the starting salary is the equivalent of around $95k:

[https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/pay/consultants-pay-england](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/pay/consultants-pay-england)

Bear in mind that by time you rise through the various junior doctor grades, you're not going to finish training and become a consultant before you reach your early to mid 30s. I don't think there are many physicians here in the US that would be very happy making $95k after 15 years of experience, but I guess you know the field better than I do.

I have friends back in the UK who are physicians and nobody - I mean nobody - is making anywhere near the kind of money that they would make in the US.

So they can't stop telling the lie, even when it's been thoroughly and publically proven false by experts and evidence.

For example, On the Phil Donahue show, at (25:14)in the video, a survivor of auschwitz insists she saw Germans [make soap and lampshades from Jews](https://youtu.be/7uozjeShNAw?t=1514). 

She doesn't appear to be lying does she? Is she the victim of false memories?

Fake skeptic Michael Shermer tries to pass it all off as a ""mistake"" and wants to quickly move onto a different subject because he knows the soap and lampshades have been completely debunked.

The real historian on the show wants to get to the botom of it and wants to let the survivor/witness tell her story.

 Phil Donahue also wants to change the subject, so he shuts her up by ""hugging"" her and then cuts to commercial. 

After WW2, fake soap and a fake lampshade that were claimed to be made from human body parts were entered into evidence at the Nuremburg war crimes trial.

Germans were found guilty and executed for crimes against humanity.

 Some of the ""crimes"" they were found guilty of was making soap and lampshades from human corpses.

It's no joke that this is/was a very real claim regarding the various crimes alleged to have been committed as part of the Holocaust.

Want to explore what's real from what's fake about the Holocaust?

Yes, it is the fundamental cause of the problem.

Landlords only exist because they can extract long-term net profit from tenants. The only limiting factor to becoming a landlord is the availability of property, thereby increasing property demand and increasing prices.

The issue has been exacerbated by a glut of cheap credit created by QE. Every other upper middle class family has remortgaged and bought more property.

Polanski was deeply troubled by the original killings, and it may have ultimately led to his own legal troubles.

As for Bruce Lee's inclusion, it was because he helped train Sharon Tate in martial arts and stunt work for one of her older movies, so having him on the film's climax makes sense, plus the fact that Tarantino **loves** Bruce Lee as an actor.

&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;  Dos nenas de 8 y 5 años murieron este miércoles, mientras sus padres y un hermano de 10 sufrieron heridas y permanecían internados en distintos hospitales a raíz del choque que protagonizó el automóvil en el que viajaban contra un camión en el kilómetro 253 de la autopista Buenos Aires-Rosario.
&gt; 
&gt; El siniestro vial se produjo alrededor de las 10.30 a la altura de la localidad santafesina de Pavón e involucró a un Renault Sandero y un camión.
&gt; 
&gt;  Como consecuencia de la colisión, la piba de 8 años murió mientras era atendida en un centro de salud de la localidad santafesina de Villa Constitución, mientras que su hermana, de 5, falleció esta tarde en el hospital de Emergencias de Rosario
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; En tanto, un tercer hermano, de 10 años, permanecía internado en el hospital de Niños de Rosario _""con politraumatismos graves""_ y asistencia respiratoria mecánica, indicaron fuentes del centro de salud.
&gt; 
&gt;  Los padres de los chicos, en tanto, continuaban internados en el hospital de Villa Constitución con heridas de menor gravedad.

&gt; 
&gt; La Fiscalía de esa localidad, ubicada a 50 kilómetros al sur de Rosario, ordenó una pericia de planimetría, toma de testimonios y levantamiento de rastros, informaron fuentes judiciales.
&gt; 
&gt;  De acuerdo a las primeras averiguaciones, el conductor del automóvil habría perdido el control del mismo y se cruzó a la mano de enfrente, donde chocó con el camión que circulaba en el sentido Rosario-Buenos Aires de la autopista.
&gt; 
&gt;  El impacto se produjo en la parte trasera del automóvil Renault, en la que viajaban los tres menores de edad.

She didnt change her plan to move to Darkshore. You clearly never freaking read the goddam novella. She was tricking the alliance from the start. Her aim was taking Darkshore, killing Malfurion and holding Teldrassil as hostage but that plan fail.

Alliance didnt lose at Lordaeron. They Just didnt occupied the city. The Horde still get push out. The alliance still own northern Lordaeron. The alliance lost. nothing at lordaeron. Anduin already evacuated his troop out before confronting saurfang. You know this if you play on alliance side. He even told Gelbin to do so. Only Anduin, Jaina, Greymane, Alleria and the players were there confronting sylvanas which we were all evacuated.

It was obvious from the start the Zandalari will join the Horde. The alliance just want to make sure they cripple them.

The stark difference is hot - an angry 5th grader can kick me there and I'm down, but in a woman's case they'd be like ""ow, the hell is wrong with you you little punk?""

It's that clashing difference of utter weakness vs relative immunity (I get it still hurts a little, but a backhand there won't take a woman down) that does the fetish for me.

White slave propaganda is the term given to publicity, especially photograph and woodcuts, and also novels, articles, and popular lectures, about mixed-race, white-looking slaves, which was used during and prior to the American Civil War to further the abolitionist cause and to raise money for the education of former slaves. The images included children with predominantly European-American features photographed alongside dark-skinned adult slaves with typically African-American features. It was intended to shock the viewing audiences with a reminder that slaves shared their humanity, and evidence that slaves did not belong in the category of the ""Other"".

"neuroscience","t5_2r3cs","Empirically, identical artificial stimulations of neurons do not produce identically reproducible responses from neurons. If you stick an electrode in an cultured neuron/neuron in a brain slice/neuron in a brain from an awake and behaving neuron, and provide identical electrical stimulations, in none of these systems does it evoke identical potentials from the neurons from trial to trial, nor does it evoke spike trains of identical frequency or amplitude from trial to trial. While I understand these trials are not truly perfectly identical, I think this heavily suggests that, on at least the individual neuron level, neural responses to stimuli are not deterministic.

The first one (current guy) he is never on his phone. We have been going out for months and I literally never see him on his phone. He replies within an hour and sometimes (depending on the text) he doesn’t reply; sometimes your boyfriend is comfortable with you and doesn’t feel the need to reply super quickly. 
The second one is my ex. He used to text me ALL THE TIME. Then he went on a vacation and once he got back he wasn’t the same.... he wasn’t texting as much and when he would it would be weird.  It turns out he met someone else.

These are your prize cards. You take one after you kill one of your opponent’s Pokémon. Flip em over and toss a coin to see who goes first. To cut things short, you just keep on going until you kill 6 of your opponent’s Pokémon and draw all of your prize cards. Sometimes you can draw 2 if you beat an EX Pokémon. You can evolve Pokémon once per turn but not on Pokémon you just summoned that turn. You use energy by attaching them to the Pokémon (can only be done once per turn unless you have an ability like deluge) and you use them to access attacks. That’s the basics of the game.",1564617701

4  Too much overhead.  Overhead costs need to be as low as possible for as long as possible.  Having high overhead costs will sink a business really really quickly.

5  Working harder, not smarter. Working smarter is always better.

6  Doing business without getting everything in writing. Partnership deals, client contracts, supplier contracts, everything you do in your business NEEDS to be in writing.

7  Starting a business with debt.  Always cash flow your businesses, especially in the early days. Start small and start with cash because most entrepreneurs will crash and burn a few businesses before they figure out what they are doing.",1564617701

""Ladies and Gentlemen, today, Tuesday September 4th, is a very special day. Thirty years ago today, the world saw its last hours of dry sunlight. I, personally am not old enough to have seen it, but my co-anchor, Anna, is. Anna, would you tell us about those days?



Anna was an older lady, in her early sixties, but with enough makeup to pass for mid fifties. Her hair had long started to gray with age, but was still blonde enough to let you know of what it used to be.



""Yes Jake, I'd be glad to. I was 32 when I saw the clouds first gather. I loved the rain, it put me straight to bed in those days. It may be a strange concept to the younger viewers, but many people used to consider the sound of rain relaxing. I would read, bake bread, and play with my cats whenever it rained. I still do all of those things, but I don't wait for the weather to clear up, because it probably never will.""



""Oh Anna, I've been listening to the rain since I was born, and I still  find it relaxing to listen to as I fall asleep. So, umm, what did you do in the sunshine?""



""Oh, when I was a kid, we'd go to the beach on sunny summer days. We'd walk around the beach, we'd play in the water, and we'd sunbathe. On other days, we'd go for a drive, or ride bikes to wherever we needed to go.""



""Yes, I hear that people used to go for long drives, it's just to slippery and dangerous to drive very far now. Today we have trains to every possible destination, instead of driving everywhere.""



""Trains almost went extinct in the days when we drove cars. Too dangerous to drive now, we'd be slipping all over the place.""

"Iceland","t5_2qigc","Ég hitti Sigmund á sínum tíma á framboðsfundi Miðflokksins í Garðabæ þegar pabbi minn var í framboði fyrir hönd Miðflokksins í Garðabæ. Þetta var seinasta sumar og var þá Simmi ekki efst á tungum manna en þá var t.d. Klaustursmálið ekki komið upp. Áður en pabbi fór í framboð þá hafði ég mikla óbeit á Sigmundi vegna skattaskjólsmálinu og ég man hvað ég var pirraður út í pabba minn fyrir það eitt að hafa ákveðið að standa með Miðflokknum. Pabbi minn er langt frá því að vera illur maður en á þeim tíma þá held ég að hann hafi litið upp til hans af því hann fílaði stjórnmálamann sem vildi virkilega breyta hlutum til hins betra (þ.e.a.s hvað varðar pabba minn). Honum hafði einnig verið ""ýtt"" úr Sjálfstæðisflokknum á sínum tíma þegar hann bauð sig fram þar og átti hann þar með erfitt að tengja við hann flokk en Miðflokkurinn lá þar með vel við. Pabbi minn hafði einnig mikinn áhuga á pólitík og vildi í alvörunni láta gott af sér leiða.

Gott og vel, ég ákvað að gefa Sigmundi annan séns og fór á þennan fund. Ég hafði talað við pabba um það að ég vildi ræða við hann Sigmund um allskonar hluti og var þar með talið Panama skjölin td. Hann var virkilega spenntur fyrir því að ræða við ungan mann sem hafði áhuga á pólitík (hans orð). Því miður þá náði ég ekki að spjalla við hann lengi en þegar ég spjallaði við hann áttaði ég mig aðeins á því hvað fólk sá í honum. Hann var alltaf brosandi og sýndi virkilega áhuga á því sem ég hafði að segja en við spjölluðum lítillega um barrmerki Miðflokksins áður en hann var dreginn frá samræðunum. Hann lét mig vita að hann vildi endilega spjalla meira við mig og sagði mér að bjalla í sig þegar ég vildi. 

Ég veit ekki nákvæmlega hvert markmiðið mitt var með þessu commenti en eftir að hafa séð hann tala á þessum fundi og eftir okkar stutta samtal þá breyttist skoðun mín á honum. Eftir Klausturmálið og eftirmála þess þá missti ég hins vegar alla virðingu fyrir honum aftur. Hann gerði fullt af góðum hlutum fyrir þjóðina á sínum tíma með Icesave og barðist hann einnig við einhverja erlenda hluthafa á sínum tíma en ég meina, come on. Hann hagaði sér eins og versta barn eftir þetta og veit ég enn þá ekki hvernig fólk getur haft virðingu fyrir honum. Gunnar Bragi sýndi þó iðrun og baðst fyrirgefningar, á meðan Sigmundur hélt fram að þetta væri samsæri og ég veit ekki hvað og hvað. Afsakið að ég svaraði ekki spurningunni þinni nægilega, en vonandi geturðu notið lestursins :)",1564617704

I mean every other one of Patsy's paintbrushes was shiny and new looking. Why was this one so beat up looking? I don't believe Patsy was ever questioned about the paintbrush maybe she was and I've just forgotten

Eventually you will learn since if you start off by doing mostly x instead of y and then accept blame for doing too little of y. If you then start choosing to do a lot more y instead of  x but now you start losing for not doing enough x that's when you need to stop and think for a bit to figure out what you should be doing.

If you go back to mostly doing x and someone calls you out for not doing enough y, that's when you can start calling your teammates retards. Personally for competitive stuff I stick to 1v1's or playing with a set group of people so responsibilities can be handed out consistently.

Option 3 only realistically possible team to join would be FCB, since Alpha to TSM is already done and no way they would prefer Speed to Alpha either way. And they seemed quite happy with Ronaky, I don't see them changing their mind now, nor it would make a lot of sense for Speed to leave the Bricks to join them.

Option 4 is the most realistic one of all your propositions that involve changes, even though Kux is a third man and Tad is kinda as well, I don't think this team would work. It wouldn't make much sense either for them after all the good results they had with Alot already.

So keeping that in mind to bother with reading texts from ""Zen masters"" at all seems quite pointless

What point would you say there is in reading a text that we could say is perfect and flawlessly translated? What meaning do you hope to grasp from it? 

&gt;So reading is pointless?

I have a lot of fun with it. As well, there are those who read the teaching and grasp it immediately, needing nothing more. Those people would surely say reading has value. 

If they're lying? I don't see a reason to worry about people who aren't trying to persuade you.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Well if you want something completely different to take you away from shounen, the first thing that comes to mind is Kaguya Sama Love Is War. 

If you’ve ever seen Death Note, imagine a romantic comedy based off of the potato chip scene. 

It’s about the president and Vice President of the school council at a prestigious high school. The Vice President is Kaguya Shinomiya a daughter of one of the biggest corporations in Japan and is talented at pretty much everything. The only person better than her at academics is the President Miyuki Shirogane, a poorer student but a genius. The two of them are madly in love with each other but refuse to confess, as that would be a sign of weakness. So instead they play kind games with each other to try and trick or force the other into confessing. 

It has a unique premise, fantastic voice acting, a distinct style of visual comedy, a colourful cast of side characters and WAY better animation than a slice of life romcom deserves. It also gives plenty of time to actual character development and exploring the motivations and emotions of the characters. I don’t really cry at books, tv, movies or media in general. I sat through I Want To Eat Your Pancreas, Your Name and A Silent Voice with dry eyes. But the manga for Kaguya Sama actually moved me to tears at points. I’m not expecting you to read the manga, but it demonstrates how well written the story and characters actually are. 

Go give it a shot. It’s one of my few 10/10 anime. I can’t recommend it enough.",1564617707

Legends also had a tv show clone wars (not TCW, but im sure you know) Back then, because they had more freedom they had more risks and wild stories. KOTOR is one good example. It also had the Vong stories. Ressurection of the emperor, that were so out there, but in cases like KOTOR great payoff and in the case of the emperor... well you know.

Above a comment gave examples that the new books are well received, but they feel... boring. They are just empire vs rebels with some drama. Feels like filler content that has no real meaning in the long run. Yes we do not want another ressurection of the emperor level writing, but that does not mean we do not want risks in our stories.

Unfortunately with our new stories, TLJ is basically the same level as the ressurection of the emperor story in terms of quality and reception, but we have yet to have something that is close to the level of Old Republic. (not just reven, but Exar Kun, or Nomi sunrider)",1564617709

Because of nostalgia.




Granted most Mario games are dull, they have enough titles where it changes up the story and in game mechanics.


Sonic basically is a one trick pony in fighting games like Smash. Nothing unique other than spin dash.

Meanwhile Mario have:

Cape (Super Mario World),
F.L.U.D.D (Super Mario Sunshine),
Super Jump Punch (Super Mario Bros.),
Fireball (Super Mario Bros.),
Standard KickBoxing (created by Sakurai),
Spin Tornado (Super Mario 64)
Down Smash (Mario DDR)

You could also look into rehoming her after her surgery. It sounds heartless but people love an animal with a sob story, and if her major medical bills are already resolved then that helps even more. The vet might be able to help you out with this as well.  There are also some places that will give a permanent final home to elderly cats, but they usually require a donation or deposit. The cats have nice chill lives until the end with people who understand their needs. 

Sorry again dude, it's a bad situation and you're probably going to feel awful no matter what you pick.",1564617710

LMS is a crock of shit. That style of learning programs breed cheating for the sake of downloading a plaque to print out. 

None of the shit anyone will be paying for will teach you how to interact, manage, or the such for dealing with 200+ people, people that cannot see the obvious, and people that are emotionally invested or in the heat of the moment of things. 

The dude who is chairing this seems like a good dude, has good intentions, etc but that cannot justify everyone else that seem to be in useless positions.

It all just seems to be adding bureaucracy to a system that does not need it, cannot handle it, and just needed a small amount of central leadership to make it work.

So fuck the lawsuits that went up. Just a fucking shotgun to the toes. Read thr fucking room and not your lawyers clutching of shekels.

Anyway our rehearsals ran from 6 to 9ish at night (it was supposed to be 9 but routinely ran closer to 10). It was late after a shitty rehearsal and I'm pissed because I'm exhausted, it's hot, and I'm nursing bruised ribs. I've always had a bit of an anger problem but football, weightlifting, and music help. But not today. We were just told to run back this set one more time for about the 10th time and this little freshman girl who was never anything but nice to everyone kept trying to ask me a question. I have no idea what she asked or what my answer was, all I remember was just fucking losing it and the looking around and seeing this poor girl on the verge of tears and damn near the entire band staring at me. I've been an asshole before that point and after but I've never once had that many people around me look at me like I had just bitch slapped the Dalai Lama while spitting in the face of Mother Teresa. Even the band director told everyone to take a break instead of running the set so he could have a word with me. I felt bad about it once I had calmed down and saw the girl crying and I apologized profusely multiple times during the marching season. I still feel bad about it today when I think about it cause she didnt really do anything to me, she was just there.",1564617710

Positive training alone wasn't working, and now that he's in a better state I can introduce things like the e-collar without turning him into a wreck. I wish I had done the meds sooner because I tried desensitizing him to triggers for months with hardly any results. It being so easy to put him beyond his threshold was actually causing negative progress because he was creating even more bad associations to things.

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","The other day a preacher came onto the campus of my school and was filming a series where students could openly debate him. Having about 45 minutes to kill, I figured I would just sit back and watch the events unfold. Normally I wouldn't say a word and just listen. I'm the type of person who doesn't like a lot of attention on me in large groups, but once you get to know me, a blast to hang out with. So I did my normal thing and just sat there. After about 5 minutes of not one of the 60+ students stepping up to break the ice, I finally said Fuck It and started off the debate. Now it's important to know I an atheist (probably more anti-theist, but I respect people's rights to believe what they want). The preacher didn't know what hit him. Being in Texas, a Christian super giant state, I don't think he was expecting some of the questions I asked him, and my rebuttals to his points. I was clearly ahead in the argument. Not only was I winning the debate, but I was winning the crowd. Whenever I would make a point, people would clap, I started putting humor into it, and everyone laughed. I had the people on my side, and where as normally all this attention would make me sink back, it empowered me. Sadly though my next class was about to start, so I had to leave the debate early. I politely gave the man a hand shake and said, ""I have class now, but this a great deal of fun sir"", but as I walked away, a number of people asked me my name and if they could get my number so we could meet up later because they wanted to talk to me about atheism and just be able to pick my brain. I met some really cool people and it looks like I formed an entire new circle of friends because people who don't believe in god decided to challenge me and be able to do so without judgment.

Of course, $1000 worth of Tether then is worth $1000 now, which is my point.  Even better, Libra is going to have a group of trusted companies confirming these transactions at much higher speed and much lower cost.  I'm excited about the future of cryptocurrencies.",1564617712

Its not illegal to call them about a question regarding your account. No matter how often. And if they block you they aren't providing the service rendered in the contract. And in the end you just need to consider how to legally hurt Thier bottom line until it's more worth it for them to cancel contract than to squeeze a stone for water. Whether you hurt it directly by destroying new customer base by camping outside and warning people of the scammy nature of the place, or going to the news in the right circumstance or in this case just destroying Thier sanity and ability to answer a call without being antsy. If they ignore the phones they lose customers. if they answer every call you make they lose productivity. If they are persistent they will get edgy and eventually answer a call from a potential new customer with a resounding ""fuck off"" before realizing it isn't you and realize that it's easier and more profitable to just capitulate.

The BLS data can give you real data on those making good salaries. If you dig around a bit, you will notice that we only hear from those and see data about those who are the higher end of the spectrum.

Let me put more thought into it.   Radar detectors only work when the cops radar is active.   In heavy traffic areas when a cop is around, it will never shut up.   Out on rural highways where there is no traffic, it’s not going to go off until he clocking you, and it’s too late then.  They generally have an effective range of a mile or two, with 360° coverage, you don’t know which direction they’re in, if he’s a half mile behind you, he’s not clocking you, but it will go off every time they pass a car in the opposite direction.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Your dog's breaths appear shallow and frequent. The process of respiration naturally brings the body into acid/base balance (in addition to the kidneys), so your dog may be at risk for respiratory alkalosis. (CO2 is an acid, and hyperventilation means you are blowing off too much CO2) So then, the next step is to find out the cause of the tachypnea, or high respiration rate. Did your vet draw ABGs (arterial blood gases)? This can help tell if your pet may have an underlying issue causing the hyperventilation; kidneys and lungs are involved in acid base balance. If the kidneys are inadequate, the lungs will compensate, and vice versa. From what I know as a nurse, it appears possible that your dog could be in metabolic (kidney-caused) acidosis, and the lungs are compensating to correct for that. Did your vet order any other blood tests? Like a BMP (basal metabolic panel)? Results of this are indicative of renal function. Yes, I know I'm a nurse and I take care of humans, but mammals and especially canines are vastly similar in the basic elements of how their anatomy works compared to humans. Lungs are lungs, a heart is a heart, etcetera. I wish the best for you!",1564617714

Anything that increases the human food supply is going to increase population size which is going to further trash the environment.

He moved my leg very minimally and quickly. I told him as soon as my hamstring got a little tight and he stopped. Then he crossed my foot over my leg for a second and I do stretches so that didn't bother it. 

However, since the appointment it has hurt worse than it has in a long time. It wasn't flaired up before I went in other than I couldn't get comfortable sitting in his chair.  He told me I was never allowed to sit how I was when he came in, which was with my leg up on my friend's lap and leaning on my right hip which doesn't hurt. Like I said, I stretch and I have pain meds so I wasn't there because I was in pain at that moment. I was there because I want to be able to show any new employer I have this issue. 

When it's been flaired up, I've never had a Dr say it isn't nerve pain and he said it wasn't only because I didn't have pain in my calf.

My wife's ovaries were liberally covered due to rampant PCOS when I first met her. She actually ruptured a cyst the first night that she slept over at my apartment. Not because of sex or ANYTHING specific. She might have just stood up or sat down wrong. She was actually accustomed to this after years of suffering with the condition and she assured me that going to a doctor was unnecessary as there was really nothing they could do. She was even horribly apologetic about it, believing that she had ""ruined our weekend""... which I assured her was ridiculous. So, she spent the first weekend ever at my place curled up in a ball next to me in the living room watching movies.

Oddly enough, it's still one of my favorite memories.",1564617719
"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","Excerpt:

&gt;The young progressives who gathered in D.C. last night to watch the Democratic debate believe Bernie Sanders is their best bet to overhaul the system.

[snip]

&gt;Most members at the bar have been Sanders fans since 2015, when the finger-wagging independent first ran against Hillary Clinton in the last Democratic primary. Brian Wivell, a 24-year-old labor organizer who lives in the city, told me that his support for Sanders has only solidified since then. **“He is the only one who says the change is going to have to come from outside the system,” Wivell said. Sanders, he added, is the only candidate working to shepherd “a mass movement of working people” to overhaul the country’s political and economic system.**

&gt;Wivell’s words pinpoint the exact reason many Sanders supporters still prefer the Vermont lawmaker to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the 2020 candidate who aligns most closely with Sanders ideologically and who, like Sanders, has proposed a number of ambitious progressive proposals. **While on a policy level, the two senators are quite similar, there is still a clear and important difference between them, argued the DSA members I spoke with: Sanders is fighting for a political revolution. Warren isn’t.**

&gt;Right as the debate began, I pulled up a stool next to John Kastronis, a 37-year-old technical writer from nearby Arlington, Virginia, who was wearing a graphic tee with a picture of Karl Marx riding a skateboard. Kastronis, who told me that “the past couple of years have really pushed me into the socialist mind-set,” **said he admires Warren’s knowledge and passion, but Sanders, whose 2016 campaign paved the way for so much of the policy discussion under way in the current primary, is still the “most progressive one in the room.”**

[snip]

&gt;**Group members explained to me that Warren, with her myriad plans for addressing the country’s biggest problems, is operating under the false premise that good laws can fix an inherently broken system.**

&gt;“It’s not that her policies are bad—it’s just that her stuff would work [better] in a system that wasn’t a failed state,” said Irene Koo, a 24-year-old editor at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. In other words, it’s too late for Warren’s plans. The movement Sanders is building, members told me, aims to overturn that system and inspire a new generation of political leaders. They referenced up-and-comers such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Tiffany Cabán, the former district-attorney candidate in Queens County, New York; and Vincent Fort, the Georgia state senator. Compared with Warren, Koo said, Sanders has a “very evidently different theory of change.”

[Snip]

Bonus;

&gt;By the time the Democratic candidates began delivering their closing statements—roughly two and a half hours after the debate began—the crowd outside the bar had dwindled. The remaining democratic socialists were standing, trying to stretch their legs, their eyes darting back and forth between the TV and the Twitter feed on their phones. They chuckled absently at Marianne Williamson’s remarks, and **when Representative John Delaney of Maryland offered his own final words, someone near me snorted and said, “Who the fuck is that?”**",1564617719

Almost instantaneously, the robbers collapsed to the floor, suffering from a bipolar seizure. Everyone clapped and she was given position as senator of the state of Florida, as well as invited by the Democratic National Convention to run for President in 2020. What an unbelievable event!

You have decided that because the pc game dies after 3 months, that’s the new “more than enough” when in fact there’s no reason for cod to die after 3 months on pc. That’s exactly why I’m willing to give up fov sliders and frame rates to tap into the console playerbase, you’re acting like it’s ridiculous for me to want the pc cod to be as populated as the console cod when that’s exactly what every pc player should want.

You started this argument by saying “I still have a big playerbase after 9 months” and now are admitting that what you consider a “big playerbase” would absolutely be considered a dead game on any other platform...........

&gt; At this point it's not even worth arguing with you

"taiwan","t5_2qhrg","&gt;In terms of national policy and it's direction, most 柯粉 are supportive of RoC as a separate entity from China, and some even go as far as saying we are Taiwan. 台派 is the term that is loosely used for those in the RoC, but believe that we are now just Taiwan. 

So is that 柯P's belief as well? That 台灣，not 中華民國，是個獨立自主的國家? Or that 台灣 is just another name for RoC, with the RoC being the official name?

&gt;It has some similarities in ideology with 獨派 but in terms of how to make Taiwan a normal country, Ko has different ways of going about it. 獨派 has their own Formosa Alliance Party, I think they're more focused on using referendums. Ko is more focused on helping the country become a normal functioning country by rooting out corruption and special privileges (like tax free cigs) that our current officials have. End game of both, I believe would be to have Taiwan be recognized.

There lies the issue which I have a problem with. A 'normal functioning country' wouldn't magically change their name though. Rooting out corruption and special privileges have little to nothing to do with changing the name of the country.

I actually think 柯P could be a good president, but 吳子嘉 actually destroyed my perception of him. No friends, 不會說謊. He is going to be a disaster if he offends anyone across the strait or in the US (Note: my opinion is that Tsai had not angered anyone from China, most of the offended feelings are of 玻璃心). Could his partnership with Guo also last 4 years without fighting and splitting up? It'll be interesting to see. Also, I'm kinda a fan of 時代力量, so it'll be interesting to see if they see this new party as a threat. The current leader doesn't get along with 柯, whereas 黃KC has been going after DPP non-stop, they may stay out of the presidential elections but it's definitely possible that they meet in the legislature seats.",1564617720

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

&gt; The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter, novelist, pianist and guitarist John Darnielle. He has the distinction of being named by the The New Yorker magazine as 'America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist'; in its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine dubbed Darnielle one of the '100 Best Living Songwriters'. Darnielle’s lyrics are erudite and compassionate and filled with imagery that reference classical literature, religion, mythology, culture, art, and history. Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on Tallahassee are fictional, but that We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and other more recent work are partially autobiographical.

&gt; Darnielle began performing under the name the Mountain Goats in 1991 in Claremont, California, where he attended Pitzer College and worked as a psychiatric nurse. The band's name, the Mountain Goats, is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song Yellow Coat. Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band, The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

&gt; Highly prolific, since the early 90s Darnielle has released over a dozen Mountain Goats albums, 6 full-length cassettes, various 7” singles, 10"" and 12"" EPs and has contributed to compilations and label samplers too numerous to mention. As of November 2006, the Mountain Goats’ song catalog encompasses 452 songs, a fair number of which have only been played live. Among this bewildering number of tunes is a song cycle named the “Alpha” series, about a dysfunctional couple, as well as one named the “Going To…” series, about people going someplace or other, usually not for fun but rather to flee from a bad situation in their lives. The last series alone totals over 40 songs to date.  Additional song cycles from Darnielle's extensive repertoire include the ""Standard Bitter Love Song #..."" series, the ""Orange Ball Of..."" series, and the ""Pure..."" series, as well as a series of songs whose titles are simply chapters and verses from the Bible (""I Corinthians 13 8-10"", etc.).

&gt; Although his last six albums (since Darnielle signed with 4AD Records) have seen more hi-fi production values, most of the Mountain Goats' recorded output is extremely lo-fi, the only accompaniment to Darnielle’s razor-sharp lyrics being an acoustic guitar and the occasional input of backing vocals, and then the sound of the tape recorder permeating the track at all times, effectively serving as a backing track in its own right.

&gt; In addition to his work with The Mountain Goats, Darnielle has also collaborated with Franklin Bruno (of Nothing Painted Blue) in The Extra Glenns (later named The Extra Lens).

&gt; Darnielle’s song ""Cotton"" was featured in the Showtime show Weeds. It can be heard in the middle and at the end of the 9th episode, The Punishment Light.

&gt; The songs ""No Children,"" ""Old College Try,"" and ""Love Love Love"" were each featured in separate episodes of the television series Moral Orel's third season, which has featured major running themes of alcoholism, regret, and domestic discontent.

My fil turned out to be a good man in his later years, but my mil had a rough time for a long while from the stories I've heard. They married when he was 18, she was 15, after he passed, she kinda went from a 60+ year old back to a teen in her actions. I always assumed it was because she never had the chance to really be young, she went from her dads rules straight to a husband, so when people were shocked by the changes in her I tried to understand and encouraged her to enjoy life as her own boss and decision maker for a while.

If the norm was an open relationship, I think more people would be willing to date, but since the expectation is ""dating when you're young gives away all of your sexiest years to one person,"" and since gay ""sexiest years"" ends around 30 (in many people's minds, not in actuality), people are prone to spend their sexy dollars in their 20s and date much later.",1564617722

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","Good calls on your brake pads, seat post and tires. I liked Purgatorys when I had em. I think your next upgrade should be brakes.... Guide RSCs or Shimano XT. The Guides will integrate on the bars without an adapter tho. 

Here's my build for ideas, I picked the parts for my lizard from the frame up, I am only going to change one thing here in the near future.

Current build:

RS Pike RCT3 140mm

SRAM GX 1x11

Guide R brakes

Santa Cruz carbon flat bar 760mm

DT 350s on ARC 40s (40mm makes 27.5+ even better)

Maxxis High Roller II 27.5X3.0 front tire

Maxxis Rekon 27.5x2.8 rear

Race Face Aeffect crankset

RS Reverb Stealth 150mm

ODI Rogue grips

MTB Volt saddle

Race Face Turbine 60mm stem

Thompson seatpost color

Shimano XT Trail SPD pedals


Comes in at about exactly 28 lbs. The only change I want to make is buying SRAM Code RSCs for my other bike and put the Ultimates on this bike. I'm not really in a hurry, despite what this Shimano fanboy sub will tell you, even SRAM Guide R is a good trail brake. It does fnd its limit at the bike park and fades at the end of the day though and they need a little more adjustability where the Ultimates have no issues...

I mentioned the gym because i go there early morning when not a lot of people are there and the few girls there seem a little on edge and i dont blame them. I just make sure i give them space, dont move at them quickly or corner them. The girls are very self conscious as well.

"ThatsInsane","t5_swxxz","When it comes to light sources for films, tungsten is king! Unfortunately it consumes tremendous power, but the benefits are a long throw, continuous source (no flicker) and full continuous colour spectrum of light, albeit heavy in the red-yellow wavelengths.
LED sources are more energy-efficient but do flicker. They are constantly getting better, but they are non-continuous spectrum, so transmit some wavelengths of blue, some of green, red, yellow, etc. This is why any LED source will have a CRI rating (Colour Rendition Index), which essentially tells you how closely matched the colour and tone of things appear under that light source compared to daylight.

Drugs undergo chemical changes in the body by a number of methods, and some of the most common ones are called CYPs which are enzymes that induce or inhibit a drug. People can be normal metabolizers, fast metabolizers or slow metabolizers for any of the CYP450 enzymes out there and there are a LOT. Metabolism in this way doesn't necessarily mean drug elimination. It can mean activation or inactivation, or people can have genetic SNP variations that lead a drug down a less-likely biochemical pathway. All of these things affect how the drug works and interacts with cellular targets. Thus you can have a drug work well for a Majority of people but work poorly in a few, and work inversely in a few others.

What has happened in this trade war, and in fact what shall continue to happen, is that the US producers shall permanently loose their market share in China, while some foriegn goods shift from China to another developing country, with the happy added bonus of US consumers (at least the not rich folk) pay more or go without.

&amp;#x200B;

The option to oppose globalization without protections for labor was 50 years ago and y'all screamed unions were bad, Democrats were against free trade, and workers rights (along with environmental protections) were Socialism.  Now that all of the affects warned have come to pass the people that caused it are trying to convince you that they can fix it by making things worse.  They don't care about your family nor your children's future.  ""They've got theirs and fuck you and your children"", is their motto.  Shouldn't have listened to them then.  Shouldn't listen to them now.  Removing the Republican party from relevance is the only hope we have now.  Otherwise you can look forward to continued dwindling of US relevance while China and Russia dominate the world.  Go on and dismiss my warning as hysterics but remember, this exact warning was dismissed the same in the 1970s and 1980s by the exact same folks telling you to dismiss it now, which happen to be the same folks that created the current conditions which they said would never occur while screaming, ""love it or leave it!"", just like they are now.

It's probably unlikely this would happen. One of the paradoxes of human reproduction is that we tend to have more children when we're poor, and fewer children when we're wealthy (though the demographic transition theory indicates this isn't a strictly linear relationship).

So, what may happen instead is that migrants to Australia earn higher wages and send money back home (or return to their homeland with money). The people receiving these remittances can use this money to buy education for their children, especially daughters (one of the most effective ways to decrease population growth), afford contraception and to purchase machinery (reducing the pressure to have children for farm/household labour). And if many migrate to Australia, the reduced population pressures in these countries would leave more resources for those who remain, increasing their ability to afford the above-mentioned things that would reduce population.",1564617726

"TeamfightTactics","t5_1136aw","&gt; I meant that often times the items you get do no synergize well with the champs or team comp you roll

Once again: **items first, then team comp**. Stop going for a team comp before you have the items to support it. When you don't have any items you should be using early game synergies that can last you until you have something else to transition into, like Knights, Brawlers, splashing Demon/Gunslinger/Ranger/Glacial, even just good 2-stars that can carry you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqEhcOgddvI

Hafu turned a start with literally nothing into a second place finish at the very highest levels of play. Git gud.

&gt; RNG is often ruining team building and other players going for the same comp or just stealing champs from you so you cannot finish your comp or two star LV4 unit is also absurd.

2-star level 4 champs are just fine and can win games on their own. 3-stars are not at all required for higher-tier champs.

&gt; If I get say an early Kennen or something and the game also drops me some Lissandra's I'll surely opt to go for Elementalist or at least plan to do so on my bank. 

Kennen is fine early since he's a strong unit and can build into many things but Lissandra is an incredibly easy unit to get even late game. Why are you building around her? Yet again, because you refuse to listen: **why are you building Elementalist if you don't have the hardest to get and most important part of Elementalist, being having a Brand or Anivia**? If you have that Kennen sitting around, you should also be open to going to Yordles or Ninjas, or even something like Sorcerer if you can get a spatula. That's three other build paths you're ignoring because the only thing you're thinking about is Elementalist. Once again, you're the problem, not the game.",1564617727

"Christianmarriage","t5_ofzkc","I was going to wait until next week's thread to post this, but I think I'm going to take another month long break from Reddit in the next day or two, so hopefully some people still see this.

I've posted here and other places before about this but its been a while. My wife is currently bed-bound. She is working on treatment but its taking much longer than expected (prayers for her recovery would be very much appreciated). 


[slightly NSFW paragraph]
I am struggling a lot right now with my own selfishness. She has been bed-bound for 10 months, its been probably over a year since we've had sex (probably since we've done *anything* sex-related) and dealing with this has been really difficult. Right now, sex is always on my mind (part of the reason I'm taking a break from Reddit) and so it is sowing dissatisfaction and bitterness in my heart. 

Even beyond sex, I miss my wife so much and it crushes me to see her like she is. Part of her ailment is hyper-sensitivity. Her room is dark all the time. She can't read anything or even listen to audio books. She can't watch TV. She listens to 2 TV shows, but those are the only 2 that she is comfortable listening to. She smells *everything* and it makes things really difficult. She can eat exactly 4 different foods. What she is going through just seems so dehumanizing. I can only spend *maybe* an hour or so with her each day. Sometimes, I'll be driving or sitting out on our porch and a memory will pop into my mind of us taking a road trip or just relaxing together and it brings me a lot of pain. 

I often feel very alone. I can't discuss very much with my wife and, apart from our moms coming over to take care of her, I can't really have people over. My pastor comes over once a week, so I at least get person-to-person fellowship that much, but that's about it. When I am with other people, I'm starting to get to a point where I don't even no how to talk about struggles I'm having - so I usually don't. I'm starting to feel really awkward around other people. I've kind of always been a somewhat awkward person, but it seems to be somewhat worse now, so even the few times I am hanging out with other brothers, I don't feel very connected or genuine.

Work is starting back up soon (I'm a band teacher) which is very difficult because someone always *has* to be at the house with her. We've gotten things worked out with our mothers how alternate days - but its really stressful. On top of that, its marching band season, so I'll have late night football games every week. 

Praying for my wife's healing has become difficult at times. I have entreated the Lord so many times, often with tears and it just seems like there is nothing to show for it. I understand that there are multiple purposes for prayer, and that it often is to align our wills with God (and I do pray for that), but I have a difficult time thinking there is even a point to praying for healing for my wife anymore. I think the parable of the persistent widow is really my one encouragement at this point in that regard.

I don't want to go on forever, so I'll just ask for prayer for one more thing I'm struggling with. I *really* want to be a dad. Walking around or sitting in my yard seeing neighbor kids hanging out or playing with their parents fills me at first with joy and delight, followed by sadness and covetousness (or at least something close to it). This is a new longing. I've always wanted to be a dad, but its never been *painful* that I'm not one before. 

In all of these things I would appreciate prayers for contentment, patience, strength, perseverance, and a continued (or maybe renewed) focus on the Gospel.

Thank you for your prayers.",1564617728

Destiny literally went through this, and abused the system ""just get married"". Dependency conditions are trash, and have kids stuck w/o much assistance if their parents wont help them til they're 24yo, get married, join military, or be an orphan (maybe a few more idk).",1564617728

Inflationary pressures are very often the exact thing that triggers these things. 2007 was partially caused by the fact that there was a big inflationary period in the 2000's which forced the fed to tighten and raise rates really quick. That inevitably put the fed in a bind eventually.

Rate cuts by themselves won't cause deflationary issues however in the short term. Look at 1998 or 1995 as examples. 

Lowering of rates in theory causes expansion of credit growth, which increases economic output and also serves as a synthetic short on the dollar. But it if rate cuts come at a time of severe risk, you may not get the credit expansion portion of things at all. In The long run, the growth in debt due to lower rates does tend to have a deflationary affect. Lacy Hunt has written about this quite a bit.",1564617730
"intj","t5_2qowo","It's a false stereotype anyway.

Which can make a lot of us hide it even more. Our main extraverted function is thinking so most of what we express towards the outside world is logic and thinking sort of things. All of this combines to produce the illusion that the feelings don't even exist, because nobody outside our head knows about them.

Doesn't mean they don't though.

"LSAT","t5_2qsf8","When I took the LSAT 22 years ago, my prep was a few PTs, nothing else - no course, no books, nothing. I didn't even consider that there might be courses or books, just thought it was all ""you get it or you don't"" material. I was so naive! But fortunately for me, I got it, and I got a 171, way above the 75th percentile for the only school I could even consider attending (non-traditional student with a family to support, working full time as the primary breadwinner, so it had to be the local night school).

Years later (12 years later, to be exact), after discovering that the practice of law was not my best career, I started looking around for something else to do, and I came across an ad for PowerScore looking for someone in my city. I thought ""I did well on that test, maybe I can teach it."" They gave me an interview, then another, then some great training, and I took to it like a fish to water. Turns out I was born to teach! Who knew?

What I learned from the materials was huge, and teaching it helped me get better at it. If I had had this information back when I took the test, I would have scored much higher. But a 180? Probably not. That's really asking too much, even of the best and brightest.

I've seen no need to retake the test since, especially since I am not going back to law school (much as I would love to). But I have taken almost every PT, and I typically score between 176 and 179 (no 180 yet, sorry - usually a few errors in RC). But, because of the big change going to digital, I DID take the July test, and was very happy to get a tablet so I could experience that and share the experience with my students (don't be afraid!). I am, however, nervous about my score, because I encountered some horrible technical problems that I won't go into but which could very well have devastating impact. If that's what happened, I will retake in October or later like many of us.

Students DO ask me my score, all the time, and I tell them all of this. You should ask, but it's not a litmus test. Teaching ability, and what they have learned SINCE they took the test and got that score, matters more.

TL:DR: I got a 171 back in 1997, but I'm better now",1564617731

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","None of what you said is true... at all. Hospitals are not required perform medical treatment on you, merely because you demand it.

In fact, most people who need medical care, don't receive it because of the costs. If you self-check in at a hospital's ER, you will be seen by a police officer, who will give you papers to sign, then a nurse of some sort will evaluate you, a licensed professional, and if you aren't about to die or have become poisoned or irradiated, you'll be told to request services at the county indigent services facility, and if your county has none, you'll be given info on which services you qualify for in which county.

Then, when you arrive at ct indignant services, you'll be evaluated again, and if you qualify for care services you'll fill out a bunch of forms, then, depending on the treatment you request, you might see a physician, a nurse, a specialist, or an ethicist.

If you are in need of services, and medical personnel find you and you are lucid, you will asked if you have insurance, and to provide proof. If you aren't lucid or a danger to yourself, you'll be taken to the county's hospital.

The patient never can force a for-profit hospital or clinic to render services. That's... not how it works.

Now, as for why prices of service are so high - hospitals have a monopoly on service, building a new hospital takes a lot of red tape to go through, and most hospitals act as an aggregator for specialists, who set their own prices which you are free to refuse to agree paying (you won't get any services tho).",1564617731

Not in any way that would manifest itself through inherent traits beyond what gender you're attracted to.         
  
&gt;There are no ""heteronormative ideas"" of parenthood held by a fraction (seriously?), its Natures culmination out of many thousands of years of evolution. That is parenthood. Its no idea, its in hard coded in everyone's DNA.  
  
Non-biological parenthood is common, not just in gay human couples, and I don't recall anyone referring to Soldier as ""Biological Dad 76"". So yes, it's heteronormative to suggest that a character exhibiting traits associated with ""dad""s must be heterosexual, especially when they're *not even a parent*.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","okay, I don't think we're celebrating violence alone, but I would celebrate the harsh (violent) response to someone whose beliefs and actions encourage and facilitate such far-reaching violence as those of Mosley (a self-described fascist) did, violence that maintains hierarchies, hierarchies that can only exist through linearly organised exploitation.

This violence, that against people like Mosley, is necessary, because though many people (who wouldn't be the worst off under fascism) may be opposed to the extreme ideas of fascists, most would not respond to it's threat seriously because they do not believe it to be directly of their interests to do so. But people who *would* be worst impacted by such harsh economic misarrangement always have the most to lose, it would be to put themselves at great risk to attack a proponent of facism, despite the fact that the facist's entire schtick dehumanises and objectifies them.

All I'm saying is, it's nearly useless for us to just say that we dislike fascism, at this point (and every point really) we must actively hinder fascist progress, not necessarily violently but to exclude violence is to let them off the hook, is to suggest 'well it's not *that* bad yet, wait until they're actually lining up foreign-born people to be murdered and then we'll think about doing something' - think of it like nipping it in the bud, I'd rather none of those people got anywhere near being killed, and if that means we've got to come close to killing their potential killers, so be it. Or perhaps, the only reason people aren't attacking the USA's detainment centres more seriously is because our expectations are already worn down, if it was the first time in history this had ever happened, masses would be far more riled up and ready to act than any of us are currently.",1564617732

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","&gt;&gt;can anyone provide evidence that shows our current commander in chief to be racist?

Honey, maybe you should sit down


- 1973: The US Department of Justice — **under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations** — sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to discriminating before.

- 1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, accused another one of Trump’s businesses of discrimination. “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said. “It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.”
1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University, Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of “stripping the United States of economic dignity.” This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.
1989: In a controversial case that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the “Central Park Five” — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.


- 1991: A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”


- 1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler’s prejudices.


- 1993: In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn’t be allowed because “they don’t look like Indians to me.”


- 2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a “record of criminal activity [that] is well documented.”


- 2004: In season two of The Apprentice, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a black contestant, for being overeducated. “You’re an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven’t done anything,” Trump said on the show. “At some point you have to say, ‘That’s enough.’”


- 2005: Trump publicly pitched what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said he “wasn’t particularly happy” with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering “an idea that is fairly controversial — creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.”


- 2010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the “Ground Zero Mosque” — a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it “insensitive,” and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.”


- 2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama’s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a ”carnival barker.” (The research has found a strong correlation between “birtherism,” as this conspiracy theory is called, and racism.) Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.


- 2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, “I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?”",1564617733

You did scout everything of what he was doing with your reaper so you should've have had at least some idea of what was going on. Unless for some reason it just breezed over your head. I mean, spine crawler in the main? Diamond or lower build. You also didn't for whatever reason re-seige your tanks and split them. You just let them sit in the corner of your base and let your tech lab get sniped. If anything, you should be scouting the corners of your bases before in anticipation for a proxy hatch, overlord elevator, or overlord sight for nydus. So what you should've done is take the natural, deny vision and keep scouting, build defense, tanks sieged on high ground, SH will attack the natural cc, lift up and pull scvs, keep pumping out units to defend your natural, eventually you will be so far ahead in economy and units you can a-move them while leaving units at home.",1564617733

Whether you think that is sad or not is up to you, but to act like ""movies"" were going to exist solely as rolls of film for the rest of time is silly. Everything changed and evolves. As of now, television is the best medium for telling a story because it eliminated all the constraints of film. This should be especially intriguing for Tarantino since almost all of his films are pushing 3 hours AFTER serious editing. TV, if he would just embrace it for what it is (a great medium for telling stories), is exactly where he should be focusing his attention. The community movie theater is dying, but the home theater is just starting to thrive. In addition, picture quality on high end 4K HDR TVs is coming pretty close to matching what we have in a theater, as are sound systems. No, it might not be 20 feet across, but sitting 5 feet away from a 65""+ tv is pretty awesome.",1564617733

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Your visible rank AKA ''Platinum 4'' is what is your SUPPOSED rank given to you by Riot, but your actual ranking is what your MMR says, which riot won't let us see (?) so in truth your rank on paper means absolutely nothing because your hidden MMR is what truly defines your skill level. Each match you play has a calculated average team MMR for both teams, which is then used in Riots own MMR formula to calculate the LP gains/losses for each individual, each individual gains/loses lp based off of the difference between the COMBINED team MMR. Concluding that, my 100% guess/assumption would be that you've been put in some higher MMR games when you were lower rank, as a filler (to make queue times shorter) and you've either played really well or gotten lucky with your teams in those games, where you've possibly been carried to victory, resulting in you getting huge MMR boosts that aren't really an actual reflection of your rank, just a 'lucky'' streak as some would call it.

Yes he did and he even went as far as to say that ""and SOME of them, I assume, are good people"". So it logically follows that the majority Mexicans coming to the US were indeed rapists and murderers.

He also said Mexicans weren't ""sending"" their best. So Mexico was hell bent on exporting rapists and murderers to the US.

This is worded purposefully to appeal to nativist fears of brown people being sent to corrupt the homeland.

These crazy and unwise sales will obviously be motivated by financial spreadsheets, but where is the footballing logic behind it all? Selling La Joya is a betrayal to him, and to Juve fans. He's one of our most talismanic figures, and definitely our most talented player after Ronaldo. Selling him when we finally have a manger who can bring out his best? That's crazy, especially when he's being replaced by a donkey with the first touch of a tractor.

*shakes head*

And that's not all. If Cancelo leaves, we get a chunk of money yes, but who's going to play RB Paratici? De Sciglio? Cuadrado? Fuck that. We need proper quality there and in Cancelo WE ALREADY HAVE THAT QUALITY. Let him develop. This is all just the management being greedy and trying to make a profit. The only one of these three (potential) sales I understand is Kean, and even then, it's potentially a risky move. Especially if there's no buyback clause.

[***Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach***](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496) by [*acgoldis*](https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/acgoldis/pseuds/acgoldis)



&gt; Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it\.  The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl\.  This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR\.  Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic\.  Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis\.   The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time\-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships\. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale?  Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power?  Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

"malementalhealth","t5_gv2qf","All medicines are harmful in the long-term. They're less harmful than not being treated, though, hence why they're used. 

You can develop tolerance to SSRIs long-term, so they stop working. And you'll get a temporary period of withdrawal symptoms when you stop using them. But the majority of people won't develop any side-effects that persist after they stop taking the meds.

&gt;They make permanent changes to the brain.

Well, you're right about one thing. Neuroimaging has shown that SSRIs can produce growth in areas of the brain that tend to be smaller in people with depression. *Therapy has been shown to do the same thing.*

&gt;Ok, then explain to me how they assess a chemical imbalance? Where can I go to find out if my seratonin receptors aren't functioning properly? And how can they tell if it's genetic, or lifestyle related? 

You can't yet, and I never suggested otherwise. The point I was making is that depression is incredibly complex and is affected by far more things that lifestyle. That's why lifestyle changes and therapy don't work for some (most) people. There are lots of treatments for depression that work in lots of different ways - not just different kinds of drugs but things like magnetic stimulation of the brain. We don't yet have a way to work out what treatment will work for an individual (except when depression is caused by something like hypothyroidism or vitamin deficiencies, which can be identified with a blood test).

That means finding a treatment that works is a process of trial and error. SSRIs and CBT are first line options because they're relatively safe. They're equally likely to work, although someone who responds to one might not respond to the other, so the best choice for an individual depends on other factors. CBT is obviously safe and side-effect free, but it's hard work and takes a long time - and in that time you're living with untreated depression and its consequences (and it might not even help). 

If you're genuinely interested though, we are getting closer to a point where we can predict whether a particular treatment will work for an individual or not. Recent research has shown that measuring brain activity via EEG can predict whether SSRIs will work or not. And I believe there are some genes known to be associated with specific problems that can cause/contribute to depression, and I've heard of people who have had DNA tests that led them to understand the cause of their depression then get the right treatment. There's also evidence that people with certain symptoms (e.g. anhedonia) are less likely to respond to some treatments and more likely to respond to others (like ketamine).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","CSI. I’m really surprised I don’t see it on this list. I was never a big fan of the show, but the pilot was a course on writing perfect pilots. 

The entire concept of the show is introduced to us through the eyes of a brand new employee. They have to teach her all about it, thereby teaching us viewers as well. The whole show seems like it will be about this young woman learning this new field. And then in the final moment of the show a guy jumps out of a closet and just fucking kills her. And that’s it, she’s dead and gone before the pilot is even over. But now we’ve all been introduced to crime scene investigations and so the show can continue with its normal characters who are already good at their jobs. And we the viewers are shown on day one that any character can die at any time, to never take a happy ending for granted. Again, it wasn’t my type of show but I’ve literally seen that pilot script taught in writing courses as the perfect pilot",1564617739

I'm not sure what the exact effect would be; but from my experience, it would cut the capital gains tax considerably in some cases, by maybe 25% or so.

I agree with most of the sentiment that has come across so far, but I haven't seen anything about how the Marine Corps cares for their Marines administratively. You will never hear a Marine sing the praises of an Admin shop anywhere in the Marine Corps because in my anecdotal (and shared) experiences I have never walked in to an admin shop runned by admin Marines that seemed competent at their jobs. I don't know if it's the result of shitty Marines, a broken system, or a little bit of both, but if any other MOS of Marines failed their peers at the rate of your typical admin shop then Marines would be getting fired or separated left and right. A hard look needs to be taken at current procedures and administrative work takes an unnecessary demand of our Marines time which could be better spent learning how to kill people. Maybe even hand over admin duties in the Marine Corps off to government contractors. I dont really know at this point. I could go on about all of my horrid experiences but dont want to get in to ranting territory. Hopefully this helps. 

To any admin guys reading this, I'm sure there are competent ones out there. I have yet to encounter them. And the same with the rest of the Marines in my family.",1564617740

"Fibromyalgia","t5_2qwut","Each week when I grocery shop I get a random fruit or veggie that will last me as snacks all week. Examples: grapefruit, apples, carrots, grapes, pea pods, celery (for peanut butter) etc.

I also grab big containers of mixed nuts from Target. Nuts are high calorie but they're really good for you.

At work, I keep a stash of protien bars for an immediate boost when needed, along with a fresh fruit or veggie option. 

For full meals: honestly, I realized I could buy pre-packaged fresh or frozen veggies and meat and it was a huge energy saver. 

Easy meals: cook pasta. In a big fry pan or pot, saute part of an onion, throw in some hamburger, then throw in some zuchinni. Mix in a jar of pasta sauce and extra seasonings and you've got dinner that makes great left overs.

Stir fry: a bottle of pre-made stir fry sauce, pre-packaged cut veggies (fresh or frozen), and pre-cooked meat of your choice. Throw it all in a pan, serve with rice if you're fancy, and done!

Soups: I make soups in huge batches to freeze for days I don't feel up for cooking. Throw in random veggies or meat (I like hamburger, celery, carrots, onion, canned tomatoes, and pasta). Use a broth instead of water to make it flavorful. Easy, and freezes well.",1564617742

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Após encontro com o [secretário de comércio americano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/acordo-eua-brasil-depende-de-desfecho-com-eu-diz-secretario-de-comercio-americano.shtml), Wilbur Ross, o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, anunciou nesta quarta-feira (31) que oficialmente foram iniciadas as negociações para um acordo comercial com os Estados Unidos.

 “O que era só um pensamento, agora é o seguinte: já estamos oficialmente começando as negociações com os Estados Unidos”, disse o ministro.

 Guedes [minimizou a preocupação de Ross](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/escorregoes-do-presidente-sao-entrave-para-abertura-inedita-afirmam-analistas.shtml), que, nesta terça-feira (30), disse que o acordo bilateral depende do desfecho entre Mercosul e União Europeia.

 Os dois blocos concluíram as negociações em junho.

 É possível conciliar acordos com o bloco europeu e com os americanos, avalia o ministro.

 Segundo ele, o Brasil tomou uma decisão de elevar sua integração no mercado global e, em um momento de guerras comerciais, isso coloca o país em uma posição de interesse internacional.

 “O Brasil entrou em campo. Então, vieram os americanos também conversar”, afirmou.

 O governo brasileiro informou que buscará um[ acordo ambicioso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/brasil-tem-objetivo-ambicioso-em-negociacoes-com-eua-diz-secretario-de-comercio-exterior.shtml) e que envolva alterações nas tarifas de transações internacionais.

 Os americanos, por exemplo, querem aumentar as[ vendas de etanol](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/para-distribuidoras-venda-de-etanol-defendida-por-bolsonaro-leva-a-sonegacao.shtml) para o Brasil. Eles usam o milho como base de produção de etanol e isso torna a mercadoria mais barata.

 Como contrapartida, Guedes citou que o Brasil pretende, então, aumentar as[ exportações de açúcar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/vaivem/2019/05/balanca-comercial-do-agronegocio-deste-ano-nao-repete-o-recorde-de-2018.shtml) para os Estados Unidos. Assim, os empregos e a produção dos canaviais seriam mantidos ou até elevados.

 “Para a gente poder abrir para eles entrarem com o etanol, o que é muito bom para o Brasil, porque chegam aqui 30% ou 40% mais barato que o nosso etanol, mas, por outro lado, a gente tem que usar nossa tecnologia flexível e colocar o açúcar lá”, disse o ministro.

 Guedes também citou discussões para vendas de autopeças brasileiras e, em troca, os Estados Unidos poderiam ter mais mercado para trigo no Brasil.

 Subsídio também deve ser um ponto a ser debatido, o que é considerado normal para a equipe econômica.

 “Os ganhos são tão maiores que, quando a gente vai conversar os detalhes, os obstáculos, a gente vê como eles são menores”, disse Guedes.

 Para um acordo que envolva tarifas comerciais, o Brasil precisaria do[ apoio do Mercosul](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/bolsonaro-constrange-frances-e-da-municao-a-opositor-de-ue-mercosul.shtml).

 Para um acordo sem mudanças nas tarifas, as tratativas seriam bilaterais e na área de facilitação de comércio, propriedade intelectual, telecomunicações e convergência de regulações.

 Apesar de trabalhar nas duas frentes, o secretário especial de Comércio Exterior e Assuntos Internacionais do Ministério da Economia, Marcos Troyjo, deixou clara a intenção de fechar um tratado com mudanças nas tarifas comerciais.

 Para ele, há um cenário positivo para essas negociações, já que os chefes de Estado do Brasil, Estados Unidos e Argentina têm agendas e ideias semelhantes.

 “Podemos aproveitar a vontade política e a convergência de propostas para fazer esse processo caminhar”, afirmou Troyjo.

 Ele não quis prever um prazo para a conclusão das negociações, pois isso pode ter influência das tratativas dentro do Mercosul e da eleição presidencial americana.

 No entanto, o secretário lembrou que a Casa Branca tem, até junho de 2021, aval para fechar acordos comerciais. Depois disso, precisaria pedir nova autorização para o Congresso americano.

 “Podemos aproveitar essa janela para essas conversas”, afirmou.

 Nesta quarta, Guedes reforçou que os Estados Unidos vão apoiar a entrado do [Brasil na OCDE](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/interferencia-no-coaf-pode-dificultar-entrada-do-brasil-na-ocde-diz-embaixador.shtml) (Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico).

 Por outro lado, o país comandado por Donald Trump defende mais diálogo com o Brasil na área de patentes e licenças.

 “Existe um nível de aproximação que interessa aos dois lados.”

 Segundo Guedes, o governo americano estuda uma aliança estratégica para todo o continente americano, em vez do Nafta (Acordo Norte-Americano de Livre-Comércio).  
   
 “Na verdade, uma aliança estratégica. Uma coisa até mais profunda que só a aliança comercial.""",1564617743

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt;Did the theft of documents happen in America? 
No, in China. 

&gt;what is the product category? 
We are manufacturing OEM. We create machinery to make consumer goods (not electronics)

&gt;How did you find out who the tech was sold to and that it wasn't independently developed? 

I am a technical person, not lawyer or IP but it was found people were downloading entire machinery schematics, piece by piece with all specs included. I don't know legal details but it seems evidence is increase in 3rd party supply of our parts and rumor of attempt for third part to reproduce one of our machines and sell to customer in China. I don't know what happened with the ones that downloaded all of the content other than they were fired. It's probably impossible to tell if something is individually developed outside of the software industry (which we can tell I assume if they stole our PLC programs at least but they are available to every customer anyway so no big issue there.). That's why IP laws are the way they are and are kinda crappy sometimes. You can say don't make this exact mechanical part with a CAM because we have it patented but you can't really prove they stole your drawing rather than reverse engineering the design themselves. I have no idea where this situation went legally, only the affect it had on our Chinese market and on our global IP policies.

Also, were the things stolen patent protected or trade secrets?
Both? Not sure what all classifies as trade secret. If we have a part which the patent has expired but we don't share the schematics what would that be under? Instead of a 3rd party taking that part, measuring it, checking the material its made out of, testing to find the acceptable tolerances, they steal the design and skip all of their R&amp;D costs on that side. Of course they still have to set up their C&amp;C machines and tool their equipment the right way so there is some work to be done on their side but having 20k schematics sure helps.",1564617745

&gt;That doesn't mean they aren't free or don't have the power to be logical.

I would contend that all people lack the mental ability to think and behave logically 100% of the time.  That would mean they don't have the power and/or aren't free to act logically 100% of the time.

This is probably true with morality as well, I would say.

Also, I would contend that there are gray areas and there aren't always clear cut ""right"" and ""wrong"" answers to questions of morality.

Perhaps people have an inability (due to brainpower) to determine the most moral behaviors 100% of the time in the same way the mice in the experiment lack the brainpower to make all 100% logical and correct choices to get out of the maze without a mistake.

Can you really blame someone who doesn't have the mental capacity to achieve something when they don't achieve it?  Would the scientists be correct in blaming and punishing the mice in the experiment because the mice weren't smart enough to not make mistakes in the maze?",1564617745

Double Jack  

TM Crocodile / 6+ Magellan  

Colo Shiryu / Warco  


The description says: Stall until Croc is at 3 turns or less, Shiryu at 6 turns or less. Leave stage 2 with Marco out. On stage 3, you keep DEX orbs, and use Warco's switch ability twice to get rid of silence/paralysis. With DEX orbs still, use Croc's special for full board of matching, and finish off Brulee.  

On stage 4, use Shiryu once Flampe poisons you.  

On stage 5, wait until Kata changes all orbs into block, then use Magellan and both Jacks - if Magellan has +100 RCV CC, you can apparently let auto battle finish the job for you.   


I'm missing Warco and Jack, and my Shiryu is at a really low special level, so I can't really try it myself. I'm *guessing* Shiryu and Warco can both be replaced, based on the description of the team, but I'm less sure about Jack. I'm guessing it can be hard to replace Jack, though, since he extends the duration of your end-of-turn healing while at the same time cutting the enemy's health.",1564617747

All that considered, I just wasn’t getting as far ahead as I’d like. A couple of the guys I work with have really turned their financial situation around, and kinda just rubbed off on me.",1564617748

"talesfromtechsupport","t5_2sfg5","Technically, the modem is the part that receives the transmission signal and converts it into a local network / data signal.  (It talks to the ISP's network over long distances - one side will be a long distance transmission line like a phone line or cable, and the other will most likely be ethernet)

The router handles communication between networks, and is frequently bundled with the modem to ""route"" between the modem's network and your local network.  (It separates one or more networks, frequently those are ""trusted"" vs ""untrusted"" networks. On its own, it would have ethernet in, and ethernet out for a basic example)

The WiFi functionality is handled by a wireless access point (WAP), and typically performs no real network functions beyond wireless communication, sort of like how the modem handles long distance communication. (Ethernet in, wireless out)

Since all 3 of these are fairly commonly needed functions, they're often bundled together for residential use, which really blurs the lines between the individual components, as people tend to use one term to refer to the entire bundle, and even independent components frequently bundle in other functionality for convenience. (Additional switched ports, basic routing and firewall functions, wireless, etc)

"laravel","t5_2uakt","I don't understand what you mean. The `create` method should only be showing the form. There should be a separate method (usually called `store` by convention) to take the request containing the information used to create the actual model.

It sounds like something is set up very wrong in your codebase. Take a look at the [documentation for resource controllers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/controllers#resource-controllers) to get an idea of the Laravel way of doing this.

Routes are matched in the order they are defined. Laravel will keep trying different routes until it finds one that matches, or runs out of routes to check. So if a used requests `app.com/models/new` the create action will be returned. If the user requests `app.com/models/1` the `show` action will be returned because it doesn't match `models/new`, but it does match `models/{model}`.

Because routes are checked in the order they are defined you will have a problem if you define the routes in reverse order.

```
Route::get('models/{model}', 'EntityController@show')
Route::get('models/new', 'EntityController@create')
```

For the above routes you will have a bug if the user requests `app.com/models/new` because that route matches `models/{model}`. Laravel will attempt to find a model with the id with the value `new` and fail because it doesn't exist.",1564617749

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Depois de se reunir com o Secretário de Comércio dos EUA, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) disse que há preocupação de que possíveis armadilhas no [acordo entre Mercosul e União Europeia atrapalhem tratativas comerciais com os americanos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/acordo-eua-brasil-depende-de-desfecho-com-eu-diz-secretario-de-comercio-americano.shtml).

 ""Todo mundo está preocupado com algumas armadilhas"", disse.

 Segundo o presidente, há um receio de que o acordo do bloco sul-americano com os europeus atrapalhe o Brasil na assinatura de um tratado comercial com os EUA.

 Ao comentar o assunto, Bolsonaro disse que o tema foi conversado com o secretário de Comércio dos EUA, Wilbur L. Ross Júnior, nesta quarta-feira (31).

 Apesar de reconhecer que há preocupações, Bolsonaro diz partir do princípio de que não existe [armadilha no acordo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/bolsonaro-constrange-frances-e-da-municao-a-opositor-de-ue-mercosul.shtml)[UE-Mercosul](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/bolsonaro-constrange-frances-e-da-municao-a-opositor-de-ue-mercosul.shtml).

 O tratado foi assinado no fim de junho deste ano, colocando fim a mais de 20 anos de negociações. 

 Diante da aproximação entre o governo Bolsonaro e o presidente americano, Donald Trump, o Brasil também [tenta firmar parcerias comerciais com o país norte-americano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/trump-diz-vai-trabalhar-em-acordo-comercial-com-brasil.shtml).

 Questionado sobre o que poderia atrapalhar as tratativas com os EUA, Bolsonaro não respondeu.

 ""Nós estamos começando o acordo. Estamos um olhando para o outro ainda. Nós passamos praticamente 15 anos [com] o Mercosul voltado como um instrumento ideológico para fazer a grande América do Sul bolivariana. E estamos desfazendo isso aí"", disse.

 O presidente disse ainda que outras negociações de comércio estão em curso, citando como exemplo Japão, Coréia do Sul e Bolívia.

 Ele elogiou o presidente boliviano, Evo Morales, por não ter participado do Foro de São Paulo.

 ""O Evo Morales está sinalizando muito bem, não participou do Foro de São Paulo, entregou o [Césare] Battisti, quer comprar um KC-390 nosso. Quer agilizar a questão da aduana lá com Rondônia. O próprio Pepe Mujica, ex-presidente do Uruguai, já deu sinal ai que a Venezuela não é um sonho que eles tinham no passado. Está indo bem as coisas, tá ok?""

 Bolsonaro disse que o encontro com Ross foi excelente e na linha do diálogo que já havia tido com Trump.

 ""Estamos nos aproximando"", afirmou Bolsonaro, que disse considerar o comércio entre os dois países ainda muito fraco.

 Na terça-feira, Wilbur Ross disse que um acordo de livre-comércio entre o Brasil e os Estados Unidos não pode destoar de aliança do Mercosul com europeus.

 O secretário disse que nada no acordo com os europeus seja contraditório com um acordo com os EUA e citou como exemplos questões que os norte americanos têm com a União Europeia sobre padrões nos setores automotivo, farmacêutico e alimentício.

 Ross alertou também sobre possíveis armadilhas em resolução fechada com a UE. Ainda segundo o secretário, a discussão sobre um livre-comércio com os EUA só vai começar após os países avançarem em outros pontos.",1564617749

These animals do not willingly become your meal. They are bred into existence by force, fed by force, beaten with force, exploited by force, and killed *by force*. 

&gt;the fact that the meat of a dog is not for for consumption and can make a human very sick. Not even getting in to the ethical issues

What deems dog flesh ‘not for consumption’? Do you have evidence that it can make a human very sick? I don’t see Yulin festival goers dropping dead from disease in the news every summer. 

Also, are you implying that the meat of cows, chickens, pigs, fish etc. are incapable of making people sick? Our leading diseases that kill the most people prematurely each year have strong links to being caused by animal product consumption.",1564617750

"paydaybuilds","t5_2yibe","Well, a DB shottie isn't meant to be a primary. You gotta pick your shots carefully since ammo is gonna be more scarce so it won't replace your izhma completely. But I think one thing that is nice about DB rounds is that it can be a bit better at room control. For example, a crowded hallway on... Say Undercover. HE rounds can clear out the hallway, but it's gonna take a couple shots where as DB you probably only need 1-2. Not to mention, while the enemies flail around on fire, this will buy you more time than a ""stunned"" enemy (which out of all my hours on payday 2, have yet to see). 

Another nice thing about DB and DOT is that it can help builds like anarchist. For anarchist, you gain armor by dealing dmg every few seconds, so you can see that having enemies on fire will give you armor back while they are taking fire dmg. But that's more or less it. DB, just like HE rounds, is just a support ammo type (I believe).",1564617751

Well luckily this is just a socially universal thing. You should also experiment with this 

1) annoy a group of people that tell you to back off repeatedly

2) continue to harass them get told to leave them alone again


3) follow them some more


4) keep annoying them 


5) most likely get beat down

He seems interested so be confident!

Like he said not jumping straight up into a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean I don’t want one, I will just tip toe around it to make sure I am making the right decision, You definitely want one from what you expressed, I think you should just let things pan out for a while, and if he eventually doesn’t show signs of evolution on your status, communicate you aren’t sure where it’s headed and ask for an answer, by then he will have a stronger opinion, if the answer is anything less than relationship, I advise you to let go, because it isn’t a case of patience and testing the waters anymore, he might be playing you... but first give him some time and feel the vibe, more than anyone you will develop a stronger opinion about the topic, and like him I think you should get to know him more and see if it’s the right decision, play his game and good luck! :)",1564617754

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

**1. Use only M, F, T, R, and G for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

So I said ""Unfortunately, no, not right now. I'm a bit busy, but if you give me your address, I can swing by later tonight and I can tell you about Atheism."" So he says back ""Well, sir, um... I don't want to give my personal information to random people..."" So my response is ""What? Why? You don't want a random stranger knocking on your door in the middle of the day and trying to shove their religion down your throat? Kinda hypocritical, don't you think?"" He just looked completely befuddled as he turned away and started walking down the street, off to his next house. As he stormed out, a couple of the passerbys started to whistle and cheer, soon my neighbors joined in and even some drivers. I waved to them and they reciprocated, soon my neighbors joined in and even some drivers too. It turned out that the man was a police officer and wasn't on any government watch list.

He was on a mission, a spokesman for the local police department told me.

We can't measure it with instruments. We can't determine its chemical makeup. We can't even interact with it, unless you are the one hallucinating it. It is a hallucination. Hallucinations aren't real.

&gt;If reality is not the consensus of subjective perceptions (trans subjective I called it) then what is it? How do you define objective?

Reality is reality. I define objective in this situation as something that can be measured, observed and interacted with repeatedly and not as a function of being on hallucinogens or in some sort of psychosis.

&gt;For 1, I was referring to reality itself. How do you know reality is there if its not being perceived?

Well that's impossible to ever know for certain, but like I said, I'm not so egotistical that I think reality revolves around me.

&gt;For 2), your presupposition is that the face is alive like you are alive (biologically). That's a logical leap that you should at least acknowledge you're making. It is not my claim that the face is biological.

There is no other form of life other than biological life.

&gt;The root of your position (if I may skip ahead a few steps in the discussion) is that objective reality has a material basis.

Correct.

&gt;To that I would ask, what about measurable phenomena for which we do not have a material explanation? Take quantum entanglement as an example. We just assume a material explanation will eventually be discovered. Why not the same assumption about the face in the wall?

The key words are *measurable phenomena.* The faces are not measurable phenomena.",1564617756

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A [Caixa Econômica Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/caixa-economica-federal/) anunciou nesta quinta-feira (31) um novo corte nos juros em linhas para pessoas físicas e empresas, poucas horas antes da esperada [redução da taxa ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/copom-reduz-taxa-basica-de-juros-para-6-ao-ano-primeiro-corte-em-16-meses.shtml)[Selic](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/copom-reduz-taxa-basica-de-juros-para-6-ao-ano-primeiro-corte-em-16-meses.shtml) pelo Copom (Comitê de Política Monetária do Banco Central).

 O banco anunciou ainda que lançará, em até 60 dias, um aplicativo para clientes de baixa renda.

 A redução dos juros chega a 40% em algumas linhas de crédito para pessoas físicas e empresas.

 [Segundo o banco](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/com-expectativa-de-queda-de-juros-estrategia-depende-de-perfil-do-investidor.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos?cmpid=topicos), a partir de 1º de agosto, a taxa máxima de [cheque especial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/marciadessen/2019/06/quando-emprestimo-vale-a-pena.shtml) para pessoas físicas cairá de 13,45% ao mês para 9,99%.

 No crédito pessoal tradicional, a taxa começará em 3,99% ao mês —antes, partia de 4,99% mensais. No empréstimo para quem recebe salário na Caixa, o juro diminuirá para 2,29% ao mês.

 No cartão de crédito, o banco decidiu isentar os clientes de pagar anuidade.

 Para empresas, a Caixa também reduziu a taxa em algumas linhas. No cheque especial, o recuo foi de 14,95% para 9,99% mensais. O empréstimo de antecipação de recebíveis caiu de 1,89% para 1,85% ao mês.

 Após o anúncio da Caixa, o Copom reduziu a taxa de juros para 6% ao ano. O corte de 0,5 ponto percentual foi acima do esperado pelo mercado.

 Além disso,[ o banco ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/06/caixa-sobe-limite-de-saque-em-lotericas-de-r-1500-para-r-2000.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos?cmpid=topicos)decidiu oferecer a partir de 19 de agosto, para pessoas físicas e jurídicas, o chamado pacote Caixa Sim.

 Para quem contratar, as taxas no cheque especial cairão para 8,99%, para pessoas físicas e empresas.

 No crédito pessoal tradicional e para conta-salário, as taxas para pessoas são iguais às de clientes que não têm o pacote.

 A vantagem, para as pessoas físicas que contratarem o pacote, é que o valor pago em tarifa (R$ 25) será devolvido ao cliente em bônus para celular.

 O produto inclui um seguro de vida prestamista com cobertura de até R$ 4.000 de operações de crédito, em caso de sinistro.

 Para empresas, a tarifa é de R$ 49,50, mas sem reversão de crédito para celular e sem o seguro. 

 O presidente da Caixa, Pedro Guimarães, afirmou que decidiu reduzir juros para estimular a receita com os novos produtos.

 ""Temos 92 milhões de cartões de débito e apenas 7 milhões de cartões de crédito"", disse. ""Se, em quatro anos, não chegarmos a 20 milhões de cartões de crédito, tem alguma coisa errada.""

 Segundo ele, o banco poderá perder um pouco de receita no início, mas vai ganhar lá na frente.""

 É por isso que estamos reduzindo os juros. Já fizemos isso em outras linhas.""

 O [banco prepara](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/caixa-prepara-modelo-de-credito-imobiliario-que-reduz-juros-a-faixa-de-6-ao-ano.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos?cmpid=topicos) ainda o lançamento, em até 60 dias, de um aplicativo para clientes de baixa renda e beneficiários de programas sociais pagos pela Caixa, como o Bolsa Família.

 Haverá operações mais simples e menos produtos do que os oferecidos no app tradicional do banco —que, como o Guimarães admitiu nesta quinta, é o mais atrasado dentre as cinco maiores instituições financeiras do país.

 “Vamos lançar um produto que utiliza motores mais simples e que permite o acesso a pessoas mais humildes”, afirmou Guimarães. 

 “A classe baixa vai ter acesso a uma conta para fazer o pagamento e a gestão da conta, com atividades bancárias e serviços sociais que a Caixa prevê, e numa linguagem com plataforma mais leve, que não consome o pacote de dados. Vamos bancar a utilização da internet nessa faixa.”

 A estratégia do banco passa por capturar ainda os beneficiários de programas sociais e transformá-los, eventualmente, em clientes.

 Guimarães confirmou que irá reduzir as linhas nos [financiamentos imobiliários com a troca de indexador](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/caixa-prepara-modelo-de-credito-imobiliario-que-reduz-juros-a-faixa-de-6-ao-ano.shtml) de TR (Taxa Referencial, hoje zerada) pelo IPCA, aferido pelo IBGE em 3,82% para este ano. A notícia foi antecipada pela **Folha**.

 Os executivos do banco afirmaram que a ideia é reduzir ainda mais os juros à medida que a base de clientes for aumentando.

 Pesquisa recente do[ Banco Central](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/por-que-o-bc-cortou-e-deve-continuar-cortando-os-juros-no-brasil.shtml) junto ao mercado financeiro indica que banqueiros e investidores aguardam sucessivos cortes na Selic até o final deste ano como forma de o Banco Central estimular a economia, que segue estagnada.

 O mercado espera que o [Copom faça sucessivos cortes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/copom-reduz-taxa-basica-de-juros-para-6-ao-ano-primeiro-corte-em-16-meses.shtml) até o final deste ano, deixando a taxa básica em 5,5% ao ano. Nesta quarta, o comitê reduziu os juros para 6%.

 A atual redução de juros da Caixa difere daquela liderada pelos bancos públicos que, em julho de 2012, decidiram iniciar uma queda coletiva de juros do crédito para pessoas físicas e empresas depois da [redução da Selic](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/juros-ao-consumidor-deve-ter-pouco-impacto-com-reducao-da-selic-diz-anefac.shtml) de 8,5% para 8%.

 Naquele momento, a iniciativa foi resultado de uma pressão da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff em tentativa de aquecer a economia.

 Bancos privados seguiram esse movimento que, no final, foi revertido porque colocou as instituições públicas em uma situação financeira complicada em um contexto de inflação crescente.

 Há duas semanas, Guimarães afirmou, durante um evento em Brasília, que o banco estudava [redução generalizada de juros](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/06/entenda-corte-de-juros-da-caixa-para-financiamento-de-imoveis.shtml), tanto no crédito pessoal quanto no imobiliário.

 Sem dar detalhes, Guimarães disse que o banco estava reduzindo os custos de captação que, combinado com uma queda esperada de Selic, permitiriam dar a largada para uma queda de juros “sem precedentes”.

 Como antecipou a **Folha**, a Caixa só aguarda a autorização do Banco Central para anunciar uma redução de até 31,5% dos juros dos financiamentos imobiliários que ocorrerá para quem optar por contratos indexados pelo IPCA. Atualmente, só existe a opção indexada pela TR (Taxa Referencial, hoje zerada).

 Com a mudança, as taxas bancárias adicionais que hoje giram entre 8,5% e 9,5% ao ano cairiam para algo entre 2% e 3%. Isso porque o IPCA, aferido pelo IBGE, deve fechar em 3,82% neste ano.

 Ou seja. Apesar de aplicar uma correção que hoje inexiste, na outra ponta, o banco abrirá mão, em um montante menor, de suas próprias taxas, que acabam por onerar os empréstimos concedidos.

 Somando juros e taxas cobrados, seriam 8,5% (no modelo pela TR) ante 5,82% (no modelo pelo IPCA), e 9,5% (pela TR), ante 6,82% (pelo IPCA).

 A direção da Caixa e a equipe econômica, que avalizou essa mudança, pretendiam incluir os contratos imobiliários no anúncio desta quarta, mas o aval do BC ainda não saiu.

 Com a redução dos juros, o banco pretende estimular novos empréstimos e, com a receita desses pagamentos, emitir títulos imobiliários no mercado. Com esses recursos, poderá girar mais financiamentos.",1564617756

I’ve become friends with this girl and we’re both 24. I kinda stopped talking to her because I think it’s weird that she always asks me if my mom approves of the stuff I do. For example, I met a guy on vacation, and she asks me ‘omg does your mom approve of you meeting him’ etc. I’ve told her how I got tattoos and she asks me if my moms okay with it or even ‘let me’ get them. Idk..we’re both 24 and it’s kinda weird to me? After awhile your an adult and should make decisions on your own? Am I the asshole for stopping talking to her because I thought that was weird?

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","This presupposes abstract equality as an end goal. Marx and Engels never saw it that way.

&gt;Hence, equal right here is still in principle -- bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.

&gt;In spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard, labor. 

&gt;But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only -- for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.

― Thomas Jefferson

Bro the founding fathers would line the bankers, big tech, media, etc oligarchs up against a wall and shoot them. Jefferson wanted an agrarian society where everyone owns land and is a self sufficient farmer, he would have never supported the massive concentration of wealth and power by plutocratic tyrants coupled with the lack of ownership of any property by a huge portion of the population. The Declaration of Independence was 20 years before industrialism even emerged in America, their whole world was entirely different to today. There was no such thing as monopolies and oligopolies then, they were specifically against Feudalism, Jefferson was against having a society based on manufacturing and such because of class conflict. He was specifically against the centralisation of power and wealth that Capitalism as we know it causes. Trying to invoke his name to support the rule of oligarchs is pretty insane, the founding fathers definitely are rolling in their graves because America is about as far away from its founding fathers' ideal as possible.

Jefferson was known to take policies that helped the average person (were populist) even if they hurt the economy and businesses, that is the exact opposite of Libertarianism where the goal is to do whatever you can to please businesses and increase GDP. Libertarianism will always lead to immigration, outsourcing, automation etc. All of those things are great for 'the economy' (the owners) but absolutely horrendous for the 99.99% (with this number always increasing due to wealth centralising constantly) of the population that it doesn't benefit.

The libertarians of today have been totally duped, your ideal would be actualised through Distributism. Libertarianism is just a trick of the plutocrats, there's a reason they're all rich.

Check out these books:

- I Want to do is Illegal - How businesses lobby the government to stop small businesses being able to join markets. Businesses won't suddenly become noble and care about ordinary people just because the state disappears lol.

- Tragedy and Hope - Analysis of the history of American economics

- The Servile State - Distributism

If you think getting rid of government interference will stop businesses doing evil shit why don't you look at the history of the labour movement to see what the businesses really do? They literally send death squads to kill their employees for striking, is that what you want? Private militias only billionaires can afford that can force you do whatever they want? Getting rid of the government would only bring forth slavery and tyranny unimaginable. Coca Cola had mercenaries killing people in Colombia just a few years ago. Your second amendment and the government are the only things stopping Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, banks etc from doing whatever they want to you. Banks, paypal, big tech etc are already refusing to platform or do business with people whose politics they don't like, from guys as harmless as Alex Jones to more radical critics like Richard Spencer and the DailyStormer guys. Do you think private utility companies and banks are above refusing to serve political dissidents? What does Joe Schmo down the street do when he has no access to water because he posted Hate Speech™ to Facebook one time after a terror attack? At least it's not the government though, right?

Yeah they're going to violate the NAP, that is and will be their entire modus operandi. Who's going to stop them?

Seriously bro, look into Distributism. Jefferson was essentially a Distributist. I hope you'll see how centralisation, which libertarianism only empowers, is the opposite of the founding ideal. Distributism with a strong state to uphold it is the only way to achieve the founding ideal. It's simply not possible in a highly technological society to have a small state because of the ability to amass huge amounts of wealth through usury, speculation etc giving rise to plutocratic oligarchies that are tyrannical as we already see everyday.",1564617761

I still plan on levelling my 2nd Shai using the weapons i bought for the 1st, but i wont be doing anything more than using the base Aw items for the foreseeable future. You invest in new characters knowing that they might not end up exactly as they start out, but they're essentially balance changes (lets not get into that!) to a class they're happy with when they release it. Shai just seems like they released something to fill a gap in their release schedule, because they're openly saying this is a long-term project for them, its not considered done (with later tweaks if needed) this is an Early Access character, invest your silver in it now and maybe they'll give us something decent in 6mo, and yet what'll happen is the stuff you think they havent got round to, is actually 'as intended' and the vast majority of what they're working on is outfit clipping and whatever is the equivalent of relocating grass beetles! They have a testing platform, it told them their initial awakening attempt was crap, and they redid it. Clearly that process works. So why release it to the live platforms and say its a long term WIP character??

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I think you're confusing a few issues.  Namely, I think you're confusing the canonization process of the Jewish Bible, the compilation of Rabbinic writings, and the diacritical notes supplied by the Masoretes.  So let's look at these topics (and ultimately see why they don't matter).

The canonization of the Jewish Bible took time and was largely an organic process.  The modern Jewish Bible used by Jews is called the TaNaKh which stands for the three categories of texts: Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings.  By around the closure of the Second Temple period, the first two categories were relatively closed.  What varied between Jewish communities were the books categorized as the Writings.  It ultimately came to be that when the canon closed for the Greek Jewish Bible (LXX), a few additional books were included in the equivalent of the Writings.  These books were not recognized in the Hebrew Jewish Bible's canon.  However, this closing of the Hebrew Jewish Bible's canon wasn't connected to Christianity or even to the flourishing of the Rabbinic movement ; rather it began before Christianity truly emerged.  The current Jewish canon contains 24 books.  Josephus, a Jewish historian from the 1st Century CE, tells us that the Jewish canon contained 22 books.  This means Josephus' canon was nearly identical to the current Jewish canon.  Josephus' canon was actually more conservative with two books now recognized not included (or Josephus regarded two books now divided as being a conjoined book or something).  So we can safely discount the relevancy of the canonization of Jewish Scripture.

Now, after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Jewish sages began a process of unifying the Jewish people and consolidating Jewish knowledge.  Fearing that Jewish traditional understandings would become lost, an effort was made to compile and codify the teachings of Jewish sages.  This culminated in the composition of the Mishnah around 200 CE by the school of Rabbi Judah the Prince.  The Mishnah is an edited Rabbinic text, but it is not the Jewish Bible / Tanakh.  The Jewish Bible is a collection of Jewish Scripture, the Mishnah is a compilation of Rabbinic legal teachings.  The compilation of Rabbinic literature is a separate topic from the Jewish Bible.  Any Rabbinic contribution to the canonization of the Hebrew Jewish Bible would simply have been the recognition of two more books than those recognized in Josephus' day (maybe Esther, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs).  So the codification of Rabbinism has no relevance.

So from around the beginning of the common era, we know a Hebrew Jewish Bible of a comparable canon to the modern one existed.  Hebrew is written without vowels which can be problematic.  How are the words to be pronounced when chanted?  With two words written with the same consonants, how do we know which word is being used?  For many words, this is not an issue (for instance, modern Hebrew books are not written with vowels as it isn't normally necessary).  It is a greater issue for less common words or in instances where pronunciation is debated.  So during the Early Middle Ages, a group of Jewish scribes known as the Masoretes developed a system of diacritics (marks which do not affect the written letters).  They went through the Hebrew Jewish Bible working to identify how the words were to be pronounced, and to show the proper pronunciation they marked each word with these diacritical notes.  That was the bulk of the work they did, and such work does not include going through and altering the actual Hebrew text.  So the work of the Masoretes is not relevant.  Moreover, we know that the consonantal text of the Masoretic Text tradition dates to the Second Temple period (Emanuel Tov, an expert in this field, has written that the consonantal proto-Masoretic Text fragments found from around the Second Temple period differ no more from the Medieval Masoretic Text than do different Masoretic manuscripts differ amongst themselves [which is not substantial]).

So the Hebrew Jewish Bible was largely canonized before the rise of Christianity without modifications performed by the early Rabbis, and the major unique features of the consonantal textual tradition reflected in the current Hebrew Jewish Bible can be dated to at least around the Second Temple period.  So where is the evidence that the Hebrew Jewish Bible was extensively modified to oppose Christianity?  Now, compared to the rather stable textual tradition of the Masoretic Text, the Septuagintal textual tradition contains many translators of varying quality and style, many errors or divergencies from the Hebrew vorlage, and many hands working to correct the Greek text.  It is fine for one to use it, especially if the grounds for its use is purely theological, but one cannot pretend that the textual tradition of the Hebrew Jewish Bible is lacking.",1564617762

In brief, the players are on a sphere, using mining drones to fight over and explore resource nodes.  Fight to expand your turf, make and break alliances, get the resources converted to victory points, hold onto them long enough to win.

Here’s what makes it great:
- fog of war means if you want to know what people on the other side of the map are doing, you’ll have to ask (and decide if the info is reliable)
- sphere map means there are no safe edges, almost everyone is a neighbor.
- units sent on an attack can be changed to a gift at any time, instead of attacking they join the enemy.  Sets up some fantastic plays, double crosses, “I’ll gift at last minute, I don’t want opponents to see we are allies” (press X to Doubt) type stuff.
- in game chat function is there.  You can have everyone provided a random name at game start.  No one knowing who’s who removes the meta across games.

upd. [Tuning](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/phaoris-control-shaman/) it hours before expansion to use vsmetareport's [Phaoris idea](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/phaoris-control-shaman/).







https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/dergachevs-quest-dragon-shaman/ Quest Shaman with dragons.



https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/dergachevs-midrange-quest-beast-shaman/ Quest Shaman with beasts (I think it's way powerful than dragon version).


upd. After seeing Firebat and Zalae versions and it's performance, I did a little bit lighter/curve version for better tempo. -2 earthen might -2 beastmasters -2 fountains - Hagathta the witch, + 2 history buff + 2 hench-clan hag + 1 barista lynchen + 1 former champ (2 is overkill imo, hes not that great without quest on curve) +1 SQ Hagatha.

Not just because you have to introduce the complex numbers, but because then there is no nice way of only picking one root to make the function well-defined. You're essentially stuck dealing with the twofold ambiguity.

The same applies for matrices. A positive semidefinite matrix has a unique positive semidefinite square root, and so defining fractional powers of these is straightforward. For matrices with negative eigenvalues there isn't a single natural notion of square root, since we have many parallel copies of the scalar case happening at once.

Similarly, there is only an unambiguous fractional version of self-adjoint *nonnegative operators*. The derivative is not a nonnegative operator, so it has tons of fractional versions that can't be cleanly separated. The *negative laplacian* is a nonnegative operator, so it has a naturally unique fractional version, which is the thing that actually tends to come up in applications.",1564617764

If you feel it's hard on you to watch him in pain, let him know that it's because you care and you're concerned he could be a lot happier. Try to make one small step, or make an agreement that works for you both. 

If he doesn't want a therapist, maybe he can start a journal, or start an expressive new hobby. If he doesn't want to talk about it to you, that's ok. But he should be able to be honest with you about how he's doing. Not his problems or what's on his mind, but the way he feels compared to last week and so forth.

I swear police in America use what I think of as escalation tactics, ie they are trained to escalate situations.  Don't speak to them right or have body language that makes them uncomfortable and they will quickly escalate to violence.

To me it feels like damned if you do, damned if you don't, when interacting with them.  If I say nothing when they initiate an interaction, that is taken as defiant behavior.  If I do speak and look at them, my body language and way of speaking is not what they expect from someone who looks like me and it is taken as being disrespectful.  I would do the carrying a note from my healthcare provider option, like you are considering, but I know first hand what a mistake it is to disclose to officers that you suffer from anything that could be considered a ""mental illness"".

It would be wonderful if there was an option to just communicate with officers through text because there is none of the meta communication requirements.  I communicate great through text, it's face to face that is a problem. Sadly that is not a realistic option.",1564617766

"confession","t5_2qo2a","Can you explain the logistics of this?",1564617768
"WorkOnline","t5_2y178","Here are my personal recommendations:

Appen ( [ref](https://connect.appen.com/qrp/public/jobs?uref=a1ddf672b44bd9625d3ba92ada3ba199) | [non-ref](https://connect.appen.com/qrp/public/jobs/list) ) has a variety of work ranging from transcription to search engine and social media evaluation. Most projects are pretty lax as far as hours go, and some are ""task-based pay"" which means the pay is more based on how many ""tasks"" you can complete. I'm currently on a task-based program and can get a pretty good amount of $ in a single sitting, the hardest part is being on my computer when they actually load up tasks for people to do, as they don't send any notice (like an email, text, etc. Just gotta check it periodically)

Lionbridge ( [non-ref](https://www.lionbridge.com/join-our-team/) ) is similar to the above, though I believe they'll always be hourly pay, no task based pay for them. Additionally some projects pay as a W2 instead of self-employed which is nice, though I have no idea what projects do that. Same deal for iSoftStone ( [non-ref](https://issworld.isoftstone.com/) ). 

UserTesting ( [non-ref](https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester) ) is a site where you spend about 10-15 min talking about your thought process while you interact with a website or product. This is far from consistent, as there are screening tests that may phase you out of some or even most tests, but $10 for about 10-15 min of your time for talking about how you're interacting with a website or app is really good.

Respondent ( there's a ref link, but I'm scared of posting it bc it has my full name in the link, lol | [non-ref](https://www.respondent.io/) ) is a site where you throw yourself at screeners to see if you fit a demographic, if you do you may get scheduled for an interview via webcam or voice or phone, or just requested to record your feedback on a site, app etc. Lots of stuff here but be prepared to spend a lot of time getting screened out of things 

BetaTesting ( [non-ref](https://betatesting.com) ) is pretty much the same as above but includes things like software, games etc. They will email you when they believe you fit a project.

Userlytics ( [non-ref](https://www.userlytics.com/tester) ) is also pretty much the same. They will email you when they think you fit a project.

InspiredOpinions ( [non-ref](https://www.inspiredopinions.com/) ) is similar to respondent, except instead of throwing yourself at every test just to get screened out, they email you when they think you fit one, generally speaking.

You can try transcription work as well (just search it on this subreddit - people love to recommend it) and teaching (if you have a degree, almost guarantee people will jump out and recommend it.. I have no experience with it though), same drill - search it, you'll get dozens of people raving about why their site is the best teaching platform and such 

If you have no background noise in your household customer support may be an option as well, whether straight through companies like Amazon, Ebay, Apple, or through outsourcing companies like Sutherland, Sykes, Conduent, KellyConnect, etc..

I've only listed the things I'm watching, so do keep in mind there's tons of other opportunities, and even job boards like  [RatRaceRebellion](https://ratracerebellion.com/),  [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com), [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io), etc.

I personally think you should apply for **as much as possible** and if you end up getting a full-time remote gig at support or etc, then you should slowly start to phase out the 'gig' jobs you may have gotten in the interlude like Appen etc.

Best of luck. It's not easy getting into remote work because of the sheer amount of people trying to do so, you might go a bit without hearing anything at all so just be persistent, keep looking and applying",1564617768

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A poupança mantém sua vantagem em relação aos fundos de renda fixa mesmo com o corte da taxa básica de juros anunciado nesta quarta-feira (31) pelo Banco Central. A Selic, agora em 6%, torna o [investimento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/com-expectativa-de-queda-de-juros-estrategia-depende-de-perfil-do-investidor.shtml) mais vantajoso que fundos com taxa de administração de maior que 1% no com prazo de resgate de até um ano.

 Segundo a Anefac (Associação Nacional dos Executivos de Finanças Administração e Contabilidade), agora, as modalidades empatam em desempenho em dois casos: quando a taxa de administração do fundo for de 1% em um prazo de resgate de até seis meses e quando a taxa for de 1,5% e o resgate acontecer entre um e dois anos.

 Pelas contas da associação, os fundos de investimentos têm um rendimento superior às contas da poupança apenas quando suas taxas de administração são de até 1% ao ano para prazos superiores a seis meses, ou quando o prazo de resgate é superior a dois anos com uma taxa anual de até 1,5%.

 A queda no rendimento da poupança com a redução do juros, segundo a Anefac, é de apenas 0,03 ponto percentual em relação ao mês de junho, com a Selic a 6,5%. 

 Com a nova taxa básica de juros, o rendimento mensal da poupança fica em 0,34% ao mês. Este percentual é proporcional ao rendimento anual de 70% da Selic mais a taxa referencial (TR) que, no momento, é zero. 

 ""As cadernetas de poupança, mesmo com a redução da Selic, continuam se destacando frente aos fundos de renda fixa pelo fato que não pagam imposto de renda nem taxas de administração"", afirma Miguel José Ribeiro de Oliveira, diretor executivo de estudos e pesquisas econômicas da Anefac.

 Segundo Oliveira, as aplicações em CDB (Certificados de Depósito Bancário) são mais vantajosas que a poupança apenas com rendimento acima de 85% do CDI (Certificado de Depósito Interbancário) por conta da incidência do imposto de renda.",1564617768

i do get lucky occasionally on my shards and get rares from greens and epics from blues. lots of green shards drop in campaign and i know over 500 have dropped for me in the month i've been playing. the occasional lucky drop adds up over a month of play, I guess. i don't pay too good of attention to my shards, to be sure, but i think i've actually only used like 2 or 3 orange shards. i think at least one was from logging in consistently and then i got 1 or 2 from completing missions and challenges, but they could have been the void (purple) shards. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",1564617768

You literally just contradicted yourself. 


&gt;That's mostly the reason google fiber stopped expanding, comcast, verizon, and other ISP's sued them at every corner and blocked every move and bribed away (donated to PACs) local officials to take shitty stances on things making it almost impossible to compete.. 

Yes, something explicitly allowed thanks to municipalities granting regional monopolies....


&gt;&gt;I feel like you're not super educated in the ISP world / network world if you're holding this view. 

That's hilarious coming from you. 

&gt;There are basically 2-3 companies who supply most of the internet to the US, they rarely upgrade infrastructure, constanly up peoples charges, are starting to put data caps on people and then charge more (they spend 0 extra dollars regardless of if everyone dl's 1kb or 10000tb's of data) just to extort people. Then bribe people via PACs and get people like Ajit Pai into the FCC to make pro big ISP decisions such as getting rid of net neutrality...

All of that bullshit exists thanks to government.  Open competition would eradicate that behavior. 



&gt;&gt;If they were forced to treat internet as a utility like Electricity / water it would increase competition and innovation because more players could start up small ISPs by being able to tap into the existing infrastructure.. Currently companies like comcast are just taking your money and doing little to no infrastructure changes or R&amp;D on technologies or networking changes because they have no competition.

If they were forced to be a monopoly, they'd be less like a monopoly is your argument.   You're ridiculous.",1564617770

What do you suggest the victim should have done differently? 

Don’t forget, he was a schizophrenic, high on drugs, that had forgot to take his medication. He tried to get help. 

What on earth is wrong with that, and why did you feel the need to call someone stupid for just saying he did everything right? 

Nothing you said gave any indication whatsoever on what was stupid. Please try to elaborate your views instead of making sweeping statements that you won’t back up with solid arguments. It’s just noise and it ruins healthy discussions.

The fact of the matter is that these idiots killed a n innocent man through a combination of lack of knowledge in how to handle mental health patients, and plain old ill will. They were joking, laughing and making fun of him, whilst he was non responsive - for Pete’s sake!

All officials in the video showed CRITICALLY POOR DECISION MAKING. 

Not only should they be stripped of their badges, but if we had a functioning society this would lead to real consequences that in the end stop situations like these from happening again!

I can’t bother to look up numbers but there is much evidence that many crimes are related to mental health problems.

And I'm sure just as I don't know anything about you, you don't know anything about me. Therefore you dont know how big of a fan I am. For the record, rewatching a show 10 times has nothing to do with being a BIG fan. I also enjoy the show and grew up on it and rewatched it a few times, read the comics, and am in the process of reading the Kyoshi novel. I am a big fan too but I don't boast about it like a 7 year old. 
In fact you were the one who is ""acting like a rude pathetic troll"" as you were the one who insulted me with ""this place is for real fans only"" as if I'm not a fan which was a really dick thing to do.
Idk why you are acting so mean to something which has no need to be and honestly if you were such a BIG fan of Atla like you come out to be, you would have learned from Iroh to show people some love and respect and have some humility. I guess you need to rewatch the show some more.

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","Really the best way is to play the game, do scav runs and collect everything you can find. You get less loot in Offline so you won’t really learn where things are or spawn. Some things are better sold on the market, some things are better sold to traders. Always grab suppressors, lasers, sights, rifle scopes sell for quite a bit. Usually suppressors are vendored. 

The more you play, the more you’ll know what you need. Usually you’ll want barter items for something specific and something you’ll use and you only know by leveling up traders and seeing what the barters are for. Most of them are useless, imo. 

Early in the game, you’ll be doing a lot switching between flea market and traders to see what the margin is. Selling something for only 1.5k ruble profit compared to selling to a trader isn’t worth it, imo. Time played is time making money. Waiting 20 mins in a lobby to make a 50k profit compared to selling to traders don’t great when one raid can net you 300-400k.",1564617777

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O mês das férias terminou e muitas famílias que matricularam seus filhos no segundo semestre estão vivendo o período de adaptação escolar.

 Enquanto algumas crianças acostumam-se rapidamente com a novidade, outras estranham a nova rotina e dão um pouco mais de trabalho até se adaptarem à escola. Tristeza, insegurança, frustração, medo ou ansiedade são sintomas comuns e em geral, somem em poucas semanas, segundo a doutora em Educação pela PUC-Rio Andrea Ramal.

 Infelizmente, não foi o que aconteceu com Ana* no início deste ano. Mãe de três filhos, ela precisou se mudar para o Canadá com o marido e os três filhos.

 Enquanto a filha mais velha, de sete anos, relatava com alegria as atividades que realizava na escola, o menino, de quatro anos, começou a ter escapes de xixi e cocô durante a noite.

 “Estar em outro país, sem falar a língua foi muito difícil para ele. Como ele é mais fechado, demoramos para perceber que estava sofrendo.

 Sua filha entrou em uma sala com uma professora mais paciente, acolhedora, enquanto o menino foi para uma sala com tratamento diferente. “O choque foi muito grande porque além da frieza da professora, ele também sofria bullying dos coleguinhas de sala por não conseguir se comunicar”, conta Ana.

 “Ele travou. Bloqueou o aprendizado do inglês e passou a ter constipação [prisão de ventre], precisando voltar para a fralda por causa dos escapes repetidos”, diz.

 Ela e o marido pediram uma reunião na escola e conseguiram trocar o filho de turma. A promessa deles é que a nova professora seria mais acolhedora e consciente da necessidade de incluí-lo na turma, que terá início na próxima semana.

 “Durante as férias, longe da escola, os escapes pararam e eu percebo que ele está mais feliz”, destaca Ana.

 O menino está na fila para ser atendido por um psicólogo e enquanto os atendimentos não começam, os pais receberam orientações para elevar a autoestima e a segurança dele.

 “Se a professora fosse acolhedora, provavelmente isso não teria ocorrido”, avalia a psicopedagoga especializada em educação infantil Kátia Almeida. Com experiência de quase dez anos em salas de ensino infantil, Katia afirma que alguns pontos devem ser observados pelos pais nesse momento.

 “A criança que participa de todo o processo de escolha da escola, visita o local antes, conhece o professor e tem pais que dialogam, tende a ser mais segura durante a adaptação. “É muito comum crianças pequenas sentirem que são abandonadas pelos pais ou cuidadores”. Por isso, a especialista defende o diálogo com os filhos e a participação dos pais na escola.

 “Um erro comum é mentir para o filho dizendo que voltará logo e deixá-lo muitas horas na escola. Isso quebra a confiança da criança.”, explica Katia.

 Segundo Andrea Ramal, ficar próximo dos filhos é imprescindível, pois traz segurança à criança. “Ficar longe e só se aproximar quando choram é ruim, pois a criança entende que, quando chorar, vai ter o responsável, e isso contraria a autonomia”.

 A escritora defende que acolher os sentimentos dos filhos é a melhor saída nesse momento.”Deixe seu filho falar sobre o que está sentindo e se mostre disponível para ouvir e ajudar. Explicar os motivos para entrar na escola ou mudar de colégio, caso tenha acontecido, também é essencial. Tudo fica mais fácil de entender e aceitar quando conhecemos os porquês”, diz.

 Andrea explica também que os pais devem controlar a ansiedade, já que a escola é um dos melhores locais que a criança poderia estar. Além disso, ela orienta aos pais falarem do local de estudo com entusiasmo, pois isso ajuda no processo de adaptação.

 “Sempre se refira a boas lembranças: diga ao seu filho que ele vai rever os amigos, aprender coisas interessantes, ter momentos de brincadeiras. E evite falar com “pena” do período de férias que se encerrou”.

    

  **MAIS DICAS PARA O PERÍODO DE ADAPTAÇÃO**

  

  Evite usar frases que desmotivam a criança como “coitado, acabou-se o que era doce, amanhã é a vida dura de novo” ou “eu também sofria muito no final das férias”. Isso acaba reforçando a ideia de que estudar é ruim.

  

  Os responsáveis também devem ajudar a criança a retornar a agenda, planejando os horários da semana. Seu filho deve perceber que não está sozinho nesse desafio: apoie na organização dos materiais, do lanche, na sua preparação para o transporte. Assim, ele se sentirá acompanhado na volta aos estudos.

  

  Outras dicas são: acompanhar os deveres de casa, conversar com o filho para perceber como anda a sua motivação e apoiá-lo nas dificuldades que surgirem, até que ele se sinta seguro e confiante.

  

   Se por acaso a resistência continuar, fique alerta: pode ser sinal de que algo não vai bem. Verifique se outras crianças estão com o mesmo problema e procure a escola para tratar a questão em conjunto.

  

  Para as duas especialistas ouvidas, o sucesso da adaptação está ligado à segurança dos pais e ao olhar sensível do educador, que entende a importância de acolher e ter paciência e ao mesmo tempo encoraja a criança nessa nova fase.

"HalfLife","t5_2rgym","It honestly goes deeper than just because it's popular now more than ever.

Long story short, the explosion of twitch streamers contribute a lot to the influx of toxic communities. I don't care how fun a game is, when the majority of a player base makes my young son feel bad about enjoying a game with a default skin, it's too toxic.

The Half-Life community, while a bit gate-keepy(I cant honestly blame them, it's a very dear game to a lot of people), is very newcomer friendly, and goes out of it's way to avoid spoiling the game for newer community members.

I've watched a lot of the twitch streamers play Fortnite, and honestly, they're toxicity breeding toxicity.

So, yes it's popular, but that doesnt mean it's wrong to hate on it. If the community was better, it would be an overall more enjoyable experience. Since it's a BR game, and cant rely on story to carry it's merit, all we have to judge on is the community.

So to answer your question, as a father of a child who plays fortnite, those ""strong feelings"" people have for it are justifiable.",1564617778

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","The Nazi and bigot stuff is directly about the content of speech, which campaign finance law doesn't regulate. It would not be hard to leave that out about content regulation yet also have finance rules. 

People in Canada can say what they want politically. Given that campaign signs and pamplets are pretty cheap, social media is nearly free, volunteers are free, and the CBC even gives free air time for candidates, you can run a campaign without much expense. I found that the median cost for a candidate is about 63 thousand CAD in 2015, and the Greens have a cap of 6300 for a nomination contests, read primary, and the parties have fairly similar expenses with that so it won't be a huge amount of money more. 

The government also subsidies campaigns that get over 10% of the vote by 60%, so you'd only be raising about 30 thousand dollars per constituency with about 110 thousand people in it. The government also gives tax credits at a ratio of 75% for the first 400 dollars, and decreasing amounts for several hundred dollars more, with all donations over 200 dollars being publicly disclosed and a maximum of 1500 dollars. 
 
The campaign length is only about 35 days or 5 weeks, and nomination contest campaigns last about 20-50 days usually. 

None of this is about the content of the speech or affecting the ability of a person to give an opinion, and if your opinion costs nothing to say, like a tweet or interview on the news or what you say on the floor of parliament, then none of that is limited.",1564617779

I believe it was a location where deer carcasses were cremated. A very short walk from Steven's trailer.

My guess is that they are deer bones given the location and reports provided.

&gt;Furthermore if they weren’t Teresa’s then why did  Fallon and Wiegart Conspire to give them to The Halbach’s?

I don't understand the insistence on the bones being human. Steven could have easily walked over there and dumped bones - if they are indeed human.

"askaconservative","t5_2vg6d","Suppose I believe that the only purpose of government is to promote freedom. It has to limit some freedom in order to do that. For example, society is more free if a few people lose their freedom to own slaves because owning slaves limits freedom of others.  I may also be required to learn how to drive and get a drivers license before I am allowed to drive a car alone. This Limits my freedom to drive without a license, but protects other peoples freedom to live because somebody who doesn't know how to drive won't be driving.   


Suppose I also believe that the government has a responsibility to promote justice. A group of neighbors may have the freedom to segregate their housing. The Home Owners Association could decide they won't allow you to sell your house to any black people who want to buy it. They may even argue that it would be wrong to sell to a black person because it would lower my neighbors property value. Now it's a matter of conscience.  The Government has the responsibility to limit the freedom of the homeowners because their actions would be unjust. If a diner wanted to be whites only the government has the responsibility to step in and say that such segregation is illegal and unjust. The owner of the shop can either stop segregating, or close down.   


Because I believe that the government has a responsibility to protect both freedom and justice I do not think it is tyrannical to force compliance against an action that limits the freedom of another or promotes injustice.   


So as to the individual examples you gave the question becomes, do I think it's unjust to discriminate against gay people. And do I think that the medical industry limits the freedom of consumers through unfair or unjust pricing. And do I think that a Nun deciding not to pay for contraception or abortion limits the freedom or is unjust to others.   


I think the Nuns should be able to opt out of paying for abortion as long as they're not taking advantage of the system in doing so.  I think that price ceilings on medical care are reasonable, I think it's reasonable for the government to tell a doctor he or she can only practice medicine if they are willing to meet certain qualifications, and one of them could reasonably be the price they charge. And I think that discrimination should be legislated against.",1564617780

Fortunately, we would be fine as he is well educated and would be able to transition, but retraining someone who has worked in a specific industry would be difficult.

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","""The growing proletarianization of modern man and the increasing formation of masses are two aspects of the same process. Fascism attempts to organize the newly created proletarian masses without affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to express themselves. [In communism] the masses have a right to change property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life. The violation of the masses, whom Fascism, with its Führer cult, forces to their knees, has its counterpart in the violation of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values.

All efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: war. War and war only can set a goal for mass movements on the largest scale while respecting the traditional property system. This is the political formula for the situation. The technological formula may be stated as follows: Only war makes it possible to mobilize all of today’s technical resources while maintaining the property system.""

Yes, you can even save scum the tier 2 dragon stars to reduce the number of level 1 dragon gems you get.

For example, you can save your game before you roll for the end of event 170 gem roll at end of event until you get the desired items.

You can repeatedly try for the bonus items or results gained from merges like Mystic idols from Monster Idol, dimensional jars amounts (for high tier life trees, it's a must), # of taps in newly created tier 2 nests, special flower producing fountain from merging fruit seed producing fountain, or glowing dragon trees from regular dragon tree merges.

Please note you CAN savescum for event eggs from the special level 2 event item from event buildings.

You can also reload the save until you get a favorable Kala quest, though the save has to be before you get a new quest.

For a while there, I even savescummed so I can get at least 2 dragon gems from running 7 runs of 1 chalice stages.

Could there possibly be a way to reverse the elderspell? Or a way for someone else to learn it (even imperfectly)? If you wanted to get real wild, your PCs could be some of the last planeswalkers in Ravnica, being perused by the dreadhoarde. At the end, you could always despark Bolas and he could still flee using the planar bridge, it's not like he can't get another spark since he knows the elderspell. Cool idea though.

I think many people in Hong Kong are mad that they don't even have enough milk powder for their own babies, and people from the mainlanders are not just buying milk powder from HK cuz they just happen to travel by, but they are doing it in a systematic manner, every day hundreds of people cross from the border, pick up the milk powder and go back up, a pretty big business.

I guess this is more on the Chinese government, after the [2008 milk scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal), mainlanders start importing milk powder from HK, from local stores, and the prices of the milk powder have gone insane.",1564617786

Something I noticed is that your character gets praised a lot, kinda like how Robin and Corrin were pretty much worshiped. The difference though is that I feel like your character deserves it more. Your class is grateful for your instruction and tactics guidance over their school time, and they can clearly see how much stronger they've gotten relative to the other houses. 

It always felt strange how much Corrin got praised and how he ends up a military and tactics genius, despite being a sheltered shut in pacifist. Robin deserves praise for his tactical skill, but the way he takes over the story in the 2nd half frustrates some people. Byleth on the other hand has years of mercenary experience, clearly shown interactions with students that show why they trust and cherish him, and he doesn't usurp Edelgard's plot role. She's clearly still the main driver of the plot.

Still need to finish the route but I'm really pleased with how they handled the protagonist and ""avatar worship""; it feels much more organic this time.",1564617786

However, this is a poor example, since two enemies were playing knights. So Dark Spirit was the obvious choice for this slot, anyway. Saw Monte two-star the thing with pretty much infinite mana in a God build and it still looked pretty bad. He trashed her pretty quick. 

We will have to see how she does, going forward. 
In theory, I could see a 4-glacier, 4-egersis, 3-hunter (and 2-warlock) build being a thing. Sounds okay on paper. But also sounds borderline impossible to pull off without getting wrecked on the way to it. And not sure it’s even work in practice. Idk.",1564617786

Lets try with the gigabyte x570 Aorus Elite.

near the bottom of the page, it gives you a glimpse of the bios.

But now, we click on ""Specification"" at the top. Then we click on BIOS(+2). Then we read that the latest version of Bios is F4g.

So now we google, ""Gigabyte F4g Bios"". We click on images. And there you have it.

And I'll say that most manufacturers' bios looks the same across the entire product line. I run F23d on a Gigabyte AB350M-gaming 3. It looks more or less the same. And because of that, simply googling ""Gigabyte Bios"", ""Asrock bios"", ""Asus bios"", ""MSI Bios"", etc. will give you a rough idea of how it looks.

Now, forget a long term relationship or marriage, I can’t even find someone who I’m interested in and is interested in me to be my boyfriend. The dates all blend together. There are a few highs filled with many more lows. I don’t even have it in me right now to try.

"iiiiiiitttttttttttt","t5_2tfln","It's impossible to secure a modern Fortune 1000 firm at any cost because they all rely on complex technology that always has a giant list of known and unknown vulns. Does it *really* matter if you are currently exposed to 1,219 CVEs instead of 1,973? You're going to get owned eventually either way; all you can potentially control is how often and - maybe - how extensively, and how accurately and quickly you can track down the perps assuming you are systemically important and/or politically connected enough to get the requisite millions of dollars of taxpayer-funded support from the government.

In most cases there is no amount of time or money that would let you refit a Fortune 1000 firm with truly vuln-free systems that have been properly formally verified, etc. It's probably beyond current human ability to construct perfectly-secure systems of that complexity.

Chucks, adidas, vans pro skate are the weapons of choice and depending on the type of style you develop, one is better than the other. Boots are also good but take practice (pros and cons to the moves you can do in them).

But really at the end of the day pick a shoe that’s comfortable then go from there. If you start getting the feel of shuffling in those, then go out and get one of the previously mentioned.

Nope I don't even get mad if I buy a TV and then they lower the price a week later oh, now microtransactions I do get mad at.
I'm pretty sure most of us that are not Weekend Warriors pretty much got the achievement for 22 characters unlocked right? Who cares how people play the game just worry about yourself, the people want to cheat the system let them cheat it it's a video game, but that way of unlocking Woods is not cheat but it is cheap, but then if you're going in there by yourself and kill yourself right away you're not actually affecting anything is 50 V 50",1564617790

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","*“I promise you the night of your life. Be ready to be tricked. Shocked. Remember folks, this is real magic we are dealing with. So my volunteers are all putting themselves in real danger. Be forewarned.”*

I looked at the fan turning around above me. I probably should have gotten up. But if I did, that meant the day started. Which in turn meant I would have to face my reality once again. I didn’t want that. Dreams and nightmares were much preferable to the life I now had. I closed my eyes, hoping for another couple of hours of ignorant bliss. But that wasn’t meant to be. My phone rang and I bolted up from my bed. 

*”For this trick, I will make this young woman disappear. Remember, no tricks. This is real. Here, this is the cloth. Examine it. You are her husband? Sure. Look at it all you want. She’s here now. But in a moment, she will be far far away.”*

I opened the car window and let the cold air rush over my face. I relished the cold. The pain made me feel alive. It was one of the few things that did. The numbness that had overtaken me these past few years had turned me into a zombie like creature. Unfeeling and living in sort of a dazed, slowed up reality. I wondered what it would feel like if I succeeded. To see her again. To feel her touch once again. Would I really feel anything? Or was this my reality. And what if... what if I failed?

I ran my hand over the knife that lay on the passenger seat. I hoped at least the blood would make me feel something. 

He sat there all alone drinking a colourful looking cocktail. It was stark in contrast to this colourless world. 

My hands itched in anticipation, curiously warm. 

*”And voila! Don’t look so surprised young man. I told you this was real magic. She is gone. Perhaps in the sixth realm by now. Yes I will bring her back but give me a minute to recover. In the meantime here’s another trick. I will now hypnotize... hey wait. I will bring her back if you just give me a minute. Ow... don’t you dare put your hands on me...”*

“You little piece of shit.”

“Hey! What the... who are you?”

“Who am I? I am the guy who has spend so many god forsaken years looking for his missing wife. I am the guy who is going to murder you if you don’t bring her back.”

“Hey come on now wait a minute.”

“I’ve waited for so long, every minute feels like an hour. Where is she?” I swung my fist and it connected to his temple. Another couple of shots and I saw red. Both on his face and my hand. I wasn’t sure if the source was him or me. It didn’t matter. I welcomed the pain that ran up my arm. 

“Alright, Alright. I’ll bring her back. Here let me just.”

He took off his hat. 

“No tricks. Where is my wife?”

“Wait I have to get my magic cloth.” He pulled a long cloth from his hat and grinned at me. My scowl made that smile disappear quite quickly. He raised the cloth high above his head with one hand and brought out a watch with the other. 

*”See my friends! It’s magic. I know we are supposed to call it a trick. But trust me, I can make this man, who was about to attack me a minute ago, I can make him do whatever he wants. He is lost so deep into his consciousness that every minute probably feels like an year to him.”*

“This watch will turn back time. Look at it carefully.”

I looked at the watch as he spun and twirled it expertly. 

“1.”

Dizziness started overcoming me. My eyelids grew heavy.

“2.”

So... so sleepy. I closed my eyes. I needed to rest then for a minute.

“3.”

I realized what he was doing and fought with all my strength. I wound up my first and extended it towards him.

Then he snapped his fingers. 

*I looked at my arm in the air wondering what was going on. The sound of clapping made me look behind me as the crowd cheered. The magician smiled at me and moved his eyebrows up and down.*

*”My wife?”*

*”You know, most people would love for me to make their wife disappear. Not this young man though. Alright. You drive a hard bargain.” He raised a cloth and brought it down.*

*She stood there just as I remembered her. I hugged her tight, surprising her. I kissed her and led her away, the magician shouting something behind me. I didn’t want to stop, couldn’t stop. I had what I needed and I was never letting go.*

*”Honey, I was just gone for a two minutes.”*

*”Felt like years to me.”*

*I hugged her again. This time she hugged back just as tight.*

*”Wait is that blood? Why is your hand bleeding? Did you hit him?”*

*”Not in this lifetime. Here, he got to me before I got to him.” I smiled at her and continued to hold her close as we walked towards our car.*",1564617790

"aww","t5_2qh1o","To be fair, the high IQ poster was right, they just communicated poorly and weren't familiar with the copypasta mockery they incurred the wrath of. It is probably the smartest show on television and legitimately fit a good 30-50% of the depth of Star Trek's entire pilot episode into like a minute of one episode of their comedy cartoon show.

I think a better way of explaining what they were trying to say, instead of just alluding to IQ, is that it's a sci-fi show with more high-level sci-fi understanding than any other. You know how sometimes you're watching sci-fi and, no matter how smart you are or aren't, sometimes you notice that a writer is using an oversimplified version of a concept like artificial intelligence, or they haven't put enough thought into their timeline of how far into the future something should be (they don't know how soon something is really coming or they think it's coming sooner than it really is), or they think society will handle something in a more dramatic way than how people will really handle it when some new innovation comes along? Things like that, you probably get the idea. Well, like it or not, some people understand all of this shit really well, and those are the Rick and Morty people. It's the only work of sci-fi that knows full well every time it oversimplifies a concept. It's the only one where if a writer has an unrealistic concept of the future that they haven't thought through, it gets tweaked by other writers because there is always *someone* involved aware of the flaw in every faulty sci-fi concept, so the faulty ones either get scrapped or written into something done jokingly and ironically enough not to seem dumb. The only other show I'm aware of that did this effectively is Futurama and that show had much more simplistic storytelling with no overarching plot or anything which makes it seem not quite as intelligent overall. Other than Futurama even the smartest sci-fi shows mess up all the time, like you can't watch a couple episodes of Star Trek without something that there are obvious reasons to realize wouldn't be real, even though Star Trek is another of the most smartly-written shows of all time and some of its high concept work in sci fi has been among the deepest and most thought through in the history of television. Futurama still beats Star Trek at avoiding silly oversimplifications of sci fi concepts, and Rick &amp; Morty beats Futurama, hands down. So if you don't think Rick and Morty is that smart, I guarantee you just aren't that smart yourself. You can't see flaws in an episode of Star Trek or Black Mirror *that much* better than the creators of Star Trek and Black Mirror can. You have no reason to assume you know what you're talking about on this, fans of Rick and Morty do know what we're talking about here, we come to this conclusion based on extensive logic and thinking over the course of our lives, we are lead to this by actually noticing issues in all other sci-fi on TV and noticing that Rick and Morty lampoons such issues constantly without ever succumbing to them, and if you don't notice then you aren't an authority on what's really smart.

"LegionFX","t5_3e713","When? In the last episode? My feeling is, probably not, but it's not surprisingly pretty unclear--

""Three years later"" from the events of season two, Oliver and Melanie are in the astral plane. This theoretically *should be* over two years after the events of season three, because Lenny gets Salmon pregnant at the end of season two and she's close to giving birth at the start of season three.

They can vaguely recall that David ""betrayed"" Syd, but also Oliver says ""the end of the world"" has happened, suggesting the same apocalypse the whole second season was about has in fact happened. But it's not totally clear, because Oliver says it a bit ironically, and Melanie clearly isn't impressed by this ""apocalypse"", she says people are still going about their lives. Whether that apocalypse was the real deal and Melanie doesn't know it/doesn't care, or it wasnt, after-all, as bad as future-Syd said it would be, it would stand to reason they didn't go into the astral plane until *after* that ""apocalypse"", because how else would they know about it? If David broke the world I doubt he would be popping in to give updates. In one timeline, Farouk was killed, and in the other, Syd stopped David from killing him with the rock. Of course, Oliver previously had knowledge about Farouk and David seemingly just from their being in the astral plane with him. So idk maybe he sensed it. But their memories were very fuzzy -- that is to say, two years from season three their memories will be.

It seems clear to me this whole last episode took place in the astral plane -- but, again, the last time we saw them they were in an ice cube together, like Oliver was in season one, when he was cryogenically frozen. The cold, he said then, was ""the one thing he couldn't seem to change"" in the astral plane. But last episode they weren't cold. Hey, maybe he finally figured it out. Or maybe they have just been hanging out there for the time being, but at some point over the next two years they'll freeze their bodies and hide them so they can be together in the astral plane undisturbed indefinitely.

Or maybe that flashforward we saw was a glimpse into a different timeline? Or time demons ate a chunk out of something? I don't know man. This show is fuckin' bonkers.",1564617792

Orbit trails are Imaginary, they are not real.  
  
It is easy to figure out somebody from Australia or New Zealand are doing these things because they always get the rotation backwards. The planets are not revolving around the Sun in a clockwise direction, if the 'south pole' of the Sun is pointing 'forward' in the direction of the galactic disk.  
  
The problem with this depiction is the Sun is moving forward too fast, so the spirals are highly exaggerated. Also, the spiral trail is only with respect to the center of the galaxy. The Sun and planets are moving in the galaxy as a rotating disk.

Also, minions. Yes, path of war characters can refresh maneuvers. So they are more likely to use them, and you can catch them on the back foot. A couple extra foot soldiers to cut through can make a difference. Also, gives the fireball happy wizard a fun target.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Yeah, my method to picking up chicks is pretty good, its unique.

I go to a popular bar and find a girl who looks around my age sitting alone. I dont really care about looks or anything, as long as she a female amiright? I start off with a cheesy pickup line (they know I'm joking, it's usually a light line) and I offer to buy them a drink (or another if they already have one). I use my charm, light humor and soft tone to keep conversation interesting and keep it going.

We laugh, talk about ourselves, share some personal thoughts, secrets, drink, and eat. We have a good time in general. When I talk to them, it's like were already on our 5th date! She gets super into me, touchy, laughs way too much at small things I say but I go with it. To her, with some small touches back, getting close and good eye contact, I'm also into her.

Eventually our fun ends at the bar, but I smoothly offer to go back to my place and continue the wonderful night we've already been having. Some girls say yes immediately, others are reluctant but I push and push and they cave.

We go back to my place and bust out a few snacks and drinks. I show off my amateur bartending skills, making a few decent mixes and we get back into it.

Our conversations are very personal now. Regardless, shes into me, my home, and very happy shes spending time with me, like we've already been together for months now. Shes getting all excited and extremely touchy, taking off her sweater, pants, socks, because my house is ""hot"".

We start to undress each other with our eyes, get very close and start to kiss. I always ask:

""Are you a virgin?""

If she says no, I make out with her a little longer, ask her other questions and slowly back off. I tell her shes extremely beautiful, a wonderful person to talk to, but I'm ""not like that"" and we should go out first before we regret anything. It turns them on more, but they comply, grab their things and leave.

But if she is a virgin, I slip something into their drink and they end up passing out.

They wake up in my cellar, look around and see me in my black robe standing around my candlelit pentagram with my ritual knife, chanting Latin words and I sacrifice them to the dark lord.",1564617795

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Generally speaking, in almost every state, you wouldn't be double taxed, the worst case is that you'll deduct the taxes you already paid to another state from what you owe to your resident state (or the opposite also works, as long as one side gets paid). The actual agreements between various states differ, but that's the worst case, you pay the highest tax rate. You still have to file in all the states, but you apply a tax credit so you effectively only pay the highest rate.

A few states don't have any agreements, or otherwise still collect taxes on all income earned regardless.

That said, in 2015 Comptroller v. Wynne the SCOTUS ruled such taxation unconstitutional.

https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/comptroller-v-wynne/

which affirmed

&gt; Maryland’s personal income tax scheme, which taxes income that its residents earn both within and outside the state but does not provide residents with a full credit against the income taxes that they pay to other states, violates the dormant Commerce Clause.


Though, let me also add a disclaimer, I'm not an accountant, or a lawyer or anything, I was just a ~~non-~~resident alien living in the US and also filed taxes in multiple states and my home country. This is my understanding  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",1564617796

Surely it's faster to iterate on these existing systems rather than create a whole new set of systems (weaves, seasons, etc.), no? And that's ignoring that these new systems _will_ have their own sets of issues. It doesn't inspire confidence either; will weaves be abandoned 6 months from now too?

The 2008 Chinese milk scandal was a widespread food safety incident in China. The scandal involved milk and infant formula along with other food materials and components being adulterated with melamine. Of an estimated 300,000 victims in China, six babies died from kidney stones and other kidney damage and an estimated 54,000 babies were hospitalized. The chemical gives the appearance of higher protein content when added to milk, leading to protein deficiency in the formula.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","Planned home birth with my first. My water broke around 10pm, went back to sleep, tried to at least. Was very excited. Contractions really picked up around 6 am, so we called the midwife again to see when she'd be there. Baby was born around 12:30 in a birthing tub. Just about 10 min of actually pushing. 

I didn't do too much to prepare. I have a lot of friends who did home births, so I didn't think much about pain. They all did it multiple times without any medication, so I didn't think twice about whether I could or not. And I knew I have a somewhat high pain tolerance. 

I did yoga throughout my pregnancy, so I just practiced breathing deeply during a contraction. I had a heating pad on my lower back, which was a Godsend. I combined this with keeping a hot, wet washcloth on the front of my lower uterus. My midwife suggested we keep a few washcloths in the crock pot. I couldn't stand to have them off me for the frirst few hours. The hot water in the pool was an awesome way to relieve the pain. I got in and out a few times. Toward the end, I didn't think I could go much longer. Which after reading others stories, when you feel that way is when you get really close to the actual birth. It wasn't long after that our baby was born. 

I watched, ""The Business of Being Born."" It gave me a lot of confidence in my body and helped set me up for the kind of birth I wanted to experience. I didn't want to numb the pain. It's a part of the process. In the end, it's your perception of pain that you remember. It's temporary and I didn't want to interfere with the natural hormones that are active in the whole process. I read stories after giving birth of women receiving an epidural during birth and found some women loved them and for some it didn't even work in the first place or they went numb and couldn't even stand. I can't imagine wanting to be numb for birth. It was helpful to know when a contraction was coming so I could prepare to breath through it and when it was time to push. I understand why women chose an epidural though. It is the worst pain you'll feel in your life and if you have ANY thoughts that you can't do it without an epidural, it would be difficult to turn one down. Giving birth is a lot of mental work. The body will do its own thing. It's up to you to relax and let it happen or to block the pain. Either way, you get a new baby out of the process and a new adventure awaits you! I'm pregnant with my second and it's been the most fulfilling, challenging, and beautiful two years of my life raising my daughter. You can do whatever you put your mind to and I wish you the best!",1564617797

When I was 30, my dad called me up and told me he was dying, and he wanted me back home with him for the 6 months he had left.  So I quit my job, packed up, and moved back across the country.  The day following my arrival, my dad confessed that he'd lied and he wasn't dying, he just wanted me close.  

As bad as my dad is, he's nothing compared to my mom.  My step-dad is quite the peach too, going along gleefully with my mom's schemes.  I am anticipating some family death threat at some point in the near future as an attempt to reel me in, and I'm resolved to not buy in.

Things with my family are so bad that I'm trying to get help to prevent them legally from contacting me for any reason - it's a toxic cesspool that will lead to my suicide if I go back.  I will not go.  I am done with them.",1564617798

&gt; Your weight is at a level that, in our view, should be good for your health. We hold this statement contrary to the ""overweight"" classification of the WHO, read why ....

&gt; With a good balance of body fat and muscle mass, your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar values are likely to remain at moderate levels. You would then seem to be well-protected against a heart attack, stroke or diabetes.

But I find that the most serious of all benefits and uses is experiencing points in time, which makes your realizations come, and come and come directly into your conscious experience of what is going on around you which culminates in everything around you telling you something you did not already know about yourself. The brain is literally producing everything you see as a common hallucination, and therefore it appears as if, your consciousness casts itself upon everything around you. It makes you pick up the phone, whether you want it or not, and it feels like you are in tune with the universe, which also seems to be the root source of these incoming realizations.

"Terminator","t5_2qpmd","You seriously misunderstand whats a macguffin is in a movie.
No, Newt and the others were not Macguffins as you say. Neither is Connor, nor Sarah. They serve the stories in a lot more way, than simply progressing the plot, that;s why they are characters and not mere plot devices.

Also, I explained why JC is as an prominent character in T2 as Sarah, but you just want to ignore it because it doesnt fit your narrative. Also his comparison to Newt and the victims of slasher films is completely false. You really dont understand his character in the movie.

It is true that Sarah is the connective issue between the two films, which that by itself doesnt diminish the importance of John in T2, but her journey has been completed by the end of T2, her story has been told. And the proof of that, apart from other things, is that Dark Fate rehashes her same story from T2 ffs. 

And beyond that, she apparently lives at the end of DF. So her story will extend in at least 4 movies. Why is that any better, to stuck with the same character for 4 films, than also having John in more than just one movie? Why is this even for debate when they replace him with another character who serves the exact same function in the general story. I like those contradictions.

No, Sarah is the protagonist in T1, but she is not the protagonist in T2, she is one of the main characters. If you compare with Ripley you will understand this difference. Ripley is not the protagonist in Alien,just one of the mains characters, although she is the only focus in the last act of the film. But she is the protagonist in ALIENS. I mean this is a basic understanding of how characters work in story. 

And no you are wrong again, John is no mysterious legacy character, or a symbol, that was in the fist movie only. In the second, he is a full character in flesh and bones with his own arc and an important role for the store of the film, not just the general lore. This is a fact, this happens in the movie, and you can no way disregard this, no matter how you spin it.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a hell of a time with the card yesterday.  I was trying to diagnose the ""louder on R channel than L"" and decided to completely nuke the Sound Blaster drivers.  After they were re-installed, the Sound Blaster control application said, ""Hey, you don't have a compatible SB card!""

&amp;#x200B;

Um.  Huh?  Interestingly, the LEDs on the board itself were lit, but it was not powering the ACM for some reason.  I think that was just a symptom of the issue; Windows nor the SB drivers would recognize the card.  I opened a case with Creative's support, and then went to do some more troubleshooting.  I lost count, but I think it took 4 or 5 reboots, a completely power cycle, and an unplugging to let the caps discharge.  Whatever it was, the driver *finally* recognized the card and the ACM lit up.

&amp;#x200B;

Something's just... off ... with this card.  I can't put my finger on it.  It could be that it's a different DAC than what's on the ZxR; the aforementioned ""crisp"" comments still stand.  But the games are just starting to sound a bit... weird.  It's still sending slightly more juice to the right channel than it is the left.  And that could be the crux of the issue, but I'm not so sure.  Either way, my enthusiasm for this card has been dampened quite a bit and I'm not sure I want to continue using it.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a driver issue.  Maybe I just got a lemon.  Either way, I'm eye-balling my ZxR and seriously considering putting it back in.",1564617801

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","If you use tech and people well it's a quality passive venture.  If you are a DIY guy this will be a living hell for you.  It depends on your personality, expected return, time horizon ect.

The problem with rentals is all market related first you need to be working in an area with high rental demand and increasing housing prices, then you need to be able to find deals on class A properties which can be done seasonally during the school year (you will want to try to find a short term tenant and then re-rent during the summer high period).  Of course the strategy works better in a high demand school district.

You do get income you can live off of and a good return at the end.  A lot of people focus more on the long term return from the sale and either live off of the rental income or pay the whole income on a loan (risky).  Millenials don't buy homes so if you find a 2 or 3 bedroom you will have an easier time renting it bc of roommates than a studio or 1 bedroom.

Have a lawyer review everything you sign in purchase/sale and handle your rental agreements (and evictions), each state has its own tenancy laws so get a lawyer in your state.  You also need repair people, it helps to have a realtor with property management services.  Make sure renters make more than three times the price of rent, there are many background check services that can help you get this information.

If you are willing to pay part of the income bc you have the ability to re-invest the rental income in both short term and long term property rental optimization then rentals are a pretty solid investment.  If you have to get loans to buy properties and you have nothing left to re-invest after servicing the debt then you should probably consider smaller investments until you can get a more assertive foothold in the market.

RE has made many people very wealthy by providing a solid return coupled with consistent cash flow, it works best if have a cool head and are willing to pay for help.  It is also very wise to diversify if you intend to hold large investments like real estate, you can use it to help balance out the effects of radical stock market shifts on your net value.  I in no way am endorsing any specific investment as the right investment depends both on the investor and their personal situation as it relates to aversion to financial risk and demand for cash flow.

For me personally, it's not that much work and I am starting year 1 at 6% ROI excluding any changes in value.  


Also it's not that they cant afford them I have renters that beat me in annual income hands down.  Some people move around a lot because of their jobs or they are not in a committed relationship and as such have no specific ties to an area.  This in no way relates to their income and is a reason many young people who could easily afford very nice homes are still willing to rent them at a premium.  To many who are early millennials renting is less risky than owning a property which will have an uncertain value in the near future.",1564617801

I had identical twins from a SET and one had a small sac up until my week 16 ultrasound. Like really small - about a 2mm difference. Each ultrasound was terrifying because you could see the baby running out of space. Doctors were hedging their bets, both telling me that they couldn’t comment on the prognosis of the pregnancy and telling me that babies really don’t need much room. By week 16, MFM said that they couldn’t actually tell the difference in size anymore, that our baby seemed to have sufficient space, and that there was a normal amount of amniotic fluid.

Google can be really distressing and I’d probably recommend steering clear, but I did find my share of success stories where people said either the sac seemed small the whole way through and grew enough or by the end of the first or second trimester, the problem seemed to resolve.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Interestingly, EFF didn't really cite Barr/Wray, either. Certainly no substantial quotes, so we could go check and see what those folks actually said. But in any event, probably the most publicly-available source of information is concerning the ""prime example"" they gave. My final link was to a comment I made on a prior EFF article. You can go read that comment, go read what the EFF article said (recalling what they said here, too), then go read [the actual OIG report](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2018/o1803.pdf). I recommend this first, because the report was quite short (only 11 pages), so it's probably the quickest route to determining which of us is most accurately characterizing the contents of a public document. Probably second to this is to go back through the court order and dueling briefs from FBI and Apple in their case. These are all publicly available, too, but they're a lot longer, so there's a lot more to get distracted by.",1564617805

"Roadcam","t5_2u6os","&gt;. It does require being willing to give up momentum. 

Do you mean like 12 seconds into the video, where the cyclist has already dropped 10km/h (and, considering the spedometer updates are delayed since it shows him going 12km/h while he hits the ground, likely dropped even further) before the car had even started accelerating out of the bike lane?  That ""giving up momentum""?  Because it seems like you're continuing to suggest the only option is to straight up stop at every intersection, which I *know* you don't do. He slowed down to 30 (or lower) in precaution, then began emergency braking as the car pulled out, then hit the car as the car stopped both blocking the lane he was in *and* the bike lane he tried to swerve back into. Assuming the driver didn't do it on purpose and instead fucked up in a panic when they finally noticed the cyclist, your magical ""oi oi"" could be the type of thing that causes this collision in the first place.

&gt;I ride and drive, and in either case, I'd have avoided this collision.

You driving doesn't make you special, you riding doesn't give you any extra authority on the topic, and you're delusional if you think that in the moment you could've made the right decision in this situation based off someone else's video. Especially considering they did exactly the things you said should be done - making themselves noticeable, slowing down, and riding defensively trying to move to another lane.  The motorist managed to block two lanes on the brake check.  You'd hit the car too based off your rules.",1564617805

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","&gt;  mountains of regulations and a shitty healthcare system

Why do you think it's so shitty? You answered your own question. Because it's been set up wrong in the first place. Healthcare in the U.S. is a bureaucratic mess, it doesn't change because it's based on too many regulations held together by decades of laws and its existence, believe it or not, makes a lot of people money. 

&gt; and you think the solution is..more regulations. Of the right type this time!

No, not more regulations. A completely different set of regulations. It's incredible some people can't be bothered to accept the reason it's so shitty is because we insist on doing it differently. Reducing this bureaucracy is actually central to single-payer Medicare for All plans.

Nearly every other developed country in the world has figured this out, whether single-payer or another system with government-funded insurance. People in other countries generally don't have to fill out the number of forms you have to fill out for a hospital visit, after a hospital visit, for going to the emergency room, etc. 

The quality of healthcare that is delivered in the US is very high, the way it is set up though is backwards in every way.",1564617806

"TheHandmaidsTale","t5_3fhbh","Keep in mind, the people watching the Martha’s have a misogyny filter that you don’t have. Sure we know and believe that women are capable of being intelligent, strong, and influential people. To the men in this society that’s just simply impossible. They see women as these fickle creatures who think too highly of themselves when they’re only good for simple lives and simple tasks. In fact a lot of these men probably think that woman PREFER the ‘simpler’ life. Serena has a big hand in that. She basically convinced the men that women might say they want power but really they just want to do menial things, care for children, and keep the peace. That fundamental idea that built the entire society is set up to be the fundamental thing that knocks it down. 

Plus we’re looking at their freedom and access in places where the rules are being broken. At both of the Commaders houses June has been to the commanders are much less than religiously following the rules (Fred because he’s a horny egotistical prick and Joseph because he’s got a Frankenstein complex and hates the monster he created so he’s housing the resistance). The only other place we see the Martha’s working is in Jezebelles which is already an illegal den of mischief that should be kept fairly secret from the masses because it’s very existence goes against what the commanders preach. When the commanders are breaking the rules they must rely on the Martha’s breaking the rules for them too so they don’t get out on the wall. So the weakness in the commanders is bolstering the strength of the movement. The Martha’s are being smart by finding those weak points and exploiting them. 

That’s why I don’t see it as much of a plot hole, but instead a smart plot point.",1564617806

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Well it will create inflation, that is, everything you will buy will require more dollars to buy it, and the reason is because dollars are easier to come by, so there is now more dollars available to be spent.  

Bitcoin will probably be impacted by this over the years even if the demand stays the same, but it will not make bitcoin go from 10K to 100K in a year.

Let me give you an example.  Let's say that you have $1,000 to spend each month on making payments on borrowed money.  Maybe that is for a credit card or a mortgage you are about to take out.  Now lets say that interest rates are lowered and now that same $1,000 can afford to borrow more money.  Since there is no end to the things you need to buy you will borrow more with that same $1,000 a month and buy more.  Let's say that allows you buy $50 more per month.  Now let's say that in America there are at least 10 million more people just like you financially.  So they all do the same thing as you and spend $50 more per month.  That now works out to $500 million MORE per month being spent across the nation.  So effectively $500 million new dollars just showed up at retailers cash registers, in the new month that did not even exist in the previous month.

Sales go up.  Retailers say hey, I have so much more sales this month than last month, I need to increase my order to replenish stock, so I can sell again.  Manufactures now have to supply more.  But if all of this new money looking for the same amount of goods, manufacturers will think, wow demand is really up and I am having a hard time keeping up.  I bet I could raise my price and still sell everything I make.  A higher profit margin on the same goods sold.  Life is good.  

Then as prices increase to the point where it becomes profitable for someone else to incur the start up cost of making a new company to sell the same goods, then they do.  This new company needs employees, so now there are new jobs looking for people out of the same size employment pool.  These people leave their old job for a higher paying one or the unemployed now have a job.  These new wages means that more people suddenly have more money to spend, so they start buying again or borrowing again and they spend and interject even more new money into the economy.  And so the cycle repeats until there are no more people to hire and then businesses cannot expand, and since people have borrowed more than before they hit their limit on borrowing and thus spending and do not spend more.   Some will even spend less.  So now if 10 million people spend just $50 less next month that is $500 million dollars that does not make it to retailers.  Thus they buy fewer goods from the manufacture since they have more goods left over at the end of the month.  Then manufactures have to cut back on production, therefore, they need fewer employees, so layoffs start.  When these people become unemployed, their spending drops way down.  Less spending, less retail, less manufacturing and cycle repeats.

Now if the prices are rising too fast, then the Fed can raise interest rates. This means then that more people cannot afford to borrow new money or will borrow less, thus reducing the amount of money people have to spend on goods.  But of course there is a lag on when the fed takes an action and when the effect happens, so the fed is ALWAYS behind.  Things have to get bad or worse before they act, but then they are acting late and it takes time for their corrective action to take effect therefore it gets worse before it gets better, or it gets too good before they pull it back.

Since the 1970s the fed and the federal government has been creating new money every decade that continues to pump up demand and thus costs.  Sure it fluctuates from year to year, but if you draw a trend line from 1970 to today, it will have a positive slope with no hint of going negative.

To give you another example suppose Bitcoin existed in the 1970s.  How much would one cost?  I do not know for sure, but it would be a lot less.  The reason is there were trillions of **fewer** dollars available for everyone to buy **anything** with; therefore, if you were going to make a sale, you better price it so that people can afford it.  

Look at these prices:  [http://www.classic70s.com/1970s-prices.html](http://www.classic70s.com/1970s-prices.html) .  I am old enough to remember the 1970s and these prices seem likely to me for that time.  Of course though, they did not seem cheap at the time.  Compare those to what you would pay today.  Big difference right?  But most people do not noticed until they look back because the price increases were gradual.",1564617807

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Jeralt actually is Byleth's father indeed, but with a major twist:

&gt;!Byleth's mother was a clone of Sothis, while Jeralt carries half Rhea blood, hence Byleth has same color with dragons.!&lt;

Full detail **( WARNING! major end game spoiler)**

&gt;!Rhea is Seiros as an alter ego. Byleth is vessel of  Goddess Sothis and then her reincarnation after they fused their souls,  thus wields power of progenitor(creator) god.!&lt;

&gt;!Long  ago Sothis granted Nemesis and his ten elites power of crest and dragon blood so they could stop the wars among human. But later they were manipulated by Those Who Slither in the  Darkness, who wants to avenge for their defeats by Sothis. They betrayed Sothis and killed her in her sleep, then massacred most manakete lived  in Zanado, later known as Red Canyon. (the city in the opening with Sothis watching over) Seiros, Seteth and Flayn were some of the survivors.  Nemesis used dead dragons to create more powerful weapons known as relics. Hence why Flayn also called relics as her mother in her paralogue. Some quotes claimed ten elite got their crests when TWSITD created them from dead dragons as well.!&lt;

&gt;!Seiros  allied with great human hero  Wilhelm I and granted him her blood to combat Nemesis, thus he receives her Crest of Seiros and later formed Empire.  The war lasts many decades. In Imperial Year 91, Seiros finally killed  Nemesis. The ten elites surrendered and spared by Seiros who then rewrote history to make elites seemly on her side. In reality her allies were Wilhelm and other four Saints, including Seteth (St. Cichol), and Flayn (St.  Cethleann )!&lt;

&gt;!Seiros  adopted new identity as Rhea over the years, and was experimenting on resurrecting her mother Sothis. She created clones of Sothis over the millennia , but  each of them failed to bear her soul and only lived out their lives as  mortals despite bearing Crest of Flame.!&lt;

&gt;!A  few hundred years prior to birth of Byleth. A young mercenary named  Jeralt took a fatal blow for Rhea while fighting side by side with her.  To save his life, Rhea transfused her blood into him, granting him the  Crest, superhuman strength and unusual long lifespan. He then serve her as right  hand for the following generations.!&lt;

&gt;!About  20 years before the game, Jeralt fell in love with a “nun” who turned  out to be the 12th clone of Sothis. Combining the blood of Seiros on  Jeralt and physical body of Sothis, Byleth was the perfect vessel that  was created unintentionally.!&lt;

&gt;!The  laboring was tragic one however, as both mother and child were dying.  To save the child, Rhea took the crest stone from the mother (following the wish of dying woman according to Rhea) and given to the child,  Byleth survived but with suppressed emotion and no heartbeat. He also bears the soul of Sothis, but with independent sentient until she was awakened just prior to the game began. Then the two became one after the fusing,  making Byleth the Progenitor God and the living incarnation of Sothis. Some NPC mentions Byleth was different after the fusion, so it's probably his personality and conscious got mixed with Sothis. But it's hard to say since player has the actual control behind.!&lt;

&gt;!By  blood, Byleth is half Sothis, with Rhea and Jeralt took quarter each.  He has very pure dragon blood running in him, thus Flayn felt his power and asked if they were related. This also plays into the name Rhea, which is mother of gods, since she basically created Byleth the Progenitor God.!&lt;

&gt;!You would learn everything about Byleth and Jeralt if you choose church path and S-supports Rhea in the end.!&lt;",1564617809

One of them was basically just the House of Representatives, the other was basically just The Senate. The high population states wanted the first, the more rural ones the latter. Neither group was willing to cede ground because they would have essentially completely forfeit governance to the other group. Meaning that the Constitution wouldn't have been ratified and we would have been stuck with the Articles of Confederation which had...problems. ((Like the inability for the federal government to raise any money...))

The compromise was rather than just have a single body (HoR OR Senate), they did both (HoR AND Senate).",1564617809

"galaxys10","t5_2x95j","I was actually about to post about this, as I had similar frustrations with my trusty wired XBox 360 controller. Worked fine on my old phone, but I'd tried 3 different OTG adapters to no avail with my GS10+. Was really bummed because the screen is so much nicer.

Decided to give it a try with my cheaper Logitech gamepad (F310). Didn't work initially, but I flipped the odd switch underneath the controller and nearly everything worked perfectly (I _did_ have to remap `a` with `x` and `y` wasn't working out of the box).

Turns out that the swith I'd thought was useless was actually meant to toggle between 2 input standards. It seems that Samsung decided to kill support for X Input via USB, but DirectInput works mostly fine.",1564617809

"PUBG","t5_3g85e","I've fired full auto SMGs and M16s.  SMG and M16s have almost no noticeable jump up close.  A SMG MP5 will nail center mass full on.

The characters all fire like enfeebled children.  I think it's on purpose though and that's why so many attachments exist.  It takes muscle to handle some weapons.  If they handled like their real life counter parts the attachments wouldn't be as useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost no muzzle climb.

Almost no muzzle climb.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the AK fired in bursts can do full center mass from a distance.   PUBG games are not meant to be realistic though.  They might as well all be scifi guns cause they have no relation to their real life counter parts.  It's made by a Korean studio who do have experience in fire arms but only the K2.

However even this weapon has better recoil than some of the guns in the game:

&amp;#x200B;

Hell one of the rifles featured in the game is just a reskin, so to say their based on real rifles is complete bull shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell in fact modern weapons don't rely on the platform any more and can be adjusted by the round being fired.  Dependent on the grain and design.  Most even so called knowledgeable gun users don't realize this.

Unfortunately bullet design typically doesn't take into account full auto but they do exist.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Arguably there might be some slight wiggle room for people/friends or whatever that get carried but that technically don't pay or otherwise cheat to get to that position.

Say player A is legitimately a complete pvp god that can compete at that level, that doesn't mean that they might not play a ton of comp with their friend B who is only slightly above average at best. This could end up taking player B to the top such that they could legitimately obtain Unbroken while playing in a fireteam with their friend (or multiple better friends or whatever) despite not being in that top 2.5% skill level themselves.

It really comes down to a somewhat fine line of where you consider that legitimate vs a ""carry"" when you consider that most everyone at some point plays with their friends regardless of skill level, you're always playing with other players that are at a minimum slightly better or worse than you, and the fact that there is no actual dedicated solo competitive matchmaking based on absolute raw skill.

If I'm a mediocre maybe 1500 glory skill cap player on my own but get lucky and hit 2100 with the help of some more skilled friends does that mean I cheesed or was carried and shouldn't have the right to Recluse or Luna's? What about people who play a bare minimum number of games each week and increase their glory largely with the weekly bonus points despite losing more than 50% of their games?

Yes if you had one team of 4x top 1% players vs 3x top 1% players and a top 10% player you could argue that the first team should always win but that isn't always the case, and when in reality it could be something like 1x 0.1% player, 2x top 5% player, 1x top 10% vs 3x top 5% 1x top 1% the actual win rate predictions kind of fly out the window.",1564617814

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","ESH. You shouldn't have called her lazy because her staying at home with the kids was a huge sacrifice on her part of her career. She is very, very unlikely to be able to go back at the level she was and I don't doubt that when the kids were younger she would have been working very hard at home and getting very little variation or free time in her day. But realistically, if all the kids are at school, she probably doesn't need to be at home all day so I think she needs to be willing to compromise on this, if it would make a significant difference to family finances and financial security for all of you. 

I think you need to apologise for calling her lazy and try to talk through the options and make a decision together for your family.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","An eating disorder does not mean one is incapable of eating, it means that there's often serious mental blocks that prevent a person from eating in a healthy manner. Your attitude of 'literally can't"" is very telling and fully believing that is probably why you've made such little progress in therapy. It's not easy, but you can push past those mental blocks. That's something you need to figure out. When it comes to mental illness the world isn't obligated to bend to what's easiest for you and you have to take responsibility for getting yourself to a function state. Thankfully you're young, you still have plenty of time to work past this and get to a healthier more functional place.  


As with any mental illness it's not as simple as 'just do better lmao' or 'just eat lmao' and I know that. It's frustrating when you struggle to make progress and it can feel impossible at times. It's incredibly important though to keep in mind it's not as out of reach as your brain is making you think it is.

"OsamuSato","t5_39zua","There is 2 different translations:

One that was made in 2014(?) by 4chan users when they first found the game. A few lines are missing and there are some questionable translations or localizations, like saying “mid-heaven” instead of chu-teng. It is only the Mac version. You can use BasiliskII, a 68k Mac emulator to run it. I don’t have a link for it but it should be easy to find on Mac abandonware sites.

The other translation (the one you mention that’s in progress) is a lot more accurate and in-depth and fully ports the game over to work on modern operating systems. The user Nosamu on the sato discord is the main person working on it iirc. 

In the meantime the translation available now it complete enough to play the game.",1564617819

Ah, I must have missed this part of the bill. That's a huge help. I'll keep looking.

And for what it's worth, I did call AirBnB customer service and told them more or less I said here in this thread. In addition to getting the money refunded they said they'd pass the feedback along to their dev team. While it obviously won't get put in tomorrow it's good to know they have a hard deadline to handle this a few months away.

We had practice 3 days a week every week after school learning how to use swords, axes, shields etc. (pvc enforced full contact foam weapons, which had weight but didn’t break skin). Every single practice, every single week without fail I got hit in the nuts, whether it was an accident, on purpose, to myself, or even the teacher joining in on practice with us. Forced the teacher to make ourselves crotch protectors. Didn’t work for me of course. Came to the day we had a round robin tournament in front of the school. One on one full contact sword fights. Every round whether or not I won or lost, I was hit in the nuts. It was honestly ridiculous lol.",1564617820

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","Regarding sex, Kant seems to suffer the same pitfall as he does with his objection the Golden Rule in *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*, and his justification of devotion to heads of state as evidenced in his essay *Perpetual Peace*: his tendency to believe that a concept is ideally realised when it has a universally recognised form. To illustrate: 1) He believes marriage legitimises sex because the relationship is officially witnessed, regardless of its quality or the emotional connection between partners; 2) He believes that treating each other as you would wish to be treated involves an observable active treatment (e.g a masochist being treated in a specific way they experience masochistically) instead of a considerate attitude (e.g. a masochist recognising that a non-masochist might wish to be treated with kindness); 3) He believes that a state's leader should be recognised by all within the nation so as to be of potential service to them in international war, so that the leaders will care for their subjects and thus rule them justly, regardless of how any citizens may interpret the nation's right to exist, the leader's legitimacy and/or competence, etc.

This position relies a lot on a notion that there is a bounded set of legitimate subjects that don't deviate from an unwaveringly-identical interpretation of everything, which is a bit ridiculous, but consistent with his views: he thought that only landed men should have a say in how their lives are governed and that women or labourers should not, as evidenced in the essay *Theory and Practice*.

From the loyalty account they used during the transaction, we could see they were making returns all over the city.

Or why the hell somebody would run the risk of getting caught for a crime that pays within the amount they could get from working a legitimate job they could obtain that requires the same level of ""skills"" demonstrated by coming up with these schemes and executing them (they have to be able to work in a group successfully if they're being told what to do by someone else, or be intelligent enough to study these things and find out how to exploit them to commit theft).",1564617821

* Poison's new haircut is kinda odd but I like it. An explosion of pink, basically.

* Going to presume we're still on the Season that started with Kage, and that we might get a couple more characters come Capcom Cup.

* Expecting some of the audience at EVO to be like ""Wait, who now?"" on Lucia, and then probably a good pop for Poison.",1564617821

What scares me are the ones who run full-speed through the store.  Some little old lady could come out of a side aisle and the kid could crash into her.

* https://www.newsweek.com/donated-body-sold-army-brc-arizona-1451846
* https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodybrokers-industry/
* https://time.com/5636486/fbi-body-donation-arizona/

To summarize:

* In 2011, federal authorities began investigating the Biological Resource Center. The BRC “brokered the donation of human bodies for research.”
* Jim Stauffer donated his mother’s corpse to the Biological Resource Center in Phoenix Arizona in 2013. His mother, Doris Stauffer, had died of Alzheimer’s but didn’t have the usual gene for it, so doctors hoped they could study her brain, although neurologists didn’t accept the body. Jim donated her corpse hoping that her brain could be used to learn about Alzheimer’s.
* “Jim Stauffer signed a form authorizing medical research on his mother’s body. He also checked a box prohibiting military, traffic-safety and other non-medical experiments.”
* A few days later Jim received his mother’s ashes. He wasn’t told how the body was used. The 2016 Reuters uncovered records showing that one of Doris’s hands had been detached from her body and cremated for the ashes sent to Jim. The rest of Doris’s corpse was sold to the army and used in an experiment studying the effects of bombs.
* In 2014, the FBI raided the BRC
* Stephen Gore, owner of the Biological Resource Center, plead guilty to fraud in 2015. 
* In 2016, a Reuters investigation revealed that the BRC had been supplying corpses to the military without the permission of those donating the corpse. At least 20 other corpses donated without permission were also used in blast tests. Each corpse was sold for over $5,000. 
* Among other things, the BRC shipped infected body parts and did not inform the researchers handling the body parts. 
* Jim Stauffer found out how his mother’s corpse was used from a Reuters reporter in 2016.
* Army officials said while they never received the consent forms that the Biological Resource Center assured them the loved ones donating the corpses had given them permission. Army policy requires that the next of kin consent to the experiments. 
&gt; “But the consent forms the Army examines are not necessarily the same ones signed by donors. In the BRC case, the Army said, the military reviewed “heavily redacted forms or forms signed by an agent of BRC that indicated consent.”
* Jim Stauffer and 32 others are suing the Biological Resource Center.
* The body trade isn’t regulated. The only state to keep detailed records is New York. There also is no law that loved ones or corpse donors have a right to know how a donated corpse was used.

Also, in the 2014 FBI raid of the BRC:
&gt; Inside, the FBI found freezers stuffed with cut-up body parts and piles of limbs unrelated to each other in various locations throughout the facility, according to a civil lawsuit filed against the Biological Resource Center and its former owner Stephen Gore. In addition, as part of what investigators described as a morbid joke, was the torso of a large man whose head had been replaced by that of a very small woman, according to the lawsuit.",1564617822

2. People who follows him a bit more know there's way more to his drawing than daily comics. Rimworld series has a complex and mature story and doodly art style is rised there to truly badass level. His anime drawings show his true skill and he makes his own game. He's a surprisingly good artist compared to what he seems to be at first glance.

3. Edits. What is cooler than getting a personalized drawing from a good artist?

4. Through edits and meme challenges he created a community around not just his comics but also drawing itself. I personally improved my drawing from absolute shit to somewhat decent only thanks to him.

"Yogscast","t5_2sg86","IMO:
Originally I think production stopped due to problems with the minecraft world. Realistically they could replace the world fairly easily, especially when they use fans. They could even start a new and say they travelled somewhere else. They also have a lot more staff now that would be able to offer their creative input in directing the series. 
The reason why they won’t do that now:
It wouldn’t be as good as the original and would never be able to live up to hype. 
Lewis and Simon aren’t interested in playing a narrative based Minecraft adventure map, even if it was successful. 
Sure minecraft is getting more popular but new viewers would struggle to understand the plot without watching the previous episodes, which have dated mic quality.

"AcademicBiblical","t5_2w28m","Biblically speaking, where does it say “half” brother? People have debated what Matthew 1:25 means. From Wikipedia:

&gt; Some writers, such as R.V. Tasker[53] and D. Hill,[54] say the Matthew 1:25 statement that Joseph ""knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son"" to mean that Joseph and Mary did have normal marital relations after Jesus' birth, and that James, Joses, Jude, and Simon, were the natural sons of Mary and Joseph and, thus, full brothers of Jesus. Others, such as K. Beyer, point out that Greek ἕως οὗ (until) after a negative ""often has no implication at all about what happened after the limit of the 'until' was reached"".[55] Raymond E. Brown also argues that ""the immediate context favors a lack of future implication here, for Matthew is concerned only with stressing Mary's virginity before the child's birth"".

Even if it does not unambiguously imply that Mary later had children, it also does not unambiguously imply a perpetual virginity for Mary. Luke 2:7 even refers to Jesus as the “first-born” son of Mary, which to me lends weight to the idea that she had other sons but is not definitive proof because the first born son was an important status even in the absence of other children (one had to be redeemed from priest, for instance). But I think the weight of evidence is suggestive of a single nuclear family. Again from Wikipedia:

&gt; In addition, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus's brothers or siblings are often described together, without reference to any other relatives (Matthew 12:46–49, Mark 3:31–34, 6:3, Luke 8:19–21, John 2:12, Acts 1:14), and Jesus's brothers are described without allusion to others (John 7:2–5, 1 Corinthians 9:5).

When Jesus was 12, Mary and Joseph seem to be still together (Luke 2:41-50) so if James is a half brother, he must be 1) a son of Joseph before marriage to Mary that’s just completely unmentioned, 2) the product of completely unmentioned adultery by either of them, or 3) much, much younger than Jesus, only a teenager when Jesus is conducting his ministry As far as I know, none of those things are biblically mentioned or implied. If Jesus were the younger son of Joseph, it would parallel several stories in Genesis (Jacob and Esau; Joseph and his brothers, etc) and you’d think at least Matthew would make that parallel. 

There seems to be no strictly Biblical reason to assume *half* brother, at least not that I’m aware of.",1564617823

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt; I think this is already worked out in the law. Certain debtors get paid before others depending on the nature of the debt. 

This is true. When filing chapter 11 bankruptcy, I'm pretty sure secured loans get paid back first.

Employees that have not been paid get paid back next. 

When filing chapter 11, the company has to come up with a plan to pay back all its debts that the court than agrees to.

Back pay is adjusted every 3 years for inflation. In other words, it's quite possible these employees may not see the pay they're owed for years. 

[Per Trump](https://whotv.com/2016/06/22/trump-defends-brilliantly-using-bankruptcy-laws/), using these laws is brilliant.

The dingus at the warehouse just labeled the box and threw it to ups. I got it all messed up and torn open a bit.  Luckily everything was inside and undamaged.

You wanna help the friend, but the boyfriend is a violent pill popper which 100% means they can't be trusted with your property. If he violates the trust bond you have with your friend, then you are all damaged accordingly to such an extent that some or all of you will lose something, when she can just sleep in her car for a while and pay the cost of choosing such a mate.

If anything you're doing her a favor by inconveniencing, but not hurting, her in this way because it will make her think twice about the cost of the bond she's chosen. I am a drug addict who's known mostly drug addicts my whole life: violent pill poppers burn you 100% of the time. 100%, guaranteed.",1564617824

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","There are 2 leagues ( American League and National League) with 3 divisions in each (East, Central, and West) that each have 5 teams.

There are 2 ways to make the playoffs, by winning your division or winning a Wild Card spot.

Wildcards are the top 2 teams in each league (by record) that don't win their division. 

The winners of each division automatically go on to the Division Series. The two Wildcard teams then have to play one game between them to determine who the final team in each league's division series is.

So it looks like this:

NL 

West Winner

Central Winner

East Winner

Wild Card Winner (decided by the one game playoff)

AL

West Winner

Central Winner

East Winner

Wild Card Winner


To be a contender that this point in the seasons you have a realistic shot at either winning your division or being one of the top 2 teams that doesnt win their division.


To clinch a spot in the playoffs, the amount of games left in the season must be less than the difference between the records of the teams behind them.


The playoffs then work in a bracket format that's identical in both leagues, AL and NL.

WildCard Game (Round .5)

Wild Card Team with the worse record (away team) vs Wild Card Team with better record (home team)

Division Series (Round 1)

WildCard Winner (away team) vs Division Winner with the best record (home team)

And

Division Winner with 3rd best record (away team) vs Division Winner with the 2nd best record (home team)

Championship Series (Round 2)

Winner of each Division Series play each other

World Series (Finals)

Winners of each Championship Series (one AL team and one NL team) play each other

After tracheal tube and catheter placement, we took radiographs to determine the extent of the damage and started treatments accordingly. We almost euthanized her multiple times because she had such a grave prognosis. But every time euthanasia was talked about, she would move and her pulse would spike. After a long night of her being intubated and myself staying at the clinic with her overnight to continue treatments, she somehow became stable.

Sports / Games:

- Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (Running)

cry evrytim:

- Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka? (aka SukaSuka) - could also be added to Romance / Drama

Wordplay:

- Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu - it's already in Drama and Josei but not here.

Workplace:

- Bakuman (Manga Artist) 

In my opinion fits here much better than Mangaka-san to Assistant-san. It offers a much wider perspective about manga artists, has more characters, better story and is longer (3 whopping seasons with 25-episodes each). To be honest I'm surprised it isn't already here.

Yuri:

The extra storage is moot, really. Though maybe not, considering if I keep this phone for a couple years. I tend to keep my pictures and videos on the phone.

Either is a great purchase, but for 45$ more the 8/256 model is very attractive.",1564617826

I'd start slow, pushing my cock in and grunting in your ear. I moan a lot when I'm turned on but I'd not hold back now, you have to know what your asshole is doing to me.

"latebloomerlesbians","t5_mwfyw","I think it depends how you define codependency, as it's kind of a vague concept that gets applied to all kinds of different situations. The classical idea of codependency is a relationship where one person is enabling someone with an addiction or severe mental illness who refuses to get help and treatment. The enabler stops the person from experiencing any negative consequences in their life, so the other person doesn't feel a need to change.

It seems that more recently, codependency has been used for any relationship that has a high level of dependence and/or enmeshment. Personally, I would view a couple as codependent if:

* They feel like they have to do everything together, and never or rarely have time alone by themselves or time with friends/hobbies/group activities/family
* All their friends are shared as a couple, rather than having some separate friendships on their own
* All their hobbies are shared as a couple, rather than having some interests or hobbies they do alone
* One or both people are so dependent that they are afraid to leave, even if the relationship becomes unhealthy, abusive or toxic
* One or both people are compromising on significant dealbreakers, e.g. one person wants kids and the other doesn't, so one person caves and remains unhappy or resentful
* There is no tolerance for a difference of opinions or beliefs, e.g. if one person is religious they feel the need to convince their partner to go to church and be religious too instead of accepting their views

Having said that, some emotional interdependence is perfectly healthy and normal in romantic relationships. My concern is when people rely so much on their partner that they wouldn't be able to cope if the relationship broke up, and they don't have a support network to help them through a break up. I don't blame people as life is hard and people can get isolated due to all sorts of unforeseen circumstances like illness, disability, and so on. I just don't think that's optimal or ideal.

Also if you're really struggling or worried that your relationships are codependent, I'd recommend seeing a good therapist to get another opinion. Just remember it's not black and white, and a lot of these ideas are culturally constructed. Our western culture does value independence and individuality a lot more than others.",1564617828

"MuslimMarriage","t5_39x1d","&gt;The choice is completely up to her

No. Shariah gives this choice to husband. He has to agree if she can go out and work or not.

I understand current feminist point of view, but please don't change shariah.

\---

Direct from Quran:

**“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them \[al-Baqarah 2:228\]**

No paraphrasing here.

\---

Husband Rights on Wife:

 **(d)Not going out of the house except with the husband’s permission. One of the rights of the husband over his wife is that she should not go out of the house except with his permission.** 

**The Shaafa’is and Hanbalis said: she does not have the right to visit (even) her sick father except with the permission of her husband, and he has the right to prevent her from doing that… because obedience to the husband is obligatory, and it is not permitted to neglect an obligatory action for something that is not obligatory.**

She’s the one who is using their product and have yet to uphold her end of the bargain. Actually read the lease you sign and you’ll probably be amazed. Even if this was true and they lost it the burden is on her to cut another one by the due date as that’s the contract she signed. Accident or not, she’s outside of her contract. If she thinks she’s just going to move and wait until they ‘come for her’ to pay it with no problem, she’s mistaken.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","&gt; In all, this team is still top 3 in all of baseball and there's no telling what can happen in the playoffs.

Totally agreed. Playoff can be fairly random. And as a relatively risk averse person I understand and subscribe to the model of ""being good enough to continuously be in the playoffs"" rather than pushing chips all in. But I think perhaps ""pushing all the chips"" (or more of the chips, perhaps inefficiently to a degree) in has some value in real life baseball. It shows more commitment to fans perhaps (but then again, fandom are fiddle).

I don't know. I honestly feel like the Dodgers have too many assets in the minors that they will eventually run into 40 man/play time inefficiencies and you might as well convert some of them a bit inefficiently into championship pushes.

I'm not advocating for May+Lux for Vazquez, that's so far off proper value IMO to be doable (but Chapman did get the Cubs that title on that ridiculous deal). But I don't know, you can spare DJ Peters for a Sam Dyson type. Or a Kody Hoese (I think you can trade new draftee right away now right?) for a Shane Greene.

And I think the biggest thing that bugged me was you guys not re-signing Greinke. The DBacks were able to flip him (ate 1/3 the contract?) for a ton from the Astros. You guys had him, probably just needed to offer him roughly what the Diamondbacks offered him (maybe a bit more due to tax) and it doesn't cost a pick. Why didn't they? Now the Astros is pushing chips in (and they still have a good farm after sending Bukauskas+Martin+Beer) and they get the service of Greinke.",1564617830

&gt;Gaming as a whole should become far more inclusive and less hostile to anyone who isn’t a straight white cis male.

I actually think gaming in today's sense is very harmful to people's health, relationships and general well-being. I think gaming appeals to aggressive men who don't have much to do in their privileged lives because women do most work for them. My friends and I play games, but we don't have the kind of ""gamer"" attitude that most men I know have because we simply have better things to do with our time.

Did you visit a dermatologist? You can ask  him/ her to prescribe **Bryhali** lotion or Codran tape. FYI that tape is $ 75 and I refill that once every 3 weeks. Therefore, I stick to Bryhali only. It helps to clear it up.

Bryali can be drying. So apply lotion as your skin starts to dry or ashy. **Eucerin** for eczema is really good and **Cerave Anti Itch** is great in the day time (if you like light consistency).

For body wash, try **CLN body wash**. It diminish the itchiness and redness. You only need a little bit and lather it. Let it sit your your skin for 2 minutes.

I stop consuming dairy, coffee, cereals, bacon, sausages, peanuts, sugary snacks, pasta, and bread. Try not to eat it for 3 months. If you gotta have bread, stick to sourdough. I incorporate flax seed, chia seed, quinoa, oatmeal, berries, bananas, apples, greens into my diet a lot. It takes a lot of effort. My eczema clears up 90%.

I DID grow up with GW1. I literally have memories that are clear as day of trundling through Istan and exploring Kourna while blasting Justin Timberlake's Futuresex/Lovesounds on repeat because it had just come out

I've also played GW2 since release and pre-ordered it as soon as you could, and still think it is an amazing game and a unique MMO. For reference, I've so far played: 

* GW1 (since release until recently)
* WoW (since release until Legion)
* LotRO (since closed beta until Rohan)
*SWTOR (until after the Hutt expansion came out)
* Rift (spottily)
* WAR (since CB until shutdown)
* Lineage 2 and a bunch of Asian MMOs most people haven't heard of

, all (- Rift) on and off but for at least one cumulative year of a 4+ hrs daily each.

If you'll look at the rankings on mmorpg.com, GW2 is in second, before FF14, and you know what? I think it deserves it.  
It introduced or improved upon a bunch of mechanics, it's (still!) visually stunning, same as at release, it has a lot of build flexibility and variety (for the non-super-hardcore; most anything is _viable_, even if it's not optimal), endless activities and activity streams for all tastes, and tons of repeatable content that doesn't get boring nearly as quickly as in other MMOs I've played. You can grind, you can explore, you can just help others or try and do cool things, getting around maps (without using waypoints) is much easier and more fun since HoT and PoF. There is lore *everywhere*, but how many random NPCs did you talk to? How many conversations did you not blindly skip? GW1 felt like it had way more lore because of the 25 cinematics per mission.

I really don't get the hate. I really, really don't. It's the only MMO I've ever played where 7 years after release I feel 100% comfortable saying ""there is still SO MUCH to do and try and experiment with!""

So many cool skins to obtain, so many looks to mix and match, so many hidden nooks and crannies (even if you have 10 GoExploration), so many awesome builds to try out, so many achievements!

Y'all should set yourselves some achievable goals and find a fun route to the destination. Or don't set goals, just pick a road that seems fun and see where it takes you. Or take a break, or look at build videos or lore videos or WvW 4v1 videos.

"RealmRoyale","t5_gdbsg","I agree with everything here completely except the personal chest, I think that should stay in the game or they need to buff how many shards you get from disenchanting. There are tons of people who want these old systems back and there are tons of people who would enjoy the game more if it was like that. Unfortunately I don't think it will happen. The developers have made it clear they want to appeal to casuals and not the more hardcore players that use to enjoy this game. There is very little chance they are gonna bring these changes in because they would mainly benefit good players (which I think should happen, I just don't think the developers will do it). Extra ability would just give good players another thing to outplay bad players, along with the reduced CD on said abilities. Armor is a system that rewards going out and getting kills (since you can pick up other players armor) along with the chicken trophy system, so both systems are more rewarding to good players. I don't know at this point it just seems clear as day that they want the game dumbed down since a majority of the playerbase left is casual players and I don't think they will risk making it harder on them even though that's really the only way they'll improve.",1564617832

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)
   
   In the meantime, make sure to familiarize yourself with our rules.

#NOTE: DO NOT MESSAGE US ABOUT THIS. DO NOT ASK US WHAT THE THRESHOLD IS. YOU WILL BE MUTED AND BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING.
   
   PLEASE NOTE. BELOW THIS IS AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE THAT TELLS YOU TO MESSAGE US. DO NOT DO SO.

But that's fixed by the House of Representatives in America. EU (from what I understand not living over there and only reading about it) has similar structures that make it as fair as it can get and still be a union, etc.

Now, in the US.. for the generation alive, it's just always been this way. New York doesn't think Montana is going to purposely try to hurt them with dumb laws and vice versa.  And if they do.. Montana would be able to get other states to band together to strike back at New York. But the general citizens don't worry about that stuff. because we know it just works out in end and always has. While in the EU.. it is still very much new and thus very much worrisome that they (the states in our earlier analogy) are losing their ability to rule themselves a bit and something bad may happen they think.

They didn't care to do simulations and it will be nice to see them finally have to deal with a new threat.  Other note, I can finally move on my Disc captain.  I had them waiting in their universe.  To make sure they saw the story completely with no simulations.  Now they can finally move into the future, and into the universe along with my other characters.

* I have no desire to help those vile Elachi.  Specially my Romulan.  So if they get destroyed.  That is one less species to deal with later.  So I hope this new story don't go that route.

* A holo-character from another universe to help us out.  This sounds interesting.  Nothing like a multi-verse story line.

There is a Tomb near Seyda Neen that contains an enchanted ring that has Constant Effect Int and Wisdom +10 you want that.

Enchanted items like Viperbolt Rings will become plentiful. Find them, buy them, use them. Hell use them in any event! It will train your Enchant skill and they don't have a use time. You can just spam attack and POOF no more target. I keep a couple such rings on me at all times and just flat out crush annoying targets or I fire them at a tree when I'm returning Home. They'll recharge just fine by the time I'm ready to go back out.

Certain Signs you could have picked during Creation will boost Magicka it might have been helpful to pick one.

The Better Regen mod which you can find at Nexus is useful without being incredibly overpowered for slowly regenerating HP and Magicka. I like it. You won't regen enough Magicka during a fight for it to matter but you will build back up travelling around. There are other mods which will recharge faster.

Consider using clever spells like Paralyze or Weakness to Damage. You might even consider putting both together in a single spell. I've spent some time running Weakness to damage combined with Enchanted Fire/Shock/Frost weapons. ZAP! WHACK! Next!

The Caldera Merchant isn't even the most OP. There is another one with 2x as much gold. Casting Command Creature on them and making them follow you back to your Home. That is OP!

Using those Merchants isn't cheating in anyway, shape, or fashion. Using them too often though causes you not to train Mercantile/Personality. Which will suck for you when you find some super awesome bit of kit but the Merchant hates your guts and overcharges you.

T2/T3 SysAdmin sounds far more profitable for a recruiter's salary than T1 SysAdmin/helpdesk, so that's a damn good start.

Irrationalist and patronising nonsense with nothing to show for it.

Supporting the political persecution of people on the basis of their views doesn't allow one's real or tokenised bloc of 'otherwise-silenced' people to speak, it is kicking an own-goal in the service of real fascism and oppression and it will backfire on genuine leftists and anti-fascists.
People like yourself back in Weimar Germany also thought it was a wonderful idea to invest the defence of democracy and oppressed people to social democrat politicians and the bourgeois fetish with legalism, which sounded like a great idea until the politics and the legal framework was handed over wholesale to the Nazis.

So no, fuck Stalinists, too-comfortable middle-class Western 'progressives' and any other crusading wankers who would flippantly and cheaply trade off fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of speech for (the illusion) of a little bit of protection.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","&gt;If you look at all those physiological effects of nicotine, you will see that there is very little hard evidence for any of them.

There is very little ""hard evidence"" of the effects of nicotine? I'm going to need to see a source on this. Just like tobacco **smoke,** nicotine is responsible for inducing a temporary state of hypoxia. We're not talking about pregnant women in this thread or in the article, but even intermittent hypoxia over 9 months is enough to cause birth defects. Smoke gives you carbon monoxide and other ""harmful chemicals."" Nicotine causes vasoconstriction and increases heart rate, among many other things. It boosts cortisol. These aren't up for debate and are based on medical science. I would love to see a study that shows that there is little hard evidence for any of the physiological effects of nicotine. All my sources are behind a paywall on UpToDate, which I refer to constantly, so that means I can't link you directly to what medical professionals use and the information provided to them. But the information is out there from other, free, reputable sources giving ""hard evidence"" on the detrimental effects of nicotine alone, and not just in conjunction with tobacco.

&gt;You could say the same things about caffeine.

The only thing caffeine and nicotine have in common is that they're stimulants. After that, the effects of the amount of nicotine in a cigarette and the amount caffeine in a cup of coffee elicit far different responses. Nicotine's response is much greater, especially in the release of cortisol. 

If you want to liken caffeine to nicotine, people can always hide behind the benefits of coffee to justify their usage and is probably part of the reason it's more socially acceptable to walk around with 20 ounces of Starbucks in your hand than it is to walk around with a pack of 20 cigarettes. And while tolerance can build to caffeine, you don't see people walking around with caffeine patches in the hopes of ending their ""addiction"" which means it's not quite on the same level as nicotine addiction.


Again, I want to loop back to the original post which I probably should have replied instead of yours sine that was where I had the issue.

&gt;Wrong. Patently false. Disgusting misrepresentation.

&gt;INHALING LIT FUCKING PLANTS INTO YOUR LUNGS IS WHAT KILLS YOU

&gt;Nicotine is not the problem. How they get that nicotine is.

....which is inherently false. Inhaling smoke is certainly the major issue here and where the vast amount of carcinogens are. But carcinogens are not the only metric to determine what OP did, unless the **only** fear of smoking is cancer. Which it is not. 

Framing nicotine in the context of the article where a city is proposing to not allow the hiring of people that have nicotine can be seen as asinine on the lawmakers' parts; but my issue was with an uneducated user (the OP) dramatically misinforming other users, who may not know any better, that ""nicotine is not the problem."" If nicotine wasn't the problem, then this sub would be much less populated because quitting smoking would just be a matter of simply not inhaling smoke. No one would be ""struggling"" to get over a nicotine addiction by vaping instead. 

One last thing to think about: medical students who graduate and go on to do a residency are sometimes tested for nicotine. Some programs/hospitals do a nicotine test on all health care providers and not just physicians and resident physicians, but nurses and aides too. This has been going since at least 2014, possibly earlier but I was never aware of it before then. But this was well before the media exaggerated ""teen vaping"" or just vaping in general, at least compared to the Juul debacle of the last two years. So is it fear-mongering by hospital administrators to threaten their own employees and staff with a paranoia-fueled test?",1564617843

oh yea eventually. which was nice. i enjoyed their deaths, especially &gt;!narancia!&lt;. diavolo was the only villain that eventually managed to kill by his own hands more than a single guy. did you notice that?
part 1 dio: dire
part 2 kars: 0 (1 if you count wamuu killing ceaser. idk why you would count it but if you do)
part 3 dio: kakyoin
part 4 kira: ... I gues shigechi? but i mean, a. who really cared too much about him until he died and b. he barely died. it took kira so long to kill a fucking middle schooler. wtf. why didnt that take 5 minutes. how did he run so far away he basically ascaped. jesus.
part 5 diavolo: abbacchio, bucci, and narancia (yay! after 150 years of fighting extremely, almost unimaginably strong opponents, more than a single person died. great writing araki. swell job...
part 6: ehhh kinda of everyone but then no one because araki is a pussy who cant stand to kill off characters.

Personally it really ruins reading/watching jojo. what's the point if i know that every single fight will be the same? every single fight, no one will die? the characters are always safe, i never need to worry. and when they die, it takes them sooooooooooo long (shigechi.jpg, also von zeppeli the first). this is why I adored avdul, kakyoin and narancia's death. it was finally a death that didn't make the main characters have so much plot armor. they died, extremely brutally and without much closer. just like, you guessed it, their enemies. why should the main characters be treated so differently? it makes no sense.

tl;dr:
the saving point of part 5 is that people died. other than that i hate it with all of my soul.",1564617843

"Toastmasters","t5_2s72y","“They do love dues increases, but they're in a real bind, right now. In much of the third world, the current dues are far more painful than they are to many of the western nations”

Right, but here’s the thing.  That part of the world, the emergent market, the membership growth is exploding (perceived value is higher, corporate sponsorship tends to be higher, etc.)  It’s actually us in the States that are vocal about dues increases.  

“In fact, using those links, anyone who knows how to do an even mildly advanced google search can see what appear to be downloads to some 80-90% of it, right now.”

Sure, but it’s still a relatively closed system.  If they wanted to make revisions to paths, they have control over that and the perception of it.  Let’s put it this way.  The base CMS probably has a base “Export to PDF” feature that they’ve opted to leave off.   Remember that WHQ and clubs have been in a back-and-forth over control over “what is Toastmasters” for almost the entire history of the organization.   Leaving Pathways a closed system is a major pivot.  At any time, WHQ can simply turn off access to Pathways, and lock out the program if a club is not aligned with the Toastmasters brand.  Whereas at the same time, WHQ can promote Pathways in non-club settings (i.e. Rotary), spreading the umbrella of Toastmasters and moving away from the original club model.  

“You're comparing the percentage of those who complete the CC manual with the percentage that start pathways...”

The percentage of people who do even 3 or 4 speeches in the CC wasn’t that great.  I’m not knocking the manuals.  All I’m saying is that the main product isn’t the curriculum, it’s the social experience of the club meeting.  And that’s actually what Dan Rex keeps emphasizing in his keynotes.   Where Pathways matters in the game is in the new club situation.   And as he usually says, “new clubs will solve everything.”

“They may have formerly had a ""layoff"" mentality toward those who don't like their pronouncements. The analogy may soon be closer to the bleeding out of our membership.”

I feel they’re betting on the retention math.  50% of members today are going to be phased out in 2 years.  Within 3-4 years, the percentage of people who only know Pathways (whether they use it or not) will probably be at 80%.  For an organization that bases its business model on recruiting guests, rather than keeping members, that is probably an acceptable loss.  Really want to emphasize again - Toastmasters.  Doesn't.  Care.  About.  Retention.  Never have, and it looks like they never will.  It doesn't matter how many of us -- club officers, District volunteers, District Directors -- want that to be different.  We all have to let that go, and go out there to find the next person who wants to join.  Our future looks much like our present.

Honestly, I agree with you on most things, and there are many things I wish I was different (see WHQ's policy changes to contest.)  The membership in North America has been contracting for a few years, and it seems like we’re probably due for another year of “Toastmasters recession.”  It may be a permanent reconfiguration.",1564617843

"MoneyDiariesACTIVE","t5_12n5pd","I do one of two things: hoard my points to pay for flights if I know I need to book one within the next year, or if I don’t have any trips planned that involve flying/paying for lodging I hoard them to offset Christmas shopping/other holiday spending, and then cash them in as a statement credit once I get my end of December statement (my billing cycle ends on the 28th of the month).

However, make sure you’re getting the maximum value out of your points - for example, since my Capital One Venture is billed as a “travel” card, I actually get LESS value if I use them as a statement credit than I do if I use them towards travel. So for that card, I always save my points and then use them to offset the cost when I do have a “travel” expense- this can be airfare, checked baggage, hotel, Airbnb, Uber, anything like that qualifies with the Venture.

My Citi Double Cash I get the same value no matter what I do with my points, so that one I’m more likely to save the points until Christmas time, or if I want to splurge on something for myself - which is rare, but helps lessen the blow a little bit when I do. 

My Citi card is the one I use for normal every day use, but the second a trip comes up I switch to using the C1V in order to build up those points to redeem for travel expenses when I start booking, and then for the trip itself. It also has no foreign transaction fee and pays for either the Global Entry or TSA Precheck, so I use that one exclusively whenever I travel.",1564617845

"puppy101","t5_2rw7o","Initially, I think that leashing for the toilet actually does help! It means that you can take them to the same spot every time, so it becomes more of a routine for them, and as you said, there's less opportunity for them to get distracted and think it's play time!

I actually didn't leash mine at first and I think it made it more difficult. Because eventually, when she got spayed around 6 months, THEN I had to leash her for toileting and it was during that time that she finally got the hang of only peeing outside (she got pooping outside only pretty early on, thankfully). So I think the leashing helped.

Also one of the best things I did was teach her the verbal command ""Go Toilet"". By saying that phrase every time she peed outside - now when I come home from work, and I don't know how long it's been since she peed last (because she has access to the backyard while I'm out) I go outside with her and say ""Go Toilet"" and she knows that means I want her to empty her bladder before we go inside. If she doesn't need to, she'll usually trot around the yard once and then come back to me - but if there's anything in her bladder she'll go do it before coming back to me. This was especially useful while she was still learning to hold her bladder inside, and it definitely prevented some accidents! It's also good before long car rides or trips to the vet!

Edit: ALSO, don't be afraid to leave her in her pen for a couple of hours (probably no more than 2-3 at this stage) and go get a coffee or do your grocery shopping or just take some time out for you (and your partner). This will help with teaching her to be okay with being alone, and it will give you a much needed break so that you can keep your sanity and remember what normal life is like! Remember it won't be this hectic forever, and there will be a time when you can go back to your regular work schedule and not worry about leaving her for a few more hours.",1564617845

There is nothing more attractive about a guy who has confidence, knows how to take care of himself, so she doesn't have to play a mother-role but also, keep in mind, don't be arrogant or something similar, which is an absolute turn off for woman. Or do u wanna hear how much better someone is than you?
The woman of your life will come if she wants to.
Also, abundance is key to a woman and a happy life. It helps you too be happy with yourself, your life and it also shows that u have something going on in your life and that you are not a boring guy. Also a turn on for woman.
If u have all these, you don't have to think about any experience before a relationship.
First of all, you have your own stable life and u won't lose anything in a relationship. You can just gain more
Second, as long as the woman doesn't have to teach you everything, let's say communication, then you are good to go
Other things will go by themselves if you start a relationship
You will learn and make mistakes and that is good. You develop and the best case scenario would be that you learn from your mistakes to make the relationship better.

Electoral college is used over popular to protect states rights. California has 55 votes. Montana has 3. Cali has 40x the people. But only 18x the electoral votes. This protects the smaller states and allows their values to have more of an impact. 

So how does the electoral college sway in favor of the ignorant? Or are you just making a political statement about someone you don't like?

I also have noticed that the knock off pods I have to jiggle around to get my device to recognize it, but the Juul brand works the second I pop it in.",1564617846

It’s why AI will rapidly replace radiologists since it can detect far more minute changes in density and thus notice tumors way smaller than a doctor on a computer monitor can.

&amp;#x200B;

After hours of searching, and replacing parts I came to the following conclusions:

* With a PCIe slot powered GFX card the system runs stable and fine.
* When I replace it with the RTX2070, the system crashes every 5 to 30 mins.- When I swapped 8x heatspreaded 4GB ECC RAM with for 4x 4GB ECC RAM without heatspreaders, the system became stable and didn't crash yet. It is running for 4,5 hours without problem. Though there wasn't a clear trigger that caused a crash, I did games, video editing and a lot of surfing.

So that leads me to these theories:

* One or several RAM modules are bad, although test didn't show that.
* The RAM is overheating in the narrow air ducts. The heatspreaders cause an obstruction in airflow, so not enough heat will dissipate. The last time the system crashed, It wouldn't post anymore. So I pulled all modules, and put them back in one by one and booted the system. Individually they seemed to be working. I replaced them with the non-heatspreaded modules in the end, because I was sure they are ok. This works.
* There is a incompatibility issue with this motherboard, regarding a combination of the type of RAM and the GFX card, or something similar.

What I don't understand is, why does the crash only happen with the PCIe separately powered GFX card inside? I wouldn't think it's heat, since the CPU and RAM have 2 separate dedicated fans.

But here it is. I had the exact same problem with this particular system as the other people have. Swapping RAM solved.

I'm really curious if you could test this for yourself. Maybe swap out your modules with basic non-ECC modules?

Both my systems are running stable now. I'm not calling victory yet, but especially my GF would be very pleased with this upgrade, from an i7 860 to an E5-2650 V2.",1564617848

I was using a few drops of beard oil twice a day. But that wasn't working out. I even used a boars brush almost everyday to get the dead skin out. About a week before I shaved last time I purchased a highly rated beard wash (Beard Mountaineer), but I guess it was too late for it to work because my beard was too itchy/ had too much dandruff. Whenever I would wear darker shirts I had to shake my shirt off every hour or so because there was too much dandruff. I also know that when you use oil and brush your beard, you're really trying to get at the skin to hydrate it and get dead skin off.

Does anyone have any advice? I really don't know what else to do. I've looked online, other YouTube &amp; subreddits, and it's all the same (Oil once or twice a day, wash once to twice a week, and use a good brush), but it doesn't seem to be working.",1564617848

"Michigan","t5_2qhtl","&gt; Michael Flynn was set up with a perjury trap. Plain and simple.

No. Truth be told the fact that you opened with this tells me that you did not read and understand the Report. The fact that you linked to a summary/opinion of another opinion found on consortiumnews.com is a giant red flag. I'll counter that opinion with an interview with a former federal prosecutor: https://www.npr.org/2018/08/10/637614730/what-is-a-perjury-trap-and-does-it-apply-to-the-special-counsels-investigation

Perjury Trap is a specific defense that can be used during a trial. It means ""a specific legal defense. It's actually related to entrapment, and it's actually an accusation of prosecutorial misconduct. So what it means is that the prosecutor calls you in to testify not because they've got some legitimate investigative reason to have you testify but simply to try to sort of trick you or trap you into some kind of a lie that they could then charge you with.""

An FBI interview is not a prosecution. Flynn was the National Security Advisor and a career military officer. He knew what would happen if he lied to the Federal Government. That is not a perjury trap. No one forced him to ignore the advice of lawyers. He could have had a lawyer. 

You are simply stating conjecture and opinion over the agents involved in the investigation. Are you insinuating that a Republican or a Democratic party member is unable to separate politics from the professionalism of their jobs? That is a very dangerous thought. 

The Campaign knew that foreign interference was illegal. They accepted help and asked for help. Donald J Trump went on national television and asked Russia to ""find missing emails."" Don't write that off as a joke. It is serious. This is our national security and our sovereignty at stake. 

A foreign adversary meddled in our election. They broke our laws and conducted cyber warfare against our nation. Ignoring that not only makes you un-American, but I would equate it to treason. That is not hyperbole. 

Stick to facts. The report contains facts that paint a terrible picture of the campaign and the administration. Justice must prevail. 

&gt;  they could not find enough evidence to charge the President with a crime.

That is not at all what the report said. The report said that due to the OLC memorandum that states a President cannot be indicted by the DOJ a decision could not be reached. However it was important to collect evidence while memories were fresh. 

Again, stick to the facts of the report.",1564617849

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Remember that he has to charge up all these moves for quite a while, so the opponent will see all this from a mile away.  Unless they themselves are stuck in an animation, they can easily avoid Kazapple, it's basically a fully charged smash attack.  You don't see people calling Ganon OP just because people walk into fully charged Fsmashes.

Also, only Kafrizzle can be stored, the other specials are immediately used on the spot.  Unlike Finishing Touch, you can't just release Kazapple whenever you want to, you're stuck in place until you cast it and if you whiff there's a huge punish window.  This also means you can't combo into it, which is huge; it isn't a kill confirm, it's a hard read or shield break punish.

I'm not saying these moves are bad, they're clearly extremely powerful and I'd agree he has maybe a few too many ways to suddenly kill people at low percent.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Thanks for the source! I was also looking into it. That figure is from a Tufts University study that includes both the years of discovery (est. 44.5% of risk adjusted clinical costs) **and** the unrealized forecasted earnings over the period of trial and approval ($1.2b). Also worth noting that it includes the cost of failed drugs that never reach approval.

As you stated, much of the discovery work is done by universities, and much of university R&amp;D is funded by federal subsidies. $100B in NIH funding from 2010-2016, with nearly all FDA approved drugs originating from public research.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Ultimately, I think it's about selfishness.

The reality is that it had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with them, as much as it feels like it's the opposite. Another good way to think about it is that they are betraying themselves, destroying the trust that you gave them, and robbing themselves of being with an awesome person like yourself by being selfish and cheating.

Also, cheating is salacious and interesting and dramatic, so that's why you see it everywhere because nobody is saying things like ""OMG, did you hear that Jennifer's BF Jason has never cheated on her? He had the audacity to stop drinking last night at Mark's party and he said, and I quote 'Thank you, but I've had enough. I don't want to do anything stupid.' when I offered him a shot.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt; There's a woman in Alabama who was arrested for getting shot in the stomach because it killed the fetus.

Absolutely vile. Do you have a source? I'd like to look at it. 


&gt; Every woman in the country was told over the past few years that men can violently rape and sexually assault them and still take vital positions of leadership in the government.

Again, can you back this up with a source? I know that Roy Moore was a pedophile but the voters rejected him. If you're talking about President Trumps locker room recording then that's another matter altogether. There's no way to say this politely but men in locker rooms do talk in ways that would horrify women. That doesn't mean we systematically oppress them though. 

&gt; Women commenting on anything in a public way are routinely threatened with rape and murder, especially if they do so in areas predominantly featuring men. Hell, a 10 year old girl was recently told to flash her non-existent boobs to prove her age.

Again, please be a bit more specific. What exactly occurred? If you're talking about issues like catcalling I'm with you. It's despicable and we need to teach our men to be better. 


&gt; Women are expected to deal with domestic issues and are blamed for any problems in the home, and then are paid less because they focus too much on their families.


It's very true that women do a majority of the domestic chores in homes even today. It's not a true 50/50 split. However the reason why they make less is two fold. Firstly, the total number of hours they work is a lot lower than men. Secondly, women tend to work in areas that are less well paid like STEM. I am all for encouraging more women to join STEM but I don't see that as systematic oppression.

It seems common for parents that lose/abandon/are seriously ill for years to see their children as stuck in the age when they were last parents. On a lot of annoying levels, she sees you as if you were twelve. Part of it might be that she's remembering when you were twelve and taking care of her and is over-parenting a grown-ass adult to make up for it in her head. None of that is right and it's all things that she should be working on, but that might be why she does this. I am so sorry.

You're not crazy for feeling this way. She's trying to control you. She's controlling your spare time, making plans and also telling you that your plans are wrong because they are not her plans. Your food tastes were wrong because they weren't hers. The things you like are wrong because you chose them and not her. She repeats your solutions back to you in a snotty tone as if they were hers because she is the adult (you are, too, but she won't admit that) and you need an adult to tell you these things. She's horrible. She probably doesn't mean to be, but that doesn't give her the right to be horrible for the next half century.

You're going to have to set up boundaries and that's going to be hard. It can help to have scripts, a few sentences you've prepared in advance. ""Mom, I just told you that. You do that a lot, repeat what I am going to  do but say it all snarky, like I'm too dumb to think up what I thought up."" ""Mom, different from you is not wrong, it is just different from you."" ""You made plans without me. That means you made plans to be without me.""

She's going to be angry. She needs you to be twelve, forever, so she doesn't have to deal with her own baggage. This is a woman that didn't feed you lunch for weeks because you didn't like the same food and then went back to giving you the food she knew you didn't like. She's stubborn and unkind.

"ynab","t5_2vqaa","3rd paychecks - I've recently decided to convert my 3rd paychecks entirely to twelve month DI.  Previously the entire amount was going to retirement savings.  But juggling the math to convert 13 months of income into 12 months (26 pay periods vs 24) and squaring that with my auto deducted 401k, HSA, IRA, etc become way to much of annoyance as I was having to fiddle with my paycheck contributions during the year.  It's just much easier to divide all those annual contributions by 26 and set it and forget it.  What ever is left of those 3rd paychecks after retirement deductions just gets DI'd and distributed out over the following year.  DI also pads your number of months you can go without a paycheck BUT it also means that your real income after your emergency ends will be lower and you may have to adjust your budget.",1564617855

"ClimbersCourt","t5_j0645","I don't believe it's ever given explicitly - just vaguely related to other people.


Some various comments I remember:

There was a Minotaur that was 'a good 10ft tall, almost twice Corin's height' so we have a lower bound of 5ft. Not that helpful.

When Corin first saw Marissa in Teft's Dueling class (from a distance) she appeared abnormally tall, and he couldn't determine if she was just as tall as him, or perhaps a bit taller.

Corin was also about the same height as Sheridan Theas, but since we don't have a good grasp on their sex, it's hard to estimate their height - unless someone can find a passage that gives a better indication of Sheridan's height explicitly.

So assuming the people in AA universe are of more 'western world' average height and not 'Best Korea' malnourished levels of height, an average girl is probably 5'2"" to 5'7"".  So for Marissa to be noticeably, significantly taller at a distance puts her at something like 5'10"" to 6ft.  Which is probably the range Corin is in.

Tristan is noted to be remarkably tall - even taller than their dad at age 14 when he still hadn't yet finished growing.  And he comments to Corin about how Corin was 'always jealous of his height'.  So Tristian is likely somewhere in the 6'2"" to 6'6"" height range.  Which puts an upper bound on where Corin is, as he must be shorter.


So, not ridiculously tall, but not short either.  As tall as a really tall girl.  Shorter than a basketball player.  5'9"" to 6' is my estimate for his overall height.


*side note:* There was a comparison to the shoulder of a golem (Spire Guardian), fallen on its side, being as tall as Corin in SAM.  Corin says this statue ""must have been thirty feet tall."" But given normal human shoulder-to-height body proportions... that would place the shoulder width, and thus Corin's height, at about 7.5 or 8 feet.  So either this statue had *incredibly* weak shoulders... or Corin *might* be exaggerating his stories *just* a tad. *(""I swear, it was thisssss tall!"")*",1564617855

Just play ranked until you get to the one you want, then stop. Unless you’re winning 75% of your matches you won’t see any movement. Plus people try to cheese you so hard on there that it’s only viable training against those specific cheeses. Casual killers are much more engaging and educational to fight against imo.

"criticalrole","t5_385bw","Well I think that participating as a player in the scripting of the plot may seem like it'll ruin all the mistery, but in fact it helps to make the plot thicker. Having an off game private chat with the DM from time to time about what your character expects, fears or plans, gives him solid elements to mix with the main plot for the campaing. 
Think that it won't be only you doing this, the rest of the players could do it also, making the main plot even richer and with lots of plot twists.
But of course you're not like a co-writer, don't try to make things happen as you want them, the DM should be the one deciding if your suggestions fit into his world and when.
Also a tip for this to work even better would be to be absolutely silent about these chats to the rest of the party. They should never know in advance things about your character.

Cotinis mutabilis, also known as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), is a member of the scarab beetle family. It belongs to the subfamily Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green June beetles (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US.Figeater beetle larvae, commonly called ""crawly backs"", roll on their backs and propel themselves upsidedown.

Yes it sounds like 'free money' or a 'free 25% returns'.  But the way that RRSPs work is that you pay income tax at withdrawal, and the added income then may well reduce your benefits under other programs.  So if you save in a TFSA account personally ........     
$1000 wages saved today     
less 25% tax rate at bottom bracket = $750 net invested.    
Double your money over time = **$1,500**     
 
Or use this group RRSP ......        
$1,000 wages saved personally.      
25% extra added by ompany = $1250 invested     
Double your money over tiem = $2,500

"catfish","t5_2uo4e","Hi there :).  I'm pretty sure we might be the same person, lol.  Was similarly roped in by crazy ass sob stories.  Also on League of Legends.  Also had the rug pulled out from under me.  I've also had my struggled with depression and suicide, making me more empathetic to him.  Mine took things a step farther and became a big part of my real life.  His name was (mostly) real, his pictures were real...but literally everything else.of substance turned out to be a lie.  And I ended up in a 5 year nightmare of sociopathic manipulation and abuse.  Our end results were very different but I imagine the pain is pretty relatable.

You also write pretty similarly to me, hahaha.  I too tend to go on endlessly when I really get into something on here XD.

If you ever need someone to talk to, or just someone to game with that kind of gets what you're going through, lemme know :).

Edit: Seriously, was suuupppppeerr into League when I had the time to be.  I've got a tattoo of Leona's crest, hahaha.  These days I play Mobile Legends just due to convenience and time constraints.

So I point out to you that Sanders is *NOT* socialist and that he advocates for the Nordic economic model and your response is to post a video explaining that Sweden isn't a socialist paradise because they're not socialist? No shit, that's what I was just trying to point out to you! I'm a capitalist, I own a small business. I'm also a social democrat, because social democrats aren't socialist. Why do you think Nordic countries are ""much more homogenous when it comes to class""? It's because of their social democratic policies! You are usuing really silly circular logic there lol

UBI isn't socialism either. I think you need to learn what socialism is.

The right-wing media will call any Democratic candidate a socialist.  They called Obama a socialist and he's a moderate Democrat (even though he campaigned as a progressive in 2008). Hell, McConnel said that granting Puerto Rico statehood (keep in mind the Puerto Ricans are US citizens) would be ""full bore socialism"". What does statehood and representation for citizens have to do with public ownership of the means of production? ""Socialism"" in America is nothing more than a right-wing boogeyman and you have fallen for the horror stories.

Also, when we make the discussion  about *policy* it becomes pretty clear that [the American populace is left wing](https://prospect.org/article/most-americans-are-liberal-even-if-they-don%E2%80%99t-know-it). I'm pretty sure the GOP primarily survives due to the abortion issue.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","This is spot on, I really think Coloring Book gets a lot of hate because (A) it just wasn’t as good as Acid Rap and (B) it broke into mainstream appeal more than Acid Rap, garnering a lot of annoying fans. I think remembering that (C) it had *trash* mixing is important too. The true gems on the album overcome this, but it hurts the replayability of the album a lot.

Despite all this, the album at least had some salient themes (Chance has mostly resolved his relationship with god, his relationship with the Chicago is changing, he has a daughter he really cares for despite being young himself). These themes are rewarding because they pick up on themes from Acid Rap and 10 Day, so even if Chance isn’t changing how people want him to, it feels like themes either resolved or became more complex. Something changed, we understand Chance better.

TBD had the chance (no pun intended) to do this and absolutely missed. The most obvious themes Chance needed to touch on were the classic “not falling off now that you’ve made it” and “what might be actually tough about marriage/family life” because he already explored the comforting parts of family life in Coloring book enough. Now it sucks because we have to wait three or four more years to get an update on Chance’s life again, and he probably won’t convey his life any better.",1564617861

It’s also not just about cringe shit, it’s not roasting them the whole time. 

The people he is filming tell the stories themselves and it’s great. It gives perspective on who these people are, and humanizes what most of us would just watch and cringe at, never wondering WHY they are making these videos, or not understanding why.

We don’t really know what state NATO is in, and given the fact that The US has been all but wiped off the map it’s not certain that it’s in good shape at all— both in terms of the alliance itself, and it’s strength as a military power. The United States makes up the bulk of NATO’s military strength and, as I understand it, much of that strength has ended up in the hands of Gilead.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Partners will receive the September security patches around August 5th. Nothing beyond the embargo stops me from making a release within 24 hours by integrating them, building it and going through the standard testing procedures. The same goes for other vendors without a messed up security process, although 72 hours is a more realistic number. It's not permitted to leak these the patches as either source or binary in advance. Also, since some of them are for the kernel, it's a GPL violation to ship binary patches without making the sources available. Intentionally delaying that doesn't meet the requirements. So, do you also want me to talk about how there's a GPL violation going on here?

The patches are the primary thing covered by the embargo... CVE numbers, severity levels and the bug class aren't particularly sensitive information. It doesn't make sense to claim that only those are covered by the embargo, but not the actual patches showing specifically what was fixed and where.

Dahan, a Skitarii leader of the Mechanicus, was shown to be fractionally faster than an Astartes (although he still lost to the Space Marine). 

Custodes, by comparison, make Astartes look like they move in slow motion.

So a seasoned top leader of the Skitarii lost to a Black Templar recruit. Imagine what a Custodes would have done to him.

On the tabletop, the Man of Iron robot from Blackstone Fortress has a stat line about comparable to a regular Custodes. It's not a perfect comparison of course, since it's unlikely he's using DaOT weapons, but he's not head and shoulders above an average golden boi either. 

This has various assumptions built in, like a Custodes being close to a Man of Gold (who knows), and the Man of Iron described not being something horribly basic like a souped up servitor. But it's worth pointing out.",1564617865

Feel free to judge me, but the only people above my cats are, in this order, my younger brother, my parents, my close family (1st cousins, aunts, uncles, etc), and probably my closest friends, which are only 2 or 3 people. 

Call me insane, call me a sociopath, but I will put the lives of things that make me happy and cherish life above the lives of others. Why you ask? Simply because I don't trust others, I have been deceived by them many times, and I simply don't really care. 

I'm selfish and I don't have any problem with admiting it, I live for my hapiness, and that hapiness comes from the hapiness and safety of those who are close to me, who I love, and love me back. 

My cats have helped me more when I was going through rough times than my friends have ever helped. 

And tbh, humanity is doomed if it doesn't change soon, so I'll just enjoy the ride with the ones I love before I care about those who I don't even know or care about. 

Altough, if I had to sacrifice my life or the life of those I love for the ENTIRE humanity, then yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind, as long as I would be the one to end the life of another person. 

I think it all comes down to numbers too, not gonna save Billy if I can save my brother, but if Billy need to be alive for an entire country to survive, well, at least let me say goodbye.

"GreenBayPackers","t5_2qqd2","I personally agree, but look around the subreddit some time. There's people saying stuff like ""Kumerow has shown more than Moore, Davis, and EQ"" so far. 

Were you here last year around cut downs? Kumerow is the new Jeff Janis except he's worse than Janis on special teams. People want him to succeed because he played college ball in Wisconsin. It was like Jared Abbrederis several years ago where a big group of people gave him way more credit than he deserved because he was from UW. 

And Kumerow actually made the team last year. So if/when he gets cut there's going to be a lot of people bitching, and especially if Davis makes it and he doesn't. It seems highly unlikely we keep more than 6 and Adams, GMo, MVS, and EQ are going to be #1-4. That leaves 3 guys, Kumerow, Davis, and Moore competing for 2 spots including with guys like Shepherd who they brought in for returns and Lazard who keeps getting brought back for camps. But if they do something like Moore Davis or Moore Shepherd then there's gonna be quite a few people in here bitching about it. 

Definitely doesn't help that Kumerow has been praised by Rodgers and so that's used to justify their view that he's better. Moore sucked ass last year and if he sucks ass this preseason people won't want to keep him around just because he's a 4th rounder. Look at Carl Bradford, that guy got way too many chances just because he was a pick. Arguably the same thing for Davis. Several people have given up on the ""he's a draft pick so he stays"" idea for anyone 4th round or later.",1564617866

"MUAontheCheap","t5_3m2bs","Off the top of my head, mostly Vitamin C serums have been my most expensive purchases.

**Worth it:**

* [Skinceuticals C+E Ferrulic $166](https://www.dermstore.com/product_C+E+Ferulic_5230.htm) \-- Love this! Brightens my skin, got rid of some discoloration, and makes my skin smooth. Only caveat: Not sure it reduced fine lines and wrinkles.
* [Sunday Riley Good Genes $105](https://www.dermstore.com/product_GOOD+GENES+AllInOne+Lactic+Acid+Treatment_40133.htm?keyword=sunday%20riley%20good%20genes%20all-in-one%20lactic%20acid%20treatment) \-- Got this in the Target beauty box for cheap. I love this product as well. Gives a brightness to my skin, it feels smoother as well.

I noticed a big difference when I stopped using these products (independently of each other).

&amp;#x200B;

**Not worth it to me:**

* [Peter Thomas Roth Potent C Power Serum $95](https://www.sephora.com/product/potent-c-power-serum-P428100) \-- Too oily for my skin. I didn't like the texture and feel of it.
* [Drunk Elephant C-Firma $80](https://www.sephora.com/product/c-firma-day-serum-P400259?icid2=products%20grid:p400259:product) \-- Oxidized quickly, didn't notice a big difference with regular use.
* [Sunday Riley CEO Glow Vitamin C Oil $80](https://www.sephora.com/product/c-e-o-glow-vitamin-c-turmeric-face-oil-P442761?icid2=products%20grid:p442761&amp;skuId=2213528) \-- Too oily for my skin. Trying to use it up, but I'm going to try and use it during the winter.

I didn't pay full price on any of these vitamin C serums, I always tracked down a code and waited for a sale (20-30% off). I would only consider repurchasing the Skinceuticals one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Products I received for free from Influenster and liked:**

* [Lancôme Genefique $105](https://www.sephora.com/product/advanced-genifique-youth-activating-serum-P379510?icid2=products%20grid:p379510:product) \-- Lightweight texture, smooths and brightens skin. I didn't notice reduction in wrinkles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Products I received for free from Influenster and didn't like:**

* [Clarins Double Serum $89](https://www.sephora.com/product/double-serum-complete-age-control-concentrate-P421235) \-- Too oily for me. I remember it smelled great though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Samples:**

* [Fresh Rose Face Mask $62](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-face-mask-P12336) \-- Love the way this feels and feels on the skin, but for that heftly price tag, I have not purchased it yet. Did feel moisturizing to me, but I have combo skin.
* [SK-II Essence $99](https://www.sephora.com/product/facial-treatment-essence-P375849?icid2=products%20grid:p375849:product&amp;skuId=1448612) (for the mini size) -- I didn't like this as much as [Missha FTE.](https://sokoglam.com/products/missha-time-revolution-first-treatment-essence-intensive-moist) Plus I've found other cheaper products that I like just as much like the [Hada Labo Gokujyun Light Lotion.](http://hadalabousa.com/products/moisturizing/)",1564617866
"deeptown","t5_3hzoe","Both have their value and both have to be considered. Since you can choose what to mine, the price/time is important. If you have more raw resources than can be processed, the profit/time gets more important. Both values are pretty much the same and active players are mining much faster and therefore we only look at profit/time.

Also the markup is extreme, 90%+ so selling raw materials isn't even considered and I guess that's why you started the whole price/time idea. But it's also the reason why the values are the same and it doesn't matter anyway.",1564617866

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","Accidents also happen when there’s an outlier in traffic behavior, driving below the speed limit can be considered safer in most situations but in some they’re extremely dangerous. 


For example, slow speeds on highway entrance ramps (I’ve been stuck behind vehicles doing 25 attempting to merge into traffic on a highway going 55+, as well as had vehicles full on stop in front of me at the end of the entrance.) Another example would be on the highway, I’ve seen too many videos of compact cars being demolished by lifted trucks going 70. Not pretty. 


Let me say this: if you’re uncomfortable doing the speed limit, you better be in the right lane. 


And to those stuck behind slow moving vehicles: if you notice a line of cars building up behind you, safely pass the slow moving vehicle. If you don’t pass you just make the problem worse (instead of passing one car to continue at the speed limit, the car behind you would have to pass two, making it more dangerous and possibly illegal to pass).


I’d rather be late then dead, but don’t mistake going slow for being safe. Different situations require different speeds.

It came as a surprise to me. Bruce changed my life and I have been following him closely for years. I trusted him. Met him several times and felt he was a genuine person.

I also enjoyed being able to watch his interviews and just by reading between the lines and listening to what he said, I was able to know what he meant and where Canopy was headed. Being able to trust management is a huge factor for me when I invest and I feel I could trust him 100%. He is a CEO who in my opinion, delivered on most, if not all of his promises.

I knew the moment Constellations came in that a day would come where Bruce would no longer be at the helm. I just did not expect it to be so soon. I still wish they had given him at least another year or two to continue being aggressive. I would have liked to see Bruce get a chance deliver his vision of what Canopy should be on the medical side and in the United States.

With that being said. I also have lots of faith in STZ. One look at their stock chart tells me what I need to know about how they runs things. I firmly believe Canopy ended up where they are today because of how aggressive Bruce was and I think he did a great job building and establishing a dominant company in a new sector. Although they may have been a tad too quick, I think Constellations and the board felt it was time to stop being aggressive and they wanted to take over and turn Canopy into the well run sector leader they are capable of being. They probably felt it was time to start showing results and Bruce wanted to continue being aggressive for at least a few more quarters. 

I am holding tight. I still believe the Canopy will continue to hold their top spot as the sector leader in this multi billion dollar industry for the foreseeable future. I am hoping to hear some clarity from the board and STZ in 2 weeks on their earnings call, as I feel they have been very quiet since Bruce was let go. 

Best of luck to you.",1564617867

"xmrtrader","t5_3f5wu","Well I was going to say. 

Those communities routinely focus on economic matters such as  interest rates, and the impact such things will have on the price and adoption on their respective cryptocurrencies.

The Monero community on the other hand has an alarming aversion... or even maybe ignorance, surrounding the importance of such economic metrics and the corresponding relevant current events. 

You don't see any such talk on the main monero sub or here either, and this is not a good thing. Fed just lowered the interest rates today, so discuss it.......

If it's not a central tenant of the discourse, then why should anybody associate interest rates with Monero being a safe haven asset?

It's all ""tech tech tech tech"" here, but the message behind why we are building the tech in the first place can often be very weak from the financial perspective.

""The don't buy monero, use it"" mantra is a super cringe worthy example. I mean really? If it's not a pysop, then this community has a long way to go.

r/bitcoin often has a bit of a ""wallstreet"" vibe to it, which is good, because we're discussing money here. Monero literally means money in esperanto.",1564617869

While I'm defensive at times I'm genuinely interested in changing my opinions when I find good foundation for it. They smelled challenge but weren't able to engage in it.

There seemed like an awful lot of fear in the conversation with my brother. He spent a lot of time in earlier conversations warning me to be careful in the small Ontario City he lives in.

My dad and his blurb about climate change seemed to be driven by fear at it's core. I wondered if it is comforting to believe that it isn't happening for him. It scares me, so I wondered if I was also driven by fear in this case.

I think the scariest bit is the lack of commitment to a shared external reality and working out what that is together. It would be much more same if we were different in our understanding of the world due to a difference in personal values. For example, if they cared more about those close to them than to a larger humanity, or some other similar difference of values.",1564617870

Furthermore, gun control =\= banning guns, and providing regulations on firearms isn’t inherently anymore authoritarian than regulating any dangerous item.

The best reason I can think of is 'you will have judges deciding what is true' like in the US abortion is a large issue and someone putting up a sign that said life begins at conception being taken to court as a liar (or the reverse which is more likely really) but I don't think that's an issue because its not really a legal question (as usually stated) its a religious one and, at least in the US, thats not something the courts will touch.

Otherwise this is a strictly factual question, do that much money actually leave the country every week to go to EU? (and are there other relevant factors related like does Britian actually receive more money than it sends) if the answer is no than Boris is guilt of misleading the public and should face, at least a fine, probably jail time. 

I suppose there is also a free speech argument to be made like 'doesn't Boris have the right to simply lie if he wants to' to which the answer is ... no he is a public figure if he wants to have that right he can't be an elected official then he can lie all he wants.",1564617872

I fall asleep at night dreaming of her holding a personal concert for me, and then she would be sorry tired that she comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold her hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on her ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans she would let out. Then, I would hug her while she clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as she moans louder and louder.

I would give up almost anything just for her to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of her. When I wake up, Dark Willow is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on her. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to her beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of her and living a happy life together. Dark Willow is my pride, passion, and joy.

I wish for nothing but her happiness. If it were for Dark Willow, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without her, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Dark Willow.

Since HRT I've not had a single headache and my head always feels clear. It's like a difference between a head full of gravel and a clear mountain stream. That has to be a physical change.

"wholesomememes","t5_3gcwj","&gt;Perhaps read up on all the ways society is focused and serviced to men over women. You might learn something.

Jesus Christ lol. I made a point that men are better soccer players than women. It's a fact, and it's well documented. Even you agree that men are stronger and faster, which means the women literally couldn't keep up with the men. 

I understand that there are a myriad of ways in which society focuses more on men's biological strength, but that wasn't the point of this discussion. The point you made was that women are better soccer players and since the point of soccer is to score more goals than your opponent that means that if what you said was correct that woman's teams would beat men's teams. Which doesn't ever happen. 

I don't know why you would pick this hill to die on when it's so easy to refute, and I don't know where you got the idea that since I accept that men are the better of the sexes at soccer that means I dislike or don't understand the plight of women. 


&gt;&gt;and why aren't men allowed in the women's league
&gt;
&gt;Probably because of the drama guys bring to the field.

Let's make an equally bizarre assumption as you just did and assume that is the reason.

You ignored the point that women don't play in the ""mens"" leagues when no rule precludes them from doing so, the owners want the teams to win, and as you're stating women are the better players.

Do you really think the American women's national team would beat the French men's national team? Are you seriously that far removed from reality?",1564617874

There is more to dating than just looks, looks don’t determine your value as a person by self care and showing world that you put effort into your body and how you look is important imo. There are plenty of women who’ve I’ve met who aren’t exactly the best looking but they are definitely great possible partners. 

I kind of disagree with your statement of “people are just inherently evil”, I think there are some evil people but I’d say the majority of people are decent regular people who have their own problems and own things about them make them unique. 

I went to the gym for both, I want people to find me attractive and desirable, I know that kind sound sorta sad but that’s just me and a ton of other people as.

With a small-scale graphical change by Jagex, the question of whether or not the old-school aesthetic is maintained is still a subjective opinion.  
  
However, adding features like highlighting and timers not only changes the aesthetic of the game, but also the core gameplay of osrs.  
  
Agility goes from learning the layout of a course to simply clicking the big green boxes.

You should mulligan pretty aggressively IMO, especially with London Mulligan. Going down a card for velocity is often a worthwhile trade.

re: Etron - 
Matchup is pretty tricky now that Karn exists, I like boarding in 2 Dismember and 2 Claim. You sorta just wanna all in them early with a 6+ toughness Inkmoth and hope they don't Ghost Quarter you.

Metering devices are at the outdoor unit. 

I would say the answer lies somewhere in the size of the lineset, but if I'm not mistaken the 6 and the 9kbtu use the same size line set. 3/8th and 1/4th. The outdoor unit cant tell the difference between a 6 or the 9 from the port its connected to. The communication wire may have some frequency at which it operates that let's it know that a 9kbtu unit is connected to port 3 as an example, and manages the metering device accordingly. 

Having been in the guts of these things it's not more evap surface, so it has to be the amount of refrigerant that's going through the system, so it has to be some combo of metering device/pipe diameters. 

Would love to hear an engineer actually explain it though",1564617878

Source? I would be willing to bet in a bear there are just as many companies that still chug along as usual and decrease by less than a company that decreased but gave a dividend.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","I don't even have an issue with calling it Lumberjack because it has a traditional nature to it. However as you said if you are going to change the name change it to something more contemporary. 

I don't know how the WWF was so in tune with pop culture from 98 to 01 when it was mostly older white dudes doing the booking. Russo was well into his 30's and his filter McMahon was in his 50's. 

That's not to say that WWE has never been ahead on things. The WWE Network and NXT Are pretty forward thinking ideas. Even their social/digital strategy has been decently with the times. 

However WWE's creative product and presentation has either been chasing the past or going in a direction that is not very contemporary.",1564617882

The negativity that comes with that is truly life destroying. Just today I called into work and lied that I had a doctors appointment because I was so tired and so sad. I want to say I cried in my bed all morning but I’m too empty to cry. The tears don’t flow most of the time because when you live in a constant state of sadness your body tries to become numb to it by dulling all your senses. Colors lose there pop and everything becomes duller. Music that I love doesn’t elicit anything inside me. No emotion, sound, or sight can overwhelm the voice inside my head. The happiest events don’t do anything but raise me to feeling just slightly like a terrible person. I truly cannot understand what people see as worthwhile in life. I still love certain things like skiing, boating, and mountain biking but the effort involved makes it not even worth it. I wish I could explain how tired I am.

I think he just basically said a current sitting President can be indicted after one leaves office.  Not that Trump, specifically, was indictable after he leaves office.  

Mueller went to great lengths to clarify that he did not have the authority to say if anything Trump did was indictable.  He did, however, clarify that gathering evidence was difficult due to the constant lying by witnesses that were interviewed, and with said evidence the special counsel was not able to exonerate Trump.

It's so easy to read between those lines.  Mr. Mueller stayed legally tight and said all that needed to be said that SHOULD get the ball rolling.",1564617884

"antiMLM","t5_2swge","Starvation mode is not real. Your body can not magically create and store energy (fat) out of nothing. There has to be a caloric surplus to gain weight. Same thing with medication- yeah, medications can give you the munchies, but you’re not going to gain weight unless you’ve consumed more calories than you’ve burned.

There is a ridiculous amount of misinformation floating around out there about weight loss. And it makes sense- if the public were given solutions that actually work, then the weight loss industry would be losing customers. They want you to fail. If anybody has any questions about weight loss you can feel free to PM me. I lost 50lbs two years ago and I’ve kept it off. There are no products, no special foods, no memberships needed. Hell, I didn’t even exercise. It’s literally just calories in vs calories out. I don’t even have any special knowledge to share besides if you want some help figuring out how many calories you should aim for daily, and how to properly read nutrition info on products. (Which can also just be figured out with some googling)

My #1 piece of advice is to just completely forget any “rules of thumb” you’ve ever heard about losing weight or how to eat. How often you should eat, what food groups you should eat, all of it. Anything that is not calories in &lt; calories out can be totally forgotten. When it comes to being healthy all over, yes, there are certain vitamins and nutrients you need that you’ll get from certain foods. But when it comes to losing weight, if that’s your only goal, you can accomplish it by eating only Twinkie’s if you still ate at a caloric deficit (which would be not many twinkies per day. Which is why it’s recommended to eat more filling things like veggies.)",1564617884

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It really depends on the gun/round.  To completely oversimplify, faster moving bullets penetrate better than slow ones, barrel length has a significant impact on velocity, and bullet shape/type can also have an effect on penetration.

So maybe (I haven't tried this) a larger, but slower bullet fired from a pistol (say a .45 ACP) that moves more slowly than a .22, and is being fired from a short barrel handgun(thus even less velocity) will transfer a lot more energy to a target (hit harder), but may not penetrate as well.  

In that case, a phone book might stop the bullet, but it would probably still transfer a lot of energy to the wearer, but over the larger surface area provided by the phone book.  It would still suck, but it might not poke a hole in your guts.

tl;dr -  A phone book might stop some bullets from some guns, but don't try it.",1564617884

Not just racists but white supremacists. Also we should recognize that white supremacy goes beyond the color of your skin or nationality and you can act towards fufilling a white supremacist agenda, and self-hatred would be as secondary question(although they can play a role).

And I've also noticed that as of recent the movement has allowed itself to get slightlt confused on the question of white supremacy. The violent white supremacists are not an abberration of the society we live in but are the logical conclusion.",1564617884

She took care of him, loved him, supported him, she was his mom in all but blood. And people seem to forget this and post all sorts of irondad posts like Tony adopted Peter off the street or something. No Tony was his mentor and he was not always there for him unlike May.

He blew Peter off a lot, didn't show him any real affection until Endgame and didn't really make any effort to contact Peter after he turned down the Iron Spider suit (I'm pretty sure it was implied when they met up in IW that was the first time post Homecoming they saw each other.) 

Now they obviously cared about each other and all, but we shouldn't equate a mentor figure with a parental one. Tony was a father but to Morgan not Peter. He never said I love you tons/3000 to Peter nor did he leave a recording for him. But he did for Morgan because Morgan is his child not Peter. And after his death Peter seems to consider Pepper more as a family friend than anything else. So it really doesn't surprise me that he doesn't become a ""Big brother"" to Morgan (not to mention he'd be a complete stranger to her considering he didn't exist for her whole life up until 8 months ago.)",1564617885

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Unfortunately, we know very little about the usage of ice in the ancient Near East. Virtually all of our sources come from sites in Syria and northern Iraq in the early 2nd millennium BCE. 

In a letter from King Aqba-Ahum to his wife Iltani (contemporaries of Hammurabi of Babylon, 18th century BCE), the king gives permission for the queen to access his ice-house.

&gt;The ice-house of Qattara should be unsealed, so that the goddess, you, and Belassunu (Iltani's sister), can drink from it as needed. But the ice must remain under guard!

In a contemporary letter from Mari, a site in modern Syria, we learn that ice was collected from water poured in trenches and left to freeze during the winter.

&gt;On collecting ice about which my lord wrote to me, at dusk I sent a work detail of commoners and artisans to collect ice. In trenches that were filled with water, I was able to collect about 3 tracts (3600 quarts) of ice. In the pasture area, the ice had not yet congealed, but it was so in the trenches.

Once the ice was collected, it was stored in ice-houses that kept the ice cool even in the summer. Zimri-Lim of Mari constructed an ice-house in Terqa, Syria, in addition to the ice-houses known elsewhere in Mari and Saggaratam.

&gt;Zimri-Lim, son of Yahdun-Lim, King of Mari, Tuttul, and the land of the nomads, maker of a storehouse for ice, that no king since time immemorial had built on the bank of the Euphrates, to which I had ice of... transported, building a storehouse in Terqa, a city the god Dagan loves.

No ice-houses from the Bronze Age have been found, but they likely resembled the [yakhchāls](https://www.maxfordham.com/assets/media/images/MAX%20R%20and%20I/ice%20making%20diagram%20(smaller\).png) of Iran.",1564617887

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have Borderline Personality Disorder, but I didn't know I had it at the time. Was diagnosed not long after I ended the relationship for the third time. 

Half the time I was lovely, the other half I was too intense, paranoid, sometimes downright hurtful - I would accuse her of cheating or conspiring against me when the only reason I had to believe she would do those things is because I pushed her towards it. She never did.

I would end things because I thought it was best for her, or I thought it was best for me, or both of us. I would be hot and cold constantly, where one day I'd be the picture of infatuation, the next I'd be obsessive and intense, and the next I'd be distant to counteract how crazy I was being.

The amount I made that sweet, lovely girl cry destroys me, the amount I fear I changed her and made her more callous to the world when she never needed to be had it not been for my actions. 

I never physically harmed her, but the emotional abuse, however unintentional, will haunt me always. 

Meeting her was my biggest regret; I fell so deeply in love, but I felt I destroyed the best person I ever met to learn lessons I could have learnt just with time. Neither of us has to learn that hard.

I'm much better in myself now, I don't know how she is. I hope she's well, but we have no contact anymore, and I think it's best I leave her well alone. I think about it a lot.",1564617887

Alonso talked bad about Honda consistently as well... although understandably since they started back in F1 with a very unreliable record.  But in the end it’s never a good idea to talk bad about a major sponsor, as it can hurt your chance at future ones.

Honda moved on to supply the two Red Bull teams with great results so far, and have shown to be extremely reliable... leading many to believe it was either McLaren’s lack of patience, or chassis restrictions imposed on the engine layout that were limiting Honda engines.

Fast forward to today, where the easiest path for McLaren to enter smoothly into IndyCar would be with a Honda engine... if Honda would abide.",1564617890

This went on for several months, until it got to where I couldn't shake the feeling back into my right arm one morning.  Through out the next few weeks it would take 20 or 30 minutes before the feeling would come back.  It was at this point that I scheduled a doctor appointment but it took a couple weeks to get in, and by then, my whole right side was numb, and it was getting hard to walk.

After starting hormone therapy with Levothyroxine, the symptoms went away fairly rapidly, but never quite completely.  my fingertips, toes, and right side of my face still feel like that last hour before the Novocain completely wears off after a dentist visit.

Like, she asked what she did, and what she did was come over during your time away from the baby when he's resting and that makes things harder, so you don't feel up to doing the extra work involved in not having that time. 
If she would like to visit while the baby is awake, or help you do whatever chores you've got lined up for that time, then you'd be more able to accommodate her visiting.

 In more technical terms, this is is what actually happens to the capacitor...in the simplest of terms.  Think of an electrolytic capacitors as a battery.  They are designed to store a charge and release that charge depending on the specific requirements of the circuit.  Inside the capacitor there are two metal plates with dielectric material between them, wrapped in paper, filled with acid (electrolyte), and sealed in its housing or 'canister'.  What happens is the flawed electrolyte prematurely deteriorates and dries up.  When this happens the capacitance value changes, becomes erratic, and can even short completely, which obviously causes the circuit to malfunction.  On your motherboard, this results in system instabilities or complete failure of your board.



since the guy is going out of business, may not be a good place to get parts or repair anymore, but hey, who knows.

but yeah, I think that either way, it will be an issue when you are dealing with things this old, even the good stuff will need to be recapped if they are not solid (and on these old boards, its not a easy swap / upgrade).",1564617896

"news","t5_2qh3l","Firstly, how the fuck is this not negligence? A man is dead and only because they didn't take the situation seriously at all, ie. didn't value human life because they're sociopathic/compassionless pricks.

Secondly, you're right from a legal sense, but from a moral / justice sense, do you see how much unilateral power this gives cops? They don't have to take the lives/safety of other seriously bendy they know where are no consequences.

This man didn't fight back. He cooperated. He pleaded for his life. He told them he couldn't breathe and that they were killing him. They didn't once, in several minutes, take their weight off him even slightly to see if he is ok, let alone fucking alive. This is willful killing, whether they set out specifically to kill him or not doesn't matter from a moral standpoint because this is so grossly negligent that it's tantamount to murder, or at least manslaughter.

Any civilian now, innocent or not, cooperative or not, can be restrained in a similar fashion and killed by a bunch of careless pieces of shit who know they'll get off scot-free. I mean the fash cop from Arizona, Philip Brailsford, literally executed a man in a hotel hallway after screaming impossible-to-follow orders at the victim and telling him he's gonna die, after the victim was on his hands and knees crawling to him with tears and terror in his eyes, and who also had ""YOU'RE FUCKED"" etched into his assault rifle, got off scot-free himself. I encourage everyone to look into the Eric Garner case. It's very similar to this one, where a group of like 10 cops killed an innocent black man by suffocation who was no threat to them, all caught on video. All police got away with it.

The parameters for incompetence / negligence of police are grossly unjust. We are talking about the lives of human beings. We are talking about the state's monopoly of force and violence, in the ability to kill, here. A single death is far too many. I know it's a job that demands quick thinking, but 99.9% of the time these deaths are tantamount to executions due to racism, prejudice (they don't care if this person suffering from mental illness lives or dies), wanton abuse of authority / flexing the big tough guy bravado, etc. Very, very rarely do cops kill anyone Bernays they absolutely have to. Being a cop is not a dangerous job. It's literally more dangerous being a teacher. Fuck cops.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

You may be disappointed at how little engineering to do compared to hands on work, but you can fit it in sometimes. If you go to a shop, you are best off if you either serve a need they have difficulty filling, or if you can get into their workflow and be independent. For example if you're not competent at MIG and TIG welding, don't go to a welding shop unless they need something you're good at, like machining.

Most places it is considered a negligent act on the tenants part not to report something they know is going on which is that serious.

The ""answer"" is misleading at first glance. Look at it carefully and you see that it does not indicate that common law states puberty = adulthood. It seems to indicate that under common law, puberty is presumed to occur at those ages for boys and girls. The adulthood part doesn't reference common law, just a general public cultural consensus.

What this would mean, is if there were a court case where the age of puberty were relevant, precedent cases would allow lawyers to use that legal precedent to legally assume puberty occurred at those ages.

However, since it's common law, a well argued case and a different judge's opinion could overturn, or challenge the legal presumption, creating a new precedent for future cases to use as ""common law""",1564617900

One thing with freelancing that many (including myself) struggle with continuously, freelancing is all about selling yourself. You need to make yourself stand out as the man for the job. You won't hire the person that says ""I believe I might be up for the task, would you be willing to accept $X? If not, then please let me know what you are willing to pay me. Thank you in advance. Hope to hear from you soon. Kind Regards.""

if compared next to the guy who says ""I'm the man for the job because of X,Y,Z reasons. My going rate is $X. When shall we setup an appointment to discuss this further? Kind Regards.""  

Think logically if you were to hire someone, present yourself with a couple of imaginary CVs and just think for yourself which you would choose. It'll almost always be the assertive, confident guy who asks for a little bit more because it makes you think he knows what he's doing.",1564617901

"nagatoro","t5_8irqa","Femdom can absolutely be pure love, but I think that you don't understand what ""vanilla"" means in this context.  Vanilla [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Vanilla+sex](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Vanilla+sex)  sex is generally defined as socially acceptable, conservative, ""normal"" sex, ie heterosexual, monogamous, maledom-but-not-too-kinky-or-rough-on-the-woman sex. Just generic forms of a guy putting his penis on a single woman in what is considered a generally dominant way. That's how I define vanilla, anyway.

  
Femdom is not normal, nor socially acceptable in conservative circles, and most people call it ""kinky"", so it is certainly not ""vanilla"".

I am not saying that makes it bad (it's one of my main fetishes actually), I'm just saying that you're using the term ""vanilla"" wrong.",1564617901

In speaking of ""moderation"" you said:
&gt;which is something the left and the right can agree is not what people want

What?! I think if anything when people who aren't in the far ends of the political spectrum (most people) look at our current dysfunctional partisan system, they want our leaders to find common ground, compromise and get shit done. In this climate, I think the actual ""hard to achieve"" goal is to reach a compromise, exactly because the loud extremes of the parties see ""moderation"" as weakness, pushing the candidates and politicians further and further apart. ""Dreaming big"" is finding an enduring solution that takes ideas both sides, giving consideration to a wider set of ideals and priorities. A candidate's ""passion"" for a policy is not going to win me over. That's just patronizing and offensive.

In this event in particular I liked how she wanted to compete with Nero and show off her charioteeing skills (Even if its for a somewhat silly reason as her not getting swimsuit version). But let me just say this: Even if all Nero said about not throwing away her life for a pyrrhic victory and try to get a complete victory on her, and also the fact that they as heroic spirits should not be so hung up in what happened in their past lives was actually a good thing to say, the fact that is NERO who says this to Boudica rubs me the wrong way a little because I feel is just a way of saying: ""See? Nero wants to make peace and is being mature, now ignore everything else Boudica has been shafted and lets keep praising Nero"". I liked much more what happened in Solomon, Boudica made clear that she still hates her and the Roman Empire but is willing to tolerate her and try to get along since she now knows how her situation also was.

Nah, the healthcare/education for all stuff he promotes isn't communism. It's just paying taxes and getting something in return like roads or schools or firefighters. Communism is a different kind of system that is more authoritarian (oppressive) but Bernie believes strongly in democracy. He isn't arguing for a post-capitalist system, but he thinks some industries such as health INSURANCE shouldn't be private because the companies are incentivized to deny claims of sick people to profit bigger. Imagine if there was a private firefighter insurance industry that made money by taking as much payment per month as possible and denying as many claims as possible. The profit motive would be incentivizing the wrong thing.

&gt;Literally the federal minimum wage.

Yeah, most states and companies can tell the federal minimum wage of $7 an hour is ridiculous, so they do indeed pay more than that. But it's more like $9 or $11 which is still pretty low for jobs that demand so much time and labor. There's a difference between working in a hot restaurant all day and sitting in a nice office doing ""smarter"" work.

Yes the gov is losing money, not just direct things like the Fed (DoD) gov is the #1 user of energy on the planet, or grants, loans, contracts, and mostly tax revenue ""credits"" or non-profits (and by gov I mean all levels of gov not just Federal), including gov or quasi-gov entities which redistribute taxes/fees from energy bills etc. This is the Marxist wheel turning, the gov controlled money, is then fed to certain people/players, who then contribute back to the politicians, to do things including change the tax laws, or simple things like requiring loans or tax credits for renewables have certain things like the equipment which is certified to last 25+ years.

The climate change hot issue is just the driver (public propaganda) to be able to allow for these corrupt contracts and rigging of the market, as well as funding a new round of Marxists through the higher education system.


If you read the fine print in those university R&amp;D contracts, gov grant contracts (be them DOE or State of CA), etc. all the contracts have the same fine print. Very similar to all gov contracts, including the border wall prototypes; they are not OPEN contracts, the fine print narrows down the entities eligible (best example is the Navy Contract for a new support ship design a few months ago, even though it's for a ship design the contract was put out for shipyards and required the capacity to build military ships--so instead of the thousands of naval architects, only about 6 real companies could qualify, and only 1 submission per company/shipyard. So this wasn't the headline of The Navy asking for new ship design.)

[spez So most people think the Navy will get the best ship or cost effective, but nope, they will get the ships the 6 companies design, most of which were already decided before the contract; so there is NO opportunity for a naval arch to have a new ship that say is x10 better and 50% cheaper to get a Navy contract, because the gov contracting agents of the swamp say sorry, we put out our RFP for the support ship already, go bid on that; and no shipyard will team up with a random naval arch vs their own in house design of years; so NO NEW NET LEAP in improvement can be made, and NO NEW market entrants to the industry. This is how most gov contracting is these days, it doesn't matter if its x10 better, or 50% cheaper; in fact these facts work against getting partners, investors, or contracts; since everyone knows you'll be shut out if not already. DRAIN THE SWAMP it a real deal!]

Again the fine print in tax law, also means any investors basically require meeting the fine print in gov qualifications. When places like CA Dems set up billions, or Germany's billions for certain solar technology; if your new tech that is x2 better but doesn't meet those subsidy specs, or qualification for loans for deployment specs; it really doesn't matter if its x2 or x10, there is far less structural, investment, and gov/reg risk.

Because the market is split into 3 layers, any new energy tech, either requires small scale (straight to consumer power), sell into the distribution system, sell to big consumers directly, or be able to use the energy directly into some other endeavor. The vast majority of energy and money going into energy is de facto required by gov regs and investors to be fed into the distribution (so utilities can meet their ""legal"" requirements). To sell into the distribution system (or any layer) it's NOT a free market in most places, the energy industry is a CONTRACT market, and the existing market players have no interest in taking a massive loss on their existing assets/investments.

Read the fine print. It's not a free market even in R&amp;D. And when the gov officials be them grant officers or college deans of engr find out your integrity can't be bought at any price, you don't get to play to pay their game. *witnessed *witnessed *witnessed *witnessed",1564617904

"history","t5_2qh53","Things were going to pop off that way no matter what the catalyst was. The issue came down to how much more quickly troops could be mobilized since the last major war and that reacting on the order of days rather than weeks caused the Alliance to feel the need to cross Belgium (invade) to get in position with France. The Cascade of mutual defense alliances made a repairable issue spiral out of control, but it could've been any. Because armys can be mobilized so much quicker at that point, spending much time on diplomacy could lose you your strategic advantages. The network of mutual defence treaties meant the sides were already chosen no matter the reason for war, and the changing tactics of war meant Belgium was always going to get dragged into it and England with them and means the war would had the same mobilization and pacing which means the front line stalemates were even already potentially predictable. 


The thing that could've gone most differently would probably be if the Alliance had gone straight through French defenses instead of through Belgium to weaker borders. They might've had a 50/50 chance of overwhelming France quickly and being able to focus on Russia without England or the US ever becoming involved. We might never have seen the same rise of nationalism after an Alliance victory. We mightve had 4 super powers in the 1960s and 1970s with US, UK, RU, and the Alliance. No push to build the bomb might mean it takes a lot longer to be developed and a lot less reasons to avoid outright war between the superpowers in the second half of the 20th century.

Holy smokes, I've never given it a lot of thought, but the whole world might look incredibly different today if the Alliance hadn't invaded Belgium first.

LK coffee, at least to me, tastes nothing special, therefore warrants no customer loyalty.    

2. 3. That's their growth story. Wallstreet loves growth stories so they are writing one. Except most existing growth companies at least make up a plan for how to reach profitability. LK doesn't even bother. LK stated they are in a strategically unprofitable stage, and there's no plan in sight to end this stage.    

LK could likely still go higher if you look at the trend of other Chinese scam stocks, such as NIO, but there's no guarantee to this up side. However, come the end of lock up period, which is Nov, I guarantee you the stock would drop like crazy. Founders and initial investors got to take profits for themselves.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","My advice would be to focus on postgraduate medicine which requires a bachelor degree in anything and a decent GAMSAT score. Have you looked at other medical careers as well? You could do a bachelor degree in medical/health subjects such as nursing, physio, radiography, dietetics, pharmacy, paramedicine, public health, epidemiology etc. and you'd still have another career to fall back on if you don't like studying to be an MD. To enter into a postgrad MD course you'll need fairly high marks (like D's and HD's) plus the GAMSAT score. A lot of medical schools place emphasis on your interview and personality and give less emphasis to GAMSAT these days. It would also help (and will benefit your career greatly) if you get some work experience in a medical field first, which is why I suggested those courses above. 

Also, if you're actually interested in studying the subject of medicine (which I assume you are) then those subjects above can definitely give you that. Particularly if you decide later to do a Masters degree (e.g. a Master of Public Health)- you'll very much be studying a lot of medical subjects like infectious disease control, immunisation, non-communicable disease, drugs etc. A lot of doctors move into those fields as well.",1564617906

"ValveIndex","t5_r4yhp","Well the point of the test is simply to make sure it works. You can test all areas with clear visual feedback of the actuation, without waiting for the input to be needed in a game. It is worth doing.

In the Beta update, they gave us a tool to test the controller. Once opted in to the beta and updated, go to the following:

Overlay&gt; Settings &gt; Controller Settings&gt; Test Controller

Here you can test all buttons and inputs.

The click and rotate test is just how it sounds. Press the stick in and the light should turn white, push it forward and then rotate the stick around the outer edge while keeping it pressed. If it is fine, the light should be a solid white. If the light flicks back to blue or black when doing so, you may have some actuation problems.

I tend to find this usually happens in the areas of the non click.

You may also test pressure. If the stick actuates, look at the pressure and grip sensor and see if you are acitvating them strongly when pressing the stick in. They also announced having to press too hard is not expected behaviour, though a little bit more force than normal is expected. So if they go up high, you know there may be an issue there.

Heres my test if it helps:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oMfsruZJ\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oMfsruZJ_A)

I would also like to suggest not ignoring it if you do have actual actuation issues or have to press unreasonably hard for actuation , even if you don't expect to use that direction much. As it is not expected behaviour, there is no telling if the issue could worsen to places you do use after more use. A faulty stick is a faulty stick. They do suggest a return for these issues.

Notice this isn't about the clicking sound or feel either, just actuation. It is down to the user to decide if they are happy with the feedback or feel.",1564617907

In July 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a final opinion that recommended restricting the use of some linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) and suspending the marketing authorizations of others, citing concerns about gadolinium deposition.

In December 2017, the FDA announced in a drug safety communication it is requiring these new warnings to be included on all GBCAs.

&gt;4.	A role for conscious construction of the self in the generation and choice of alternatives.

I'm confused. His neurological requirements for free will seems like an attempt at describing generic deterministic consciousness rather than any particular freedom of the will. Does he use free will and consciousness interchangeably? If so thank you but I know I have a consciousness, I can't help not to; I'm stuck with the damn thing. 

Admittedly I'm biased. I can't stand how the guy words himself. The dreamy way in which he keeps mentioning his trademark 'neurocognitive free will' makes me feel as if he's trying to sell me a revolutionary homeopathy solution that is not at all like the others. Also:

&gt;""There is evidence that people who believe in free will are more pro-social. They adopt behaviour that benefits others and society as a whole, and have a greater sense of control of their future - they believe they can influence the future in positive ways. This is important. Neurocognitive free will provides a basis for understanding why they are correct.
&gt;
&gt;""Neurocognitive free will ties our understanding of free will to something real. It also helps us to understand what it means. I suspect it's not what most people think. As Sartre once said, ""Freedom is not a triumph"". But I think neurocognitive free will gives some hints to how it could be. That will be a focus of future work. ""

This is just... I dunno; dreamy yet manipulative? I mean hell, try reading the thing while swapping 'free will' for 'God' and 'neurocognitive free will'™ for 'spiritual selection'™. It's uncanny.",1564617908
