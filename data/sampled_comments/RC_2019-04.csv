**Introducing Maggie** - I think it'd be cool to meet her at the party. A great way to signal that a character is important without being hamfisted is using the camera to introduce them. Start the scene where they're smoking a joint with a shot centered on Maggie. Have a close up on her face and pull back as Noel and Jamie talk about lighting the joint. It'll immediately tell us that we're supposed to be seeing things through Maggie's POV rather than Noel or Jamie. That's a great place to show-off her *""I'm new to this""* character as well, have her fumble passing the joint because she starts coughing or something. 

You should think of each scene as a scarce resource, so pack it full of characterization, conflict, or plot.


PS - And of course I meant it! But you've got to keep revising or it'll never be true.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Artists are eccentric and own a lot of weird shit sometimes. He owned a lot of art books of nude men and women as well, and these were obviously part of a general collection. These books were not found in the context of an excessive collection of nude photographs of children, but they were found in the book collection of a man who was generally interested in photography, art photography, art history, book rarities and vintage books and not specifically focused on nude photographs of children. At least two of the books could be assumed to have been gifts from a fan as well since one was inscribed as such and the other one was the sequel to the inscribed one. Even if that wasn't the case and he bought the books himself what are the chances that he was such a dastard and devious pedophile that he purchased three books and didn't bother to procure any other nude photos of children? 

Besides, the evidence submission request that lists these books was endorsed months after the judge had barred all evidence from the 1993 investigation, which dramatically damaged the prosecution's case. They pushed to reverse this ruling with documents such as the one you provided, and eventually won a minor victory; three books were permitted, as was testimony about five alleged victims and the pornography. But that's it; nothing else made it. 

I'm sure you are aware of all of this though since your other posts indicate that you know the cases and allegations quite well and has researched them, something i'm incredibly thankful for since most people talking about this issue have not (which makes it hard to have any sort of discussion). So i just wanted to commend you for that.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Awakening makes it really easy to grind levels outside of chapters. Most games have a limited amount of experience, so you're better off with an elite team to carry the lord.
If you're trying to use too many units, try funneling that experience into fewer strong units. Typically, the knights get left behind as soon as possible for being too slow, and and some people go as narrow as one unit per promotion item + mages. 

Additionally, people argue about when the right time for promotions should happen.  Do you promote your troubadour at lvl 10 or not? And do you stop for arena grinding? 

Also, even though Binding Blade comes before Blazing Blade, maybe try Sacred Stones and Blazing Blade before you try more of the games. They're considered easier and make a better transition from Awakening to the different tactics of the older games.

   * Players to buy races. Want to play a Troll? That's a 0.99c PDF on the store; Need a Smartlink? That's only 0.49c;
   * Do similar things for ammo. I'm sick of people handwaving the rules. Have official ammunition punch cards that must be purchased in order to fire your weapons;

"Flyers","t5_2ribt","The team isn't just stacked with home grown talent. It's basically all home grown talent. Every one dressed for the game yesterday excluding, Gudas, Knight, Varone, Voracek, Talbot, all started their career with the Flyers. JVR is the odd ball of that group as literally every other player on the roster for the game against Carolina has only played for the Flyers. The Flyers aren't just stacked with home grown talent, it's spilling over the top.

The Flyers have so much great home grown talent, ""fans"" are willing to give up on Provy, Ghost, TK and other to sell them off for picks or a true #1 guy at whatever position. The one thing that is missing from this group is a Stanley Cup quality coach. All the other bases are covered. I'm not taking away what Gordon has done in the short term. He inherited a team that was ripe with young kids they just needed to knock off the old stock. And I know..."" One more year and the Flyers are cup ready"". It's cliche but I believe they are right there. A Stanley Cup quality coach like Coach Q pushes what the team already has over the limit.

&amp;#x200B;

\- OP's post is about political posts being locked.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I ask why political posts are locked and not removed. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Someone responds saying that most of the time the posts aren't political, they're just pictures of Trump with a meme caption. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I respond by saying that Trump is an an incredibly divisive political figure, and so even just memes of him are inherently very political and divisive, making the space more toxic and political. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- You respond by saying that Trump is not divisive in most of the US, and go through talking points about the progress he has been making. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I try to get across the point that this sub is not just Americans, and even for Americans, he has a less than 50% approval rating, with likely half that outside the US.  Again emphasizing not that I dislike Trump, but that he is divisive, which was my main original point.

&amp;#x200B;

\- You respond by comparing his US approval rating to Obama's (I have no idea why), and go on to continue pro Trump and anti Obama talking points.

It's fucking dumb. 

Also, armor in this game is sort of wonky, I really feel like armor was added so that we can tank a few bullets but, Challenging enemies really do a number there, damage resistance is just silly at this point. Building tanky does literally fuck all, and the ballistic shield is not tied to your health under a gearset now, so, there goes that. 

I am sort of out of sorts with veteran enemies, purples are more dangerous than elites and named enemies sometimes, and it shows. They hit hard, not as hard, but, they are spongy, and I really feel like they either need to just have less armor as a result or more health and no armor. They are just in the middle ground where it just does not seem to be easy to deal with them like before. Elites really arent the issue come to mind, and I would actually love to see more golds and less purples in missions. Reds are fodder lets be honest.  


I think ALL WEAPONS should get an inherent damage to armor stat. Lower caliber, less damage to armor, but increase stat to another.   
So an SMG could get 25 percent crit chance (just an example) and  10 percent armor damage to enemies.   
Assault rifles could get 25 percent damage to health with varying amounts of armor damage, say 15-20.

Mp3 compression takes advantage of a psychoacoustic effect known as frequency masking. 

When two frequencies that are close together are played quickly one after the other with the first being 10dB louder than the second one, you don‚Äôt actually perceive the second one. 

Mp3 compression uses this to actually remove frequency data permanently, this is why it is known as a lossy compression format. You actually lose data. 

It does start doing something called aliasing, which is really audible on low quality Mp3s. If you listen to the high frequency information, like hihats, on an mp3 it sounds mushy and ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù. 

MP3s are also band limited above a certain frequency, often around 15,000Hz, which means *all* the data above that frequency is completed removed. 

Most people can‚Äôt actually tell the difference between a 320kbps Mp3 and a 24-bit 48kHz PCM wave file, and the wave file will be about 10 times bigger. 10 times longer to download, 10 times longer to stream. So, for the most part, uncompressed audio isn‚Äôt the preferred delivery format for consumer level  digital audio. 

Now that transmission bandwidths aren‚Äôt as important as they used to be due to faster internet speeds, lossless formats like FLAC are becoming more and more popular. ",1554076804

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","If you're just now figuring out that this is war, you're coming late to the party. WAKE UP! The contest between Islam and human civilization has been ongoing for more than 1400 years. What do we do? Ten of the THOUSANDS of possible things to do follow below:

1. If you don't already know how to pray, **LEARN and practice daily prayer** for yourself, your loved ones, for our Beloved President, for our uniformed Guardians (military &amp; civilian) for our leaders, for our teachers and for the coming Kingdom of God. Yes, I'm serious. Pray as if it's all up to God and WORK for His Kingdom as if it's all up to us. You wanted to know - I'm telling you.
2. **READ and study the Only Holy Word of the Only Living God: The Bible**. PRAY over what you will read. ASK for wisdom. READ the Bible and then PRAY over what you have read. Make friends with people of Christianity or of Judaism - or BOTH. TALK with them about Heavenly matters and the reality of God's active Grace in this world. Be BUSY about being a part of God's Reconciliation of this busted-ass world. Seek FIRST God's Kingdom and His reconciliation (His righteousness). LEARN to listen to the Holy Spirit of God in your heart. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
3. **FIND and attend and support a Church or Synagogue** that you can *fully* support. GET SERIOUS about supporting (with your MONEY and your time) one or both of the only two Abrahamic faiths that exist: Judaism and Christianity. God in Christ is our ONLY hope. The Churches and the Synagogues - no matter HOW imperfect they are - are the entities through which the Heavenly Father has worked in the past. YES, the Churches are all full of hypocrites (I don't really know about Synagogues). When you participate, you'll realize you're just one more. You'll be right at home.
4. **WHEN YOU ARE** ***STRONG*** **IN THE FAITH In Christ - LEARN &amp; TEACH** about Islam. Yes, I'm sorry that ANYONE has to learn anything about Islam. However - we ***ARE*** at war. You're gonna need to know ALL YOU CAN LEARN about your enemy: the filthy, vile, violent and hate-filled idolatry of the pseudo-prophet of Islam. Islam is NOT an ""Abrahamic Faith""! Islam is an idolatrous institutionalization of supremacism, misogyny &amp; **SIN** \[""you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy""\] (but yes, worse than Mos Eisely space-port). There are AMPLE resources on the web and through your local library to help you come up to speed. **WARNING**: **Islam is spiritual** ***POISON***. Become strong in the force of the Holy Spirit of God before you dig deep into Islam. DO NOT WALK THIS PATH ALONE! David Wood (Acts 17 Apologetics), Pamela Geller (Geller Report), Robert Spencer (Jihadwatch) and DOZENS more will help get you started - but find a MENTOR to help keep you safe while you learn. REMEMBER: **THE NAME OF THE ONLY LIVING GOD IS** ***NOT*** **""Allah""** and there is **ONLY ONE LIVING GOD (the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ). Muslims DO NOT worship the Only Living God!** Remember, Islam has NOTHING to do with Father Abraham. The Muslim people are NOT spiritual descendants of Ishmael. The pitiful Muslim people are slaves. Islam is more military-political than it is religion. Any imagined connection between Islam and Father Abraham is (to quote a great man) ""ridiculous bullshit"".
5. **THIS IS SPIRITUAL WAR** \- every bit as much as it is social and cultural war. When our Churches and Synagogues are strong and well-supported, when our civic leaders are clear about the rule-of-law, when our social organizations are well-informed regarding the realities of Islam, when our media organizations no longer support the destruction of our Constitution, THEN, Islam will have less chance to spread unopposed and stealthily. GIVE ISLAM NO QUARTER. **SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT!** Major, ***MAJOR*** money (petro-dollars) has gone into corrupting our public officials. Vote for and support people who love our way of life. EXPOSE AND REJECT those who would - or who do - sell out to the enemies of freedom.
6. **ORGANIZE with local officials, spiritual leaders and other like-minded people**. Yes, I KNOW you don't have time but, President Trump CANNOT do all of this by himself. And, remember? THIS IS WAR! THIS IS FOR ALL THE MARBLES! Organize to EXPOSE examples of the implementation of SHARIA - in the media, in legislation, in business, in banking, in education, WHEREVER! CALL IT OUT! NAME IT FOR WHAT IT IS! **SHARIA IS DEATH!** SHARIA is the END of human freedom. THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY in SHARIA! There MUST BE NO SHARIA in Democracy. We must EXPOSE AND LOUDLY REJECT every manifestation of ""the path"" of the pseudo-prophet and his slaves.
7. **Understand that there is no reform in Islam**. All of Islam is Mohammad's Islam or it's NOT Islam. ISIS is the perfect demonstration of the reality of Islam. ISIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE UNDER ISLAM!! Understand that Mohammad's Islam is worse than the WORST of la Cosa Nostra. Islam is like a gang; like a cult - but much WORSE! Escape from Islam is VERY difficult and very dangerous. Most of the pitiful wretches who live under Islam have been born into it and leaving Islam is as much spiritual/psychological as it is physical.
8. **BE PREPARED TO DEFEND YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVED ONES FROM VIOLENCE!** You have no need to inflict violence onto others but YOU - as a defender against Islam and as an educator regarding Islam's deadliness - MUST NOT TOLERATE threats or attacks against you or your family. Keep dash-cams looking forward and backward on your vehicles. Record all phone conversations. KNOW where your children are going and KNOW the people with whom they'll be spending time. Stay informed regarding local mosques and their leaders. Who is teaching terror? Who is advocating violence? Remember? THIS IS WAR! If your profile becomes high enough - if you become an important enough target, you may be threatened. BE READY TO EXPOSE the PERPETRATORS or to defend yourself in any way necessary. DO NOT be a victim! Again, you need people around you who understand the threat! Again, seek out a mentor and ORGANIZE your community of ""counter-jihadists"". Get to know your local L.E.O.'s and collaborate with them when possible.
9. **When you become mature enough** and your community is organized enough, you MAY be able to help Muslims escape Islam. THIS IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS and is NOT for newbies. SEVERAL layers of organization are necessary and you'll need the cooperation of your L.E.O.'s, of your spiritual leaders and of one or more social service orgs. What I'm saying is, we must deplete their number and turn as many of the Muslim people into true patriots and true worshipers of God in Christ. IT AIN'T EASY! However, we MUST transform our enemies into our friends and then ENLIST their aid to help more Muslims escape from Islam. WARNING!!!! Muslims are taught to lie to protect Islam (and the Ummah) from childhood. You need discerning friends and a true spirit of discernment before you take this path!
10. **DO NOT STOP PRAYING! DO NOT STOP WORKING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND FOR HIS RECONCILIATION! UPLIFT THE FALLEN! STRENGTHEN THE FAINT OF HEART! WATCH FOR WHAT GOD IS DOING AND THEN FOLLOW HIS LEAD!**

I wish you well!",1554076808

When I started going to group fitness classes, I stayed in the back behind everyone so no one could see me mess up. They should offer you all the equipment you‚Äôll need (mats, weights, barbells, etc.) and the instructor should explain all the moves, reps and sets. If they don‚Äôt give clear demonstrations, just watch the people in front of you and copy them. 
After a few classes, I started feeling really good and confident!

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","The Resident Evil 1 remake is one of my favorite games. I think it's definitely worth playing, but there are some caveats. 

You're right, the version on PS4 is a remaster of a remake. The remaster made it look a little nicer and added new control options that the Gamecube didn't have. In my opinion, you can skip the original RE1 on the PSX. The remake basically takes everything from the original, expands the story and gameplay, and makes it look beautiful and atmospheric. In comparison, original RE1 is going to feel very dated and wooden. 

One thing to keep in mind if you play the Remaster is that it's essentially a game from 2002. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In 2002, Capcom was coming off of 4+ classic survival horror games. In my opinion, REmake was the pinnacle of that style, which doesn't exist anymore. Back then, horror meant lots of inventory management, tank controls, limited ammunition, etc. I think it's still perfectly playable in 2019, but you have to cut it some slack for being less user-friendly than modern games. 

After you play the Remaster, you can actually track down a copy of the original Resident Evil 2 on PSX. Unlike the 1-Remake relationship, the RE2 remake changes a lot from the original. It's still worth playing the original RE2 so you can appreciate the remake that much more. There are still some cool things in the PSX version that the new version didn't cover. 

If you buy the RE1 HD remaster on disc, it comes with a remaster of Resident Evil 0, which was also released on the Gamecube in 2002. RE0 is a lot more divisive, for both story reasons and gameplay considerations. It's a lot harder, more frustrating, and less tightly designed than Remake. It's worth playing if you fell in love with Remake. But if you weren't crazy about it, then skip it.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","It's a tough call. If you can wait, likely the C7Z's (used or even new) are going to drop quite a bit. Corvetteforum won't like to hear it, but they will. Just look at normal pricing curves on all of them. The only way I don't see it happening too much is if the C8 is a total disaster (and that is a possibility). If you're not that crazy about the potential of the new C8 platform (or don't care), then you're heading right into prime C7Z snagging opportunity. 

However, none of us have infinite time here so there is absolutely something to be said about having the car you love one summer sooner and getting the enjoyment out of it. We never know what will happen. Generally speaking, none of these cars will be worth more after we've used them (unless you're talking put 10k miles on it, winterize it, throw it in storage for 40+ years and pray) and there will ALWAYS be someone faster, something newer, whatever. Get what you love and go enjoy it. 

edit: and to clarify, when I say ""no chance in hell I'm paying 70k"" that is simply because I have so much overlap in my current lineup already that I can't sink 70k into something that pretty directly competes with half my garage. On their own, I still firmly believe the looks, performance, and improvements of the C7 are hard to beat in that price range. ",1554076810

"MathHelp","t5_2qz84","Your professor may be teaching you a different method (I'm in Calc 3 right now so hopefully this gives me some merit) but the way that I know how to do this is the derivative of an equation f(x) is the equation of the tangent line at any given point. The tangent line at a point gives you the slope. To find the mins and max, if you remember from lecture, is a little curve where a function is increasing or decreasing and then turns back around, thus the function has to have a point in the ""turn around"" where the slop is zero. When the slope is zero the tangent line is flat. To find where the tangent line is equal to zero, you have to set the derivate equal to zero (remember the derivative is the equation of the tangent line) and solve for what x values make that equation equal to zero. Once you have the x values, you will then need to find what y values correspond which is when you plug in the x values into f(x). Those x values with the y values will give you a coordinate pair where the mins and max are.",1554076812

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by this:

Isn't that exactly the opposite of what WASM is? The entire point of WASM is that it's a bytecode interpreter? Are you implying that there's a version of WASM that compiles to native binaries? May I have a link to it, because I would be curious to see that project.

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","The war on opioids is saving lives. But it‚Äôs also killing people like me.
 
(George Frey/Reuters)
By John Heubusch
March 27
John Heubusch is a novelist and the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif.

We had tried everything to stop the spread of my cancer. My doctor felt it was time for me to go home, get my affairs in order and say my goodbyes. ‚ÄúGet your Christmas shopping done early,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have just a few months to live.‚Äù

Five years have passed since that grim day and, strange as it might seem, there have been times I‚Äôve regretted undergoing the last-minute medical gambles that saved my life.

I am not alone. Victims of tragic accidents, disease onset, combat wounds, complicated surgeries, workplace injuries, gun violence or even a simple fall off a ladder are among the 20 million Americans like me who experience some form of high-impact, chronic and often debilitating pain. Many, given a second chance at life after a serious illness or injury, tragically choose suicide over pain. Why? The most unfortunate among them, those with life-altering, unspeakable pain, are being denied access to the medications they need to go on. Their doctors, now numbering nearly 70 percent of our front-line physicians, have enlisted in the nation‚Äôs war on opioids. Many have turned away from their patients in chronic pain.


When you see news stories declaring that federal action is driving fewer questionable opioid prescriptions, that Purdue Pharma is in deep trouble for allegedly creating millions of OxyContin addicts, and that the United States has stepped up the fight to interdict drugs on our nation‚Äôs borders, no doubt there‚Äôs reason to applaud. Lives are being saved. The rising number of deaths since 2015 that necessitated this war on opioids is most often not the fault of doctors or their patients in chronic pain. The real blame ‚Äî where the war will be won or lost ‚Äî lies with the illegal trafficking of opioids on the street where you live.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knew this when it trained its guns on the opioid epidemic three years ago. Revising its guidance to physicians in 2016, it sought to limit opioid treatment practices that were outside the bounds of common sense and sound public health. The CDC‚Äôs intended audience should have been small; a limited number of bad actors and a minority of doctors overprescribing for short-term pain were the CDC‚Äôs real target. But the guidelines were ambiguous and short-sighted. The immediate result: confusion at major medical conferences, inside hospital boardrooms and, most troubling, in just about every doctor‚Äôs office.

Next came the law of unintended consequences. At least 33 states, each seemingly eager to outdo the other, have passed their own measures to severely reduce or eliminate the use of such drugs to treat pain. ‚ÄúJust say no,‚Äù the national refrain from the 1980s in the war on crack cocaine, has become the standard of care for patients with severe pain.


Enter President Trump. His battle cry, verbatim: ‚ÄúWhether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will hold you accountable.‚Äù

Lumped in with drug pushers and heroin traffickers, even law-abiding doctors who have responsibly treated patients in chronic pain with opioids began to cower. Just what were these new laws? What dosages for each unique patient with a unique set of needs will keep a doctor out of prison? Administrators of major medical research institutions, teaching hospitals, national pharmacy chains and most particularly overworked private practitioners were not going to wait for answers. With visions of Drug Enforcement Administration agents in their waiting rooms, they headed for their bunkers, leaving desperate patients behind.

We have reached the point where doctors believe the next prescription they write for opioids to treat chronic pain might be their last. In my own case, I‚Äôve had to undergo countless unsuccessful procedures and near superhuman efforts to be granted barely enough medication to try to live a normal life. Even those doctors with the courage to prescribe them for chronic pain sufferers are finding the hurdles established by federal and state reporting requirements so onerous that they are simply turning patients away.


Opioid prescriptions have shrunk substantially, but Washington‚Äôs goal now is to cut their number by a further one-third. In a bitter irony, opioid overdose deaths continue to hover at an all-time high. Many chronic pain patients, denied prescriptions, are self-medicating on the street, using synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, 50 times more powerful than heroin. There, danger and overdose lurk around every corner. Even worse, some who have lost all hope for pain relief are choosing to end their pain by ending it all. The risk of suicide among patients with chronic pain is twice that of those without it.

Three weeks ago, more than 300 medical experts wrote to the CDC noting the increase in suicides tied to the agency‚Äôs widely misapplied guidance. The patients in chronic pain they defend are not addicts. Far from it. There is a terrible truth for our government complicit in this crisis of its own making: Though it can regulate prescriptions for those in need, it cannot regulate pain.

"Roadcam","t5_2u6os","&gt;How is the car supposed to avoid a rear end collision? Speed up and t bone the ambulance? 

Firstly, the car was rear ended and went through and didn't get t boned. So, that wasn't a threat especially since ambulances don't fly through red lights, they are aware of the danger hence why they were slow and didn't get hit. They were probably fully stopped, off screen.

But to answer, prevention. In terms of coming up to lights, stops, etc., and you have a large vehicle behind, you should be alert that they don't stop as quick, especially if they don't see you. Can't do much outside change lanes or to blow a light, when allowed such as here or if it went yellow (this was a judgement call, here).

Again, many might be shocked this happened, but go ride a motorcycle. This situation, what's going on behind is just as important as in front of you. We don't have the luxury of impact zones. We do have the ability to guess on what might happen. Truck behind me while approaching a light? Super sketchy.

Case and point, approaching lights, and these count since it could go yellow just the same, be aware of who is behind you. 

Is it cammers fault? No. But so much of what's in this sub is avoidable on some degree. Stopping may have actually not been the safest thing to do. You still have a green light and ambulance drivers aren't taught to blast red lights for this reason.

"WWEGames","t5_2t9bx","What excites you about pro wrestling? What gimmick matches do you like? What dream matches do you want to see? (With the in game roster). What Superstars do you like but aren't being pushed how you like? 

For me, tournmamets excite me about pro wrestling so I incorporate a lot of them into my Universe. I love tag team wrestling so I made a lot of teams to play. 

I've always wanted to see dream matches like Sting vs Taker, I always thought Kane should have gone over HHH for the World title, I think the King of the Ring should be a tournament to decide who is the King and give them the #30 in the Rumble, I think I could push Roman and others better on TV (I probably can't, but this is my Universe). 

So my Universe is based around all that. You may think you have to be creative, but I don't think you have to be so creative and on top of that, I think you can be creative you just might be thinking too much about this mode. 

Just put some stars into a rivalry and run it. Set available goals for the Superstars on your roster and let the show run its course. Customize as much as you want from the way your RAW arena looks to the types of PPVs you run. Delete Summerslam in August and run Survivor Series or delete MITB in June and download a classic PPV you like instead. 

Use different championships too. Why use the WWE Championship as your top prize when you can use the UK Championship? There's an idea, run a UK based RAW promotion! 

See, the ideas just flow. It's really such a bland mode and there isn't much to think about. Trust me, I used to overthink Universe mode and when you look at it barebones, it's really just do whatever the hell you want. Now the ideas just flow and most of the times it just takes a little bit to get the gears moving. It'll happen as Universe goes on too. 

Don't do what's on TV because that's one of the reasons you're getting bored. You should go as far as running a WCW promotion or modern ECW promotion with updated titles and a mix of classic and modern stars. 

Bottom line, I don't know you but I do know that everyone has a little creativity in them. Sometimes it just takes a little bit to get it out. Some come up with ideas on the spot, others need to get in a groove. You might need to stick with universe mode for a couple of in game months until you start getting ideas. 

Fun tip: your first month in Universe mode is usually pointless. I'm not sure about this current game, but I know from WWE 12-WWE 2K17 the general rule was pretty much ""the first month is pointless as the game is still recognizing the roster, rivalries, and schedule"" so nothing exciting is really going to happen in your rivalries until June. 

Another idea, try starting Universe Mode at the Road to WrestleMania season. Meaning start a new universe and don't touch anything. Simulate up on the beginning of January and then set up your shows and all that. Then play from January to WrestleMania (this hasn't been tested by me, but I thought it would be a good idea so idk how well it would work). 

Anyways, I hope you find the fun in this mode and I hope this helped too.

- Teammate kills and other sources = 25% to your frame and 75% equally split between your weapons. Bringing 1 weapon will give it 75% of the affinity, while bringing 3 will give them 25% each.

Note that max rank gear will not change the distribution. So getting weapon kills with a max rank frame will still give 50% of the affinity to the weapon.

Also, enemy spawn (and by extension, total affinity) is affected by the amount of players in the squad. With more players spawning more enemies. You won't get as much affinity with just 2 of you vs 4 of you.",1554076817

* Shotguns may potentially need a fundamental shift, good rates of fire and two tap quickly, like a 90 rpm shotgun can two tap fairly consitently and a tight predictable spread.
* Handcannons need higher rpm, shorter range than Scouts, and Scouts are the reverse

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Heh, emotional support porcupine!  Maybe that's all that means.  Yeah, the other part that has me most concerned is the requirement where the student must be ""substantially limited"" in performing certain basic tasks.  How does Crohn's fit in here, especially when it is so unpredictable and variable?  You could say that sometimes Crohn's kids are ""limited"" in their ability to ""hold it"" when nature calls?  That's probably where that requirement would fit in.  That's not a guarantee though...sometimes things could be fine and other times it could be impossible.  I'm not sure if their requirement means it has to be all the time or if only some of the time counts.

I think starting with the doc sounds like a good idea. I already have ""get formal diagnosis letter"" written down on my list of things to bring up.

If you‚Äôve got anxiety, maybe it‚Äôs a reason you were self medicating? You should make an apt with the doctor and let her/him know about your anxiety and trouble sleeping. Each night you have those anxious thoughts that keep you up, it reinforces that pathway not allowing you to get great sleep. You may benefit from a mild medication like trazadone. Quitting Kratom Can have lasting effects on your brain (not body) because the stress that quitting has on your brain is a stress you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have had in your life. So sleep might be an issue for another week, or you‚Äôve reinforced pathways in your brain that might make it difficult for quite some time. I‚Äôd just go to the doctor to address the sleep issue. Honestly that was exactly the reason i was self medicating; anxiety. Now that I‚Äôm medicated for it it makes sleep no-brainer easy , and it has helped with dealing with everyday stresses like money school and work. No shame in having a few tools to help you live healthily. Have you also looked into therapy? 

 And related to the sleep issue; I hadn‚Äôt slept more than 5 hours in 6 months when I decided to visit the doctor. Now, I get 8 hours every night almost on the dot. Hang in there.

I would not want anonymous feedback.  People can be extremely unkind while pretending they're ""just being honest"".  And what about problems that can't easily be fixed, like ""your nose is so big that it's distracting trying to talk to you.""  So, is that person receiving this feedback going to feel like they need to run out and get a nose job because one person is distracted?  And whose problem is it really?  I mean if you know the person who tells you something like that, you might know that they've had 16 plastic surgeries and their opinion about almost everything is based on personal appearance -- and so be able to disregard the feedback because of who it came from.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","I did not write this.  Just something another redditor wrote that I saved because I loved it.  Unfortunately the account is now deleted so I cannot give proper credit.

""Big ugly squid."" I wish I was still that innocent, still unaware of what...they really are. Once you know, once you really understand - or if you are among those damned to witness it yourself - once you know, you will never forget. It keeps me up at night, and if not for my physician's pity I would never sleep at all.

Squids. It's charming, frankly - the Old Gods, with bloated and frowning faces writhing with tentacles like the beard of Neptune. Like a God of Egypt, with a man's body and an animal's head. A curiosity, and little more.

The truth...well, I cannot tell you the truth, not properly, as a man of science should. These things are beyond our science. Still, I understand things about them that explain some of the reports, and perhaps you can carry on my research now that I can no longer pursue it.

It comes down to dimensions. We possess three - height, width, and depth. Grip a billiard ball, feel your fingers wrap around it, and you will understand. Now imagine a creature that existed in only two of those three dimensions, in a universe that described a simple plane through our own. To that creature, the billiard ball would appear to be a simple circle, growing and shrinking as it passes through the plane of the creature's universe. Imagine how our hand would look - strange fleshy circles filled with pulsing fluids, shards of bone, glistening meat. The creature could never understand what it was really seeing, as it could no more conceive of a hand than it could imagine a creature like us, moving freely in three dimensions and gripping billiard balls on a whim.

The Abominations, as you aptly described them, are to us as we are to that benighted creature. They exist in dimensions beyond our own, whose nature we can hardly guess. When they appear to us, we see only fragments of their bodies - long stretches of writhing flesh, glistening with juices that should not exist outside of a body, which whip through the air and vanish back where they came from in a way that our minds simply refuse to accept. Witnesses have tried to describe these as great tentacles, words failing them in the presence of such incomprehensibility. Those who heard the stories seized on this, and explained them as resembling cephalopods. This is a comforting lie, as there is nothing in the most stygian depths of the darkest sea that is not our beloved brother compared to the horrors of the Abominations.

This is a creature who is incomprehensibly alien, and our only glimpse is a sickening flash of writhing, elongated flesh that slips into our world and back out. Worse than the appearance of the creature, though, is its disappearance - your mind knows, on some level, that this creature - this hateful, hungry god of a creature - is not moving it's body between ""here"" and ""away"", but between being a glimpse of a writhing horror, and a horror that watches unseen.

Imagine our two-dimensional creature again, and imagine yourself to be a cruel child. If you chose to torment the creature, it would be powerless to resist. It cannot perceive you unless you chose to intersect its plane - you can watch its every move, and it cannot hope to escape your gaze. It would be the simplest thing in the world to push a pin through it, like a butterfly on a card. Take a glass of water and push it into the creature's plane and it will find itself trapped, drowning, in an inescapable sea. The creature is entirely at your mercy, and always will be.

Same as you. Same as me.

Democrats don't want to do that because there's no way to get 2/3rds of the Senate to vote to convict no matter what crimes Trump is guilty of. 

It's safer for Democrats to run against a flawed candidate that everyone thinks is corrupt in the current political calculus. I can see how it *might* be better to embarrass Republicans for supporting an open criminal by blocking removal from office in the Senate, but there's more risk there and I'm not really sure it would move the electorate but instead it would make the election a referendum on Trump more than democratic policies and priorities.

Politically Democrats have to embarrass Republicans not for just being corrupt in supporting Trump, but also for having bad ideas on pocketbook issues like healthcare. 

It's sad because it basically shows that impeachment is just a useless tool that will never be used and we need a different mechanism for removing lawless Presidents. ",1554076823

"orangetheory","t5_39w4v","Really - I hope you hear me!. They aren't looking. OTF is a really supportive community. I totally understand where your negative self-talk comes from - I literally was there on day one with that attitude (and also was in horrible shape). Don't let you own fears stop you.

I was in the same position - slightly terrified, anxious and totally out of shape. Even the first five minutes of class I was thinking to myself ""what the fuck have I gotten myself into"". But somewhere in that hour it just clicked for me.

My sage wisdom:

- It will be hard, but you can totally do it.

- The rower will probably be your arch enemy for the first few weeks/months. Until you have core muscles built up to handle rowing with proper form, it is hard as a bitch. It's not just you - we've all been there. Suffer through it and you will see the benefits pay off immensely later on.

- Go at your own pace - across the board, for every exercise. Don't worry too much about completing things all the way through or keeping up with everyone else- just do you. All that matters is that you are moving. You'll also probably want to start as a power walker.

- You will probably be hurting the first few weeks - but it's totally normal (and sort of feels like a badge of honor). My first half dozen workouts were rough, and I needed 2-3 recovery days between. Soon after you get in a groove, you may find yourself recovering faster, and now I can go multiple days in a row and not feel sore, but still prefer to take one day off in between most workouts.

- Listen to your body. And something I found important my first few months was figuring out what I could (and more importantly, could not) eat before workouts. I need to work out on an empty stomach, where some people need some fuel beforehand.

Also for what it is worth - I started totally out of shape and had not worked out in earnest in over 5 years. You can do this! ",1554076825

I can also see a lot of what you've described be a possibility for the next year of chapters, particularly with the present arc, the miyabi one, and the time skip (god I want some wholesome shit from these chapters). I also think that anniversary of Natsuo and Rui's kiss is kind of brilliant, and I'm kind of expecting that now for a possible way for chef boi to fix things. You're seriously onto something with the rings, though, but I'm not quite sure that Hina is going to confess with them. She's seriously doing a lot to be a big sister, and she's come quite a long way in that regard for her to just say, ""btw ever heard of sonic? Cuz I like rings too"". I think that Natsuo is going to find them on a shelf or somewhere else without a god damn HINT of secrecy and will interpret that as being latent feelings or something like that which, I mean, they are. But with Hina trying to be an onee-chan, I think that she's gonna book it at this point in the story and cry in a ditch or somethin', cuz there's gonna be a lot of decisions that she'll have to make in the span of about, oh, 20 chapters and by that point the stakes will be so high Vlad the Impaler will be jealous.

Even in the crypto world, Nicehash is not using a blockchain to synchronize all the computers on their network, and they are allowing people to rent their computer power to people who want to buy computer power.

Nicehash IS using crypto though, specifically bitcoin, therefor a blockchain.. lol.

Plz find a non-crypto service that allows people to rent/buy computational power from idle computers and mobiles. Plz. If you can‚Äôt find any then I have proved you wrong

&gt; It looks like DecentBet does not have a product yet, I could not try it.

Funfair, augur. About 10+ others that have working products, including decentbet. Btw you do realize that trying a product is irrelevant. You can read exactly how it works.

&gt;Nobody is walking around with $10B.

It was an extreme example, saying that if someone wanted to it would be possible.

&gt; People have shares in company. 

Ok..

&gt; Also, you don't have 10B USD, you have a 10B IOU coins from a company somewhere. 

Which is a lie. There are several stablecoins, probably 100+ different aprroaches within 2-3 more years. Some are not reliant on a company but rather code. ‚ÄúMaker‚Äù is a good example. You will sadly not understand it, so better to just ignore it like everything else you are unable to refute ;)

&gt;Tether is refusing to have an actual audit. I'd much rather have $10B in a few banks than in a stablecoin.

Yeah I would not recommend anyone to hold large amount of tether.

&gt;Do you have personal experience developing with a blockchain? Can you give a simple example project (with the code) using a blockchain and comparing how using a regular database is slower, less efficient, more complicated?

Slower. I believe I was referring to sending international payments. Let‚Äôs say you wanted to send 10mill to another country (just an example)you would have to trust SEVERAL banks, it could take a week and cost you 10k+ in fees if done by wire transfer. However with crypto it can be done instantly, for as low as a few cents and you don‚Äôt have to trust or even tell anyone. How is that not a usecase?

&gt; For example, if you want to learn machine learning, tensorflow has tons of practical examples and projects. You will get to learn really cool things, like image recognition, style transfer, audio recognition, actually useful things.

If you are into that sort of thing while you hold on to your ‚Äúcrypto is a scam‚Äù thing, you will eventually run into a few problems ;)


&gt; Machine learning is a bit far from blockchain. Let's look at something that blockchain is supposed to replace: Firebase. They have a ton of examples and very good documentation on things that you may want to do with a blockchain: User authentication, hosting, serving content, synchronised and realtime multi-regional database, storage (petabyte level), encryption, computing services, machine learning. And it works: Firebase is used by millions of users and developers everyday. Amazon and Microsoft also have competing services that are very profitable. If blockchain was that useful, why wouldn't Google just add a blockchain API to their services?

Because it doesn‚Äôt make sense? It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt soccer players pick up the ball and throw it‚Äù.

Firebase is a toolbox for app develops. It‚Äôs built to enable people to build better apps and ultimately benefit google.

The wast majority of apps and games don‚Äôt need crypto. Just like for example not all food needs ketchup, but a few very popular meals do.

&gt; Compare the examples above to the EOS documentation. If you follow their tutorials, you successfully upload and download data from their blockchain. Not that useful in itself. You can do the same with an encrypted database on AWS for $0.10 per 1M query. From a technical perspective, a blockchain does not add much, expect maybe in some very edge cases, as in the image I posted (there are additional restrictions)

Yeah if the ultimate goal was to up/download some data then a regular database would be a better fit. But that‚Äôs not really the situation.

You seem to take a mental gymnastic move away from actually viewing crypto and blockchain for what it is.

It‚Äôs dectralized. As in the users themselves controll it. It therefor cannot be censored. It also cannot be altered or gamed, an attack on for example bitcoin would be pointless (super high cost, little reward).

The fact that it‚Äôs possible to write computer code that removes the need for a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù, have it run on an unstoppable network almost as it were a law of nature is super cool imo.

This will allow for so much that before was not possible. It‚Äôs like a massive efficiency boost to almost everything. Peace",1554076826

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","So this is a fairly ridiculous idea I am going to throw out here, but it kind of seems like we are eventually going to be forced to do this to prevent having the same conversation over and over again...

I think we should include in the next hard fork an EIP which moves the Parity funds from the smart contract to the 0x0000 burn wallet. 

The issue I think it that if we decide to recover the funds, that requires taking an action, and it is non reversible. In that case it is clear that a ""decision has been rendered,"" to use Lane's words. If we decide not to recover the funds, that means taking no action, and that decision can be reversed at any time in the future. This makes it easy for the polkadot people to further muddy the waters with claims that ETH governance is broken, no discussion ever happened, no one knows what everyone actually wants, we don't have signalling tools etc. If we burn the ETH, it is equally clear that a non-reversible decision has been made. 

We shouldn't have to do it, but too many people in a position of influence have lost money on this bug, and this issue will never die if we don't make a firm non-reversible decision. ",1554076828

&gt; Josh Bell can‚Äôt play. He‚Äôs not a good defender. He‚Äôs a big lump. He has bad agility, bad footwork. He can‚Äôt run. Supposedly he‚Äôs a big power threat, but he hit 12 home runs at first base. **This is not a kid!** This is his third year in the big leagues! I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs got the ability to get better.

Then proceeds to call Moran, same age, a kid (""he‚Äôs a big, strong kid."") on the cusp of stardom - lol. He says Moran plays solid third base which I just... what???

He also calls Richard Rodriguez a ""kid"" though, and RichRod is 2 years older than Bell FWIW. And he's not a hard thrower at all but the scout says he ""throws hard"".

&gt; Q: Whose batting practice makes your jaw drop?

&gt; A: He (Bell) has immense raw power, but there‚Äôs something in his head. 

&gt; Q: Name the guy (or guys)on this teams that you would never want in your clubhouse.

&gt; A: I don‚Äôt think I have anybody I‚Äôd veto, other than Bell, ‚Äôcause he doesn‚Äôt produce.

&gt; Q: Who don‚Äôt you want in that situation?

&gt; A: Bell.

Other answers involving Bell. I mean I understand that the scout really thinks Bell is not a productive player at all but his comments just makes me feel like he's a bit biased, you know? Why is he so strict with just Bell?

I tried giving Yoda a block as well but nothing changed so I'm guessing he doesn't have any new animations, but I could be wrong.

For reference, [here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BgIqQMIRk) of a mod made back in January last year that shows what Maul's blocking animations used to look like.

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","tbf, people - particularly poor people - aren't usually driven to get take-out because they honestly think it's a better financial decision for them than basic healthy food. I feel like everyone in these comments saying ""wow so lazy, just cook beans and rice"" are kind of missing the point. 

Most of us who get take-out do it because life sucks, we're tired and sad, and fast food is an affordable way to make ourselves feel better for half an hour. The fact that it's maximally convenient, that we know we ""shouldn't"" have it, not to mention that nightmare corporations fill it with addictive chemicals, all add up to make it feel like a treat.

In The Road to Wigan Pier, Orwell had a really solid take on this, which he summarised: ""When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.""

If you're reading that and thinking ""oh but I'm poor and I manage to be healthy"", great, but the expectation that everyone makes the same progress as you in this rigged system - and well as has the same priorities as you - is unreasonable. It's also essentially pulling-up-bootstraps rhetoric.

Don't buy into bougie propaganda about the supposed moral evils of fat / unhealthy people. Most are just normal folks trying to deal with the waking nightmare of capitalism. Socialism has a natural answer to the obesity crisis: when we smash capitalism the socioeconomic &amp; cultural drivers behind that health crisis will largely disappear.",1554076831

"leanfire","t5_38u7g","This is like the easiest question to answer ever.  With your salary, you'll be able to both max your 401k, IRA, and pay off your student loans within year.  So there's no prioritization needed.  You can simply do it all.

Even with the ""bad"" 401k plan, it is still easily in your best interest to contribute up to the IRS maximum of $19,000, because this will reduce your income by the same amount and save you money at your highest marginal tax rate.  This savings will dwarf any high fees.  Plus when you get a new job, you can roll it over into and IRA to reduce fees to a reasonable level.

You make too much money to be able to deduct the traditional IRA contribution, so that means go with Roth, where the [income limit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2019) to make a direct contribution is $122,000.  At some point, it's likely you'll have to jump through the hoops to do a [backdoor Roth](https://www.physicianonfire.com/backdoor/) once your income increases.  It's hard to go wrong with a Vanguard account. They have been the low cost leader for decades and [they are owned by their funds](https://about.vanguard.com/what-sets-vanguard-apart/why-ownership-matters/), meaning that their goal is not to maximize profits like other companies.

It's relatively easy to [access your retirement accounts early](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/), through a few different methods, but with your income and saving habits, it's probably not even going to be an issue since you'll end up with lots and lots of money in your taxable brokerage account.

For my English class, we had to create our own gothic film with a partner or by yourself. Obviously creating a movie is rigorous work so we decided to split the parts to where it‚Äôs sort of 50/50. I made the script and shots, he did the editing. We started working and eventually we finished the script and the all the recordings needed and all we needed was the editing. The next day, he shows me what he had and said that he finished editing the movie and I was really excited to see it (I wasn‚Äôt expecting the movie to be edited like a marvel movie).  He shows me the video and it looks half assed. This made me really upset because the script I made had everything I wanted for the edits. I said ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù He said that it was the film and then I started telling him things I think he should‚Äôve added and took off. He got really upset and told me he wasn‚Äôt going to continue editing because he spent his entire night dedicated to editing. I wasn‚Äôt fine with the work he did so I decided to take the initiative to do it myself and we ended up getting a pretty good grade and I also believe I should‚Äôve took points off of his grade to improve my score for the project.

As for the required servicing it's saying, you may be right about not knowing how to reset the message, the last time I had my brakes done by a small off the high street garage they didn't know how to reset the error on the dash and it stayed on until I went to BMW for an oil change which is when they reset it/got rid of it, since it may be the case that they didn't know how it might be a good idea to take it to BMW for a service ASAP if you were to purchase it just to put your mind at ease and they would probably tell you if something needed doing or wasn't done properly in the past, I'm currently on my 2nd BMW myself, both of them have had little to no service history and over the past 3 years I've had no real issues, I do take them to BMW for servicing though regardless of what little service history they have had in the past and the last time I did they sent a video to my email of them servicing the car and telling me what good condition it was in, that did put my mind at rest.

The over-filling of oil is a bit of a worry like you said, however if the car feels like it's driving smooth and there's no strange juddering or anything alike then I don't think you should worry too much, maybe just don't boot it alot until it's had an oil change and the correct level restored.

Over-all I think it looks like a nice tidy car and it does have alot of extras, it seems like a good deal, buying second hand cars is a risk we all take, I think you should give it another test drive but this time take it on the motorway and get it up to a bit of speed/RPM, if you don't feel any worrying shaking, juddering or lack of power when power should be there then I'd say it's worth the risk, but book it into BMW for a good service as soon as you can just to be on the safe side.",1554076832

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","They don't really need them, the Arado C-3 is more than enough right now. I will admit that I am tired of seeing Germany getting aircraft from other nations, it just cheapens the experience. But at least they won't receive that many once we move into more modern designs. The best they'll get is a MiG-29A and F-4E, it'll leave a big gap in capabilities when compared to the other nations. At least until the Typhoon and Tornado are added. So I think they should get these planes eventually, but they don't really need them right now. But if by chance they're added Gaijin needs to split up West and East Germany for Air RB... well they should do it regardless in my opinion. 

Personally I think they need more proper German aircraft, even paper planes are fine by me at this point. Stuff like the Hs 132, Me P.1110, Volksj√§ger 1&amp;2, and the Ta 183. Even the Pulqui II would be nice since it was designed by Kurt Tank.

It should be noted that Comp Helpdesk is open for one more week (!!) before we close up for the semester (since we have finals too!)

My second recommendation is quite biased, but did you attend the CSUS review sessions? 

If so, could you provide me feedback on them? For the first midterm review, we went over some of the trickier quiz questions, but found that on the midterm, there was quite a bit of understanding code, so we took a different approach for the 2nd. What approach do you think we should take for the final? I‚Äôm considering spending some time going over a practice final / past final. 

If you did not attend them, I don‚Äôt blame you, they are long in duration, but we do spend a lot of time preparing for them - we‚Äôve received a lot of good and constructive feedback to our review sessions. I‚Äôm biased, but I think they are very helpful :) 

The final review session will be April 18th, at 6PM. I hope to see you there! In the meantime, you can also DM me if you need help on specific questions. I‚Äôd be happy to meet up and discuss algorithms, data structures, practice problems, quizzes, past exams etc. ",1554076832

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","After refined, gasoline has a shelf life. Therefore it makes sense to refine it as close to the consumer as possible. Building the refinery near the border also limits your labor, a lot less people live there.  By shipping the oil to the gulf, you also have the option to either refine it or ship it overseas for higher prices. 

Finally, if you refine near the border, you still need to ship the final product. Rail and trucking are much more dangerous ways to ship, and if you elect to ship refined product by pipeline, you have to purge the lines of the previous product every time you want to switch products (example, gasoline to jet fuel).

So there's a lot of reasons for this pipeline. Right now, most Alberta oil is being moved by rail, which is expensive and much more dangerous (look up Lac-M√©gantic). If you're worried about the environmental impact of pipelines, I do believe that technology and stricter inspection regulations are the way to go.

You're not missing anything, it's just that instagram's algorithm buries pics that don't perform well within the first hour or so (and typically does the same for 2-3 pics after the initial flop). My partnership with Ulta required me to post at 8 AM on a Thursday and 4 PM on a Friday so people had time to shop their sale.  Those times are usually when teachers are at work, heading to work, or leaving work, so the pictures/blog posts didn't reach as many viewers as the ones I post on my own schedule. On top of the non-chronological feed (algorithm) not exactly working in my favor, pictures in my classroom typically get the most likes but I think it's highly unethical to use a public school classroom as a backdrop for paid sponsorships.

Doing a little meme challenge is a fun way to engage my followers with posts that didn't reach many people the first time and to also provide them with something free that they like to see in return :) Hope that helped answer your question! If you want to know anything else, lmk!",1554076834

"tattoos","t5_2qj9g","For my first tattoo I went to a local parlour and didn't give too much thought to it because I had the design drawn out already; all I had to do was send them the picture. They print it out, put the template on my body and tattoo it, like tracing an image with tracing paper. Easy, right?

Afterwards I find that there are lines they've missed that I guess they just didn't see, so I go back a few weeks later for a touch up. It's been about two years now and I'm not saying I hate the tattoo but when I look at it for a while I can see what's not been done properly. Parts where the line work is wonky or faded in some places but not others. Dot work that looks put of place and as if they weren't paying attention to what they were doing. It makes me wish I'd scouted out a shop with artists that actually took care over what they were doing, or gotten recommendations from people with tattoos beforehand.

So to answer your question, I'd say try to look for an artist who knows what they're doing. Ask people you know with tattoos who they go to and if they'd recommend them for the piece you want. Much better to have a look around beforehand, rather than dive into the first tattoo parlour you see because it might be that you end up with something you look at in a few months or years and think it could have been done better.

EDIT: Going with a cheap option just to save money isn't worth it in the long run. Better to go with a parlour of quality rather than the one across the road that can do it for half the price, just with slightly less sterilized needles.",1554076837

When the Ace Attorney Trilogy was announced to release in the US on Feb 21, it was immediately up for pre-order on the digital stores for PS4/Xbox One.

If you go to Borderlands.com and select to pre-order it, it only gives you the option to order from 2K and GameStop, both of which only offer a physical copy. In the age of digital media, they don't wait to offer the digital code. So I take that as ""we're not getting a digital release.""

CDC Argues: Aluminum-containing adjuvants are vaccine ingredients that have been used in vaccines since the 1930s. Small amounts of aluminum are added to help the body build stronger immunity against the germ in the vaccine. Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food, and water. Scientific research has shown the amount of aluminum exposure in people who follow the recommended vaccine schedule is low and is not readily absorbed by the body.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an alcoholic, so naturally I am hard as fuck on myself, self-critical, self-deprecating, depressed, anxious, you name it...

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe the ""motivation model"" of sobriety isn't working for you, so what you're working towards finding something that does, and to me that's a helluva lot more than most people are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a couple starts and stops before getting to the place I'm at now, but I never lasted 250 days, 2 weeks maybe, but nearly 250 days is definitely something worth being proud of.

&amp;#x200B;

Somebody in this sub once described relapse as a cross-country road trip. If your car breaks down when your 245 miles away from home you don't scrap the car and walk all the way back. You get that thing fixed and you keep plowing on with the knowledge that you were able to make it this far at all in the first place!

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to provide you with some flowery niceties about hardwork and dedication paying off, but sometimes life can feel like a constant cycle of rejection, especially when you're on that unemployment tip.

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, as someone who's been unemployed and trying to maintain sobriety in handful of situations, some as recent as a couple months ago, I can assure you this is no cake walk, but I can say that all that pain, all these challenges you're going through right now, they will make you stronger, they will make you more experienced, and an all around wiser person at the end of the day for it.

IWNDWYT you got this!

Unfortunately nothing will knock you out quite like benzos, but some things that help me are diphenhydramine (benadryl), 5-htp (this seems to give me more restful sleep), melatonin, and marijuana (there is evidence that this also degrades the quality of your sleep, but I don't think near to the extent of benzos ore alcohol. overall it has been a godsend for me in terms of sleep)",1554076840

This view that the ‚ÄúUS is a force for good in the world‚Äù is just wrong, and filled with western bias. A major reason these other countries seem more barbaric to you (and why you are suggesting that the US is the best of a bad bunch) is that the US has kept them in poverty, in war-torn conflicts, under economic suppression, under the rule of US-backed dictators etc.

We can play the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù game all day long, but there are mountains of evidence to show that the US has had a truly awful foreign policy over the last 50 years that has done more damage in the world than anything else. There is absolutely no evidence that the US is the ‚Äúleast shitty option‚Äù. In fact, the opposite seems to be true.

Some examples:

During late 90s, early 00s, the US gave money and weapons to royalist forces which then slaughtered Nepalese communists in a civil war that killed 20,000.

US interfered massively and directly in the election and support of Boris Yeltsin, a situations which led to massive social decline in Russia as well as economic oppression, unemployment, poverty and corruption.

US directly backed West Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani war, allowing them to kill up to 3 million civilians and leading to a massive refugee crisis (something like 10 million fled into India).

US bombed east Cambodia until there was nothing left, killing about 150,000 civilians, something Nixon directly denied.

US dropped 400,000 tons of napalm on Vietnam, a war which killed millions and millions. Their use of Agent Orange is a downright war crime, leading to the deaths and disfigurement of millions.

Direct support for the Khmer Rouge which massacres 2.5 million people.

My Lai Massacre - need I say more?

The US overthrew a democratically elected leader in Indonesia in 1965. The CIA backed and set up his replacement, a regime which massacred a million civilians with US-supplied weapons. All because these civilians were supposedly communists.

Prior to the Personal Endeavours, I would not have noticed.

But in the simplified scenario of the Foundry Endeavour Grind, where your eyes are glued to the counters, you don't see the counter reacting to certain things . . .  some times. Not enough to be sure.

Powerful secondary weapons hits for example - the group goes down, but nothing in the Personal Endeavour tracker for that damage type. But the primary weapon fire is counted. Then later it looks like the secondary is counted.

After the Borg have adapted, it doesn't seem to track any damage for Personal Endeavour types either, maybe. Even though the minimal damage floater ""1""s are floating up. I think.

The other 2 would be your SDO's which you arent paid for and dont need to take leave to fill.

So you would basically be charged 24 hrs of AL for last week if you worked a total of 16 prior to your vacation.  You are not going to be charged 40 hrs of AL since that would push you into OT, which will not happen.

If I were guessing, I'd guess the vodka will probably still get most of the potency...  it may just taste disgusting.   I think it would be worth testing a couple of doses worth of each.

I would NOT use the isopropyl.  It's toxic.  Not like...  methanol toxic...  but toxic.  It actually turns into acetone in your liver.  (fingernail polish remover.  Yuck.)  The right kind of alcohol is ethanol...  and everclear is about the purest and cheapest form of that you can buy over the counter...  because if there WERE another cheap and easy to get but safe to ingest kind of alcohol...  people would be drinking it instead of paying liquor store prices, right?   

In fact... when you go to the paint store, you can buy alcohol by the gallon for cheap...  but it's labeled 'denatured'...  which is a term that means 'they intentionally put poison in there, to make sure that if you drink it, you die.'  There's some history with prohibition, because of course the mob was buying solvent grade ethanol, dumping it in a bath tub with juniper berries, and selling it as gin.  So the government started adding methanol to 'denature' all solvent-grade ethanol, to make sure you couldn't get around it.    All the people who go blind or die of methanol poisoning - intentional poisoning by government decree!   

So...  unfortunately... there's not a great answer other than everclear.  Liquor stores are the only places you can buy human safe ethanol, unless you're a laboratory who has a hookup (or a moonshiner who can make it yourself!)",1554076843

I don't think he has awful cardio but id say average at best and I think to beat Khabib requires Ferguson/Holloway/colby tier cardio since he WILL get you down in the first and it comes down to a war of attrition from there, how much will be left in the tank after that?

He has heart for days that previously has allowed him to drag himself that last inch across the finish line despite running on empty....but thats when he gets people to fight the fight he wants them to that plays to his comfort zone, Khabib most likely will not.

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","Get rid of the spearmen without shields and replace them with two swordsmen and a unit of crossbows. Save up for a mortar if you can. If you have the Grim and the Grave DLC I would also suggest Free Company Militia instead of swordsmen, for their versatility. If you need to, go into Marienburg land and start raiding (the option for it is on the bottom left when you select your character). It will damage relations and earn you some money (the amount varies in my experience). If they declare war on you, try and bait them out with am ambush and fight Marienburg in the field. This will make taking the city much easier if you win. You could also try attacking the Greenskins close to Marienburg (the ones with the red and white banner, I forget the name) or the ones south of you (Crooked Moons) and loot their settlements for some quick money. 

Whatever you do, keep the halberdier, reiksguard, handgunner, and wizard alive.

Alright, so my fiance and I had a baby together a couple moths ago.

Before then, his parents didn't necessarily mind if they saw us or not. In an entire year, they invited us to 2 events total, not even necessarily holidays. Not only that, but they always treat my fiance as the black sheep of the family. When he was younger, his mom gave his dad an ultimatum and they ended up sending him to a private school.

Since our baby's birth, his parents have been wanting to spend time with her. I don't mind. I let them have their time with her and she even gets to spend the night with her grandparents if they so choose.

However, they don't necessarily attempt to make my fiance and I feel welcome. They will make small talk, but other than that, it feels as though they want us to leave so they can have their time with the baby.

On top of that, whenever I suggest something for them to do with her, they always act like it's wrong. Our baby has to go to physical therapy for a common tight muscle issue and they've given us exercises to do with her to stretch it out and make it stronger. I showed his parents the exercises and they said that even just going to PT is a waste of time. Needless to say, they haven't done any of the exercises. They refuse to do tummy time because they think it's bs. Our pediatrician even recommended a special juice for her as her digestive cycle is a little backed up. I sent some juice with them and it came back untouched. They said they wouldn't give it to her because it will rot her teeth (she doesn't even have any teeth yet!).

It just hurts my feelings and I feel like my wishes for my child's best interest are being walked all over. Other than letting them watch her once a week, I don't necessarily want anything else to do with them.

AITA?

Or WIBTA if I told my fiance about this? I wouldn't make him stay away from them himself, but I wouldn't see them any more than I had to.

Also, I think you are confusing the state of D2's launch as being an identical replica of D1's launch mistakes when in reality, D2's launch failures were due to the fact they had designed the game for a much more casual audience. This was done in order to attract the sort of players who either quit D1 early on or could never get into it as a ""grind game"" but doing so alienated the hardcore fanbase, who supported them for 3 years, by significantly removing/reducing many incentives to play long and reasons to grind for endgame content (and the lack thereof). Their intention for D2's launch state was in their mind to avoid what happened to most (casual) people for D1's launch of running away when they saw past the post-campaign as just ""mindless grinding"".

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I would ask you to consider waiting. Here‚Äôs why:

When I was younger I thought I had a big nose. It wasn‚Äôt something strong and noble, like yours. In my mind, it was bulbous and grotesque. I felt that way for many years, just never told anyone because I was quite embarrassed. I spent way too much time examining my nose at every possible angle to identify my ‚Äúflaws.‚Äù

Then one day a guy (now my hubby) called my nose cute, and I went back to the mirror to re-assess the situation. To my surprise, upon further review, I did not have a bulb on the end of my nose. And it‚Äôs pretty darn straight. But what I really wanted, and my sister has, is a straight nose that was strong and noble. 

She and I talked about it. She has a straight, beautiful nose, and when she puts her hair up, she looks like a Grecian statue. She told me she hated her nose and wished she had one like mine! Her nostrils show the insides of her nose!

I told her, no, you don‚Äôt want my nose! Look at how big it is! Not like your nose.

She said oh, but your nose is so cute and small! I would love to have your nose!

So. We ended up talking about who in the family we look like. I look almost completely like my mom. She looks like the other side of the family. But we were both so glad that our little insecurities (everyone has them) didn‚Äôt lead us to permanently change our noses! I can‚Äôt tell you how much I treasure this.

You‚Äôre young and living in a time when people dissect every single aspect of themselves and compare to all the others. That‚Äôs so hard to deal with, I know, I did it too. But what all of you examining yourselves on a microscopic level are not considering is there‚Äôs only one you! Even if you‚Äôre a twin. There is no ‚Äúideal‚Äù face‚Äîwe all get our very own faces. Beauty is found in so many different types of faces, and it‚Äôs entirely subjective. Surely all of us responding think your nose is fine as it is. Wouldn‚Äôt you want your future life partner to find that nose as attractive as we strangers do?

Heidi Montag got something like 15 procedures done in one day, thinking she would be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù after it and could, idk, do car ads or something. Since then she has said publicly that she highly regrets having the procedures done because she is no longer recognized physically as one of her family. Any resemblance she had to them is gone forever. She no longer looks like her mom, and now that she‚Äôs a little older and wiser, this really saddens her.

There‚Äôs also the question of, how badly do you want this new nose? Badly enough to risk your life? Because they need to put you under for surgery, and every single time you‚Äôre put under, there is a small chance that you will have a bad reaction to anesthesia, or some other complication happens. Yes, people do die during routine surgeries. Not a lot, but it‚Äôs a very real risk. 

And what if your nose job is botched? This happens too. You have to do surgery again to get it fixed, so that‚Äôs double the risk. Some nose job patients end up with structural problems in their noses that block their airways and reduce your ability to draw air. They have trouble doing some physical activity because of it. 

Have you looked at photos online of nose jobs? Do it, look at all of them, not just the before and after photos. There are great photos out there that show all aspects of the surgery. Looked up ‚Äúbotched nose surgery.‚Äù 

Keep in mind that what you‚Äôre talking about is taking the healthy, well-functioning nose you have and cutting, scraping, grinding it to hopefully be what you want. Hopefully.

Many very beautiful women have interesting noses. In fact, the bland ‚Äúperfect‚Äù faces all start to look the same. This is happening in Hollywood as well as South Korea, where there is huge pressure to make your features generic.

And I want you to know, as someone who had nose surgery for a sinus problem, it‚Äôs extremely unpleasant in the aftermath. The first three days are just awful. That said, my improved ability to take in air was a huge relief.

Now with all that much said, there‚Äôs the underlying issue which is that you‚Äôre perhaps a little overly sensitive about your nose. And that maybe that bump is not actually so pronounced. And that you‚Äôre an attractive woman already. Could any of those things be the case? 

Because the last thing you would want to do is go and do something permanent when the problem can be solved by simply changing your mind. That‚Äôs it! You can DECIDE that it‚Äôs actually an ass-kickin nose that is so great because it‚Äôs healthy and strong and lovely and the only one you have. And that right there means you save $20-30k or so and all you had to do was decide to like it fine as it is.

What you haven‚Äôt said is that you are ridiculed on the street, that your nose draws negative attention on a regular basis, and it‚Äôs making your life hell. That‚Äôs what people say when they have extremely large or misshapen noses. Some some people have no noses at all. These are people for whom nose jobs make more sense. When people are suffering from public reaction to their noses and are ostracized or hide themselves from view.

In my opinion, you‚Äôre a beautiful woman with an attractive nose who might focus on every little ‚Äúimperfection‚Äù, and may not be satisfied with just the nose job. Maybe next you‚Äôll want a chin implant. And a boob job. Then those weird ass crease things they put in the corner of your mouth, and so on, until they look like lumpy mannequins with unnatural features. Some people go down this path of multiple plastic surgery procedures and are STILL not satisfied with how they look. It‚Äôs called body dysmorphia, and it‚Äôs considered an illness.

What my mom (a nurse practitioner and former ear, nose, and throat surgical nurse), always said when we complained about our big noses, big feet, funny toes, etc., was ‚Äúit works and it‚Äôs the only on you got.‚Äù Not one drop of sympathy because none of us had any facial deformity and she has seen things like this go wrong. Had seen perfectly healthy people develop life long problems from unnecessary surgeries. 

This got long...but I‚Äôm not sorry. These are all the things I know to consider in such a situation. It‚Äôs a major life decision. I hope you think about this for a long time, and talk with supportive and kind others about it.

Whitehead was a poor choice for city manager because he'd not managed a small, improvished, and declining town, with big problems (like Independence).  His lack of experience and knowledge in doing so may be why he insists on spending his costly time on PR pieces, instead of working to resolve some of those big problems.

Hopefully, a new city manager will accomplish what Whitehead's largely failed to accomplish.  Also, hopefully, the new city manager will understand the importance of the City having an independent attorney, as opposed to having one that serves three different public agencies.  How can a city attorney represent the interests of multiple public agencies at the same time, especially when the responsibilities and needs of those agencies often overlap?

It‚Äôs a struggle that a lot of even trans people put other trans people through. The whole argument against gender constructs trans &amp; LGBT people have been combating is one ‚ÄòYour genitals &amp; mannerisms correlate to your gender by default‚Äù but some trans people are quick to tell you that if you don‚Äôt get SRS then you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot really trans‚Äù.

Cis women are so quick to be defended for being called a ‚Äútomboy‚Äù rather than just being a woman for simple things such as liking sports or not shaving. Because you‚Äôre not any less of a woman for liking those things. They fight for the title of trans woman being recognized as real women but often forget to treat them as such... it‚Äôs a sad and unfair scenario trans people deal with. I hate it. The same people believe that an FTM person who wear makeup or nail polish are invalid, but cis men who do are valid. That an MTF person who likes having short hair or not shaving body hair are invalid, but cis women who do are valid.

It‚Äôs wrong.

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","I disagree. My leanings tend towards the bottom left, and I despise neoliberalism. But I can see where you're coming from.

Classical (economic) liberals believed that government should stay out of the way of the market. But this result in recurring crises, culminating in the Great Depression. Keynsian liberals, seeing that WWII mobilization had addressed the depression, argued that government could step in stabilize the economy. Then came the stagflation of the 1970s. Neoliberals emerged who argued that markets, not government, should do as much as possible: but where liberals believed that markets would self-organize, neoliberals realized that they would not, so argued that government's role should be to create markets wherever possible.

The role of government in the economy is the key differentiator:

  - Classical liberalism: _laissez faire_
  - Keynsians: government spending to smooth out the economic cycle
  - Neoliberals: create markets for everything possible and protect them from interference (e.g. from national boundaries and from the vagaries of democracy)

Neoliberalism, if anything, is more market-oriented than was classical liberalism. It's not about  government control: it's more about clearing the deck of anything that gets in their way. It is a technocratic creed that narrows the space for democracy and put markets in charge of governing everyday life. I believe it has been described as inverted authoritarianism, where control is wielded by private actors.

In my view, the manifest failures of neoliberal globalization led to the populism of the right and left today.",1554076846

When I do eat breakfast, the most common one is cereal. So easy to throw together quickly. Or if I'm out of the house, I'll stop at a bagel shop and get a bagel or two.

On weekends or days where I'm feeling like taking the extra time to cook, I'll make two fried eggs, bacon, sausage, toast. *Occasionally* an omelet but usually I fuck them up so I mostly leave that for when I'm eating breakfast at a restaurant.

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","PKing someone to obtain desirable items/supplies is griefing? HMMM. No it's not. There is a clear incentive.

PKing people even without any incentive in the Wildernes isn't griefing anyway. I'll kill someone for skeletal/royal I won't even pick up just because its a PvP area and I can. Its not griefing, its engaging in PvP in a PvP that you willingly, knowingly enter. The only PKing I would consider griefing can't exist in RuneScape, I would call blocking progression (in ways such as spawn-trapping or camping to block quests) griefing but thats it. I wouldn't even call the latter griefing in RuneScape's dangerous PvP depending on whether the PKer was trying to get loot or stop people finishing the quest. Obviously, quests in RS3 are all instanced so this isn't a problem regardless.

If you want a non-PvP threat try literally any content outside of wildy, which is 99% of the game. Don't need to turn the only open PvP area into a safe area to cater to noobs. The only thing that is divisive is people like you who are griefing by trying to ruin a place other people enjoy.

"aoe","t5_2s72o","Glad to hear that :) Sadly I played yesterday 2 games in multiplayer, but I didn't read your comment until yet, so I have no save :( But here is again a somewhat detailed report from me :D

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with an low amount of villagers occurred again in both games. This time we used no custom AI/per files, but it was again a map created by me. The AI built more villagers, but again not enough. 2 AI players built 24 vills (started in tool age, this number is at least as high as before Update 8), 3 others only 18 (2 of them started in bronze age, 1 in iron age; 18 is better than in most other random maps or scenarios). But I don't think, it has much to do with the starting ages, if at all! In previous games they often had just around 8 to 11 vills (including the start vills, starting in stone or tool age). In this particular scenario the tool age players started with 800 food in comparison to the others with 400 or 500 food.

All of them created the military units as in the single player tests, but an lower amount. I guess the problem was again related to the weaker economy.

In the same scenario, tested in singleplayer, the AIs had 22 to 32 vills and recruited military units until the pop cap was reached (which I set for them at 75 in the editor). They even built houses to support a pop cap of around 200 (which is great, especially if they would use it, when allowed).

&amp;#x200B;

The AI never built so many vills and troops before in singleplayer, so is this an intented change of the Update 8? :) And I guess this is, what you intend for the multiplayer too :) And very important for me: If you create your own AI files, should the AI be able to handle building lists containing 200 units? Is this modified with the ""ID 152 //SNHouseOverage"" in the per file?

And thanks for your detailed answer, it's very appreciated! I'm excited for the news :)",1554076849

Biggest issue I see with them each time I use them, is a slight lag from the treadmill to the Android tablet (by the way, they are Android tablets, not iPads at my studio anyway). So the time, distance, speed, and incline on the tablet is like 2-3 seconds behind what is shown on the treadmill.

When they don't work, usually they just don't work at all. You can't sign into them as they keep crashing/rebooting. 
Other times I've seen it get the incline and speed swapped. Others where it doesn't keep track of all your start/stop segments on the tread, so the overall distance is off.

I think it's comedic that you didn't elaborate to me like I asked.  There's a Universe of difference between making an inference with the evidence available and just believing something on faith.  However, it's pretty compelling evidence, if you ask me.  Consider this: how is it that genetics and comparative morphology both support the phylogeny of the order Asterales as having shared common descent?  DNA, the unit of inheritance, can be used to trace ancestry among extant species, just like its used to generate haplotype maps of human lineages.  However, isn't it strange that these flowers in Asterales are not only genetically close to one another, but no matter their diversity of shape, coloration, and growth habits, they all feature the *exact* same pollination mechanism?  We biologists almost universally support the monophyly of Asterales, support the line of common descent.  It's literally the best conclusion we can make with the available evidence, faith is not relevant to what the data indicate.

Just to complicate things a bit more: BlackVue 1CH dash cams can not be upgraded to 2 CH. They will lack the rear camera port, as the 1CH dash cams are physically different than the 2CH versions. 

Thinkware dash cams which have 1CH/2CH versions can be upgraded from 1 CH -&gt; 2CH. 

* [Thinkware FA200 IRC 2CH](https://www.blackboxmycar.com/collections/thinkware/products/thinkware-fa200?variant=12736075661367) ($240 USD) - Includes Dashcam/IR cam + Micro SD card + Hardwire kit.

* [Thinkware FA200 WiFi](https://www.blackboxmycar.com/collections/thinkware/products/thinkware-fa200-wifi-dash-cam?variant=12848998580279) ($130-190 USD) - Lacks IR cam, has Micro SD card option, Hardwire kit option.

* [BlackVue DR590W-2CH WiFi](https://www.blackboxmycar.com/collections/blackvue/products/blackvue-dr590w-2ch-dash-cam?variant=6844741287991) ($240-260 USD)

* [BlackVue DR590W-2CH IR WiFi](https://www.blackboxmycar.com/collections/blackvue/products/blackvue-dr590w-2ch-ir?variant=8151019126839) ($280-300 USD)

Look around for the best price.  - Standard copy pasta.

IR lenses listed above this line are more interior IR lenses.

* BlackVue DR650S 2CH IR Truck -  Exterior weather proof lens.

* BlackVue DR750S 2CH IR Truck - Exterior weather proof lens.

* Thinkware F770 2CH IR Truck - I think has an Exterior weather proof lens.

* Thinkware F800/F800 Pro IR Truck - I think has an Exterior weather proof lens.

* BlackVue DR900S 2CH - Does not have an IR/Truck version that is weather proof at this time - AFAIK.

"PSP","t5_2qjts","You can buy another battery but most are chinese not oem quality,a better investment would be a usb power bank like an anker and use that to play and charge on usb,still portable.

Remember the psp came out a long time ago now so of course the battery life is not going to be good the battery is due to be like almost 15yrs old give or take a year or 2

A well used oem battery depending on what your doing will probably get 4-6hrs out of it,now imagine if you have that 10,000mah anker usb hooked up....

Given a long enough time line extremely rare things happen. Societies can collapse quicker than they took to build. The lifetime of a society tends to be governed by the power law. Power law statics are unintuitive and catch people by surprise. A stock can have a history of only going up until the day it crashes. I don't think that the US government will become a tyranny in my lifetime. But the next 10 or 100 lifetimes goes beyond my ability to predict. One rogue nuke or natural disaster can radically alter the future of a country.

Chests can hold gold blocks in them.

Chests can have NBT values so that they can have items in them when placed

By the 6th layer, the chest has enough chests that the gold inside them is enough mass for a black hole

By layer 20, it‚Äôs more mass than the entire universe

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

What happens is that iPhones (and android) do their best to maintain 24p (or whatever) but if a message comes in or a app updates or the email gets checked or whatever and the phone is low on resources it will just quietly lower the frame rate. So most seconds are 24p , but some seconds are 22p or 19p or whatever.

"Steel_Division","t5_3jbdp","I played a lot during the short 48 hour beta and I am fairly convinced that Vanguard and Maverick as presently designed are severely underpowered.

Even a Juggernaut in full retreat in A (which **never** happened to me) only has to avoid losing on VP's for 20 minutes, after which point the Vanguard and Maverick players have no chance whatsoever. As soon as the Juggernaut is stable or positive on points, it's over. And that can easily happen in phase A where you stabilize on 50/50 or even +1. But even -1 or -2 is completely acceptable from the Juggernaut's perspective, as it will take 400-100 minutes to actually lose, which will not happen.

This will require some testing, but I have a strong suspicion that even an extremely high Vanguard early income like 180 or 200 would be very winnable by Juggernaut. Obviously in such a setting the Vanguard will take a lot more VP's in A; but it does not seem likely to me even with 200 income that a Vanguard player can actually close out the game before time turns the tide.

Maverick in particular could have a HUGE phase B income, take two thirds of the map before C, and still lose, due to how huge a weakness 80 points of income in C really is.",1554076857

This only really would apply to the bully example or a toxic relationship situation.

Killing with kindness should mean being kind to yourself, and in turn, making those around you more positive. You shouldn't go out of your way to try to please others because at the end of the day, your validation is the only one that matters. Youre all youve got. Dont waste precious time on trying to get the approval of others. Be kind to yourself, do whats right for you. And if you recognize youre in the wrong, own up to it like a mature adult.

If you end up driving through Wisconsin, send me a note ahead of time if you want a safe place to stay for the night (we have a large AirBnB adjacent to our home).

We have recently added the useful feature of Title Flair! You can set this manually by clicking Flair under your post once you have submitted your post, but if you missed it in the rules there is a much better way that will automatically flair your post!   

To do this simply add what your post is about in brackets before your title. For example for a Build Log you can type [Build Log] before your post so that it looks like this; [Build Log]My new awesome build!, and the bot will automatically set your flair to Build Log! This works for Build Log, Build Showcase, News, Hardware News, Hardware Release, Discussion, and Miscellaneous!

For R&amp;D purposes I‚Äòm sure they use much more modern systems, like an Audio Precision or a Klippel, with typical sweep measurements, or possibly am MLSS.  
But for quality control a stepped sine like this is enough. Changes would cost money and yield no additional benefit for this application.  
  
What determines the resolution?  
The FFT length, which is limited by the sweep length. And of course the samplerate of your Analyzer.  
For example we typically measure with 2-second sweeps with a samplerate of 96 kHz for most applications. Higher samplerates are only used for intermodulation or ultrasound measurements.  
  
The distance between microphone and loudspeaker is an issue, but more important is the distance to any surfaces that would create reflections. This will require windowing of the signal, and effectively limit low frequency resolution.

Women's sports is often a hard sell. I work camera at sports at the university level so I see it first hand.

Most basketball/soccer/volleyball games are female/male double headers and the attendance almost always doubles for the men's game. It is what it is.

It's kind of like when a brand will try to become a meme like Old Spice. The problem is that they're co-opting social media platforms and manipulating people. It IS effective advertising because thousands of people will see the brand's name and brand awareness is very effective advertising, even if they are not advertising promotions or the quality of their products. I guess you have to think consumerism, advertising, and manipulative marketing techniques are bad in the first place to be against this kind of thing, which I presume you are not, but that is exactly why people are downvoting screenshots from corporate twitter...

*****
&gt; Southern and eastern European countries are more concerned about emigration than immigration, according to a wide-ranging survey of attitudes in 14 EU countries.

&gt; In Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, six countries where population levels are either flatlining or falling sharply, more citizens said emigration was a worry than immigration, according to the poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations.

&gt; In some countries, the fear of emigration was so great that large numbers of people believed compatriots should not be allowed to leave their country for long periods of time.

And just in general, there's no point to ""restore"" Batman and Superman's status as role models since they never lost said status in the first place (Well, Superman did with Man of Steel, but the inclusion of Batman leads me to believe the intent here is to discuss the characters in general). The fact this article refers to Batman and Superman prior to this film as ‚Äúinhuman‚Äù and ‚Äúabstract‚Äù proves to me they have about as little knowledge about the character as Snyder himself does. Zack Snyder poorly deconstructed Batman and Superman before ever properly constructing them. If he truly wanted to turn them into the characters we know them as, he would've done this when he first started working on the characters rather than take multiple films to tell an arc the comics told within the span of 1 page. Superman isn‚Äôt meaningless because he doesn‚Äôt commit atrocities, he becomes meaningless when somebody who doesn‚Äôt understand the point of the character tries to ‚Äúfix‚Äù him by taking away not just every single notable aspect of not just the franchise, but the character himself, creating something that doesn‚Äôt resemble the original besides superficial aspects and loses all the meaning the original has.",1554076863

&gt; Andrew Sullivan‚Äîof all people!‚Äîwrote a 1988 article poking fun at this sought-after honor (‚Äúthere is no more glittering prize a young American can win‚Äù), and noting that those who win it seem to possess ‚Äúfecklessness, excessive concern that peasants be aware of their achievement, and a certain hemophilia of character.‚Äù They are chosen ‚Äúnot for their creative brilliance but for their slogging ability to make all the right career moves and please their elders.‚Äù The Rhodes recipient, he wrote, is the‚Äúapotheosis of the hustling apple-polisher, the r√©sum√©-obsessed goody goody,‚Äù honorees often having a kind of ‚Äúbland eugenic perfection.‚Äù They ‚Äúare good at seeking and getting approval. They were good boys at every stage. They were the kind of guys who were editor of the yearbook in high school.‚Äù (Or the president of the senior class.) From Oxford, he said, the Scholars tend to take up unexciting but well-paying professional positions, such as working for McKinsey &amp; Company. Sullivan predicted that a Rhodes scholar could never be president, because being president involves making decisions, which they would be unable to do. (Four years later, with the election of Bill Clinton, he was proved both wrong and right.)

He also brings up Chomsky's definition of the factors of success as a ""combination of greed, cynicism, obsequiousness and subordination, lack of curiosity and independence of mind, [and] self-serving disregard for others."" which lines up very well with this.",1554076863

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Hey /r/DotA2 community, I'm looking for some feedback or discussion around a ""lore time-line"" concept. There are a lot of apps out there that list out the lore of the heroes &amp; items, but I haven't really seen any that go in-depth into the lore that you can find on Wikis ([DotA2 Gamepedia](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/)) or fan-made sites.

My interest is trying to visualize the sequence of events in the DotA-vers(es). I'm working on a mobile app (Android &amp; iOS) that with that focus. So DotA time-line, general game, in-depth hero &amp; item lore - linking any lore that connects heros with items, etc. Other things that would be cool to have: Sounds, responses &amp; game mechanisms. Maybe some sort of community feature.

Content: Mix of own writing &amp; grabbing lore &amp; assets from [DotA2 Gamepedia](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/) under the Creative Commons license. And the plan is to put up the game lore, time-line content &amp; order as well as hero &amp; item lore on GitHub or similar place where people can contribute to correct/update/add to it.

License: App &amp; content will be under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the App &amp; content is nowhere close to being done.. lots to research &amp; add! This is more like a proof-of-concept.",1554076865

We also use them to mow, weed eat and edge when we go on vacation (which is $40 for all of that, our yard is on the smaller end though). They've been great so far and was the company we choose to install our spinkler system (which they did an amazing job with too!) They will also come out if you need an extra weed control treatment, which is free, and also came in handy because our house was a new construction and we had weeds up the wazoo.

If I had one complaint (which is honestly minor). They give no heads up as to when they'll show up.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

Why do we have debt? Since the last balanced budget (Clinton‚Äôs last years, a joint effort by both parties), we have...
- added a huge government agency (OHS)
- fought two unfunded wars, that led to destabilization and further expenditures and a continuing drain on our resources)
- had three tax cuts for the wealthy (that were supposed to pay for themselves in job creation, but none did as claimed, but they were repeated anyway)
- had the unfunded Medicare-D expansion that was basically using government money to bribe the elderly for votes 
- had major cuts to oversight, leading to greater gains in the upper levels of the private sector... but increased tax cuts to corporations (negating the effect of any of those gains on tax gains)
- had to spend to counter the economic crisis that was so big it took the world with it (and the spending we did lessened the damage and sped recovery, paying for itself)
- had a healthcare reform plan (that should have paid for itself, but was consistently undermined by the same political opponents who refused to help fix it)
- had to spend money to deal with the consequences of a foolish trade war that should never have started


One item on this list of increases is not an ongoing problem ‚Äî its the one that was trying to fix the damage caused by most of the rest. 

The damage caused here is ideological. And the same people insisting on causing the damage have zero interest in working together to meet goals. They showed that in the eight years under Obama when they deliberately killed the good-faith policies of the past. They showed it with every unethical action in the last two years. They‚Äôve shown it in the refusal to hold their own party accountable. They‚Äôve made a mockery of our nation and our government. 

Before anything changes and we can fix these issues, a near-impossible change needs to happen. The Right needs to hold their own to the standards they use to attack others. Until that happens, nothing will change. ",1554076865

"OCLions","t5_2u29i","Your intent doesn't *really* matter. People can be well-intentioned and still foul someone. Look at Sane's bad challenge just prior to that: He was 100% intending to go for the ball, got there a half-second late, and completely laid the DC player out by accident. His challenge wound up being so bad he even picked up a card! Dom's wasn't *nearly* that bad.

What made Dom's tackle reckless (from my vantage point here on my couch, mind you) was that he went in with his studs out in a situation where he could easily have just stayed on his feet. He also made minimal contact with Rooney's knee (or, at least, it *looked* like he did on the replay) and caused us to gain an advantage (we would have had a throw-in).

I'm not a referee (anymore, at least), but I could see myself having called that. Was it a soft call? Yeah, sure! But, it *is* in the rules of the game that referees may call fouls when there's no contact. That's what I was trying to get across with my response to /u/Ethanc17: Lalas is 100% correct, even if we don't all necessarily  agree with the call itself.",1554076867

"OpenChristian","t5_2rvuh","I get it. And you are right, I made it sound like everyone in the church is that way. That is wrong. When I was in the church system (well over 50 years), I was not that way and I know there are many still there who are loving, kind, accepting and non-judgmental. I should have made it clear my comment was for some in the system not all. Certainly many people follow and love God who are in the institutional church and there are many outside it who love and follow him also. Your point is well taken and thank you for being so kind about it.",1554076867
"The_Donald","t5_38unr","I'm torn on this thought. While it's an awesome idea, learning at your own pace with limited distractions, it also has two huge drawbacks. One, the limited social interaction, which I'm fine with personally, no tutors or teachers to ask or debate with, no influx of ideas in a real time setting. And two... it's the internet, imagine how much disinformation there is out there now, about even the most innocent of topics, now figure in how much bullshit there'd be on half the sites offering 'free' degrees.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.

&gt; A comedian with no political experience has won the most votes in the first round of Ukraine&amp;#039;s presidential elections, according to exit polls.

&gt; Mr Poroshenko, a chocolate magnate and one of Ukraine&amp;#039;s wealthiest people, was elected in a snap vote after former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled in the February 2014 Maidan Revolution, which was followed by Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Crimea and a Russian-backed insurgency in the east.

&gt; The next president will inherit a deadlocked conflict between Ukrainian troops and the eastern separatists, while Ukraine strives to fulfil EU requirements for closer economic ties.

"videography","t5_2qwgz","Stop being a freelance videographer and start being a video production company. Find a niche that will produce return business and push on that hard. Your focus, time, and effort should be spent towards being a businessman, the art is the easy part. For a lot of artists it's hard to accept the ""ugly side"" and that is where they burn out.

I originally come from photography but I do a lot of video work nowadays. I started shooting for pocket money in grade 10, ended up in college for photo/media. Came out of that and did freelance weddings, but really I took anything that came. I went through 2-3 part time jobs until I turned 27. I was living with my girlfriend and pulling in 30k-40k total, it's not really liveable, but my girl was supporting me. At around 26-27, I basically got sick of weddings and coasted doing portraits in my girl's condo and working a side job. I was earning 40k at that point. There was also outside pressure to get engaged, have kids etc etc. I went through depression and therapy came out at 27 with the idea of being a successful business. It took a few years to really get going but it eventually stuck.

Long story short, I'm 35 now and I run a real estate marketing company. I've had my fair share of good luck, made mistakes, worked so hard that most people don't believe me. It didn't make a lot of money right away, but after year 3ish it became really good. I employ a handful of people, and I earn a lower-upperclass income in a major metropolitan city. 

As a 35 year old, sometimes I think my job isn't as fulfilling as helping sick kids or something, but in my own way I think I help people get the most for their homes and help agents make a living and put food on their tables.

You are 22, you have a long way to go, you haven't seen half of what is out there yet. I can't tell you if it's for you or not, but achieving success is not an anomaly, It's a mindset. Btw. I married her.",1554076871

"UCSantaBarbara","t5_2shs9","Dear EEMB 3L  Students,

Welcome to the Introductory Biology Lab series.  In this quarter, we will be doing lab exercises that cover the Diversity of Life.    This is a fast-paced class.  Reading the lab manual and completing the weekly online pre-lab assignments prior to class will help you get the most out of each lab activity and therefore better prepare you for the lab exams. Make sure that you give yourself enough time to complete the pre-lab assignment.  Allot at least an hour for your pre-lab, so don't wait until the last minute to start it. All portions of the pre-lab must be completed with a 70% or better before the beginning of that week's lab section or you will not be allowed to attend class.  The first pre-lab assignment is due at the start of your enrolled section during week 1.

Lab exams will follow a lab practical format which will be described in greater detail lat er on in the course.  The following material will be needed by the first day of lab next week (labs start April 1st).

Required material all available at the UCSB Bookstore:

EEMB 3L lab manual (ISBN 978-1-5339-1846-8 )
Lab Coat
Goggles


The first lab section will cover part of Exercise 1.



To reiterate we expect EEMBL 3L students to:

Come to lab WITH your PPE on time.
Complete and earn at least 70% on the pre-lab assignment before coming to class.
Be participatory in lab and respectful to your fellow classmates and your TA.




Best of luck this quarter.



Sincerely,

Dr. Nguyen

"askanincel","t5_s29zp","&gt;and have a decent personality that isn't totally loathesome.

Seeing as how Waffen SS officers were beloved by German women, Neo-Nazis ( openly ) get laid all the time, Dark Triad traits are *scientifically* known to be attractive, bullies get laid more, 80% of female erotica is about 'bad boys', and 80% of threads on TrollX mention dating an abusive/'shitty' ex at numerous points ( inb4 master manipulator theory ), that doesn't matter in the slightest.

&gt;you'll eventually find a girl who will have sex with you

Do you realize that your premise can be *empirically* falsified both statistically and due to the fact that it is in fundamental odds with the biological principle of *sexual selection*, by which males of the species ( with infinite sperm ) compete over the chance to pass on their genes, and the females continually 'weed out' a certain percentage of the males from doing so?

It's not only a biological concept that even a third-grader should know about, as Darwin wrote about it in 'Origin of the Species', but it's the reality everywhere you look - 28% of young males not having sex by a certain age compared to only 18% of women. Every single dating sub with 0 replies to males and dozens of replies to women. Women swiping right only 40% compared to men's 80%.

To the complete buffoon ( Which I'm sorry to say, you might be, unless you acknowledge the data ) this is registered as 'Getting laid is gonna be hard'. To someone with a basic grasp of math, what those numbers mean is that **some percentage of men will always be 'losing'** - you can't have extremely low demand and abundant supplies without some of those supplies being left to collect dust. If a couple get picked up on a sale, the fact remains the same. So when you're telling men that it is *inevitable* they'll eventually find a girl who will have sex with them, you are on the same level as a flat-earther. You're literally denying mathematics and biology.

No, you *won't* eventually find a girl who'll fuck you. It is not BOUND to happen. Millions of men in history were perma-rejects and not for 'lack of trying' that somehow systemically affected every single one of them. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Some people 100% can't get laid through any half-assed idea you're putting out, which means you'd have to resort to an endless unfalsifiable list of pure speculations about what they were 'doing wrong'.

In reality ,you don't have to be 'doing something wrong'. Because women are sexually selective, not inclusive, which means every generation all the guys on the bottom of the barrel are getting weeded out. If some of them somehow get out of it by being famous or rich or whatever, what they did was out-compete other men for women's attention, and other men have now simply taken their place at the bottom. Grab a stack of papers, take out the bottom sheet, and place it slightly above somewhere. Did you notice what you just did? There's now a new sheet at the bottom. You're never going to eliminate the bottom of the stack no matter how many times you keep doing it, only creating new bottoms, and that's exactly what some people are doing when they claim that with a hefty dosage of 'self-improvement' incels won't exist anymore.

As long as women, *on average*, don't share the same sexual standards as the male average ( Which means like 20% of women who'll just fuck anything that moves that is remotely masculine without requiring that person to jump through hoops ), that means men have to compete for intimacy, which means exactly the sort of **statistics that can be literally gathered from real life and online studies**, which means some men will always be incels.

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Yale vs. Princeton vs. Stanford

Major: Somewhat undecided but want to go into English/Creative Writing/Psychology/Philosophy

Cost: equal

Climate: My siblings all say that the two NE schools are very cold for the time classes are in session and that Stanford's weather is much warmer (nicer?). I'm not too sure about the implications of warm sunny weather or freezing cold winters

Distance: I would be pretty far from my siblings in the northeast if I choose California, but I'm not sure that matters since a plane flight costs relatively the same anyway (I think the difference might be that it would be realistic to drive to my siblings if I was also in the NE, but not for CA)

\- bigger Asian population of CA and Stanford is a minor plus

\- I'm not sure about the atmosphere of each school and how they feel different from each other (not able to visit)

This is before even considering that many are coerced into the treatment in whole or in part. Allowing the practice to continue offers no value to anybody. 

There are clearly people who enjoy anal sex just as there are those that enjoy cigarettes, despite their risk. That gives those practices value insofar as they provide pleasure.

If that were really so you'd be asking polite questions in response to people's comments on this story, not saying dumb shit like ""sweet way to not do your job.""

&gt;I don't agree with the fundamentalist interpretation of ""infringe"" that most gun folks adopt

Clearly. But why are you coming here to say dumb shit instead of trying to actually understand *why* we think that way?

&gt;I can't understand why more responsible gun owners, protectors and providers are not stepping up with their own solutions

Because these aren't gun problems so gun legislation is not to be found among the solutions. This sentiment is not novel to me. People express it consistently in this sub. If you're looking to understand why this is, why aren't you asking thoughtful questions in reply to people who espouse that view. Why are you instead just dropping low-thought brain turds like ""sweet way to not do your job?""

Non gun owners are ""forced"" to take anti-gun action in the exact same sense that Trump is ""forced"" to build a border wall. No, we're not forcing you. It's what you really want and that's why you're doing it. Don't even put that shit on anyone but yourselves.

&gt; Protesters on Sunday denounced an upcoming amendment to Hong Kong&amp;#039;s extradition laws in one of the biggest demonstrations of 2019.

&gt; Hong Kong has in the past signed bilateral extradition agreements with specific jurisdictions, but last month, the government proposed a case-by-case system that would allow the city to handle extradition requests from jurisdictions where there were no pre-existing deals - most notably China and Taiwan.

&gt; Jimmy Sham, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, said that the amendment was worse than the controversial Article 23 of the Basic Law - which states that Hong Kong must enact national security legislation.

"apexlegends","t5_rgzzt","&gt; If you do the math on how many cheaters have already been banned, and this has been confirmed in other posts, there is a cheater in at least 1 of every 3 games played.

I mean I don't really see how this number is remotely relevant to the argument other than supporting my position. The number banned says nothing about the number currently playing or anything else. They don't even provide the rate at which they are being banned which would indicate if it is an increasing or decreasing problem. 

&gt; And I have played 600ish games (Lifeline stats) with 200+ being top 3 placements and over 100 wins.
1/3 games I'm top 3 and 1/2 I win.

&gt; I too, encounter cheaters.
The number hasnt increased.
If anything, its declined.

If we want to get into a dick measuring contest, my games with one of my mains Bangalore is 186, with 84 top 3's, and 50 full squad wins (10+ more with non-full squad). And today I played played in more lobbies with a hacker than ones without. Lost 3 straight games in top 3 to a person with an aimbot. My winrate has been dropping precipitously since this influx of hackers and it makes the game incredibly infuriating.

The fact that the strongest claim you can make is that ""if anything, its declined"" shows that they are NOT solving the hacking problem. Even if I conceded that it hasn't gotten worse than 2 weeks ago, having a hacker win 1/3 of games is a fucking atrocious stat to hang your hat on. You are defending the devs on the fact that the numbers of hackers per game hasn't gone from 1/3 to 1/2. I played Fortnite for like 6 months and I can count on one hand the number of hackers I played against. This game I am well over 100 now. You can hop on here and defend the devs and watch a great game die to their ineptitude or you can make a fuss about it like I am and hope that they will prioritize this fix more than they currently are.",1554076881

The other alternative is the schedule is amended to take these breaks into account. Again, Council refuses to make changes pointing to the scheduled contracts. Bus company becomes physically incapable of providing the service on available resource (see paragraphs 1 and 2)",1554076881

People will talk about how 1x replaces the range that most 2x offer, but it does not replace the efficiencies found in that range from a 2x or 3x configuration.  A long day in the saddle and you'll be thankful for having a double chain ring. If your legs are near wrecked you may find that with a 1x set up the next gear up or down will be too easy or too difficult. Our bodies will adapt, but there's a reason traditional touring bikes are still commonly triple chain rings.  

Again this is only for geared up rides. 1x11s are fine for light day/weekend trips. I wouldn't want to adapt to a 1x config for a full on tour.",1554076882

I'm sorry that i let you wait for the answer so long. I also had to think about your answer \^\^

1. I agree with most of what you say here, but i guess i need to clarify the thing about the simulation theory a bit. I don't believe everybody can be in the same simulation, because there are people who change their behavior after they damage their brain. How should that be possible, if our real brains are connected to the ""matrix"". This sort of simulation is physically unidirectoinal, just like a dream. You can hurt yourself in a dream and still be fine in reality. Most of reality doesn't give a fuck about special quantum physics as far as i know. Most likely it just needs to be observed more, to get to the causes of this weird behavior. As a electical engineer and upcoming computer scientist i can tell you, computers are not weird at all. They are very predictable. Maybe even the most predictable thing for us humans. [It's even considered to be very hard, to make a computer unpredictable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) Its fascinating that processors, consisting of logic-gates much smaller then every human neuron, are capable of doing exactly what they are made to do. If just one of this small parts doesn't work properly, the whole computer might break.
2. I don't know if i understand this problem right, so please correct me if i get something wrong. This problem might be the one that many people fall into. Homeopathy, astronomy, electromagnetic hypersensitivity, personality/ego, conspiracy theories, religion and the geocentric model are just some examples of the variaty of inductional traps. But those are just the extremes. I actually try to question myself and others in every induction that comes up. And as a strong defender of rationalism/determinism i also try to find the main causes of events. I'm aware of the possibility of other causes effecting the outcome of those events, but inside i know that everything is determined by the past. [Here is a nice video, explaining my point of view (determinism/rationalism).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjeKiIa7XEk) In the end i can't judge people with tendencies to induction. Falling into those things are nothing more then human. Keeping the placebo effect/rosenthal effect in mind, i actually don't even think they are totally wrong.
3. UwU you described my point of view pretty well. And yes i know it's hard to find hope in misery, but i think feelings can't help you out in this state of mind. The best approach in such situations are to think about alternatives and logically build your way back to the default state. You can even train yourself to be less sad in misery. On the other hand bad feelings signal to other people that you need help, wich is (if it works out) a good approach as well. Drug addicts are also happy, as long as they have their drugs and higher their dosage ... till the point of death. From an outside perspective this might look like misery, but this isn't the case for those people. Beeing on an alltime ""high"" doesn't make your life fulfilled. At least misery should be considered as a natural part of life. What would keep you alive if there weren't any bad feelings from time to time?

Hope, this answeres most of your questions. Damn you have a really good wording, i love this conversation. Waiting for you answer patiently, my friend. Take your time.",1554076882

My mother and grandfather had both died around the time I first heard it, and I cried for probably 2-3 hours after hearing Together Again the first time. As a gay person, I also related significantly to Free Xone and Tonight's the Night for obvious reasons. Her themes of depression stemming from unresolved childhood and teenage traumas also hit hard, and You still gives me chills.

Adele's 21 hits the emotionals hard too, but of course you already knew that because who doesn't.

Some of the songs on St Vincent's MASSEDUCTION are also very emotional if you read the lyrics. Happy Birthday, Johnny is devastating, and several other songs deal with her ex girlfriend Cara Delevingne's drug problems and Annie's fears that she could be dead when she finds her OD. Her songs are even more powerful on the piano-version of the album. They're great songs, but don't let them make you depressed - they're meant for reflection. ",1554076883

You didn't tell us pay frequency but multiply $22+$17 by number of pay periods left, then add any withholding so far for 2019. If it's equal to $3,884 and all those assumptions are true, it's correct.

If this was the beginning of the year, you would do 0 and 0, with $19 for extra to withhold if bi-weekly (it doesn't matter who) (and that would result in a $250 refund, so $10/bi-week is all that's needed).

It requires strike time of course, but not a big deal since doing the 6 Hard+ fights will only take a few seconds out of your other strike time activities.

So you use Sidewinder/Nighthound MC and the Change EMP skill to swap the MC with Yodarha (who is positioned in the 5th slot out of 6).

If he was born and raised in a typical north American household, but just had a strong appreciation for a good tomato sauce or salami, and claimed to be Italian, sure, call him on it, but from what you've said, that's not the case. 

I would say it would be especially insensitive if you said that in front of his mom, who is adopted, since you're in a way saying that she doesn't belong in her family. I don't really understand why this would bother you, but you need to get over it and just enjoy the food, and a man who was raised in a culture that values family, loyalty and cheese.

[Message from Dr Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/contact/): For the last year, I have been receiving hundreds of emails a week comments, thanks, requests for help, invitations and (but much more rarely) criticisms. It has proved impossible to respond to these properly. That‚Äôs a shame, and a waste, because so many of the letters are heartfelt, well-formulated, thoughtful and compelling. Many of them are as well ‚Äî in my opinion ‚Äî of real public interest and utility. People are relating experiences and thoughts that could be genuinely helpful to others facing the same situations, or wrestling with the same problems. 

For this reason, as of May 2018, a public forum for posting letters and receiving comments has been established at the subreddit. If you use the straightforward form at that web address to submit your letter, then other people can benefit from your thoughts, and you from their responses and votes. I will be checking the site regularly and will respond when I have the time and opportunity.

**Please remember Rule 2: Keep submissions and comments civil. Moderators will be enforcing this rule more seriously in [Letter] threads.**

"anime","t5_2qh22","**Futari wa Pretty Cure** - *4/50*   (7/10)

Not too bad so far, I'm only a few episodes in. The fight choreography lives up to expectations; however I feel like it's animated in slow-motion to pad the run-time. Padding isn't unusual in this age (and not unusual at all for Toei) but it does come off as a bit jarring to me.

**Princess Principal** - *12/12*  (8.5/10)

I'd never watched this one, but I'm glad I did now. The character dynamics were handled remarkably well in my opinion. I really like how despite the episodic nature of the show it's the character relationships that help ground the Case Numbers. It was probably most apparent in Case 11. Though I can't think of any examples I remember being really impressed at the level of detail in some scenes. Some subtle foreshadowing, background details, and a few other things helped really ground the series and bring it to life.

Unfortunately the background plot was kind of messy. How exactly did the Commonwealth manage to seize power out of the biggest military power in the world? Even a brief scene of them seizing the means of production would have been nice. Then there's some stuff near the end that bothered me as well. [PriPri Spoilers](/s ""The way there seemed to be not one, but two major political upheavals in the commonwealth with the military seizing and then losing control happening all of camera really bothered me. It was really strangely implemented and in retrospect feels more like forced tension.  The fact that they disobeyed their orders and got off free; despite the aforementioned upheavals seems rather silly to me as well."")

I'm not sure where to go next. I kind of just want more PriPri but I can't imagine the movies getting subbed in a reasonable amount of time. Well, I might actually pick up some books in the meantime.

&gt; The pope made his comments to reporters aboard the plane returning from Morocco in response to a question about migration in general and about U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s threat to shut down the southern border with Mexico.

&gt; &amp;quot;Builders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build,&amp;quot; he said.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Labels on their own can be useless yeah, but it‚Äôs not unreasonable to try and characterize different administrations‚Äô doctrines. In this case, I‚Äôd say that the Bush administration took a more neoconservative approach, where the Obama administration was decidedly more neoliberal/institutionalist. Trump doesn‚Äôt really fall into either doctrine, or any coherent doctrine at all really. 

Note that neither of these frameworks can be characterized as for or against intervention, but rather as different descriptions of how and why interventions / conflicts donor don‚Äôt happen and what aspects of the international order best explain the behavior of nations. There are very convincing components of both frameworks, and most any administration‚Äôs policy is bound to make decisions that could arguably fit in one or the other.

For example, the Bush administration‚Äôs disregard for the role of international institutions in the run up to the Iraq war indicate a strong dominance of realist analysis. Their concerns over the Hussein regime‚Äôs behavior, especially with a mind to its belligerent role in the Gulf War a decade earlier and even the (likely pretextual) justification for the initial invasion had to do with a purely security minded reason (the threat of WMDs), consistent with a more realist approach, and generally the projection of American hard power influence is consistent with the neocon playbook.

Obama and his admin on the other hand, while continuing with the intervention left to him in the GWOT, even while engaging in intervention, took a much more institutionalist approach. For one thing, the GWOT became an international coalition driven endeavor shortly after its onset, and it continued to be under Obama. As for the actual international policy pursuits the administration undertook, the just about all involved institutional change. The JCPOA, the TPP, even the justifications for new interventions or involvement (Libya, Syria) were given based on largely institutional grounds. That is - support for local movements in the name of democracy proliferation. This wasn‚Äôt absent from the Bush administration‚Äôs justifications (see: Fukuyama), but their textual justifications were all about securitization.

Trump, on the other hand, seems to pursue foreign policy based almost solely on domestic politics. Iranian nuclear program? A problem. The agreement settled on through years of international negotiations? Done under Obama, so must by abandoned. Aggressive behavior of China growing in SEA? North Korean nuclear program? Problems. A comprehensive trade agreement with pacific nations excluding China that could be used as a carrot to pressure them to adjust their doctrine in the South China Sea or to put further pressure on the Kim regime, in which they have practical total suzerain power? That damn globalist Obama set it up. Tear it up and tax their steel - that‚Äôll do it. Drawing down military involvement in the Afghanistan is consistent with his general domestically oriented approach, although the justifications for it are consistent with a realist framework (though not necessarily a neocon one - the two aren‚Äôt synonymous, for example neoconservatives definitely leaned on some institutional analysis during the Cold War, although they generally took a back seat to the more securitized realist narrative).",1554076890

No, he deserves more chances I hope he can return to his 2017 form with Zidane. But the fact remains, he was one of the players who were coted to step up with Ronaldo's absence and he didnt so far so he has his part of blame even though he had some issues. ",1554076891

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Don't Shave That Hair!!!¬†
I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.¬†

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.¬†

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.¬†

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.¬†

Little did I know.¬†

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.¬†

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.¬†

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""¬†

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.¬†

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.¬†

Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!¬†",1554076894

Basically Dan Fiver outlined his strategy for countering Trump, which was that liberals should respond to his lies and the lies of his fans on social media with facts and logic (no really). AKA, ""truth-squadding"", which was what journalists in the White House Press Corps called their fact-checking comments during the early days of the Reagan Administration. Obviously, truth-squadding died very quickly, because it was completely ineffective due to Reagan not giving a shit about the facts, and as one of the journalists said, they ceded responsibility for contesting the administration's lies to the Democrats, which worked out incredibly well as we all know.

As the Chapos said in the episode itself, this is a fucking moronic strategy, since fact-checking doesn't change anyone's fucking mind and your boomer relatives already view you as their insufferable shithead lib nephew or whatever.",1554076895

That alone says a lot about the state of the industry and where its going to if we can not trust what they advertise to get us to purchase the licenses.

As for the sustainable/fair business model part of your reply... you would need access to financial information about the company's revenue and income vs expenses which I do not believe you have. Just because they opted to change their business model does not mean that they were not making enough money. But lately, software companies have found a way to keep milking customers for money to keep a steady stream of income. What most people do not realize is that this business model hurts the customers in the long run because it forces them to keep paying if they want to continue to use the software but it does not force the software companies to improve their products to attract new customers or to keep their existing ones.",1554076895

"Landlord","t5_2qpqt","Wow. This sucks. I just find it difficult to believe the owner/ landlord did not know about this.

I purchased a home with a first time home buyer program that stipulated that we had to reside in the home for 5 years, or the down payment assistance loan (7500) would be due immediately upon selling. 

Well, a year after purchase we ended up relocating to another state for my spouses job. We did rent our place out to a couple for a year. (Not an HOA community and we didn‚Äôt have a property manager) Literally our house was under contract and sold the day the renters lease ended.

I say this to say; the owner had to have known. All of these things are outlined in the hundreds of documents that you agree to and sign. If your neighborhood has an HOA , that might have been the thing that got him caught up. 

Maybe see if the owner can return your deposit to you early or give you some moving assistance. I know a lot of people are saying that it‚Äôs not your problem and to milk them, etc. But just remember that just because someone owns a home and is your landlord, they don‚Äôt always  have a ton of money. It really could have been an honest mistake. Gage how the landlord treats you in this situation. Just try to find a peaceful and reasonable resolution for you both. I‚Äôm not excusing the landlord, but life and stuff like this happens sometimes. Just treat them how you want to be treated.

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","&gt; Yet *Shenzhou* is NCC-1227, and Georgiou describes her as 'old' in 2249. *Discovery*, NCC-1031, is impressive, new, fresh out of the shipyards in 2256. We know *Enterprise* is commissioned in 2245. None of these dates and registry numbers makes sense in the context of a chronological assignment of registry numbers.

You already mentioned the German tank problem, but I've always believed that *Discovery*'s low registration number is an example of another military-related phenomenon, deliberately issuing a lower, unused, serial number to what is actually a top-secret high-tech prototype. The US military adopted the tri-service aircraft designation scheme in 1962, unifying aircraft model numbers across all branches of the military, instead of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps each having their own separate systems (for instance, the F-4 Phantom II was designated the F4H by the Navy and F-110 Spectre by the Air Force), starting over from F-1. However, when the F-117 stealth aircraft was developed much later, it was given a designation as though it was a *pre*-1962 development, with a higher number than any actual aircraft ever received. This was supposed to make it appear as an older aircraft, instead of the cutting-edge design it actually was. I similarly think it's likely that *Discovery* got an unused serial number made to appear as though it belongs in an older sequence, giving the appearance of being an old design instead of being a highly classified top-of-the-line military research vessel.",1554076897

"anime","t5_2qh22","**First Timer**

This was a great episode! The animation was fantastic here. I guess because it‚Äôs the penultimate episode of Season 2. I love how the girls‚Äô shadows each had cute little patterns in them separate from the wall during the final scene with the Tanabata tree, and I think some of the usual music tracks were rearranged for this episode? I noticed a few more instruments in some of them, and a bigger focus on strings, but I could be completely wrong about that.

Getting into fights can be really hard, especially when you aren‚Äôt used to them. It takes a lot of maturity to be the one to apologize. Maturity I probably don‚Äôt have most of the time. I‚Äôm definitely no stranger to stress-eating, like we see Hiro doing in this episode (Although in a much more exaggerated fashion), and it was kind of sad to see Sae kind of take her aggression out on Yuno and Miya a bit at lunch. It can be frustrating when you see your friends hanging out with someone you‚Äôre mad at, but they are on the outside of this and are really just trying to understand what‚Äôs going on and help mend wounds.

Being on the outside of a fight can be hard too, though, and I think this episode captured that confusion pretty well. It‚Äôs easy to exaggerate these kinds of things in your head, especially when you don‚Äôt have all the info. So I wasn‚Äôt surprised when Yuno literally visualized the fight as Hidamari Apartments ‚Äúfalling apart‚Äù. She doesn‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre fighting about, how serious it is, how long it will last, and that can be kind of terrifying.

Sae‚Äôs apology was really sweet, and their embrace afterwards honestly got me a little teary-eyed. I‚Äôve been in fights like that, and for as angry as I may have been at the time, all I really wanted was for it to be over. Being able to let that all out is worth so much more than whatever it was I was angry about. And it looks like Sae and Hiro came out of it even closer than they were before.

It was also sweet to see them decorate the little bamboo tree, and to hear everyone‚Äôs wishes. It was a tender little moment, and almost felt like a season finale for these first few episodes. I hope the tree sticks around, even if just in the background. It‚Äôs a cute little addition to the apartments.

I don‚Äôt have a rating for this episode, just a couple of well wishes for anyone who reads these.

**Discussion Topic**

I‚Äôd have done exactly what Hiro did, and write out a wish for every possible thing I want. If I had to pick just one though, it would be;

That was all she recalled, at least. Perhaps it was simply all she cared to remember.

""I have not seen my father in years,"" she told him. Her eyes were averted to the palms of her hands, as they opened and closed unconsciously in her lap. *I have never met my father, ever*. Not that she *wanted* to meet him, Kiera would always tell herself. He was just another bastard, after all. ""And I do not know my mother,"" she said, somewhat too bitterly. ""Did *Your Grace* not hear me earlier?""

A sharp exhale came next. She bit her lip to hold back the flames. This was the King of all Westeros, she reminded herself. He could have her head off within moments. Suddenly, she found herself eyeing the Kingsguard stood somewhere near the door, waiting, watching. The girl blinked at him, sobered herself up, then returned to smiling at the others.

""The capital is wonderful."" The mask slid into place without seam. ""There is so much going on, all the time!"" Perhaps if she acted excited enough, they would ignore her previous slip. ""Three years, and I still feel that there is more left to experience. Perhaps..."" She blushed falsely, chuckling. ""Uhh, perhaps you two could escort me for a visit to the city? Maybe to the Kingswood, too. It has been so long since I last went riding."" Then, she cleared her throat and allowed her hands to fidget, a bastard suddenly aware of her current company.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I'm not a person who would be in a fwb relationship anymore. I had fwbs and I don't think it's benefitial. If you have a fwb and at some point you get in serious relationship, you'll have to stop being friends with the friend from fwb relationship.

Imagine your girlfriend/boyfriend finding out you had sex with a friend and that you're still hanging out with him/her. I think in 99 times out of 100, it isn't possible to continue being friends with a fwb. I had few fwb relationships and they all ended the same. 

One fwb relationship even destroyed the social circle I was part of because my gf wouldn't let me hang out with the crew because my ex fwb was part of them.

IMO, If you're male (I'm talking from male perspective) and single and want sex without relationship, just work on yourself and your game. At some point you'll be able to have sex whenever you want without potential drama.

RT (&amp; other Russian media) invites Western Establishment propagandists (e.g. former Clinton advisors) to debate with truth telling Western political analysts about particular topics.

The Western propagandists always lose because they are pushing pure lies and very few, if any, now accept the invitations.

Whereas Western media Neocon propaganda rags like the BBC, or MSNBC, or CNN, NEVER invite say Lavrov or a senior Russian diplomat or a senior Russian government advisor on to the Sunday Morning Talk shows, or the peak time evening political discussions because the Western propagandists would be shown up to be scumbag liars, supporting Mass Murdering War Criminal Psychopaths like Tony Blair, Theresa May and David Cameron.

Putin didn't start a war to murder over a million Iraqis - that was Bush, Cheney and Tony Blair.

Putin didin't arm and support al-Qaeda terrorists to murder 100,000 Libyans, topple Gaddafi, turn Libya into a failed state for ISIS and al-Qaeda, and reintroduce the slave trade - that was Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Sarkozy, the CIA and NATO.

Putin didn't arm the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda to start a war on Syria and murder 600,000 people. That was Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, David Cameron and the CIA.

Putin didn't arm ISIS from 2013 to allow them to invade Iraq to replace Maliki as PM to get US troops back into Iraq. That was Obama, John McCain and the CIA.

Putin didn't start a War of Aggression and invade Yemen in 2015 to cause mass slaughter, starvation and genocide. That was the Saudis under instructions from Obama &amp; Cameron using US and British made planes and bombs.

You haven't got a clue what ""an ethical foreign policy"" even looks like. The US and UK do the EXACT opposite.

You are providing me with lots of evidence that you are as brainwashed and ignorant as the Chinese peasants waving their little Red Books at Chairman Mao in 1960's Beijing.

I think you are a hopeless case and I am looking to converse and share info with rational critical thinkers.

There's a fair number of them on this sub from what I have seen so far. But you are not one of them. You are a regular on Neocon Fascist disinfo propaganda subs getting force fed Oligarch &amp; Neocon disinfo propaganda.

If you want to stick around and start learning by reading some of the informative articles on this sub, that would be great, but I will not be continuing this pointless conversation.

If you want to learn what is really going on in the Neocon wars, /r/EndlessWar is great, and for a wider perspective on US, UK &amp; European politics and geopolitics I and several others post to /r/Antimsm.

Went 4-2 on the first try, 5-1 on the second try. The main plan is to flood the board with cheap artifacts and the treasure tokens, turn them 5/5 via Antiquities War and attack for lethal in one turn.  


This version is specially strong against aggressive decks due to the huge ammount of lifegain, but it can be tweaked to be better against control instead depends on what you are facing.  


Some cards are not optimal because I didn't want to use too many wildcards on a deck I will only play in the event. If I had infinite wildcards I would play with 4 Hallowed Fountain, 4 Glacial Fortress and 4 Zhalfirin Voids and try some different artifact combinations, such as using Treasure Map or other 1 mana artifacts.  


Suggestions versus control:   
\+ Anticipate, Treasure map, Negate, Disdainful Stroke, Scrabbling Claws, Opt

"somethingimade","t5_2r4wt","first time caning, and what an experience! my thumbs hurt. the chair is in a set of 4, so i‚Äôll have lots more practice. the chair seats and site posts were all trashed, so i had lots of restoration work to do. it‚Äôs not clean at all, but works so far. hoping the next 3 will turn out much cleaner.


 in case anyone is curious, here are the materials used:

-corn husk caning rope

-staple gun

-small hammer and ‚Äúchisels‚Äù (i made my tools super quickly out of some scraps)

-water bucket

-mister


the corn husk rope was very difficult to work with, it‚Äôs thickness varied foot to foot. variances (plus my inexperience) yielded a kind of crusty looking finished product, but i think that kind of adds to the piece. in retrospect i might work with a more stable/consistent caning rope, but i thought the corn husk would fit the vibe of the piece. i‚Äôm curious to see how the rope will break in over the coming years.

Not all sin issues will dissolve that quickly. I have other sin issues, like lust, that I am still strangling and mastering. It is the same with sinful homosexual desires. Sin is sin. But if you buy into the world's deception, you will believe there is nothing that can be done about homosexual desire. This is not true. All things are possible with God. What your flesh desires for you to do with you genitals is not an identity. You are not 'gay' anymore than I am a 'luster'. I would not label myself in that way. Yet similar to you, it's a sin I struggle with. But through sanctification by surrendering to Jesus and reading the word and praying, I am conquering the flesh.

Good luck brother. God bless. Surrender it all. We must decrease, He must increase. Don't take your cues from this fallen world. God is the supreme, perfect, all-knowing judge. Don't listen to well-meaning folk that rob God of his glory and his perfect commands. ",1554076904

""Though producers are a vital part of the solution,
their ability to reduce environmental impacts
is limited. These limits can mean that a product
has higher impacts than another nutritionally

In particular, the impacts of animal products
can markedly exceed those of vegetable substitutes
(Fig. 1), to such a degree that meat, aquaculture,
eggs, and dairy use ~83% of the world‚Äôs farmland
and contribute 56 to 58% of food‚Äôs different emissions,
despite providing only 37% of our protein and
18% of our calories. Can animal products be produced
with sufficiently low impacts to redress this
vast imbalance? Or will reducing animal product

We find that the impacts of the lowest-impact

*****

New featuresLux can now damage enemies by shooting explosive tanks, crates and barrels. If an object is explosive, it will appear in Target Lock along with the enemies. These explosive objects deal a lot of damage, so select the object, wait until an enemy is near it, and...boom! Mutant: meet Death. Supply crates now randomly appear in many levels. They're dropped by the Redaction Commission to help out agents in the field. The contents vary, but they may contain medkits and shield energy packs, ammo and weapon parts. They almost always contain new clothing items for Lux. You'll know it's a supply crate from the pink flare and smoke trail near it.ImprovementsImproved the grenade explosion effect.If you're using an Xbox One gamepad, a rumble effect is now applied when Lux uses DNA mods, guns and grenades. Added a new option ""Vibrate"" to enable or disable gamepad rumble. If you're using an Xbox One gamepad, it will automatically appear at Options &gt; Controls &gt; Vibrate.There were some rendering issues with the Daisy Shirt (all five versions of it), the Ninja belt and the DATM Jumper. They've been replaced by other clothing items, including the new Foxy Stripe design. If you've already unlocked a Daisy shirt, the Ninja belt or the DATM jumper, you'll automatically unlock the corresponding new item after updating to this build.The full HUD display is now the default; i.e. health, shield and stamina bars are displayed. You can still switch to the minimal HUD by selecting it in Options.The Melee command has been changed to match attacks with DNA mods and guns. To perform a melee attack, hold down Aim and then press the Melee command.The Roll command is now available when using a gamepad. It's Circle on a PS4 controller, or B on an Xbox One controller.Added decorative bird flocks to some of the outdoors levels.Various performance improvements across most levels. It's brighter in the Genji Service Tunnel now.Bug fixesFixed a bug where the icons for the current DNA mod and the current gun would both be displayed simultaneously in the HUD.Enemy ""got hit"" animation is now played when a grenade explodes near an enemy but doesn't kill it.Fixed a bug which could sometimes prevent the Threesome achievement from being unlocked.Target lock range is now correctly tied to the range of the current gun or DNA mod, as determined by skill point upgrades.Fixed a bug in the UI where Lux's arms could twist unnaturally when selecting a weapon to upgrade.Fixed a minor bug in the UI where Lux's animation would be unpaused under certain conditions while the menu was still open.One of Lux's Invoke DNA mods was not being rendered correctly after some performance enhancements were implemented (a pink square was being displayed). This is fixed now. Trees were not being rendered correctly during the cutscene where Lux first sees the trolls. Plugged a hole in the terrain where Lux could run through and fall off the edge of the earth. Removed lots of small stones from the floor of the chupas' lair. These were causing Lux to walk in a stilted way whenever she stepped on one. Removed an unnecessary waypoint in the chupas' lair which appeared after Lux found the sacred Fire Rod. The waypoint led back to the entrance, but since we've placed a Fast Travel Station there now, the waypoint back is no longer required. Fixed a bug where a gamepad button was being displayed at the Fast Travel Station in the chupas' lair, even if you were using a keyboard and mouse.

Feels good. Looks good. Sound design is incredible. 

That being said I have some issues;

1)Breakers are lame. Being punished for winning the neutral and perfectly executing a combo seems silly. Combos are pretty short this time round making breakers seem a little misplaced as it is... especially considering meter regens at the same speed for everyone, and pretty fast.

2) fatal blows are way too strong. Both in how safe they are and how much damage they do. Getting down to where you both have FB available is incredibly mundane imo. Especially when facing Kabal. The game comes to a standstill waiting for someone to stop blocking.
(Side note also I wish if we killed using a FB that we‚Äôd get a special death animation. Watching the entire X-ray attack play out only for it to then say ‚Äúfinish him‚Äù and then watch a fatality... gets a little tiresome..)

3) movement speed, but this is being addressed. That being said I don‚Äôt want it to increase too much. The neutral and footsies game right now is crazy fun. Just make dashes viable.

4) the HUD/UI in game leaves a lot to be desired.
It‚Äôs not exactly easy to recognise which side you are on once you‚Äôve jumped over a couple times back and forth, and the X and Y axis defence/Offence meter isn‚Äôt exactly pleasing to look at or focus on. Is manageable and functional, but it could be much more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.   (Side note, with custom variations, and being able to edit the names of the main variations, how are we meant to know what attacks and fighting style our opponent is using?)

5) 50/50 throws are stupid. Really stupid. Especially since the whole game has slowed down to methodical footsies and pokes. It seems silly to read the throw, but be punished because it‚Äôs the wrong throw. There isn‚Äôt even a specific ‚Äòtell‚Äô for either direction. 

6) wake-up rolls are needlessly hard to do. I‚Äôll probably be told to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù but it‚Äôs the truth. You should only have to hold L2 and a direction. 

7) some amplified moves are needlessly hard to do; see Barakas Chop Chop. 

The rest is all little things that aren‚Äôt included in the beta and bugs that im sure will be ironed out.

Other than that, it‚Äôs a really fantastic fighter and I‚Äôve enjoyed every minute of it! ",1554076907

To answer your question I first want to mention that applying our own person experiences can be beneficial when there is overlap in analyzing the behavior of others. For instance you could apply Kratom addiction to alcoholism.. because both are addiction.

Think of a time you felt like you probably shouldn‚Äôt be smoking or you made a plan to not smoke one morning.. but then as the morning came you said ‚Äúwell I already got all my shit done, and I‚Äôm not doing it go cope with stress, so I‚Äôll go ahead and smoke no big deal‚Äù

An addicted person who is actively in denial will say these things.. even if they are aware of their addiction they can use rationalizations in place of the truth ‚ÄúI am chemically dependent and my body and mind are uncomfortable and I have a desire to drink/smoke/shootup at 9am for reasons x y and z that make it okay because I‚Äôm not an addict, I‚Äôm not doing it for maladaptive reasons, just for fun.",1554076908

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;Is this just a temporary phase or will immigration dominate for years to come? What caused this shift?

Immigration has been an issue for decades.

It was an issue in the 80's when Reagan signed a huge amnesty and immigration reform bill. That settled things down for a few years but it was again a political issue when Clinton signed another major ""immigration reform"" bill ten years later. There was to be another big immigration reform bill announce by W but that got put on hold in the wake of 9/11. Then, it was back up again in the mid 2000's with each chamber passing their own versions of immigration reform. Obama ran on immigration reform in his 2008 election, and again in 2012.

Illegal immigration has been a hot topic for as long as I can remember, with various reforms being passed but never actually accomplishing much more than ""kicking the can down the road"". 

This isn't some temporary shift or temporary phase. Illegal immigration has *always* polled near the top of of most important problems, but perhaps never overtaking the top spot from healthcare, terrorism, or the economy. That might be temporary but illegal immigration as a concern isn't going anywhere until congress actually fixes the problem. ",1554076910

And I didn't think that, after born, she didn't tell him otherwise, I think she tried to sold her vision that Ray had to live the most he had and die peacefully in the end, Ray faked and bought that idea, but in reality was elaborating a plan to escape.

Days 5-14 are the worst, and you really don‚Äôt know just how bad until you get to day 7-14. At day 4, you should be feeling the withdrawals pretty good from whatever cut you made, but they can continue to ramp up until day 14 at times.

Please consult your physician but from what I know you are at extremely low risk for seizure...extremely! Benzos can take a long time to rear the full extent of their withdrawal effect, but if you can make it 2 weeks at any new cut, or completely off the drug, then you‚Äôre not going to experience anything WORSE from that point on.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Did this fairly easily for warlock.
Whisper can be a great asset if your aim is crisp, if not, stick with Thunderlord, its by far the easiest option.
In the first section, use a close-medium range weapon (pulses are what i used) along with a shotty and your heavy of choice. Chase those symbols around, and clear your sightlines. Healing rift is by far the best thing you can use, and i would recommend either well (youll need it later anyway) with lunafaction or Nova bomb with Skull.
After the first section, switch to either a pulse or scout, with a sniper as your special and take your time. Shoot everything at long range and be careful of the major taken captain early on who will fuck you up, also be careful with the ogres as they are a bitch sometimes. Spawn them, then run back as fast as you can to safety. Switch back to a pulse or hc and a shotty right before the thrallway (use a void special weapon, shotgun or not, it will help) and farm ammo in the thrallway till you feel comfortable. Make sure well is on, if you arent using it yet and you have a full super. Then make your way to the Ogre encounter.
Here comes the first tough bit of the run. When you jump down, dart to the left side and hide by the pillar, constantly use healing rifts, watch your surroundings then clear any ads you can. Leave the wizards though. After clearing the front and left side ads, run past left all the way to the back and kill the ads there. Also remember with well, you have healing grenades which can save you in a pinch. After back, take out right side ads then run back to where you started. Here comes a fun bit, use your void weapon to destroy the wizard shields then melt the fuckers. Start with the front, then move in a clockwise rotation, the same as you did with the ads. Keep an eye on your timer and dont let it expire. After you kill the 4th wizard and pick the orb, this is where strats can differ slightly. If you are using thunderlord, make sure lunafaction boots are equipped, slam the orb then a healing well and just tank the axion darts as you melt the fucker. A full thunderlord should be able to one phase. If you are using whisper, do the same thing as thunderlord, just without lunas. Try to avoid the darts if you can, make sure whispered breathing is active 24/7 and dont unscope, whilst aiming for the one phase. If you cant do that however, just do what you did the first time, starting on left and clearing ads, then wizards. Once the ogre falls, switch over to a whisper if you arent already using it along with a close/medium range weapon and a solar special (everyone should have an ikelos shotty lol, thatll work). Switch over to a bottom tree stormcaller with crown of tempests (this will come in handy later), and work your way through all of the ads. Farm ammo in the section with the infinite taken thralls, and make sure you have max heavy. Keep pushing on until you get to the Dul Incaru section, and prepare for the second hardest encounter. When you start off, trigger the boss and then run to the far right balcony. As soon as the psions spawn, pop your super and clean them up, then instantly dart to the left side and clean all the psions there. Any remaining super can be used to damage the knights. Pull your whisper out and start critting those knights, dont be afraid to kill them slightly early from one another, and remember they can still be hit whilst they go invis. You are on a hidden timer during all of this, and a one cycle is by far your best bet so aim for that. If you can kill all 3 knights before Dul shields them, then grab those orbs and start sniping the wizard in the head, nabbing the kill and the solo run.
The gear I personally used was a Chattering Bone with either an Ikelos shotty, or a dreaming city sniper depending on the section. Was able to flawless the entire thing, though you don‚Äôt necessarily have to go for a flawless run.
Practise is the best method, and dont get frustrated if you constantly wipe on sections. Take your time and remember to be chill.

So I think he set poor boundaries, and it seems like she set poor boundaries too. 

I think the whole AB case is a reminder that even men who seem worldly and experienced can have misplaced boundaries so we men should be mindful on what we expect others to do and what we are taking on that's not necessarily our responsibility. 

And how to find emotionally responsible women: that's easy. I'm not talking about manipulation, but just get into any conversation for things that really matter to you, and I'll eventually come a point where I see if she's treating the people around her in a supportive or judgmental way, in a self centered or communitarian way, etc, and how she responds to criticism as well as how I respond to her criticism that are honest and constructive.

There's a difference between that kind of talk and attacking someone with the vulnerable parts of themselves they've chosen to share with you.

IMO, I understand where you're coming from. Often times women are held in a higher standard when it comes to emotional responsibility and behavior. But I wasn't saying AB was blameless. He created the dynamic he got himself into, and AA also seems extremely self centered. She isn't the type he should've gotten attached to begin with.

You're in a AB sub so I'm thinking it's natural people will be more defensive of AB. And you're right. He has responsibility for making what seems like a poorly defined relationship happen. Paying for the rape your girlfriend did of a minor? What the actual fuck? She shouldn't have done that and he shouldn't have offered or accepted her request.

O homem estava foragido desde a sexta (29), quando a Pol√É¬≠cia Civil de Minas solicitou sua pris√É¬£o preventiva. Ele √É¬© suspeito de ter abusado sexualmente de clientes do est√É¬∫dio em que trabalhava na capital mineira.

  De acordo com informa√É¬ß√É¬µes da Pol√É¬≠cia Civil, o tatuador estava escondido na casa de amigos e foi localizado pela pol√É¬≠cia ap√É¬≥s uma den√É¬∫ncia an√É¬¥nima.

 O caso √É¬© investigado pela Delegacia Especializada de Atendimento √É Mulher de Belo Horizonte, onde pelo menos 15 mulheres j√É¬° formalizaram a den√É¬∫ncia.

 Ele √É¬© acusado de [viola√É¬ß√É¬£o sexual mediante fraude](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/03/registros-de-crimes-sexuais-em-coletivos-de-sp-crescem-265-em-dez-anos.shtml), quando o [agressor](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/03/barrar-agressores-de-tirar-oab-e-positivo-dizem-especialistas.shtml) engana a v√É¬≠tima para cometer o [abuso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/papa-publica-lei-sobre-abusos-sexuais-que-limita-prescricao-de-crimes-a-20-anos.shtml). A pena √É¬© de 2 a 6 anos de reclus√É¬£o. 

 Uma publica√É¬ß√É¬£o em uma rede social da professora e ativista mineira Duda Salabert serviu de combust√É¬≠vel para que as [den√É¬∫ncias](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/03/sp-tera-botao-de-panico-por-meio-de-aplicativo-para-pessoas-em-perigo.shtml) viessem √É tona. Ela sugeriu que as seguidoras dessem prioridade a tatuadoras mulheres, afirmando que √É¬© um mercado machista, e perguntou se haviam sofrido ass√É¬©dio em est√É¬∫dios.

 Em menos de um dia, recebeu mais de 50 relatos contra Leandro, segundo ela, alguns de meninas menores de idade (den√É¬∫ncias envolvendo outros homens tamb√É¬©m foram recebidas).

 Uma das v√É¬≠timas afirmou que o tatuador derrubou tinta em seus seios e usou o √¢¬Ä¬úacidente√¢¬Ä¬ù como pretexto para toc√É¬°-la. Outra, que ele tocou em sua genit√É¬°lia. O tatuador √É s vezes colocava a cliente em posi√É¬ß√É¬µes desnecess√É¬°rias para facilitar o abuso, sob a justificativa de que facilitaria a realiza√É¬ß√É¬£o do desenho.

Roi: best single target damage in the game but doesn‚Äôt do so good in adventure mode amazing in the late game with scoring content (wb conquest guild raid challenge raid) when I say best I mean THE best

Chase: generalist you can bring him to most content that physical teams can do and he‚Äôll excel but he needs 3* UW and UT2 to not rely on HoT healers Like rephy May and juno worth the investment though Also needs special gears with  all lines having atk and nothing else 

Crow: late game hero like row very good burst damage his S3 obliterates Anything But He needs heavy manual control because you need to use S1 1-3 times before you use S3 similar to Roi since he‚Äôs good in late game scoring content and meh in adventure

Lillia: generalist like Chase but doesn‚Äôt get all the crazy free stats so she‚Äôs a bit below him in that sense she does needs special as well with 5 mp/sec lines due to her passive good in both 4man pve and some late game scoring content (mostly suggested her if you prefer waifus) 

AOE:
Erze: great in content where there‚Äôs a lot of enemies can do insane damage when there‚Äôs at least 5ish mobs and more also has a lot self sustain so she won‚Äôt die too easily still good in pvp I believe even after the nerf not good in scoring content but if you feel like you want an AOE specialist and a waifu choose her

Zafir: Doesn‚Äôt Have The self sustain Or selfish buffs Erze has but has a lot of utility with mini stuns a shield and area wide CC needs his UT1 to play efficiently similar to Erze where he‚Äôs good in places where there‚Äôs 5+ mobs but not so good in late game scoring content but if you want an AOE specialist and husbando choose him

Nyx: unlike Zafir and Erze needs stacks of his passive to do his job efficiently so meh in adventure mode since it takes a while to stack up in a short battle but with a 3*/4* UW he‚Äôs an insane auto attacker in arena if you like his design you can choose him but Zafir and Erze are arguably better

Maybe someone who has already worked with Villeneuve, like Emily Blunt? Amy Adams? Ana De Armas?

If they want Oscar buzz, will they go after a recent nominee/winner, like Emma Stone, Lupita Nyong'o, Saoirse Ronan, Felicity Jones, Rosamund Pike, Charlize Theron, Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Anne Hathaway?

You seem to be under the impression that democracy and republic are mutually exclusive forms of government.  They're not [1][2], and we practice both [3].  That's why we use the phrase ""democratically elected officials"" to describe holders of public offices. You might be surprised to find out we're also a federation, a federal republic, as you pointed out a constitutional republic, and a presidential system simulataneously.

In sourcing this response it looks like ""the US is a republic, not a democracy"" is a right wing talking point [4].  However the title of this article, ""Sorry, Liberals, But America Is Not A Democracy, And It‚Äôs Better That Way""  actually disagrees with the content.  To quote article:

""Thus, a republic‚Äôs defining feature is democratic consent of the people"". 

Despite the headline, the article never manages to actually dismiss our status as a democracy.  At best it equivocates by saying ""we're equally republican"", which either means we're a democratic republic, or we're neither democratic nor republican.

Morning people tend to have a shorter ideal circadian rhythm, and night people tend to prefer longer, but night people tend to be more able to adjust to disruptions to their routine than morning people.

I dont know many modern electronics that you would WANT to use in 10 years, just because of how fast technology is changing and evolving. I can still use my old EOS because film hasn't really changed, and the lenses even now are a few hundred $ each. That being said 99/100 times I would use a digital camera over the film.

-
No way that the ""late in the day"" child is going to be the exception.

Here's what happened. Each time she got (or strongly suspected) that she had (already) ""gotten"" pregnant, she proceeded to push him to have sex and to ""try to GET pregnant.""

-
Why don't men realize this? Well one simple reason is that they're *ignorant/trusting* and have been mislead by ""hearsay"" (or colloquial/informal *mis-*understanding). That is, most men think that a human pregnancy lasts **9 months** -- but that actually ISN'T true -- *average* human gestation is closer to 40 weeks than it is to 36 weeks (i.e. basically **~10** months -- give or take a week or so -- and *unless the baby is multiple weeks ""premature""* **not* **9** months).

-
What that means **in reality** is that a woman (especially a crafty/conniving woman) can already BE pregnant by a good couple of weeks -- and yet *easily* DUPE her hubby/boyfriend into sex AFTER she already knows (or strongly suspects; particularly these days when some of the in-home OTC pregnancy tests CAN be accurate in &lt; 1 week after conception; and the general rule is that they can ALL work within ~2 weeks)... it gives her a ""window"" to create ""plausible deniability.""

-
And that is almost certainly what happened here. NONE of the kids were ""planned"" by them **as a couple** -- she may (or may not) have ""planned"" to get pregnant by other men, but regardless, the whole ""let's have a kid NOW"" was just a ruse...

-
She's been actively ""gaslighting"" him for nearly 34 years. (So why wouldn't she think she could ""get away with it"" **yet again...** besides, sunk-cost fallacy; one way or another she's so DEEP into this that no ""confession"" is going to get her out of it).

Should this not work I would turn off the pc again and remove the power. Then open and verify that the power cables to motherboard (both wires ) have not gotten loose.

 Congressistas de direita e centro-direita passaram a semana manifestando preocupa√É¬ß√É¬£o com a forma como o Executivo, em especial Bolsonaro, trata o Legislativo.

 O presidente [fez provoca√É¬ß√É¬µes p√É¬∫blicas a Maia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/bolsonaro-diz-que-embate-com-rodrigo-maia-e-chuva-de-verao-e-pagina-virada.shtml), que retribuiu. As discuss√É¬µes envenenaram o ambiente pol√É¬≠tico e as expectativas do mercado. Na quinta-feira (29), a disputa arrefeceu, mas o ceticismo permanece.

 Sem esfor√É¬ßo de Bolsonaro para organizar uma base aliada para aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o da reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia, deputados dizem que ele flerta com o caos na inten√É¬ß√É¬£o de desmoralizar o Congresso perante a opini√É¬£o p√É¬∫blica.

 A conversa chegou a Maia, que reagiu com cautela. ""Precisamos ter paci√É¬™ncia e fortalecer o Poder Legislativo"", disse o presidente da C√É¬¢mara √É **Folha**. ""Com as institui√É¬ß√É¬µes fortes e equilibradas √¢¬Ä¬îSupremo Tribunal Federal, Legislativo, Executivo e imprensa livre√¢¬Ä¬î, n√É¬£o haver√É¬° risco de ruptura.""

 A [exonera√É¬ß√É¬£o do funcion√É¬°rio do Ibama](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/03/ibama-exonera-servidor-que-multou-bolsonaro-por-pesca-irregular.shtml) que multou Bolsonaro por pesca irregular, a demiss√É¬£o da presidente da Embratur e dois diretores e a desautoriza√É¬ß√É¬£o do ministro Sergio Moro na indica√É¬ß√É¬£o de[ Ilona ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/moro-recua-de-nomeacao-de-especialista-em-seguranca-publica-para-conselho.shtml)[Szab√É¬≥](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/moro-recua-de-nomeacao-de-especialista-em-seguranca-publica-para-conselho.shtml) para a supl√É¬™ncia de um conselho s√É¬£o, para alguns deputados, ind√É¬≠cios de autoritarismo do presidente.

 Parte dos parlamentares com bom tr√É¬¢nsito com Maia advoga que o Congresso deve dar seguidos recados ao governo, com a aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o de projetos que contrariam interesses do Executivo.

 Outro grupo pondera que, se aprovar medidas para atrapalhar o governo, o Legislativo acabar√É¬° alimentando a narrativa do Planalto de que prioriza interesses n√É¬£o republicanos.

 Por isso, esses deputados veem com preocupa√É¬ß√É¬£o momentos como a aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o rel√É¬¢mpago, na ter√É¬ßa-feira (26), da [PEC (Proposta de Emenda √É Constitui√É¬ß√É¬£o) que torna o Or√É¬ßamento ainda mais engessado](https://webmail.grupofolha.com.br/OWA/redir.aspx?C=t-Pnq666zWr866Jj5JbsIxkIkbuSH4obU5_dySn-Th-6v5IIJbbWCA..&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww1.folha.uol.com.br%2fmercado%2f2019%2f03%2fcamara-aprova-em-1o-turno-pec-do-orcamento.shtml).

 Aliados de Maia dizem que l√É¬≠deres do centr√É¬£o queriam ir mais longe e acelerar a tramita√É¬ß√É¬£o de projetos ainda piores para o Executivo. Segundo os relatos, Maia conteve os √É¬≠mpetos e a PEC foi uma imposi√É¬ß√É¬£o dos l√É¬≠deres como denominador comum.

 ""Quando o di√É¬°logo fica muito dif√É¬≠cil, cada um tem de ocupar o seu quadrado, Executivo, C√É¬¢mara, Senado, cada um fazer a sua parte"", disse o l√É¬≠der do PP, Arthur Lira (AL).

 Notam deputados que a especula√É¬ß√É¬£o em torno de um hipot√É¬©tico impeachment, da mesma forma, fortalece a vers√É¬£o segundo a qual os deputados achacam o presidente para dar a ele os resultados legislativos que espera.  
   
 O impasse da reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia √É¬© mais um fator que pode ser usado por Bolsonaro, eles afirmam. Ao dizer que ""a bola est√É¬° com o Congresso"", o presidente lava as m√É¬£os, sinalizando √É popula√É¬ß√É¬£o que uma eventual n√É¬£o aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o √É¬© culpa de deputados que n√É¬£o querem o bem do Brasil.  
   
 A apreens√É¬£o com o autoritarismo foi refor√É¬ßada com manifesta√É¬ß√É¬µes de Filipe Martins, assessor especial da Presid√É¬™ncia para assuntos internacionais, olavista e pr√É¬≥ximo ao deputado Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP).  
   
 Em uma s√É¬©rie de publica√É¬ß√É¬µes na semana passada, ele [fez um manifesto anti-establishment, pregando um canal direto com a popula√É¬ß√É¬£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/contra-maia-assessor-de-bolsonaro-pede-povo-na-rua-por-reformas.shtml). Para Martins, √É¬© urgente ""uma coordena√É¬ß√É¬£o efetiva entre as diferentes alas do governo para trazer o apoio popular para dentro da equa√É¬ß√É¬£o, de modo que o povo tenha um papel ativo na prote√É¬ß√É¬£o da Lava Jato, na promo√É¬ß√É¬£o das reformas econ√É¬¥micas e na quebra da velha pol√É¬≠tica"".  
   
 O temor com uma ruptura encontra eco na esquerda, que se levantou contra a [determina√É¬ß√É¬£o de Bolsonaro para que o 31 de mar√É¬ßo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/bolsonaro-determinou-comemoracoes-devidas-do-golpe-de-1964-diz-porta-voz.shtml), dia do golpe que instaurou a ditadura militar em 1964, fosse comemorado. Depois, ele recuou, falando em rememora√É¬ß√É¬£o. Uma liminar chegou a vetar celebra√É¬ß√É¬µes, mas ela [foi cassada pela Justi√É¬ßa Federal.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/justica-cassa-liminar-que-proibia-governo-de-comemorar-golpe-de-64.shtml)  
   
 A semana da C√É¬¢mara foi pautada por discursos na tribuna de deputados de oposi√É¬ß√É¬£o alertando para o risco de amea√É¬ßas √É democracia.

 No governo, um ministro disse reservadamente que o Congresso cava a pr√É¬≥pria cova ao insistir na obten√É¬ß√É¬£o de cargos em troca de apoio. Para ele, ao criticar a ""velha pol√É¬≠tica"", Bolsonaro e companhia reagem √É fome por postos de bom or√É¬ßamento.  
   
 H√É¬°, no entanto, um espa√É¬ßo vazio de articula√É¬ß√É¬£o leg√É¬≠tima, sem a qual o governo sofre derrotas e desgastes evit√É¬°veis. No caso da PEC do Or√É¬ßamento, por exemplo, a deputada Joice Hasselmann (PSL-SP), l√É¬≠der do governo no Congresso, foi um dos tr√É¬™s votos contr√É¬°rios, ante os [448 a favor no primeiro turno](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/camara-aprova-em-1o-turno-pec-do-orcamento.shtml).   
   
 Ela gargalhou ao saber que o l√É¬≠der do governo na C√É¬¢mara, Major Vitor Hugo (PSL-GO), votou a favor e disse ter sido uma vit√É¬≥ria do governo.   
   
 ""N√É¬£o acredito que o governo esteja trabalhando com o caos"", disse o vice-presidente da C√É¬¢mara e presidente do PRB, deputado Marcos Pereira (SP). ""√É¬â falta de experi√É¬™ncia, at√É¬© porque o Congresso tem todas as condi√É¬ß√É¬µes constitucionais para n√É¬£o permitir que eventuais vontades pessoais autorit√É¬°rias prevale√É¬ßam no pa√É¬≠s.""  
   
 Com indicadores econ√É¬¥micos ruins, como o aumento do desemprego para 13,1 milh√É¬µes de pessoas, e popularidade em queda, o governo ter√É¬° mais dificuldades para mobilizar a popula√É¬ß√É¬£o a seu favor. ""O povo n√É¬£o quer saber de ideologia, o povo quer saber de resultado"", afirmou Aguinaldo Ribeiro (PP-PB), l√É¬≠der da maioria.

"artificial","t5_2qhfb","&gt; My current understanding of AI is that 'AI' is a field with lots of different techniques within it, that are often used in isolation, and for very specific purposes (e.g. machine learning for classification problems).

Yes, that's pretty much correct for 99% of AI research and development. This is often referred to as narrow AI to contrast it with AGI. 

&gt; Is anyone actually trying to build a unified software system that can perform all intellectual tasks that a human can?

Yes, although this is relatively rare (although arguably less rare for the past 5 or so years). We have a section on [Getting Started with AGI](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/getting-started#wiki_how_to_get_started_with_agi.3F) on /r/artificial's wiki that points at some research that *is* doing that. One of the problems is that there are not only different definitions of AGI, but also different approaches with different apparent milestones. All of this makes it very hard to [evaluate progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/agi/comments/52tv08/benchmarks_besides_turing_test/) towards AGI as well. 

This makes it difficult to say who or what is the closest system we currently have to AGI. I'm inclined to answer with cognitive architectures like OpenCog and NARS (check the wiki), because at least they're explicitly targeted at AGI and they are open to arbitrary problems in an important sense. However, getting actual AGI may still take very long, so it's very hard to say. Maybe e.g. OpenCog is on the right track, but it will take them 20 years to realize AGI, and maybe in 10 years a company like Deepmind will get on the same track and beat them to it because they have much more money, resources and talent. 

&gt; I'm no expert in this area but it seems to me that that would require many work in many different areas of AI, such as NLP, computer vision, etc. It seems like we have quite impressive systems in many of these seperate fields, but are people trying to build systems that bring all these types of things together?

Well, ideally AGI doesn't require messing around with all of that. Maybe there's a ""master algorithm"" that underlies most of cognition (e.g. whatever the fairly uniform neocortex is using). More unified approaches like NARS work like this. 

On the other end of the spectrum is the idea that you could just build a million narrow AI programs and ""just"" glue them together with a Big Switch program that switches between the narrow AI programs when it sees fit. The problem with this is that virtually all of the complexity of building AGI is offloaded unto that Big Switch program. 

Somewhere in between you have an approach like OpenCog that does have different components for processing language, perception, procedural knowledge, declarative knowledge, motivation and so on. 

&gt; On a related point, what's the closest thing we have to a replicant? Some kind of humanoid robot whose software is designed so that it mimics a human as much as possible.

I think the Japanese and Disney are quite good at creating humanlike animatronics (or ""robots""), but they lack intelligence. 
[Sophia](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/), despite not nearly as impressive as the talkshows might have you believe, may be the best somewhat humanlike robot platform, as it actually allows integration of many modalities and can be controlled with actual AI software based on OpenCog or SingularityNET. However, it doesn't have legs of its own (or it didn't use to have them; although it can be connected to a ""leg platform""). Something like Boston Dynamics' Atlas probably has a wider range of ""useful"" motions, but clearly doesn't aim to pass for a human. ""Petman"" may be the best walker, and with the hazmat suit looks kind of of human (although that should probably be considered cheating). 

Since a replicant should presumably also sound human, you may also want to look at Google's Duplex project (although one of their main insights was to make the AI narrower). You could also look at what chatbots are winning the annual Loebner prize.

If you put all of that together, you could perhaps imagine the best ""replicant"" that could currently be made.",1554076928

Being apart for so long was incredibly difficult and there was a lot of missing each other. But we made sure to visit each other at least once a term, taking it in turns to visit, or meet somewhere in the middle, and of course spend our summer holidays together. 
We also spoke very regularly and tried to Skype/FaceTime a few times a month. 

It was very difficult going from a regular relationship into a long distance one, and we both missed each other a lot. But after 3 years, we both had a good time and grew a lot as people, and it makes us appreciate our time together even more.

-	built with angular, loosely structured like the tour of heroes tutorial
-	based on the [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/avm2kr/anthem_stat_calculator_spreadsheet/)
-	multiple load outs per javelin
-	add weapons/abilities/components with your specific inscriptions
-	toggle your buffs, and debuffs when calculating dps
-	store your info in a cookie
-	enable sharing your loadouts with others (json like factories prints)

I‚Äôm well aware of the posts that say ‚Äúgear doesn‚Äôt matter, and numbers are all made up‚Äù. The reality is that there are numbers, they just don‚Äôt work the way we expect them to.  Clearly a well built legendary javelin will do better than an epic javelin in GM3. 

So my goal is to try to build a stat calculator that can factor in all the mechanics of damage scaling, so we can truly min-max our builds, even when maxing dps requires something silly like an empty support slot or a lvl 1 defender. 

Inspired by [mmo-champions](https://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) and elitist jerks.

I fell in love with this sport as soon as I strapped on my loaner goalie pads for the first time, and I knew I wanted to play for the rest of my life. But I never had any opportunity beyond trying out for varsity uni/college teams. It's so disheartening to hear ""The women only have the Olympics to play in, and it's not like you'll ever be that one-in-a-million girl to make it!"" 

I know that the NHL is also one in a million for the guys, but at least they have a thing to strive towards and give their goals a direction. If not the NHL, there's the AHL, WHL, ECHL, local junior leagues, and the list goes on...

But for us? You basically just have Midget AA and college, then the beer leagues or senior for the rest of your life. ",1554076932

I can't see all of the article because im either not bright enough to find a free version or its half pay wall, but from what I see its 34 precedex vs 30 placebo and they do a scoring system check in 6 or 7 times for their determination of quality of sleep. I have questions in general.

&amp;#x200B;

How do the measure incidence of delirium for their original 100 people in the study? Is it if they get delirous during the stay, is the delirium incidence measured as each day delirious = 1 incidence. Just curious how that is defined.

&amp;#x200B;

How long were these people in ICU, on average and total range. I would of course want to look at people who stayed a similar number of days in ICU (8) to see if their experiences were different outcomes.

&amp;#x200B;

My only real concerns with the precedex was the original complaint of hemodynamic stability. The attending was always furious that they didnt titrate the pressors down as fast as he wanted but they would titrate them back up at night. I also can't tell you how many times I heard ""Levophed? More like Leave-em-dead haha!"" after she finished that drip.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Sob ataques de que a [reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/previdencia/) afeta os mais pobres, o governo argumenta que, considerando a conta por pessoa, a proposta √É¬© mais penosa [para servidores p√É¬∫blicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/governo-quer-aliquota-do-inss-de-ate-22-para-servidor-publico.shtml) e [militares](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/entenda-os-principais-pontos-da-proposta-para-reforma-da-previdencia-dos-militares.shtml).

 A perda m√É¬©dia para os trabalhadores da iniciativa privada √É¬© estimada em R$ 9,6 mil em dez anos para cada contribuinte do INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social).

 O impacto per capita para o funcionalismo p√É¬∫blico da Uni√É¬£o √É¬© de R$ 141 mil.

 No caso dos militares das For√É¬ßas Armadas, √É¬© de R$ 181 mil √¢¬Ä¬îsem considerar os efeitos da reestrutura√É¬ß√É¬£o das carreiras, que representam ganhos para os militares e gastos para os cofres p√É¬∫blicos.

 Esses n√É¬∫meros t√É¬™m sido usados pela equipe econ√É¬¥mica em encontros com deputados para convencer o Congresso a aprovar a proposta de [reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/entenda-os-principais-pontos-da-reforma-da-previdencia.shtml) do presidente [Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/).

 Em debates na C√É¬¢mara, parlamentares contr√É¬°rios ao texto afirmam que a [economia para Previd√É¬™ncia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/em-20-anos-proposta-da-reforma-da-previdencia-tem-impacto-de-r-45-trilhoes.shtml) de R$ 1 trilh√É¬£o em dez anos com a PEC (Proposta de Emenda √É Constitui√É¬ß√É¬£o) recai principalmente sobre os trabalhadores mais vulner√É¬°veis √¢¬Ä¬îos do INSS.

 O governo, ent√É¬£o, preparou a tabela sobre o efeito per capita da reforma. √¢¬Ä¬úQuem ganha mais paga mais; quem ganha menos paga menos. O impacto √É¬© bem maior para militares e servidores p√É¬∫blicos, porque eles t√É¬™m regras [de aposentadoria] mais benevolentes, rendas maiores e condi√É¬ß√É¬µes de trabalho mais previs√É¬≠veis√¢¬Ä¬ù, afirma o secret√É¬°rio de Previd√É¬™ncia do Minist√É¬©rio da Economia, Leonardo Rolim.

 Ao calcular os dados, a equipe econ√É¬¥mica levantou quantas pessoas seriam afetadas.

 No INSS, esse grupo √É¬© de 71 milh√É¬µes de trabalhadores, pois a proposta n√É¬£o ter√É¬° efeito para quem j√É¬° se aposentou ou j√É¬° recebe pens√É¬£o.

 Bolsonaro [apresentou uma ](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/20/5652-aovivo.shtml)[PEC](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/20/5652-aovivo.shtml) para endurecer as regras de aposentadorias, [pens√É¬£o por morte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/reforma-da-previdencia-permite-pensao-por-morte-abaixo-do-salario-minimo.shtml) e mudar as al√É¬≠quotas de contribui√É¬ß√É¬£o.

 Juntas, as medidas representam uma economia de R$ 687 bilh√É¬µes para a Previd√É¬™ncia em uma d√É¬©cada. Esse √É¬© o peso da PEC para os trabalhadores da iniciativa privada √¢¬Ä¬înas cidades e na zona rural.

 Mas, como o n√É¬∫mero de pessoas nesse grupo √É¬© expressivo, a parcela para cada trabalhador seria dilu√É¬≠da.

 Esse c√É¬°lculo √¢¬Ä¬îimpacto per capita de R$ 9,6 mil√¢¬Ä¬î √É¬© uma m√É¬©dia, pois a reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia prev√É¬™ medidas diferentes dependendo do tipo de trabalho, idade e sexo.

 A maioria dos brasileiros que est√É¬£o no RGPS (Regime Geral de Previd√É¬™ncia Social) j√É¬° se aposenta por idade, principalmente os mais pobres.

 Para servidores p√É¬∫blicos e militares, a reforma da Previd√É¬™ncia afeta ativos e inativos.

 Foram consideradas cerca de 1,4 milh√É¬£o de pessoas que est√É¬£o ou j√É¬° passaram pelo funcionalismo p√É¬∫blico, porque a PEC eleva a al√É¬≠quota de contribui√É¬ß√É¬£o para aposentados.

 O governo espera economizar cerca de R$ 200 bilh√É¬µes em dez anos com as novas regras para o setor p√É¬∫blico.

 Assim, o peso da reforma seria, em m√É¬©dia, pr√É¬≥ximo a R$ 141 mil reais por servidor ativo ou inativo √¢¬Ä¬îque t√É¬™m sal√É¬°rios mais altos que a m√É¬©dia do trabalhador da iniciativa privada e que se aposentam com valores bem elevados.

 No caso dos militares, mesmo se forem considerados os ganhos da categoria com a reestrutura√É¬ß√É¬£o da carreira, o impacto por pessoa ainda seria superior ao do RGPS.

 Mas t√É¬©cnicos do Minist√É¬©rio da Economia s√É¬£o contr√É¬°rios a esse tipo de compara√É¬ß√É¬£o.

 √¢¬Ä¬úA reestrutura√É¬ß√É¬£o, aumento de sal√É¬°rio √É¬© uma coisa; regra de inatividade e pens√É¬£o √É¬© outra√¢¬Ä¬ù, justificou Rolim.

 O economista Marcos Mendes concorda que as medidas previdenci√É¬°rias e as benesses a militares t√É¬™m que ser analisadas separadamente.

 √¢¬Ä¬úPodemos questionar se esse √É¬© o momento para propor a reestrutura√É¬ß√É¬£o de carreiras, mas s√É¬£o duas coisas distintas.√¢¬Ä¬ù

 Os c√É¬°lculos do governo sobre o impacto per capita excluem os efeitos das mudan√É¬ßas [propostas para o BPC (benef√É¬≠cio pago a idosos carentes)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/02/beneficios-para-pobres-poderao-ser-abaixo-do-minimo.shtml) e o corte no abono salarial.

 Rolim argumenta que, por serem benef√É¬≠cios assistenciais, as medidas n√É¬£o podem estar na compara√É¬ß√É¬£o apresentada a deputados. Em dez anos, elas representariam uma redu√É¬ß√É¬£o de R$ 182 bilh√É¬µes √¢¬Ä¬îvalor que deixaria de ser pago a brasileiros de baixa renda.

It *was* Javi's fault, he does anything and everything to get under Kail's skin (see the soccer contact list).

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","That was a lot of topics, most of which, probably not to your surprise, I think you've mischaracterized. ""Someone said it's a white nationalist symbol"" isn't an honest depiction of the controversy around the OK sign. It's a fact that it's been used as an under the radar signifier to other white supremacists. Crypto-fascists aren't a conspiracy theory. You can read about these things in their own spaces and hear it from their own mouths. This is a terrible argument, and heavily inspired by emotion. It's an emotional urge not to be dictated to, to rebel against being told that actions you don't **feel** contribute to harm shouldn't be a big deal despite there being evidence to the contrary. Just like conservatives don't **feel** like their edgy memes are dangerous despite inspiring people like the MAGA bomber and the most recent Christchurch shooting.

Your post isn't supplanting emotional language with unemotional facts, but with your own emotionally charged rhetoric. You've cast ICE as heroes, ""saving"" people from terrible fates, and tried to project onto me a position I don't hold by implying I believe in the ""evil right"" and ""angelic left"". I don't think you've been paying much attention to my posts if you think that's how I see things. I think the center left Democratic Party supports plenty of things I would likewise consider immoral. They're just amateurs compared to the GOP who make the Legion of Doom look like a second grade Chuck E. Cheese birthday party.

You have all these weird logical fallacies like ""Ha, you believe in socialism but you haven't gotten rid of all your possessions! Checkmate!"" This isn't a gotcha, it's just ridiculous. I don't know how you even wrote that without hurting yourself. If I did that I'd simply starve and be no use to anyone and for no reason, because the systemic problems that caused the conditions that I'd be giving all of my possessions up to solve, would still be in effect. My drop in the bucket would be meaningless, and my sacrifice would be ultimately foolish. So instead I spend my time and money (of which I don't have much) advocating for systemic change that would remove those systems of oppression in a mandatory way so that no one need to face those conditions in the first place.

Your paradigm is a dead end. Individuals can't solve societal problems on their own and it's not a moral fault that they can't. Those problems are too big and complex to sort out by everyone ""doing their part"" in an individual and disorganized way. Some things take the force of law and the organization of the state.

I'm not suggesting that the left doesn't use emotionally charge language. They do, it's that the right does as well, all the time, if not moreso, and they live in denial of this fact. Most of their arguments are feelings based arguments and they have absolutely no idea. Conservatives **feel** like immigration is an emergency despite evidence to the contrary. Conservatives **feel** like climate change is being overblown, they **feel** like free speech is under attack, that identity politics is out of control, etc, and when responded to with facts, they use emotional language to justify their incredible level of denial as an intolerance to the conservative mindset rather than confront that maybe some of their beliefs are mistaken.

Always look at the work contract.  If they're pressuring you to sign it immediately, that's a huge red flag.  There's nothing wrong with taking time to go through the whole contract.  If you're unsure of anything, ask someone else.

Turn up on time, and willing to work.  This will put you above probably 60% of your co-workers.  

As I said, you're going to get mostly shitty jobs, but there's a hard limit on how much shit you should take.  

Getting a job is always easier whilst you're employed.  If there's no hope of advancement in your current role, or you've reached your hard limit, start looking for another job.  Like, NOW.  Ask around some employment agencies if they offer CV tuning services.  Try to get a good reference from every job you have.",1554076943

I'm all for no abortions besides for medical situations. Sorry for assuming you weren't for it. However, that's not a fully logical stance because it doesn't take into account the real world.

Common argument-
Pregnancies are an ordeal and will hinder your ability to work. Just because someone made a mistake (or prehaps something goes wrong), should you be FORCED to take a break from your career?  


I actually think that having consensual sex means you are accepting the risks of pregnancy (however small they can possibly be) and should be able to deal with it, so yeah, you should be forced to take a break. 

But do you really think you will be able to sell that argument to people?
People will just have sex anyway and then turn to backroom abortions if it goes wrong.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Quase seis d√É¬©cadas ap√É¬≥s sua morte, √É¬© f√É¬°cil encontrar refer√É¬™ncias a Oswaldo Aranha em card√É¬°pios de restaurantes cariocas √¢¬Ä¬îonde um fil√É¬© batizado em sua honra √É¬© prato tradicional√¢¬Ä¬î ou em dezenas de placas de ruas pelo Brasil. Mas em sua √É¬©poca, poucos brasileiros tiveram tanta proje√É¬ß√É¬£o mundial.  
   
 A curiosidade pelo advogado, pol√É¬≠tico e diplomata Oswaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha (1884-1960) deve ganhar impulso com a [visita de Bolsonaro a Israel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/bolsonaro-anuncia-a-criacao-de-escritorio-comercial-em-jerusalem.shtml).  
   
 ""√É¬â motivo de muito orgulho para mim e para o povo do meu pa√É¬≠s o papel que o nosso chanceler Oswaldo Aranha desempenhou na cria√É¬ß√É¬£o do nosso Estado de Israel. Eu disse nosso"", afirmou Bolsonaro em discurso ao lado do primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, durante cerim√É¬¥nia de recep√É¬ß√É¬£o √É comitiva brasileira neste domingo (31).  
   
 Em [Jerusal√É¬©m](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/bolsonaro-cria-jabuticaba-diplomatica-para-agradar-israel-eua-e-evangelicos.shtml), ponto alto da agenda, uma pra√É¬ßa central mantida com doa√É¬ß√É¬µes de empresas e entidades brasileiras homenageia Aranha. Na internet, a p√É¬°gina dedicada ao lugar lembra-o como ""chanceler do Brasil e presidente da Assembleia Geral da Organiza√É¬ß√É¬£o das Na√É¬ß√É¬µes Unidas, que deu seu apoio √É decis√É¬£o da ONU pela Partilha da Palestina em 1947, que levou √É cria√É¬ß√É¬£o do Estado de Israel"".  
   
 Em Tel Aviv, Ber-Sheva e Ramat-Gan, ruas receberam o nome do brasileiro. Para um presidente interessado em estreitar la√É¬ßos com Israel, a mem√É¬≥ria do compatriota representa um ativo simb√É¬≥lico de peso.  
 

 ### Partilha da Palestina

 Embora a aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o pela ONU da partilha da Palestina, em 29 de novembro de 1947, seja menos celebrada em Israel do que a proclama√É¬ß√É¬£o do Estado judeu, em 14 de maio do ano seguinte, as duas decis√É¬µes est√É¬£o intimamente relacionadas. A ideia de um lar nacional judaico na Palestina remontava ao final do s√É¬©culo 19, mas a Segunda Guerra Mundial e o Holocausto deram-lhe uma atualidade dram√É¬°tica.  
   
 Esgotado pelo conflito na Europa e sob press√É¬£o dos Estados Unidos, o Reino Unido, que controlava a regi√É¬£o desde 1917 com crescente dificuldade diante das rebeli√É¬µes de judeus e √É¬°rabes, fazia planos para se retirar. Em meio a essa turbul√É¬™ncia, a ONU, rec√É¬©m-criada para substituir a Liga das Na√É¬ß√É¬µes, encarregou uma comiss√É¬£o de elaborar um plano de partilha da regi√É¬£o entre judeus, √É¬°rabes e comunidade internacional.  
   
 O papel de Aranha √É frente da Assembleia Geral de novembro de 1947, a segunda em car√É¬°ter regular realizada pela organiza√É¬ß√É¬£o, √É¬© alvo de controv√É¬©rsia desde que o resultado (33 votos favor√É¬°veis, 13 contr√É¬°rios, 10 absten√É¬ß√É¬µes e uma aus√É¬™ncia) foi proclamado. Para ser adotada, a resolu√É¬ß√É¬£o pela partilha deveria alcan√É¬ßar os votos de dois ter√É¬ßos dos pa√É¬≠ses presentes √É Assembleia. Partid√É¬°rios da causa da divis√É¬£o da regi√É¬£o, os sionistas (partid√É¬°rios da cria√É¬ß√É¬£o de um Estado judeu) tinham fortes aliados: os governos americano e sovi√É¬©tico, al√É¬©m de uma parte dos pa√É¬≠ses da Europa Ocidental e da Am√É¬©rica Latina. Contra a proposi√É¬ß√É¬£o, alinhavam-se os pa√É¬≠ses √É¬°rabes e mu√É¬ßulmanos.  
   
 Nesse cen√É¬°rio, o peso do respons√É¬°vel pela condu√É¬ß√É¬£o dos trabalhos poderia ser decisivo. E foi, como reconhecem especialistas, numa rara unanimidade. ""No momento em que compreendeu que a partilha poderia ser aprovada, Aranha teve uma grande a√É¬ß√É¬£o de bastidores e ajudou a definir o voto de pa√É¬≠ses latino-americanos que queriam ficar bem com o Brasil"", afirma Corr√É¬™a do Lago.  
   
 ""Na Assembleia Geral, Aranha foi um √É¬≥timo pol√É¬≠tico e um articulador fant√É¬°stico"", afirma Maria Luiza Tucci Carneiro, professora aposentada do Departamento de Hist√É¬≥ria da Universidade de S√É¬£o Paulo (USP). ""O Brasil poderia simplesmente ter votado a favor da partilha e perder. Efetivamente, al√É¬©m de votar, ele colaborou com a vit√É¬≥ria [da resolu√É¬ß√É¬£o]"", sustenta Fabio Koifman, professor do Departamento de Hist√É¬≥ria da Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

 ### Chegada inesperada √É ONU

 O acaso instalou Aranha na cadeira da presid√É¬™ncia da Assembleia Geral da ONU. Afastado da pol√É¬≠tica desde o fim do Estado Novo, a ditadura de Get√É¬∫lio Vargas √É qual servira com zelo, o veterano estadista estava nos Estados Unidos em viagem de neg√É¬≥cios, em janeiro de 1947, quando foi surpreendido por um convite para assumir o assento que caberia, por rod√É¬≠zio, ao Brasil no Conselho de Seguran√É¬ßa da ONU, em raz√É¬£o da morte do embaixador designado para a miss√É¬£o.  
   
 Como advers√É¬°rio do governo do presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra, viu no gesto uma demonstra√É¬ß√É¬£o de esp√É¬≠rito p√É¬∫blico e aceitou a indica√É¬ß√É¬£o. Como ex-embaixador em Washington e ex-chanceler, estava √É vontade em Flushing Meadows, onde ficava a sede provis√É¬≥ria da ONU, no Estado de Nova York.

 Em abril, o Reino Unido pediu a convoca√É¬ß√É¬£o de uma Assembleia Geral especial para tratar da quest√É¬£o da Palestina, e Aranha foi novamente acionado. Acabou assumindo a presid√É¬™ncia dos trabalhos, por proposta dos Estados Unidos (""Muito depender√É¬° da coragem, imparcialidade e firmeza do presidente"", escreveu o secret√É¬°rio de Estado interino, Dean Acheson).  
   
 A Assembleia Geral optou por nomear uma comiss√É¬£o para investigar o caso da Palestina e fazer recomenda√É¬ß√É¬µes √É organiza√É¬ß√É¬£o. Depois de uma curta passagem pelo Rio, diante da inten√É¬ß√É¬£o do governo Dutra de se aproximar dos Estados Unidos, Aranha foi novamente enviado a Nova York para participar da Assembleia Geral regular, em setembro.  
   
 Mas desta vez o Itamaraty n√É¬£o simpatizava com uma nova presid√É¬™ncia de Aranha, e os EUA haviam se comprometido com o australiano Herbert Evatt. Os delegados latino-americanos, ""pela primeira vez como um bloco indestrut√É¬≠vel"", nas palavras do diplomata S√É¬©rgio Corr√É¬™a da Costa, genro de Aranha, rebelaram-se e impuseram sua candidatura. No segundo escrut√É¬≠nio, obteve 29 votos contra 22 de Evatt.  
 

 ### Temas espinhosos na ONU

 Al√É¬©m da Palestina, a Assembleia Geral de setembro preparava outros temas espinhosos para Aranha.  
   
 Em maio, o Supremo Tribunal Eleitoral tornara o PCB ilegal, e o governo Dutra preparava-se para romper rela√É¬ß√É¬µes com a Uni√É¬£o Sovi√É¬©tica. Jornais sovi√É¬©ticos passaram a atacar o mandat√É¬°rio brasileiro, acusado de ""uma paix√É¬£o m√É¬≥rbida pela Alemanha fascista"".  
   
 O Rio de Janeiro contra-atacou orientando Aranha a votar contra a Ucr√É¬¢nia como novo Estado-membro da ONU. Ao mesmo tempo, a delega√É¬ß√É¬£o americana pedia-lhe que nomeasse um sovi√É¬©tico para uma comiss√É¬£o dedicada √É Palestina. ""Preciso de amparo e apoio. Se n√É¬£o nos quiser dar, pode dispor do meu lugar"", queixou-se Aranha ao chanceler Raul Fernandes.  
   
 A consagra√É¬ß√É¬£o de Aranha veio no final de novembro, durante o debate do relat√É¬≥rio do comit√É¬™ sobre a Palestina, que recomendara um plano de partilha da regi√É¬£o apoiado fervorosamente pelos sionistas. O texto constitu√É¬≠a uma rara unanimidade entre americanos e sovi√É¬©ticos, mas a exig√É¬™ncia do qu√É¬≥rum m√É¬≠nimo de dois ter√É¬ßos de votos favor√É¬°veis tornava sua aprova√É¬ß√É¬£o dependente de apoio mais amplo.  
   
 Assessor da Ag√É¬™ncia Judaica e futuro embaixador de Israel na ONU, Abba Eban relatou ""tens√É¬£o desesperadora"" entre os simpatizantes da partilha por temor de n√É¬£o alcan√É¬ßar o m√É¬≠nimo de votos. Em uma sess√É¬£o nervosa no dia 27, uma quinta-feira, v√É¬©spera de feriado de A√É¬ß√É¬£o de Gra√É¬ßas nos Estados Unidos, Aranha usou sua autoridade para suspender a sess√É¬£o. Assim, a causa sionista ganhava mais de 24 horas para conquistar votos. ""Aranha tinha a m√É¬£o mais r√É¬°pida no martelo que eu j√É¬° vi"", escreveu Eban. Afinal, no s√É¬°bado, 29 de novembro, em vota√É¬ß√É¬£o acompanhada pelo r√É¬°dio no mundo inteiro, a ONU sacramentou a partilha. 

 ### Antissemitismo sob Vargas

 Se h√É¬° consenso sobre a efic√É¬°cia de Aranha em favor da causa do Estado judeu, sua passagem pelo Minist√É¬©rio das Rela√É¬ß√É¬µes Exteriores durante o Estado Novo rendeu-lhe uma amarga cole√É¬ß√É¬£o de cr√É¬≠ticas p√É¬≥stumas.  
   
 No in√É¬≠cio dos anos 1980, com a publica√É¬ß√É¬£o de ""Antissemitismo na Era Vargas"", Maria Luiza Tucci Carneiro revelou pela primeira vez a exist√É¬™ncia de circulares secretas do Itamaraty contra a concess√É¬£o de vistos de entrada no Brasil a judeus.  
   
 Prefaciada por Antonio Candido (""Este livro √É¬© uma contribui√É¬ß√É¬£o not√É¬°vel para o estudo da atitude do governo brasileiro em rela√É¬ß√É¬£o aos judeus no per√É¬≠odo Vargas, isto √É¬©, justamente quando eles sofriam a maior persegui√É¬ß√É¬£o de que foram v√É¬≠timas na hist√É¬≥ria contempor√É¬¢nea""), a obra causou furor.  
   
 Na √É¬©poca, por√É¬©m, o regime militar (1964-85) mantinha classificada a maior parte dos arquivos do Itamaraty. Pressionado por pesquisadores e intelectuais, o governo brasileiro come√É¬ßou a abrir a documenta√É¬ß√É¬£o do per√É¬≠odo a pesquisadores nos anos 1990.  
   
 As evid√É¬™ncias de que Aranha teria nutrido preconceitos normalmente identific√É¬°veis como antissemitas nos anos 1930 s√É¬£o fartas. Ao ent√É¬£o interventor de S√É¬£o Paulo, Adhemar de Barros, ele escreveu em 20 de outubro de 1938: ""Necessitamos, entretanto, de correntes migrat√É¬≥rias que venham lavrar o solo, ao mesmo tempo que se identifiquem com o ambiente brasileiro, n√É¬£o constituindo, jamais, elementos subversivos ou dissolventes e com tend√É¬™ncias a gerar quistos raciais, verdadeiros corpos estranhos no organismo nacional, tal como acontece com os israelitas e os japoneses. (...) O israelita, por tend√É¬™ncia milenar, √É¬© radicalmente avesso √É agricultura e n√É¬£o se identifica com outras ra√É¬ßas ",1554076947

I ask because I respect Hurley as an author and I'm interested in trying *Light Brigrade*, but in the past I've often found her work just too grim and depressing for my taste, due to brutal crapsack worlds and viciously selfish characters. (These days the real world is dismaying/depressing/stressful enough that I don't really want to read stories about people where any hint of kindness, empathy, hope, is brutally crushed.) Darkness and desperation are fine, but I need at least a little light to balance it if I'm going to enjoy the story. So where does *Light Brigade* fall on the grimdark scale compared to the Nyx books?  ",1554076947

W8JI explains the loop as follows:
https://www.w8ji.com/delta_loop.htm
The quad element is actually two stacked, shortened, bent dipoles fed in phase. The fed dipole  feeds power to the unfed half through the attached ends. The square shape provides 1/4-wavelength broadside spacing between the two short dipole's current maxima. This more than offsets the immeasurable gain decrease caused by bending the ""dipole"" antenna. The maximum possible gain of a square quad element over a dipole at the same mean height is just over 1 dB. This peak gain difference occurs in freespace or at an optimum ""sweet"" height. The ""sweet"" heights occurs where the dipole pattern has a strong broad direct overhead lobe at heights around .75 wavelength. The quad has no gain over a dipole, and actually can have loss, at heights where the dipole has a vertical pattern null, such as 1/2 and 1 wavelength. The standard horizontally polarized quad element is less effective than a dipole at mean heights below 1/2 wave.",1554076951

"rescuedogs","t5_2ryfq","My experience is based solely on being an experienced volunteer at a shelter, and on foster failing with a dog through a rescue:
- I've never seen adoption fees be arbitrary - these are usually stated upfront and the reason for different amounts is made very clear (large dog, small dog, spayed/neutered, puppy vs adult). I have seen fees be waived for unusual circumstances (not based on dog's cuteness...!) or for special promotions.
- It is possible for a rescue's business address to be somebody's residence. Often rescues are only a handful of very committed people who assist with pulling at risk animals from high kill shelters and placing them with fosters. However, a rescue org is not a shelter. 
-  The shelter I volunteer at also has dogs who poop or pee in their cages - not something you can prevent. However, the cages are cleaned at least daily, the animals receive prompt vet care when this is needed, are treated according to vet guidelines (eg bathed on a schedule if they have various skin conditions), are not allowed to interact directly unsupervised, get to go outside multiple times a day, and there is an enrichment program for each animal.

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","If you are familiar with ZFS, Ceph also uses the ""pool"" mechanic. You create a pool and add your disks to it. Then you create RBD devices in the pool just like you would create volumes in ZFS. CephFS is the equivalent of datasets in ZFS.

-Ceph bluestore needs whole drives.

-you can mix different types and sizes of drives but not recommended. I suggest 2 pools: SSD and HDD

-Ceph supports cache tiering between pools. You can make your SSD pool work as cache for your HDD pool.

-Minimum size cluster is 3 storage nodes and 3 monitor nodes. Monitors can run on the storage nodes so you'll need 3 machines to get started.

-You need a fast network. I started with 1gbit and performance sucked. I grabbed 40gbit IB switches from Ebay. 10gbit should work well too.

-Ceph does periodic scrubbing to prevent bitrot but I'm not sure how resilient it is against memory errors, so I run ECC memory on all my machines. Also storage nodes can use system memory for caching.

-Ceph also supports compression. CPU overhead is really low so I suggest turning it on as default on the entire pool.

-Instead of creating files as disks for VM's, you mount RBD devices to your VM's. RBD devices are thin provisioned and also support trim/unmap. So if your guest OS also supports it, your data usage in the pool can both grow &amp; shrink dynamically.

-You can also setup CephFS, this will allow the hosts to directly access files stored in a pool. Could be useful for running a file server. I would not recommend storing VM disks in this way. Use RBD devices for VM storage as it's much faster.

-Ceph uses free space as distributed hot spare. For example you have a 5 node cluster and your pool is set to replica = 3. One node goes down, Ceph starts rebalancing accros the remaining nodes to achieve replica = 3 again. But it can only do this if it has enough free space to play with.

If you go with something like Proxmox, setting up a basic ceph cluster is almost point &amp; click. Only thing to do afterwards is setup compression and cache tiering. Getting it to work is relatively easy. Tuning it to work fast is a whole other story...

Well they were wrong a lot , but we could see when parts of their brain on the scan light up when their brain decided the answer

TLDR the experience of deciding an answer doesn‚Äôt correlate with our feelings about when we decide
Many times the brain just decides for you and you only THINK you decided.

Plus 10 million kids die every year under the age of 5, mostly from inadequate medical care.

No free will there , neither the kids or parents decided to reject medical care.

I've had a bottle sitting directly on the stone ground for a couple months (although through the winter) and I pulled it out right now and it was quite cold to the touch. I moved in the Summer and was too busy to monitor it until now so I'm not sure if it fluctuates much. Do I just get a min-max thermometer and watch it for a while? Or a temp gun to see the temp in different places? I know there's nothing much I can do about moisture (or lack thereof). Funnily enough before this place I rented a place with another basement closet with a big empty rack in it that got warm and muggy in the early Summer.

I'm sure I could hold on to stuff for a year+ in there, but how much longer is the question.

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","I'd honestly either wait for the Model Y or take a look at the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.  It gets about 30 miles of all-electric range on a full charge, and then the gasoline engine kicks on and get roughly 30 mph on the highway, allowing it to go another 400+ miles.  I know Chrysler doesn't have the greatest reliability record, and there was an initial recall on these Hybrids, but I'm a huge minivan fan and they are just way more practical for families.  My wife and I bought our minivan nearly 5 years before we even decided to have kids.  They are just so roomy and comfortable for road trips and camping.  We'll always have a minivan now, especially that we have kids.  The Model 3 is tight for 2 kids (in my opinion), and I know some crazy people have been able to fit 3 car seats across in the back by buying super thin car seats, but if you're tall like me, I just wouldn't recommend it.  The Model 3 doesn't really have a ton of combined legroom for the driver and the rear passenger seat behind the driver.  I need my seat nearly all the way back when I drive, and it just doesn't work very well with the car seat we have behind me.  My kid is constantly kicking the back of the driver seat, because its only about a foot away from her knees.  ",1554076955

I think you really need to consider that the closest range super needs speed and low energy cost. If you nerf any aspect of it, it becomes a crappier version of arcstrider.

If you don't care about being cheap,always have several bottles of Staminan/Tauriner on hand so you can spam weapon heat moves.

Zap guns and Super Spicy Knife are good choices to search for from Dragon &amp; Tiger to use against Shakedown.

In a general sense,just use Kiryu's Rush and Majima's Thug. Wait for the charge attack or the big windup punch that leaves him kneeling,then hit him with light attacks while he recovers. Outside of the windup punch,never go for a strong attack/finisher.

"SouthParkPhone","t5_3lvjr","#Throwdown Guild 


Level 17 required, with exceptions.
Moderated Guild.
We focus on communication, participation, and are prepared for team vs team.

Top 50 team on TvT leaderboard.

If you‚Äôre looking for an independent, drama free top team, look no further! 

We have always completed guild events quickly, and never had an unfilled request! :) 
Guild launch was November 2017.

Min requirements each week: 
75 pts for donations,
25 pts for card events,
260 pts for locker events.
However, most finish their solo packs every week.
TvT requirements are mandatory. Never have problems with people not collecting caps or investing in the wrong cards. Very organized team! 

LINE app is required for better communication. Come join, or shoot me a message, buddy! 

LINE ID to add as friend : trippysma 


All pot smoking, beer drinking scallywags welcome! 

We are looking for super cereal players who participate every weekend and want a guild that is kick ass!
We have two spots open!

Why choose us over the other guilds? We are super laid back, yet strong as fuck! We understand life comes before a game. The guild chats are not overwhelming, yet we discuss TvT every week together. Everyone on the guild is equal... everyone gets a say. And tbh, I‚Äôve grown to really care about the members in our guild. We are like family. :)

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

Parents basically had no clue where we were or where we were going, because kids didn‚Äôt have mobile phones yet. It was a great sense of freedom in my younger years. 

There were dirt tracks, and lakeside bike trails we could ride on, as well as a skate park. It was never not fun to go out and ride bikes with my friends.

"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","t5_3fmbm","How I bought the game:  
Was a long time player of DayZ and also watched DayZ on Twitch. Then came PUBG and without playing it, for some reason, I *hated* it. Watched a video or two and just disregarded it. Stopped watching favourite streamers (the people that got me on Twitch) because they played it. It seemed lame, boring, a big deathmatch and yada-yada. Pfft, suck on dat PUBG!

Almost a year later, a friend gets on my nerves about getting it cause now it was 1.0. For a few days he was trying to convince me, until i broke and bought it. What did I buy the next day? Well, my very first SSD because I wanted to load into matches faster. That was a little over a year ago and PUBG is my favourite game with 1000+ hours played. I still suck mostly, but fuck it's fun. Solos, duos, squads and customs. All have their own pros and cons.

What I'm trying to say is: you need to try it. If it sticks, it sticks - if not, then who cares.",1554076961

"BattlefieldV","t5_2uxp8","BF is a unique and a great game when the Developer focuses on the core elements of the Battlefield franchise. Vehicles, Easily accessing transportation, Conquest maps, Service Stars, personal emblems, weapon type diversity for each class, 5 man squads. 

DICE has fucked the franchise‚Äôs rep by neglecting the core elements of BF. The game at the most basic levels still  plays like shit and is extremely frustrating as a result. Iconic elements of gameplay from previous BF titles are missing and accessing vehicles has never been so frustrating. 

The core game is still broken and we‚Äôre not seeing a steady stream of new Conquest maps like we did with BF4 and BF1. Instead they‚Äôre trying to reinvent Battlefield. 

Don‚Äôt believe the game is still broken? Consider the following: 

Still broken:

- team imbalances(numbers). This was an issue for 3 years in BF1 and is still an issue in BFV. 
- Top squad‚Äôs all being on the same team and never being shuffled to opposite team post match resulting in steamroll after steamroll after steamroll. 
- AFK players never seem to get kicked from the match in a fair and timely manner.  You can Have a full squad of afk players on your team for 5 to 10 minutes which means you lose unless the other teams is really bad or they have more afk players than your team. 
- Vaulting(better but still unreliable to the point it can take 5 to 8 attempts to get through a single window)
- bipods(better but still unreliable). 
- reserving tanks and aircraft. We can‚Äôt spawn the vehicle we‚Äôve reserved. How is this still an issue 5 months post launch? Spawning the vehicle we have reserved works flawlessly in BF4 and BF1. What‚Äôs the disconnect DICE? 
- Sound design. missing/inconsistent enemy footsteps sounds. This is NOT a volume issue. Half of the time enemy footstep sounds just do not render at all. I have vastly superior audio awareness as far as hearing enemy footsteps playing Battlefield 4, a game that is six years old. BFV‚Äôs sound design was poorly done. 
- Sound design. while playing as infantry I often have enemy tanks appearing only feet away without making a single sound. Moments prior there was no tank in that location so the engine had to be active and revving. 
- not being able to locate or access a single transport on all maps but Panzerstorm. It‚Äôs obvious that Panzerstorm transports respawn much more frequently, in greater numbers and in many more locations than all other maps. The Panzerstorm transport availability model needs to happen on all maps that have vehicles. 
- instant executions when melee attacking an unsuspecting enemy from behind do not work. Instead of the instant execution we see in BF1, BF4 and hardline, in BFV when melee attacking an enemy from behind we love tap an enemy on the shoulder so they have time to turn around and shoot us.
- the specific ‚Äúperks‚Äù for each class of melee weapon(knives, maces, and heavy) that were present in BF1 aren‚Äôt functioning or were just left out of BFV. It appears the only melee mechanic that‚Äôs working in BFV  is damage. Therefore there‚Äôs no reason to carry anything but heavy melee weapons. It‚Äôs a shame because daggers and knives were nasty fun in BF1, but it takes about 8 knife strikes in BFV(even from behind) to kill an enemy and the quicker execution perk(from the front or side)  for knives from BF1 isn‚Äôt present in BFV. 
- one frame deaths 
- the respawn map when playing Grand Ops or Conquest often falsely shows transport available  icons at certain locations suggesting transports are available in those locations where there aren‚Äôt actually any transports available. Spawning in at a location where the map FALSELY shows transports being available then running around searching for the supposed transport in vain is as frustrating as it gets.  Keep in mind that six years ago playing BF4 we could see the ‚Äúreal time‚Äù status of all available transports on the respawn screen and we could spawn directly into any available transport DIRECTLY FROM THE RESPAWN SCREEN.   
- in BF4 abandoned transports catch fire, self destruct, then reset back to their spawn point so there‚Äôs a steady stream of transports spawning all over the map.  In BFV abandoned transports never self destruct so they never reset so we can hardly ever locate access a transport at spawn points. The quite often results in all transports being abandoned during the opening minutes of the match then players never being able to simply find a transport at any spawn points the rest of the match.  Quite often this leads to one team being camped at the one or two objectives outside their spawn because they have no transportation available to help flank or break out of the camp.  This problem occurs on all maps with vehicles except Panzerstorm. 
- often the only transport(s) available in game modes like Frontlines, Grand Ops and Breakthrough are located hundreds of yards away from the nearest available infantry spawn point. So if we want to access those transports we have to spawn in and then run a couple minutes back away from the frontline. Then it takes another minute or two to drive the transport into the fight. That or those only transports on the entire map are located way back in our back lines in OUT OF BOUNDS areas üòÇ.  You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Its ludicrous and this is absolutely terrible game design. I never thought I‚Äôd see the day in Battlefield game where accessing a simple transport is extremely difficult if not totally impossible.

The answer to both these questions are no.

###[Basic Phenibut Withdrawal Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/wiki/phenibutwithdrawal)

Unaided, cold turkey withdrawal, from a state of dependence, [even low dose dependence, commonly causes severe and potentially dangerous side effects](https://i.imgur.com/cGHxnIR.png). Don't rush the process when you don't need to.

**Rules reminder:**    
Don't promote reckless behavior. 
If someone is dependent on phenibut don't tell them to do an unaided cold turkey withdrawal.    
Don't needlessly tell people to do a fast taper.    

**Further reminder:** 
You will feel low or worthless or stupid while going through withdrawal, especially rapid withdrawal. Don't take these thoughts too seriously. Continue on day by day, things will get better.

"MortalKombat","t5_2robf","&gt;About the classic trilogy, that's a huge lie you're saying, they had skimpy outfits

Those clothes were more simple than skimpy: the MK2 concept for the female ninjas was a leotard with long boots and long gloves, concept that remained in MK3 with a few tweaks including showing some cleavage, yet still weren't that ""skimpy"" as Cammy's outfit from SF as an example.

&gt;Variety is everything, X you had classic outfits, new ones, thematic and fully covered. 11 so far is leaning only in one direction.

I can agree with this, MKX had more variations in terms of outfits, but, those came with the full game (and some as DLC). MK11 isn't even complete at this point, and the costumes that we saw at the moment are just the default ones, and also, we know that the full game will come with way more gear and outfits for kustomization, including klassic gear which it has, ""less clothes"".

Think of it this way...you show up to drill and do drill stuff right? Leading up to those weekends there's so much work that goes into it to make those 2 days happen, it's absurd. I spend anywhere from 15-20 hours per week on drill stuff (without being paid obviously) on top of my normal full time job. As a Lt platoon commander it wasn't nearly as bad but still around the 8-10 hour range. Almost like a part time job. Creating rosters, making sure Force Preservation Marines are ok, writing safety plans, writing Letters of Instruction, Calling Active Duty units to schedule training areas, helping Marines find jobs, helping Marines with life issues outside the MC, scheduling logistical support, hours and hours of conference calls, creating promotion and schools packages, writing classes that will be given during drill, etc. 

Sometimes I'm jealous of the junior dude who gets to just show up to drill weekend, execute, and forget about the Marine Corps for a month. But hey, like I said, it's all behind closed doors. The enlisted guy gets to bear the burden of doing physical work, the officer gets to bear the burden of planning and preparation. It's a pick your flavor kinda deal.",1554076971

"SelfDrivingCars","t5_2udmw","Energy efficiencies are great but they are a small efficiency in the greater scale of cost efficiencies.  

Energy costs money.  But lots of other things cost money as well.  Such as buying a car, or paying an uber driver, or paying car insurance, or paying to park your car.  Considering that the energy will likely mostly come from solar and wind providing resulting in an energy cost of 1-3 cents per mile, energy efficiency is a minor issue in the terms of the overall costs.  Even if the markup was 5x you are still talking about a dime per mile cost of energy.  

Reducing traffic and thus saving people time is going to be a big energy efficiency.   The big issue regarding mass transit in America is that its mostly a slow bus network.   Simple trips involve a lot of waiting and a slow speed and the pickups and drop offs are not actually at the location you need to be.   Turning an hour long ordeal into a 10 minute long SDC ride becomes very time efficient.  An hour of human life is more valuable than 5 cents of energy.  

The ultimate goal should be to save money in all forms rather than just energy efficiency with the car.   If the cars are shared and fleet operated this will mean that individuals do not have to purchase their own car and can just call it when they want like Uber at prices that are probably 80% off what you would expect to pay with Uber (before tip).  That $40 uber ride could cost $8. Or less.  That becomes cheaper than actually buying a new car, and likely cheaper than operating your own existing paid for car.  

The big efficiency is going to be a city of 250,000 going from 240,000 personally owned cars to 35,000 fleet owned cars.  All the energy both financial and material,  required to manufacture, maintain, insure, fuel, store,  will be freed up and allow people to do other things.  



Trying to optimize the speed of the SDC to save energy has a place, but its saving a very small amount of money.  If the cars are powered by wind and solar their per mile operating cost is so low that trying to shave it off a little more could be a poorly prioritized quality.   The much more important priority will be to bring the cost of energy down and make them as useful as possible to the market.  ",1554076972

I will admit, though, it is a clunky class at the moment. I could see where trouble could come from down the line. I will say this, though: You can rush to the boss and kill it in area one immediately and just stay outside of the teleporter circle to kill the faster-spawning monsters. In area 2, you can do pretty much the same thing to the double boss spawn, but after that things will probably get really dicey without being quick.",1554076973

The chance of winning three terms in a row is pretty darn small. Obama just wasn't that darn popular that we were going to have an easy time winning three terms, nor was Hillary. 

the Republicans did pretty bad considering we just had 8 years of Obama and a slow economy to give them plenty of ammo to criticize Democrats.

if more people had already known how horrible Trump really would be I suspect he would have lost to Hillary.

Their image was also far more edgier and more dangerously marketable because of Kurt Cobain's much famous marriage with Courtney Love and well known use of drugs and heroin whereas Pearl Jam always appealed much more towards the blue collar crowd of rock fans who were into stuff like U2 and Bruce Springsteen and had nothing in common with the culture of ""grunge"" and ""alternative"" rock in general so Nirvana was always a far more marketable band for the people watched MTV 24/7 and always bought the cliched corporate culture of rock 'n' roll.

It doesn't help that Pearl Jam made a deliberate decision to stop making music videos, stopped making as many TV appearances and begin to release far less singles right at the height of their popularity and the band did everything in their power to distance themselves from the grunge genre and anything to do with the scene so they could make the music that pleased them and evolved as artists.",1554076974

So, on the other side we have puppy Sif, which is protected by Artoria's greatshield until Alvina (or a *misterious person* guided by her) finds him and takes him to the forest where he grows protected by the Forest Hunters and protects his master's grave out of honor and respect until he dies.

So the puppy is bound to become a grown wolf as time passes, and not only that, he is a *greatwolf*, which must mean he's some kind of wolf that gets big. So he I totally get why he's huge. But the sword? It's a sword, how did it grew?? Why did it grew???",1554076976

"news","t5_2qh3l","That's relatively true, because they are mostly dealing with the issues that affect them directly, and most feminists aren't men. So even though the philosophy is there, in practice these aren't the battles many feminists are trying to fight.

There was a feminist movement dealing with men's issues during earlier parts of feminism (the Men's Liberation movement), but it fell apart in the late 70s when anti-feminist MRAs split it up and dominated the conversation. It seems like intersections of mainstream feminism with issues that affect men have largely gone under the radar until recently (2012 or so maybe?) with 4th wave/intersectional feminism. And they're still not very popular, because so many of the people bringing men's issues up *are* still the anti-feminist MRAs. But there is a context for them again, because people are understanding more that issues of power and oppression will often cross all the different divides. 

That's honestly how I got into it, when I saw that intersectional feminists are also trying to deal with issues like racial and economic discrimination, which I have had more direct experience with personally. Of course I also care about women's equality, but without that connection to issues beyond women's issues that I already understood a lot better, I would never have learned enough feminist theory to actually understand women's issues either.

"VeganForCircleJerkers","t5_kycqf","I think that this separation people have between humans, and all other non-human animals is insane. The whole point of Veganism is that we want to treat other animals the way we would treat ourselves. The whole reason carnism exists in the first place is because people think that humans are different or special in some way. But vegans that hate humans and want them to die because they're killing animals is very hypocritical. Humans are animals too, and they simply don't know better. It's on us to try and find a way to get through to them. But specifically denying a living being (ie. a human being) the chance to live, just because you don't like how they live, is essentially doing the same thing carnists do. You're ignoring the consequences of a small action (or inaction) that you would do now, and would have an impact on another living being in the future. In fact your actions to specifically and consciously deny life to someone is probably worse than your average carnists who doesn't totally realize the consequences of their actions. 

As vegans we have a responsibility to preach total compassion, and consideration for all living things. We can't start Veganism from a point of hatred. We have to change the way people think, and educate people on the unimaginable horrors these animals face, as well as the devastating impact it has on the environment. I find that people really truly don't know, and when you calmly and politely have a conversation with someone, and slowly bring up a few of these facts, they often get interested by themselves and start asking their own questions. But slowly killing carnists, one by one, and as indirectly as not donating organs, is simply not making any difference at all. People are born at a faster rate than that. You'd really be causing more suffering, and to intentionally cause suffering is literally the opposite of Veganism. So yes I think as a vegan, you should be an organ donor, and it might actually be anti-vegan not to. ",1554076977

Again, that's on you bro. You are like a trash fighting game player complaining about ""winning means nothing if you didn't have flashy moves and combos"". Naw, you are just salty you lost to something that *supposedly* takes no skill. I might be trash at aiming due to this being my first FPS game, but I've been around strategic competitve games my whole life.

I've had plenty of games where my opponent seems like he has a win, then bamboozle him for a sweep. Kick and scream as much as you like, but at the end of the day, being on the win screen is what matters. Not some inflated sense of trying to win the ""right"" way.

This isn't as big or drastic of a shift as it might seem on face. It's a great movement, for sure. As a lifelong Idaho resident, I just felt it relevant to bring up the point of copious hydro resources here in the state.

EDIT: I'd also be curious to know if Idaho Power has its sights on piggybacking off UAMPS and NuScale with the SMR project that is planned here in Idaho for the mid 2020's. If the project goes well, it's not inconceivable that Idaho Power could say ""Hey we want to have a couple modules installed at the desert site too!"", as an easy way to boost carbon free power capacity while letting UAMPS shoulder the risk until the project is up and running.

Destructive succubus is ok but it‚Äôs a bit of a high roll. Dragon and shadow don‚Äôt have to care about having board, sword just plays Latham and starts to damage you.

I've camped out in winter and summer in Killarney and think it's manageable but like you say, getting access from the core would probably be a nightmare. 

I really like the idea of having access to Lake Huron, even if an hour away. I need to stay in Toronto for work but I'm considering packing up to somewhere like Milton (or other area on the GO line).

I can do 3 days in the office, 2 at home, which means I could live with the 90min commute 3 days a week if it means I'm only an hour from where I need to be. I was looking at west of Collingwood area as the lake shore seems fairly built up but looks rural inland a bit. 

That being said, property prices are crazy high all over the place. Even Milton is ridiculous for a cookie cutter. 

Other consideration was moving to maybe some smaller city/town like Cambridge. It's smaller than KW and Guelph and think far enough away from Toronto. I could at least get a house with a decent back yard to grow food that's in my price range.

That isn't how it works. Before spouting legal bullshit, you should at least have a fundamental understanding of how the legal system works.

If (when) the state appeals, that doesn't actually change anything. The law is still struck down. They will have to request an emergency injunction to stay the ruling, *if* that gets issued then NEW mags are illegal again.

HOWEVER, magazines that were gotten DURING THIS WINDOW are now grandfathered in again since they were completely legal when acquired.

If the injunction isn't granted then the law stays struck down while they battle it out.

Either way, the appeal, if granted, will move this on through the court system.

Just because they appeal doesn't mean local or state police can do fucking anything.",1554076985

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

"Dreams","t5_2qmbx","It could be related to your past or your present or both. I interpret rape dreams to be something in your life you want to have control over but dont. Especially if you are distraught in the dream about the rape. 

The baby thing could be something you have been working on and you're worried that it's not going to plan. 

Not telling anyone could be shame based or guilt or something similar. 

If you enjoyed the rape (there is nothing wrong with you if you did, this is just a dream and besides that many women have rape fantasies) that is a little harder for me to interpret. Perhaps you subconsciously want to experiment in the bedroom. Doesn't necessarily mean you have a rape fantasy or con-no-con (look it up if you're curious) but could mean you want to branch out a bit. Check out the world of kink and see if it's to your liking. There's a great forum called FetLife just be shy about your profile at first if you create one. The world of kink is large and can be overwhelming so take it slow haha. I still get surprised sometimes at stuff I find out. It's really interesting even if you're not into it. 

People with traumatic pasts tend to be a little more open to the rougher side of kink. Not sure the psychological reasons behind that, but I can definitely say there is nothing wrong with you. You are a beautiful human with a beautiful mind!",1554076987

"1911","t5_2rtpo","Yeah, I don‚Äôt normally criticize the way people choose to carry, but I might have to get just a touch critical here. 

The decision to carry condition three vs. condition one is, like you said, based primarily on comfort. Sure, carrying condition one buys you a little bit of speed and less complexity on the draw, but condition three is arguably safer. In the low percentage chance where you need that speed on the draw, you‚Äôre faster carrying condition one, but it comes with the increased chance of an ND otherwise. 

Personally, I‚Äôm comfortable going condition one. I trust the internals of my 1911s (and anything else I may carry) not to accidentally blow my balls off when I‚Äôm walking around town. If you don‚Äôt wanna take that risk and are willing to accept the slower draw, that‚Äôs cool. 

What I don‚Äôt quite understand is the carry method you‚Äôre talking about. What you‚Äôre saying is that every time you load up your 1911, you‚Äôre pulling the trigger on a loaded chamber and easing the hammer down? You‚Äôre taking a reasonable gamble on not slipping and having an ND literally every time you load that pistol, and that‚Äôs not really ideal. ",1554076987

We‚Äôve made some compromises, like offering my dad the chance to say a prayer or do a scripture reading during the ceremony, but otherwise we‚Äôre not advertising that it‚Äôs not a church wedding and the rest of our very religious relatives can just get over it when they get there and realize that.

The state IS a power tool, and it IS used to force everyone to follow what it's voters think is right.

That isn't like... up for debate. 

The question is either use it to enforce libertarianism (or at least more than we have now), or hope it dissapears and then we have have anarchy (and then pray it doesn't come back). 

I mean... those are your options. 

Which boil further down to ""vote for the lesser of two evils"", or ""riot in the streets against the US government and hope for a societal collapse"".

Personally?  I chose the former.  Not the least of which is because it actually works to improve my life and it doesn't involve destroying the entire US on a fundamental level.

"apexlegends","t5_rgzzt","Try scouting more. Scout before entering a new area, climb roofs before going out into the open and make sure you always see your enemies before they see you. Most fights in this game are won before the first shot is fired. Scouting correctly is one of the most important skills in this game. It allows you to take favorable positions, hit the first shots, not get third partied, not get snuck up on and rushed etc.  It will drastiacally increase your survival time if you're not consciously doing it yet.

Also drop in less populated areas on the edges of the map. Makes it easiest pick and choose your fights, and take your time to learn about the game. I recommend Relais, it's a genuinely nice place. High level loot, waterfalls, grass, trees, ziplines and usually not a lot of people there. The one just to the south of it is also good.

Lifeline, Wraith, Bloodhound and Bangalore are the most beginner friendly Legends imo.

With all of that being said, if you have a high level player on your team, stick to them. They mostly have a plan.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

It is the same because it involves running missions that were already in the game to fill up a bar.

Define what makes it different.

&gt;For a player like me it offers me to do more of the content that I normally wouldn't have done because it doesn't give enough of a reward.

If you weren't willing to do those missions for fun, how does getting points make them fun? Really, it doesn't. You just get that manipulative dopamine hit from ""progress.""

&gt;It also gives some challenges that are actually challenging.

Which one has been challenging?

Not a single one has actually taken the amount of attention from me that fighting a basic enemy in Sekiro takes. What they have been is annoying and time consuming.

&gt;They made it to be a system that is available for everyone.

I don't think they did. Some of the challenges require star chart progression or standing grinding that locks low level players out of getting them, and those are the people who actually need things from the nightwave store. There's also the time aspect for these players because the items in the nightwave store cycle and that they need might not be available when they finally have credits.

End game players like me already have all of those things, so there's no ""extra loot."" I have 50 extra catalysts and probably over 80 reactors just sitting in my inventory because GOTL alerts come up more often than new weapons or frames. I have all the helmets. I have all the auras. It offers me nothing.

More importantly, I don't see what is *enjoyable* about them from any perspective. If spraying a gas ignis isn't fun, then spraying a gas ignis to get 150 gas kills still isn't fun. Sanctuary Onslaught did not become fun because a challenge asked me to do 3 waves of it.

&gt;And about the wolf. what would happen if he dropped a part every time? The parts would be completely worthless in trading.

And? I don't care about trading them. I care that he is a boring damage sponge with a garbage drop rate. Why does it matter if they're worthless in trading and how does the trade value of the parts have anything to do with what I said?

&gt;And like I said before. the drop rate for the items is not awful. 

You didn't back this up with anything, so you saying it carries no weight or authority. It doesn't matter how many times you say it.

No it didn't. It all started because you made claims that white being the norm was a sign of racism. 

&gt;I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs very hard for people of color to find products that work for them in comparison to their white brothers and sisters

No, it isn't. It is hard for them to find it **mass market**. 

&gt;But not concede that maybe we actually do discriminate against them. 

Where did I say this? Where did I say anything you could even misconstrue to mean this? I have repeatedly stated there is a race problem. Black women having to go to specialty stores to get makeup their tone, or learning how to darken makeup, is not a sign of a race problem, it is a sign of how the fucking market economy works.

I do appreciate what she's doing, and like I said, I thought her prior video was really well balanced: both enjoyable and thought provoking content.  I think anyone can see a development of maturity, sensitivity, and quality of content in her work, but this latest one seemed like a regression back to a lot of misguided sentiments, cis normalization, and seeking cis validation.

I never liked her presentation style either, and I prefer more conceptually cleaner work, but The Darkness provides a really excellent dialectic in comedy between shitposting and social responsibility.    


However, in all honesty with this latest video, I sincerely felt embarrassed for some of the things she said from her privileged, cis-passing standpoint, and I felt ashamed for the impact it could have on my non-cis passing friends who I try to remind daily that they don't need to submit to cis-passing norms and that they're beautiful.",1554076998

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

On the other hand, other than the comment JimmyBoombox made, I don't think there's anything anybody here can do to help. You kind of have to have a similar experience to relate well enough to offer the advice or comfort you are looking for.

The only thing I think there is say is that you don't have to treat anybody with respect because they raised you or spent a lot of time around you. It's either they are a human that treats you well, or they don't treat you well. If they don't treat you well, you aren't obliged to treat them with respect. I think you already know that.

Try to find somebody that you feel that understands deep down what you're going through and talk to them. And it's okay to cry to a bunch of people on the Internet.

An updated kernel will be included in GalliumOS 3.0, but until that is released, you can either enable the ""testing"" repository for 2.1, or use a 3.0 release candidate.

Chromebooks often ship with hardware combinations and configurations that exist in no other commercial products, so there's frequently a gap in driver support in the Linux kernel. Google patches things for their purposes, but their patches are not always useful in newer kernel versions.

So yes, GalliumOS is a tinkerer's project. That can mean many things, but we're happy to own it. The rejoinder is that if you have a model that we've been able to support (CYAN is well-supported), then your system can be rock solid and 100% reliable (until the soldered eMMC storage fails...).

I'll be sure to send an email to Gw... Maybe not this whole thing, but I'll insist on the main points like the lack of a character, the shitty warlord trait, relic and chapter tactic. Also maybe change the stratagem to ignoring penalties for moving and shooting + using the top row of the damage chart.

I love the stratagems... Especially the one making venerable dreadnoughts characters. That would make them completely viable in the game. 

I also love the trained by mars warlord trait... So damn fluffy (but make pay for the harness, or it looks unbalanced)  
As a chapter trait -1 to wound could be viable since there is so many -1 to hit in the game.   
Re rolling armor saves even with a stratagem is completely busted, as is the 5+ fnp. If you want to get 5+ fnp you should do it by stacking of fnp (Eg, the venerable dreadnought has two 6+ fnp that don't stack¬∞  
Maybe just add a thing where iron hands vehicles benefit from the chapter tactic as well.

So if you can't avoid exposure to a pathogen indefinitely, its better to simply encounter it earlier. That means ""germaphobia"" is rather unlikely to do you good, but might be a net loss if you are avoiding ""normal"" pathogens you will inevitably be exposed to later in life.

I have a polyester bag that squishes down into itself to be easy to pack and I've used it over 300 times. I wash it regularly and it has lasted for more than 5 years - it has paid for it's environmental manufacturing costs by nearly 100 times. It is easy as fuck to use and more comfortable to carry than an ldpe bag. And I carry it everywhere because its size is negligible. When it eventually falls apart (I've got so many more years to go) I'll have kept over 1000 bags out of landfills and waterways and it will have paid for all of its manufacturing costs and the costs of hundreds if its kind. 

The study isn't asking a lot of the reusable bags. Pretty sure at the end of their lives most of these bags paid for themselves hundreds of times over. ",1554077006

&amp;#x200B;

This firmly convinced me he isn't Ti/Fe. Notice how Sam Harris constantly tries to get him to clarify something, and the results are always like oil and water. Peterson can't manage to sync up with Harris's attempts, even on the tiniest things. He constantly misunderstands, and drops as many specific proper terms as possible while never really wanting to stop and plainly define them.

&amp;#x200B;

ENTPs are slippery like that but it's always slippery with Ne. Like, an ENTP in this conversation would have seized on Harris's attempts to clearly define something, and would have challenged whether you can sum it up so tidily. Peterson does the opposite--he somehow takes Harris's fairly basic terms and makes them too specific to the point of defeating the purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

An ENTP would have probably had a field day with Harris, since NeTi is exasperating as hell for an INFJ. But Peterson sort of seems oblivious to that, and just ignores Harris's attempts at mutual understanding and audience clarification, and takes every opportunity to switch straight back into lecture mode.",1554077006

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","I can‚Äôt compare it with everything, but I‚Äôve had four 3D printers so that‚Äôs my angle. 

Kits: 
My first printer was a Printrbot simple metal kit($550). It was an all metal frame, liner rails, auto leveling, no zip ties. I had it for 8 mi this before I binned it. I spent five of those eight months fighting with it or replacing parts that kept failing. 

Pre-builts:
My second printer was (is I still have it) a Flashforge Creator Pro($1000). The printer is a work horse. I have 2300+ hours on it. However it‚Äôs a manual three point bed leveling which is a huge pain most of the time. Also there is no active cooling so details and over hangs are sloppy or impossible. 

My third printer was a Hatchbox Alpha($900) delta style printer. Deltas are really cool. This printer printed Huge pieces up to a foot cube-ish. Active cooling, autoleveling.  I would still have it if the power supply hadn‚Äôt died and the replacement wound up frying most of the electronics. 

Then the Prusa mk3 i3($750)
As a kit the Prusa‚Äôs assembly is second to none. In my job I have set up million dollar systems that didn‚Äôt have instructions this well done. 

After building I didn‚Äôt have to do any tweaking to get great prints right away. Honestly the best quality prints of all four printers. The Prusa uses really high end electronics for a really quality system. 

I had my leveling get all wonky after a print failing, but running the auto calibration wizards fixed it all laser smooth. ",1554077008

Mrs. Blank,

I‚Äôd like to apologize if tone was combative, in my previous email. I feel backed into a corner with this. After receiving the letter, from Keith Grant, I had The fence contractor order the fence. I‚Äôm financially obligated at this point. Keith‚Äôs email was pretty clear that he approved with the understanding that future neighbors might want a wooden privacy fence and would be able to put one up. 

I understand that the ACC wants to protect the aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood. I think a 4‚Äô fence will be more appealing. I went to the house with a tape and did a line of sight measurement from the window. A 6‚Äô fence has to be looked thru, to see the lakes. Additionally I‚Äôm the first house that backs up to the lake. This could be a better look all around for this section of the neighborhood. 

I ask you to reconsider my proposal especially given that there aren‚Äôt restrictions in the contract, Keith gave approval, and I‚Äôm financially committed.

Her cuntiness is all her own doing, not the mental illness'.

Dia Lacina, in her review of Hellblade: http://archive.is/F5rkC

&gt;""it felt like I was being deliberately undermined ‚Äî that my own mental illness was being explained to me by an inexperienced outsider.""

&gt;""Perhaps I should have listened to the warning and begged Sony for a refund, citing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm severely mentally ill, and the game says I probably shouldn‚Äôt play.‚Äù

Even when those games had already promised their fans, backers and pre-buyers to release on Steam, their contract with Epic prevents them from doing so for a year.
* Epic Games is significantly owned by a major Chinese telecom firm with questionable ethics and terrible politics.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Hmm barbarian/wizard.  I like bear totem barb and bladesinger.  It has a ""I pwn the world"" kind of vibe going.

Another alternative I was thinking on is more of a ""Where's Waldo""  kind of thing.  You can be a mountain dwarf.  Use your same stats.  Go 3  or 5 levels of barb and take the wolf totem.  Then go 8-10 levels of  Necromancy Wizard.  Invest all of your higher slots in making skeletons,  zombies, etc.  Why not it's not a concentration spell. Wear high level medium armor, a shield and axe  or dual wield axes.   Dress and arm your minions the same.  Now your pack has the advantage to  hit any enemy within 5 feet of you ( wolf totem ).  You all look alike (  disguise kit is important ).  Now the poor mobs have to play where's  waldo while your minions go chop-chop.  You can rage if you like--low  levels--but once you get animate dead, it becomes a game of now you see  me, now you don't.

When Dan got a girlfriend the most posts here were basically ""Weird flex dude."" Not to mention most of the complaints and defense for that were located on the main sub.

Arin going on vacation is a bit different. The grumps stated that it's getting harder to survive on youtube without firing people. Vacations and hiring more staff is counter intuitive my guy.

For years people have had complaints and Grumps pretty much called it hate and ignored it. I remember being younger and hearing that Danny and Arin didn't read comments because ""After a certain amount of time you end up hearing it all."" Disrespectful a tad bit and also assumes that fans new and old aren't creative enough to say something new or give out fair and valid criticism. Then later they made a joke about reading hate in a Dale Gribble and went with the old ""I miss when Arin used to animate"" thing. Not an insult, just saying they miss Arin animating. They were making fun of the fact people liked Arin's animations, not just the people who shit on Arin for not animating.

Arin also got pissed off at fans for trying to help Dan figure out how to play Paper Mario. Said they ruined the experience but either way Arin didn't like the game. Then Arin pulls out the walkthrough cause fuck the fans helping out. Either way according to Arin, the experience would be ruined be it walkthrough or fans that do it.

First off, you should not be FWB with him.  Get yourself a cute FWB who actually treats you well. Getting some distance from this man and this relationship will give you more objectivity over time.  You might have agreed to it before, but today is a new day.  Say:  ""no thanks - I'm looking for a guy who's really into me"".

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, you did not waste your time, even if you feel that way today.   Each relationship is a learning opportunity about who you are and what you want and don't want.  Reflect on what this relationship taught you and bring it to a new relationship, with a new man who treats you like the rock star you are.

"ula","t5_30yuo","&gt;People can't hold Tory or ULA accountable for information that is not available.

Bullshit. All major aerospace companies have entire armies of analysts solely employed to figure out what their competition can do. SpaceX made it easy, by publicly stating performance to a wide array of destinations in a variety of reusability scenarios, and by giving information on engine performance and such, it would have been easy for ULA to model FH and calibrate their models against known performance numbers to fill in the blanks. Random dudes on NASASpaceFlight did it and got very close. Might be a few hundred kg off, but the difference in performance between FH and DIVH for all commercially or militarily relevant orbits (and the vast majority of interplanetary destinations of interest) is so great that itd be a rounding error. Tory has in the past made some questionable/outright false claims about rocketry in general too. Like constantly saying kerolox upper stages can't last long enough in orbit for direct GEO missions, despite the Soviets having done it 40 years ago with Blok D (and despite FH already having at least one publicly-known mission manifested with a coast duration longer than direct GEO, and at least 2 post-primary-mission demos on previous flights, and repeated statements that it could do so). This one seems to have finally ended after FH started getting commercial orders for direct GEO missions",1554077012

I'm assuming you have no manual action against you right?

&amp;#x200B;

We have a few sites we work on and this type of Negative SEO has been witnessed by us in two methods:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The first Negative SEO we have witnessed on another website was an ongoing increase of links that are categorized by (Porn, Gaming, Foreign Weird Websites).  These links poured in by the hundreds per day but were easily viewed as (Porn, Gaming &amp; Foreign Weird Websites).  In this scenario, we did disavow once a month for about a year.  The volume of links showing in GSC never decreased and kept increasing with new domains.  Interestingly enough, no ranking hit with this type of negative seo.
2. The seconds Negative SEO we have witnessed now is the Duplicate content/Keyword Anchor links to images.  These seem a lot more potent and potentially harmful since it is harder for Google to see through the intent.  The troubling part about this type is Google could think it's the owner doing shady black hat seo.

I guess time will only tell and we all need to keep a close eye out on on keyword rankings.  If all else fails, keep disavowing and keep on working hard &amp; ethically.  ",1554077013

"RedPillWomen","t5_2xing","Ok ok... So I'm honestly trying to understand myself here I think. Like I am trying to figure out why I like him so much and also how to make sure I keep him, though I'd say I'm doing really well. I've never liked, loved, and lusted after any single person in my life except him. 

Can I get some idea of what traits are alpha and which are beta? I think with this in mind and that there is a spectrum for both categories this might make a whole lot more sense to me. 

Let me see if I can kind of tell you about him. He is definitely charming. He makes all the women who interact with him genuinely smile (particularly the prettier ones) even if they are just supermarket cashiers. He's handsome and fit and confident without being arrogant (except sometimes when he's playing around). He totally ""has his shit together"" and holds a key role at work and makes a good salary. He's very well respected at work and they all like him, but he works in a female dominated workplace. Like he's the only dude on his team. In my opinion, they ask him to do a lot and he somehow manages to pull it off every time. He has vast stores or drive and determination like I've never seen. He has been a bachelor for most of his life, I know I was totally a plate in the beginning, for sure. He manages his life and finances amazingly and now that we are a couple I have gladly let him handle all of it because I have confidence in him. For me, he makes my life exciting and fun and I feel like I'm part of a great team and I know he would never let me down. I don't have to worry about a thing. I've gone back to school and he really encouraged me to do it and has been supportive every step of the way. He says things like we are going to be a power couple (that makes me laugh but I'm starting to think he's serious). I feel super secure in our relationship. I love to love him. I'd be DTF at any given moment. And I genuinely enjoy his company even if we are just putting together a shelf. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1554077013

Now what you could do is have the percentage of their income or net worth be the standard. For instance a first time DUI would be like 50% of their net worth\\income. Second time would be 75%. Something like that.

But you want the punitive damages to be reflective of the crime. Yes, someone of more means might have an easier time paying off certain fines, but more severe crimes carry harsher fines and repeat offenses have higher fines and jail time.

One thing at the end is when you say that protecting mage will decrease the chance of getting frozen. This is not true, as you stated at the beginning that prot prays do not impact the accuracy of an attack. Therefore, the chances of being frozen are the same with or without prot mage on and only depend on your defence and magic defence.

There's no right way to find love. It might take a year, it might take 10. Enjoy the journey! At the end of the day you are what you love, not who loves you. That's mostly made up of experiences and people. Love is always best found from a place of want, not *need* and so the more pressure you put on yourself to get that kiss the more it irritated you will be. The best relationships are formed when you're both starting from a good place with yourselves. Try to just enjoy the ride. Stick to your guns! Honestly, kissing someone who you don't feel a massive attraction to is pretty underwhelming, but with the right person its amazing. So there's nothing wrong with taking your time.

&gt; „Ç∑„Éº„Éà„Éô„É´„ÉÑ (The Seatbelts) is a Japanese blues/jazz band led by composer and instrumentalist ËèÖÈáé„Çà„ÅÜÂ≠ê (Yoko Kanno). Their style is very diverse and ranges from straightforward big-band jazz to more refined rock 'n roll and blues ballads. 

&gt; Since most of the band's prolific output revolves around instrumental work, The Seatbelts have no de facto lead singer but Steve Conte (from The Contes and Crown Jewels) and Â±±Ê†πÈ∫ª‰ª• (Mai Yamane) have contributed to and sung for several tracks. The lyrics of these songs are written mainly by Tim Jensen and Yoko Kanno. Singers Soichiro Otsuka and Gabriela Robin also provide the backing vocals on some songs.

&gt; After a few years of hiatus, The Seatbelts regrouped in 2004 to compose the soundtrack of the Cowboy Bebop game, released in 2006. Many of the members of The Seatbelts have also worked with Kanno and with each other on other projects, as well, and some have even gone on to compose their own work. For example, guitarist Tsuneo Imahori also played guitar on the soundtracks for Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Wolf's Rain (both of which were composed by Kanno), as well as composing the soundtracks for Trigun and Gungrave.

Some episodes do it, some fail at it. But the show definitely is viewed as something that wants to add social commentary and debate.

&gt; You can‚Äôt figure out the benefits of flying cars on your own? 

Sure, and I can figure out the downsides on my own too. Doesn't mean I don't want to see them grapple with both sides in the show.

You're presenting it as a laziness issue lol? What a stupid argument. I'm critiquing the filmmaking choices. I don't like it. If you prefer to just have entertainment with no debate then more power to you.

&gt;You can engage with an audience and encourage debate without depicting an actual debate on screen.

I can engage with other people without watching the show at all so what is the point of making the show at all? If it's just pure entertainment then fine but don't present it as some edgy social commentary and they CLEARLY wanted the show to have edgy commentary and to be viewed as high minded in that way. So I'm saying that they set out with the goal of having this dialogue and in some cases they failed to draw their ideas out completely.

"Salty_Spitoon","t5_xywqt","You're thinking a lot, and thinking clearly and writing it all down which is great. But I'm not sure its translating into a compelling photo series - you're in a no mans land between close up candids/portraits and arty, human-in-geometry shots featuring strong shadows and silhouettes. 

You can have great ideas but you need to be able to translate them into powerful photos. This looks kind of like casual shooting or the work of someone who shoots every other weekend, not the result of a months long dedicated campaign. Great art isnt born in a couple of weekends, it will take a lot of time to achieve things that people will still want to look at and talk about decades from now. 

If you believe so strongly in these ideas, commit to documenting and writing about them daily for months. Dont just observe - interact with these people and these spaces. Engage deeply, dig in, and it will show in your work. 

I like the last photo, I think if you keep coming back to it, you'll get something even better. If I had to give you one piece of advice based of these photos, it's study minimalism, and study it closely. ",1554077019

Israel is a modern democracy which treats people with respect and affords them rights. You can probably cherry pick individual citizens doing something bad if you look hard enough but by in large the country itself is an advanced, western country.

Also I looked him up, It looks like he was the prime minister from over two decades ago. I also don't really understand what he did that was wrong. From wikipedia:

&gt;As Prime Minister, in 2004‚Äì05 Sharon orchestrated [Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan). Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new party, [Kadima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadima). He had been expected to win the next election and was widely interpreted as planning on ""clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank"", in a series of unilateral withdrawals.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#cite_note-Rees-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#cite_note-timesofisrael.com-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#cite_note-Terrorism_2013,_page_9-9) After suffering a stroke on 4 January 2006, Sharon remained in a [permanent vegetative state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_vegetative_state) until his death in January 2014.

Hillary made mistakes which were made worse when you run against a lying con-artist.  

I have no problem with anyone running in a primary but if the progressives are only going to support their candidate if they win then there is a chance the centrist side could do the same and the Republican wins because of the split.

People often forget what it's like to be a teenager, it's one of the biggest changes you will ever make in your body and mind, but without the maturity to handle it.

2. I disagree with with this wholeheartedly. The response is clearly up to you as an adult. If it was malicious, or repetitive, yes tell the parent. This is not the case. As an adult, have you never had something slide because it was an accident? She even demonstrated responsibility by offering to pay for it, sounds like a good kid. Learning to be an adult has nothing to do with this situation.

3. Not only did he overcharge her, but he broke his promise. And for what? An easily fixed fence post? Teenagers often feel like the world is out to get them, developing brains and new hormones fuck up adults plenty too. Why exacerbate the situation?

My script is ""I know it's April fool's day. I know you have every right to prank me in any way you see fit. I also know I'm better at this than you, so do it at your in risk. I will not prank you unless you prank me first. If you choose to do so, make it a good one. But I promise you, mine will be better "". Inevitably, every year there's one who accepts the challenge. Last year it was my dad. He sawed the attic stairs just enough to make them collapse under my weight. (I was staying with him and the attic was my room.) A few hours later, he went to the store. Whole he was gone, I sawed a hole in his bedroom floor right beside his bed. Threw a rug over it, and waited.

Also, the fall of SHIELD is a pretty major event that informs the entire govt arc of Civil War that continues in Infinity War. 

I guess it's the only film not crucial to that narrative focus but the context it provides for a lot of the films is important. Esp since it effects IM heavily.

"dungeondefenders","t5_2sf8u","I have a few standard suggestions for players in campaign/adventures or new to expeditions/onslaught...

Make sure you didn't select hard mode on accident.

Use all available du... a 50 mana defense is always more damage than a 50 mana upgrade. Build as much as possible before upgrading anything.

Don't upgrade walls, damage output wins maps, not wall hp.

Mix aoe and non-aoe defenses. A flame aura will kill 10 enemies faster than a cannon.... a cannon will kill 1 enemy faster than a flame aura.

Make sure enemies aren't able to stand anywhere pummeling your walls without taking damage... especially ranged enemies.

Use skyguards for flier enemies.

Spread upgrades around. Generally upgrade benefit is linear so a 50 mana upgrade is 4x more efficient than a 200 mana upgrade

Use your best medallions... totems in walls.

You can repair stuff during battle... like walls.

Watch defense tooltips... the damage dealt stat is very useful. If after a wave or two the damage dealt isn't much sell it and move it somewhere where it'll do more work. Sell stuff from lanes doing really well and move them to lanes struggling.

Sometimes you can upgrade a lane enough that allows you to sell one of the defenses and move it to a boss lane or something

Lastly, a little harder to master... time is damage. The farther enemies have to walk through kill zones or the longer they take to walk through kill zones the more damage they take. So try to use the full range of your defenses, don't crowd enemy spawns. In addition to range, try to take advantage of slows/stuns/freezes/oils/knockups/shocks when you can.

And
Javelins throwers pierce so if they throw at your blockade and you have a tower directly behind it the tower could get hit and take damage too. Some enemies have an area attack, ""cleave"" such as slekeleon and plaguing hulk, if towers are too close to the blockade they will hit the towers as well. Careful putting defenses on the inside corner of a turn as ranged enemies may aim for the blockade but will hit the tower if it happens to be in line of their attack.

Also
Most defenses have defense rate capped at 25% (of base attack rate)... a few have different caps. Ascention is 35.. so that gets you down to 65% (which is an increase in dps of 54%). Defense rate shard is 33... so that takes defenses down to 32% (which is an additional increase of 108% dps on top of ascention... yes double)
Using gilded rate shard or any rate servo mod gets you to 25%... which is again an additional 28% more dps on top of ascention and ungilded rate shard",1554077026
"samharris","t5_2thqg","In his previously reply to Harris, Hasan also claimed he was ‚Äúnever a religious bigot‚Äù. But there is literally no other explanation for his bigoted statements years ago: that per the Koran, non-Muslims are animals.  So he‚Äôs def a liar.

Why would he lie about this, one might ask?

You got to keep throwing gear into A(eh) build and keep upgrading that skill power until you get that 8k skill power. From that.... then you can start tuning the brands and talents.

I felt like using the dps build trying to farm those gear pieces wasnt helping improve the loadout easily. Having switched to skill power build and farmed with a person was the way to go.

I can agree that there are things that frustrate me too, and have. Do I long for the pre-playoffs/chase/whatever you want to call it days? Sure do. Do I love the package? No, but I love the sport. And I also feel like I can empathize with nascar a little bit. I think 4.5 million or so tuned into Martinsville..taking that number, of those 4.5 million people, I bet there are 4.5 million different opinions on how to improve nascar or take it back to the so called ‚Äúglory days‚Äù and I bet they‚Äôre all vastly different. How do you cater to that?

We just don‚Äôt have the whole scope, and even if we did, nearly no one here can even agree. They‚Äôre in a tough spot. 

I also recognize that there is nostalgia in play here. I‚Äôd give anything to experience 2003 again as a season. And when I ask myself why..I realize I‚Äôd love to just go back to 2003 as a whole. We love what we don‚Äôt have anymore.

Our specific machine is extremely precise, we are not allowed to move it or it can mess up the calibration. We are not allowed to clean it because the cleaning material we use (typically isopropyl) actually inhibits the test and messes up our results, so we have to pay someone to come and calibrate it/clean it for us annually, which can be costly.


I‚Äôm not sure what the above redditor means about it doesn‚Äôt measure turbidity, ours definitely does. So what it is, is a machine that sends a laser through tubes inserted into it, this compares the turbidity (cloudiness) of the sample compared to your standard dilution (tubes in which you know the concentration of endotoxin per microliter) to give you a number of endotoxins in what you‚Äôre testing. This particular machine also counts for the dilution factors to measure precise results, which saves you time and is much more accurate/reliable than doing the calculations by hand.


The LAL is what binds to the endotoxin to help it to be picked up by the machine. If you have a sample that is high in amount of endotoxin, the sample will be cloudy, like putting a droplet of milk into a table spoon of water.


The LAL is expensive because it‚Äôs harvested from horseshoe crabs, which is a limited resource and you can‚Äôt just ask for more to be harvested because the population has to be maintained. It‚Äôs kind of like fishing, only those horseshoe crabs large enough to have their blood drawn can be used, all others are tossed back. After the blood is drawn they are released back into the wild, but as some redditors have said not all of them survive, as well as drawing their blood makes them ‚Äòweak‚Äô and is effecting the breeding as the females are producing less eggs once drained. Research is being done to try and synthesize it so we don‚Äôt have to sue the crabs anymore, but so far it just isn‚Äôt as reliable as the blood. We use probably ~5 mL‚Äôs per day (one bottle) depending on the amount of samples. And only 50 micro liters is put into each sample, but each bottle is literally hundreds of dollars.",1554077029

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Probability calculation is not an assessment of evidence, but likelyhood.

Absolutely meaningless sentence in this context. The new testament -is- the evidence they're looking at. There isn't any probability being worked out in some vacuum that has no causal relation to the body of documents. The documents -are- the evidence which then need to be thoroughly assessed. 

&gt; He may have existed, scholars say that probability points to his possible existence, but evidence does not.

I'm sorry, but this is seriously laughable. All their argumentation comes from the historical evidence available to them i.e. the new testament. Without it, there is no historical Jesus to talk about. Let me repeat that, without -the new testament- there is no body of evidence that speaks about the historicity of Jesus. 

&gt; I would also like to point out that any american scholars who are christian are likely using confirmation bias to support their argument, which is intellectually dishonest.

Both christian and non-christian scholars alike say the same thing. The consensus on this is incredibly uniform. 

I get where you're coming from. Shortly after my deconversion I wished so badly that Jesus didn't exist. Deep down, it threatened my new found atheism. His existence somehow made all the grandeur surrounding his name a thing that I still needed to completely break down and debunk so that I could rest in peace. Well that's completely silly. Who cares if some carpenter guy walked around telling cryptic stories? His impact ends as soon as you close the book, because if you look around, this world looks nothing like the world he lived in. This world has a suspicious jesus-shaped hole in it, which can only mean the -divine- claims are false, and that's all we should really care about. The rest is literally just history. ",1554077029

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","&gt;For example, the Army has been saying for years they don't need more tanks,

What the Army wants and what the Department of Defense and Congress want are not always the same thing. There are obviously incentives for congress to push for more spending in their districts and states, there are also very important reasons that we keep pushing out tanks and keeping many other programs running when the various branches of the military may not currently need the inventory. 

There are many programs that have been deemed to be of strategic national security importance and our main battle tank would be one of those programs. Not only do they not want the program to stop, they don't want to lose significant manufacturing capacity. The reason being that should we find ourselves in a nation state war, say with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, we wouldn't be able to start manufacturing new tanks, or missiles or aircraft or any countless other programs that we continue for the same reasons. 

To build something like a tank it takes dozens to hundreds of contractors building thousands of highly specialized parts, often using classified processes. This is one of the reasons we can't just go back to the moon or restart the SR-71 or F-22 programs again. The ability to build these technologies no longer exists without restarting from the ground up building every little part. 

Additionally, this is one of the reasons we give aid to dozens of allied nations in the form of what amounts to vouchers for specific programs. We'd love for a nation like Israel to buy the Abrams but they developed the Merkava instead. The goal with the vouchers for these programs is to get them on the program and then let them help fund the continuation of the programs by purchasing more units and lowering unit costs for our own military.

how is this hard to comprehend?

there is no direct correlation to one's personality having to do with one's quality of 'looks'. that doesn't even make sense when it pertains to a dating app as to where anybody can make several false profiles under the perceived ownership of an attractive male, and under the ownership of an unattractive male. The females as to whom 'matched' with the ugly's male bio in percentage didn't opt to swipe right, as opposed to the attractive male whom was able to match with girls whom had a much lower percentage of 'similarities' in their bio. 

you're not smartest as I can see, and with that I think it's unnecessary to even consider conducting a study upon OKcupid in particular, especially for a dating app such as OKcupid that provides a percentage of how 'similar' a man and a woman are as far as personality is concerned.",1554077032

No, and I never said this. You're allowed to have your opinion, I'm simply trying to understand where it comes from because of all the people discussing her videos, I have never heard anyone say that Contra is sexually inappropriate in her videos, including people who are looking for an alternative outlook just like you.

&gt;i think her attitude is hurting the trans community, milking her sexuality as a marketing gimmick while at the same time creating reactionaries because of the picture she portrays of trans people

I think I see the issue here. Contra has repeated time and time again that she is not the one true represensative of the trans community and explicitly does not want to be seen as such. You're acting as if she's a important political figure with a grand responsibility to educate in the most polite manner possible, but she never asked for that responsibility as an Youtube creator. If a viewer watches a Contra video and decides that all transgender women are exactly like Contra based on her content then that's idiotic on their part and not Contra's for making such a mass generalisation.",1554077033

"BrownU","t5_2sbc1","You can browse available classes on cab.brown.edu but have to wait until the semester to actually register for them. If the course was offered in the past, you can even search in past years/semesters to find its syllabus! The Critical Review is also a great resource to learn about classes (link on each course page in CAB).

RISD classes start on 9/4 I believe, one day after Brown‚Äôs. You can find their academic calendar and their course catalog through Google. After you find some courses you wanna take (definitely have multiple for backups), email the professors well in advance (over summer) and follow up two or three times if they don‚Äôt get back to you in a week - RISD classes can be very hard to get into and the professors aren‚Äôt always responsive. Regardless if they reply or if they say you‚Äôre on the waitlist, show up to the first class. Often times RISD students will drop (they are shopping as well) so you can scoop up their spot. Brown students can only officially register for RISD classes after the semester starts, aka after RISD students pre-register, so being super proactive ahead of time is key. Once the professor says you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôll need to get a cross-registration form from Brown‚Äôs registrar and print RISD‚Äôs cross-registration form as well, and complete each forms‚Äô instructions! 

I think googling ‚ÄúBrown RISD cross registration‚Äù you‚Äôll find a page on Brown‚Äôs site and a page on RISD‚Äôs site about the process. I‚Äôve also registered for RISD classes before w/o any art bg so feel free to msg w any questions!

"Arithmancy","t5_xmdt4","###Clueing in

I don't mind hints continuing to be released, but I'm not sure about the penalty. I've found that some of the hints haven't really helped with solving the puzzle, but have been most useful for corroborating your method when you've gotten past the bit that the hint talks about. So I think I'd prefer no penalty.

###The numbers advantage

Your solution to this problem seems quite sensible, but I've got another suggestion in case you haven't considered it. What about dividing the points by the ratio of how much time each house had left before the deadline after solving? E.g. Two houses solve - one with 24 hours left, one with 16 hours left - the point would be split 60:40 (I think this would also help with the clues thing, because getting more clues would mean you took longer so would get fewer of these bonus points if they were available.

###Organisation and Collection

I like the idea of a Discord server for Arithmancy. But what I'd be interested to know is how you would verify that each person asking to join a house is actually a member of that house? Would you be checking with someone in each house subreddit and getting a PM from the reddit account once you've confirmed they're in the house sub? Or would you be less strict and hope that no one tries creating alt accounts and joining multiple houses?

###General Feedback

* I thought the difficulty was pretty good. It definitely got harder as the month went on. 
* I think the increase of how many points each puzzle was worth may have been too much. The earlier puzzles barely counted for anything in the final tally. And because of the staggering of the start times it felt kind of weird that the ones worth the most points were the least convenient times for me. So I'm wondering, would you be changing which puzzle was at which time from month to month?
* This is possibly just a personal preference, but I find I'm much less engaged when there's loads of elements of a puzzle that all need working on at once. I prefer to move step by step, concentrating on one thing at a time.
* I'd be interested to know where you plan to move on from this in terms of how you organise who makes the puzzles. Because while you two are doing a great job, if you do this every month I imagine you'll quickly get burnt out. I think a couple of good options for this are:
 * Having a group of people like the Professors over at r/hp. They would apply and accept a temporary position (Professors is 4 months, which I think it reasonable) where they work in pairs to do a months worth of puzzles. So if you had 4 people they'd be doing it on average every other month.
 * Having a volunteer system like at r/HogwartsWerewolves. Anyone could sign up and be put on a schedule to run a month. You'd probably want to check over their puzzles beforehand, and maybe have a backup in your pocket in case anyone has to drop out.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NAH but you really made me think hard on this one. You‚Äôre not an asshole but you also weren‚Äôt very tactful, either

The title of your post is extremely off-putting, and if you phrased anything even remotely like that then you‚Äôd be TA. But this is your area of study and it makes sense that you‚Äôd answer scientific questions

Jenny isn‚Äôt TA because it doesn‚Äôt sound like you even asked about her experience with the science side of being trans. I have CPTSD and I‚Äôm the type of person who studies the absolute eff out of everything going on with my body. So I would be pretty miffed if a friend tried to explain my condition, even scientifically, with me sitting right there

IMO, the best way to handle it would‚Äôve been to ‚Äúoffer‚Äù some of the questions to Jenny. Either let her answer first or share a part of your study then give her room to share her experience or knowledge

Since this is what you study, you gotta know statistically and anecdotally how hard it is to be trans. Be considerate of that experience, especially if your career is based on studying their brains",1554077034

That in itself is not so much of a problem. The issue is that many of the Moon landing conspiracies also revolve around anti-science conspiracies as well. You'll find arguments like rocket engines not being able to work in a vacuum, Van Allen belts being lethal to humans, or that it's impossible to break through the ""firmament"" above Earth.

But regardless saying you would do anything except this actually very normal thing does make it soundlike you're NOT actually willing to do anything for her.

Like, would you go out in the cold to get her medicine? Would you go out in the cold get the mail? It s just a very weird hill to die on.


But if you two have a chore chart, if you're VERY clear that you will NOT warm up to the idea and these are your boundaries, and if you discuss emergencies before hand (ie if she has to go out of state or is sick, will you walk the dog or get a dog sitter? Both are valid options if both of you agree) then I don't see why it wouldn't work out. You just need to be very assertive and extremely clear before she gets any pet. As someone who likes pets a normal amount I would suppose you'd warm up to the idea, or that your no isn't definitive no, or that you'd be willing to compromise. Point is: you don't want any of you to be blindsided and your preference is kind of unusual, so be clear and tell her in detail so she can plan. That's all there is to it.",1554077039

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","I'm conflicted about this and would as well want to know how someone would argue for the hijab: The argument I always hear against the ban is that society shouldn't tell women what to wear and what not to wear. My parents were from Turkey, I was born in Germany. I consider myself German, I know way more German than Turkish, I'm not religious, yadda yadda. My mother was forced to wear a headscarf by her man but stopped doing so when she divorced. A looot of her friends are just like that. headscarf when married, headscarf off when divorced. Basically all of them are divorced.

My issue is: feminists know the concept of internalized oppression. When a muslim woman says that she wants to wear a headscarf or hijab, it sounds the same to me like a woman saying ""Some guys sexually harassed me because I was wearing short pants. It's my fault, I should not have worn short pants"".  You only feel that way that you want to wear a headscarf/hijab, because you are told to do so. That's not ""power, liberation, beauty"", thats internalized oppression. Also, I'm not an expert, but I think the quran never mentions wearing a headscarf/hijab I think. So it's not even a religious thing

"dankmemes","t5_2zmfe","Hello /u/Repetitive_Routine! Unfortunately, your post was automatically removed because you do not exceed our karma threshold. This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NAH initially but after reading your responses I‚Äôm heading towards YTA as you sound pretty elitist. Debate kids are a pretty self selecting group. Any high school who wants to spend their summer practicing debate probably doesn‚Äôt suck at it. If you do it by points, you‚Äôre prioritizing the kids from better schools who have more resources to travel to tournaments and rack up points, which isn‚Äôt fair to the kids at smaller schools with worse-funded teams. 

I think what I would do is have applicants write an essay on why they want to be in your camp, and accept the ones who seem to be taking it seriously. Again, any kid who wants to spend their precious summer days doing this is either already good at it or will improve rapidly because they care a lot. 

Btw, I say this as an ex hs debate kid from a public school whose tiny team was led by the local middle schools Spanish teacher because he was a kind enough soul to spend his time working with us. We didn‚Äôt have a lot of points, but we sure as hell cared and we were pretty good at what we did. ",1554077040

EOW is definitely right. It's short and very little mechanics.

I think Scourge is easier than Leviathan if you have power level to do it. But it's close. Scourge is so much shorter though. Surely the mini raids are easier to do from scratch than full? Spire is by far the hardest Lair though.

Then I guess Leviathan is easier than Last Wish but it's hard to really remember. Power level matters again -- how long would world's first have been if people had enough power?

And does a druggie really want to be tied a bunch of legal issues? Not really. Being put in the system can be horrible, too, especially depending on what state/area you're in. 

My guess is that the lady either panicked and killed the kid, or the kid died of ""natural"" causes (basically anything besides murder). Desperate times call for desperate measures, no matter how grim.. 

It's fucking awful, though, and really shows us how we can work to make sure things like that happen much less, like actually making the adoption and foster system reliable and good for a kid to be raised in, and working to help addicts recover instead of trying to completely ban all drugs.

"Soulnexus","t5_3nzct","&gt; For me it begins to smack of the Christian fundamentalist stuff I was raised on -- God created us, we defied his will, and now the Almighty, despite supposedly having complete control over everything, has somehow become pissed at how badly things have gone!

That is too bad you have interpreted what I said that way as nothing in what I wrote was written with that as the energetic intention.  It sounds like you are bringing your traumatic past into this.  I was raised with no religion and never actually participated fully in any religion or follow anything.  

And no one is pissed at anything.  In fact if I were to consistently become angry it creates an immediate separation energy that makes it impossible for me to reconcile with what I am attempting to reconcile with. 

The kind of work and energy that has gone into the purpose I have come here to do is tremendous and is not just a single incarnation.  However none of us view it as angry or etc.  However I will say that the negative polarity creation created too much work as Todd Deviney does say and repeats in several of his posts and in his books. Essentially it is unsustainable.  As above so below.  We see the word unsustainable used to describe almost every man made construct here.. why?  Because much of it is has roots in negative polarity.  The polarity experiment is to end and it is well on its way there.  And I have my role in this as well as others.  That has nothing to do with anger... in fact anger is a product of the negative polarity experiment as Todd Deviney states in that post.

What I have directly observed in the entities and the guy stalking me as well as in his father is their orientation absorbs energy.  They feed on life force or ""positive"" energy which is really just source energy which I don't like to say is positive because that's not really entirely true.  If they were to orient themselves as the rest of us exist they would cease to require energy as their own energetic flow would be ""normal"" and the energy would just flow through them as it normally does for most of us.  However it is oriented ""opposite.""  The negative polarity was initially created to ""create work"" to motivate those of positive polarity to continue their ascension process as there had been observed stagnations which had to be ""reset"" and could not be recovered.  However the experiment mutated out of the original intention into what we see here...but this is not the only place this experiment affected.  The experiment does not appear to be confined to a single planet.  And I do think he is spot on in that there are separate galactic consciousnesses who choose for their own space their ground ""rules"" which this particular one chose this polarity experiment.  From what I have read it seems the Orion galaxy comes up a lot as being rife with negative polarity as well.

Todd mentions mutations such as the creation of violence.  Hatred.  Anger.  These did not exist in the original experiment.  Originally the intention was just to ""create work"" and the hatred that I have sensed in the collective that guy's father works with is so intense a friend described it as endless.  She could only say to me ""my god he absolutely hates you.""  It's not hatred of me but they have a collective hatred of God in particular...their own creator and hence themselves as they are all fragments of that creator.  And when you hate yourself your energy ...well becomes that so there you go.  The problem is all life is sustained on the free flow of energy from the source and when you hate yourself that basically stops and halts eventually to nothing.  And you can't feed forever on ""new meat"" because well at some point you consume all of the energy possible in your planet and then what?  The only choices are to exponentially continue to feed and feed and find new conquests to feed on until all that's left is nothing.  Nothingness.  That is why negative polarity is ending and is unsustainable.  I observed enough of this and reflected quite a bit on what I observed that I came to this conclusion a while ago on my own before even reading Todd Deviney.  I just found it interesting his connection back to his collective garnered nearly identical information.  And once again, no anger in any of this.  Just observation and awareness.  If our goal is to evolve and grow in consciousness... something that devours all consciousness and leaves nothingness in its wake does not have a benefit that outweighs the cost.  In fact if you read the other posts he discusses how the work is being done to reconcile the polarity to the extent that the original Creator can send an energetic pulse to erase the experiment.  I actually was experiencing something the last two days that came through me to work on that reminded me of this particular reference Todd made.  

And I do ""remember"" that evolution of consciousness is entirely possible without negative polarity.  I am quite sure where I come from we did not use this sort of experiment ourselves which is why I find it really disturbing when some people start espousing about how superior humans are or how they start justifying the negativity as necessary for understanding Love.

&lt; I think most people find the idea far more ""digestible"" that they've been dealt a bad hand by completely random forces and they can never do shit about it. 

The concept that you are either completely do not own your reality is just another side of the same coin which states you are entirely responsible for every single thing that happens to you.  They are basically the same concept and two extremes on a scale.  I don't know if I said this but the usefulness of the concept of owning one's reality is useful for countering the overwhelming propaganda that one doesn't own one's reality... up to a point.  When it becomes tossed around to justify someone raping you or harming you because well.. ""oh I caused it"" ...it's like saying that person who does very well exist separate from you as their own separate consciousness fragment of the Creator did not own their reality.  Can you really have a reality where you are completely responsible for every single thing while they are not responsible for what choices they make in their actions with you?

And then to take it a step further in terms of psychology and boundaries.  The above thought process basically says you are always responsible for what someone else chooses to do with you.  Where is the boundary now?  There is none now between you and the other person as you in your mind equate them as part of you.  This reminds me of codependency which I did my first exploration of a long time ago.  ""Abuser"" roles tend to believe others are completely responsible for them.  ""Victim"" roles tend to believe they are completely responsible for others.  Those two roles actually unlike what most people believe flip flop a lot as abusers will become victims and vice versa.  There's no happy healthy medium in this dynamic because someone is always overly responsible for someone else.  There's no boundaries or just owning one's space and being happy in that space alone.  Psychologically speaking it becomes quite tenuous to adopt a belief that everything/everyone is an extension of one's own world.  Certainly we have our own giant Universe of experience and our own filters through which we interact with others.  That is what we own though the interface with our collective interface is quite interesting as this whole ""violence"" thing done by negative polarity has done quite a bit to wear down what used to be more clear boundaries.  As in what I experienced truly was my own thing...like I said this is complicated.  I have a feeling on other worlds where this experiment did not occur this boundary is not permeable and the understanding that one's own thoughts are from one's own perception of the external is more obvious.  

What I did at one point in my own blog/spiritual IG was to emphasize this boundary of having one's own Universe and to fully own it.  You must take responsibility for your part in your perception/actions/etc.  Without this you are a rudderless boat drifting in the collective currents of this insane reality.  I actually imbued this into the quotes I wrote and pictures I put on IG.  I was guided to do this in this particular way.  So yes I do say own your space.  But don't own OTHER spaces that are not you... that is what negative polarity tends to do and is quite insidious in how it goes about it.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I think the reason we see very little progress on immigration is because it is less of a zero sum game than other major wedge issues. 

Fundamentally in the USA it seems that voters reward politicians that take strong stances against their opponent on wedge issues rather than those that offer solutions ‚ÄúDemocrats want to ban guns and we are going to go in and stop them‚Äù gets more votes than ‚Äúhere is my solution to gun control‚Äù. Similarly ‚ÄúThe GOP wants to ban abortions and we are going to stop them‚Äù gets more votes than ‚Äúhere is my solution to abortion‚Äù. 

This is part of the reason we see so little progress, but with both of these issues there is a very obvious give and take. With something like abortion, you either make it easier to get them or harder, so if you claim to have a side in it you have to at least do something, vote on some law that pushes that needle one way or the other.

Immigration is complex enough that their is no obvious needle. This makes it the perfect wedge issue for politicians because they do not have to do anything. ‚ÄúDemocrats want open borders‚Äù gets people angry and turns out voters, and there are not any laws you have to pass to back up that position. Maybe just built a useless wall to show your voters you are ‚Äúhard‚Äù on immigration. Similarly if your position is ‚Äúthe GOP is inhumane, they want to put children in cages‚Äù, there are no laws you have to put forward to support that, you just have to resist your opponents and throw out some meat to your base like sanctuary cities. 

TLDR: immigration can‚Äôt get better if all we care about is opposition. You do not have to show any progress on immigration to show you oppose the other side",1554077042

The military spending is controlled by inflation but not local purchasing power parity (which is important as 1 US dollar does not buy the same in Japan as it does in Russia).

As far as I'm aware, military spending of the US has gone down since 2007 but this is a nice visualisation of data that serves as a good proxy to judge how important militarily were different countries at different times at the world stage

Globally, it seems military spending as a [% of GDP has been decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/bsq5ljT.png) (Source is the first link) - with the notable exception of Russia and the US during the period of 2000 to 2010. Even though the %GDP spenging of China has remained stable and low - their spending is rising considerably fast due to their growth rate. They spent around [2.5x more in their 2016 budget](https://chinapower.csis.org/military-spending/) than the nominal amount shown by the video in 2007. [These are the predictions the article makes for 2045](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/08/ourworldindata_defence-spending-projections-to-2045-uk-government.png) - have in mind again, this is not taking into account differences in regional prices - China, Russia and India gain ground if we take purchasing power parity into account.

Is there reason to be concerned by China's fast expanding military? Should the west and the US continue the downward trend of demilitarization?

"Berserk","t5_2rru6","The Casca theory I have historically seen the most is people saying she will run back to Griffith out of some remaining sense of irrational devotion. That‚Äôs the fan theory that I particularly dislike. 

On the subject of ‚Äúcommander Casca‚Äù, Guts‚Äô party doesn‚Äôt really have a true leader imo nor does it truly need one‚Äînot if it remains its current size. Everyone may follow Guts from place to place, but I wouldn‚Äôt call him the ‚Äúleader‚Äù (in battle specifically) nor do I think Guts would call himself the leader. ‚ÄúDo what you want‚Äù is very much his motto, and that works fine when it‚Äôs basically just a small group of friends traveling around. Bouncing ideas off each other, working with each other‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, and sharing the burden of battle strategy works in a small group like theirs.

But if the need for something bigger grew? For example, if a literal army had to be lead against the New Band of the Hawk? Imo, Guts is going to do what he wants to do, not stand back and lead a large group of people against another army. It‚Äôs never been his style to stand back to tell others  what to do or to lead large groups. In the Golden Age, as commander of the raiders he was shown most often going off away from his men, not directing them. And he essentially ignored Griffith‚Äôs strategies to rush in alone and fight. While much about Guts has changed since then, I don‚Äôt think his disinterest in giving and receiving orders has. He isn‚Äôt going to be lead but he also isn‚Äôt going to do the leading imo. 

In that case, if the need for some kind of army came around, I think Casca would be a wonderful choice (depending on how sorting through all of the emotional trauma goes). Casca proved herself a capable leader during Griffith‚Äôs absence in the Golden Age. Her quick and steady leadership is the only reason that the Hawks survived Midland‚Äôs ambush. Her leadership skill was even remarked on by Guts during the eclipse when she was the one to get everyone to calm down and stay together as a unit at the beginning. She clearly has the experience and a personal stake in the whole thing. I would be interested to see Casca‚Äôs leadership abilities explored more in some capacity. ",1554077044

The knurling is smoother than what most gripsters will prefer, lacking anything that could be called ‚Äúbite‚Äù. However it should be durable as a result because there are no little peaks to knock off. For that same reason, the anodized color might also prove more resilient to scuffing.   
They do close smoothly and there is no doubt you can get a grip workout, but I don‚Äôt feel the price point is justified. These are \~$12 grippers. ""

"Drama","t5_2rd2l","&gt; All the ""empirical data"" said Trump would lose the election -- or at least experts like Silver interpreted it that way. 

That's not how statistics works. Clinton was favored in 2016, but if you understood the model you'd have seen Trump had an over 30% to win the election.

Basically, Silver predicted if Trump won PA, he'd likely win ohio/wi for example.

That's exactly what happened and it's why he won. 

&gt;  I'm right now.

No, you aren't, which is why you've failed to refute anything that was said to you. 

You're an old man that doesn't understand math.

&gt;  Don't pretend you're one of the world's great intellects for letting other people do your thinking for you, especially when the people you've chosen keep coming up with the wrong answers.

There's a cognitive bias in human psychology known as ""counting your hits but not your misses."" What people such as yourself exercise is ""counting misses but not hits"" and you apply this to anyone you consider an enemy.

If someone correctly predicts events 8/10 times, the 2 times doesn't invalidate them. Nobody is right 100% of the time, but Nate Silver has a history of accuracy, including 2018.

You aren't thinking for yourself, you're engaging in what is known as ""motivated reasoning."" If you accept what the data says, you have to admit you're wrong. So what you're doing here is pretending Nate silver making one off comment means his history of accuracy no longer applies, because that's easier than refuting the data.",1554077045

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I agree here and i hope you listen to this.  

I am recently divorced.  During my divorce, my ex got desperate and was pulling every card she could to hurt me, because the gravy train was leaving the station.  And my ex wasn‚Äôt evil.   Yours is.  I can‚Äôt even imaging the horrible stuff she is plotting on you right now, as we speak, in preparation for you filing.    You need to get a bag together and leave now.   And whatever you do, DO NOT have sex with her or come into contact with her physically.  Don‚Äôt even be around her alone.   She will do anything she can to save face, including making false claims against you.   Keep your DNA away from her.   

The level of pure evil you need to do what she did to you is staggering.  You‚Äôre still in denial and still have feelings for her.  It‚Äôs going to cloud your judgement.  You‚Äôre still young and in a spot you can recover.   If you try to save this marriage, the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù will occur, but at a much less ideal time for you.   At 52, you can still work for 20 years and recover.   Divorce is an MFer, but it‚Äôs necessary here.

You‚Äôre handling this amazingly.   Don‚Äôt feel sorry for yourself.   You are a real man, you were duped but you stood by your children and raised them properly.   That is something immensely important to be proud of, and can never be taken from you.  

Focus on the positives.   File divorce asap.

Finally, there‚Äôs a self help coach out there named Corey Wayne.  While i don‚Äôt want to get into his teachings and advice, he does have my favorite quote ever, and it applies strongly here:

‚ÄúYou can ignore reality, but you can‚Äôt ignore the consequences of ignoring reality‚Äù.   The sooner you cut this off and move on from her, the better. ",1554077048

The food is absolutely awful and they do not accommodate you if you have any form of dietary restrictions... even though they claim that they do. The ladies in the caf will probably yell at you if you ask them to clean the grill for your allergies or food restrictions.

The residences are half decent... if you don't mind spiders hanging from the ceiling, in the washroom, or your bedroom. The washrooms have drain flies all over and there is black mould in the showers. 

I think in terms of programs, if I were you, I'd only accept my offer if I am studying Psychology, French studies, Spanish, linguistics, Poli Sci or Translation. The FSL courses are not very good according to everyone who takes them that I know... 

Some positives of the campus: it's not as congested as the keele campus if you are interested in a smaller campus, the view of campus is amazing, you live next to the Bridle path which is the most expensive neighbourhood in Toronto, amazing food at yonge and lawrence, you have easy access to TTC, and you have a better chance at improving your french since most people on campus are francophone.

I promise you, I did not download this game to play shield security or AIM infector.  That part of red stars just seemed totally tone deaf of who the game‚Äôs audience is.  It is frustrating because unlike wolvie‚Äôs kit or Green Goblin‚Äôs appearance, the one thing you would think you would never have to point out to a dev team is that people play a Marvel game to play Marvel characters.  It is more frustrating because they have done zero to explain and/or fix this glaring disconnect.

TL; DR - Two duh thoughts.
1. Elite red orbs should cost 2000 shards like other orbs.
2. We should be able to red star Marvel characters we like instead of random minions.  No one downloaded or plays this game to not play with the marquee Marvel characters.  It is not Rocket Surgery.",1554077050

I've also discussed this with friends in California, who've seen the plant life on the beaches disappear almost completely and I've discussed this with friends in Washington and Oregon, who say the salmon population is almost non-existent anymore. 

Just because the media chooses to not talk about something like Fukushima anymore doesn't mean the issue is fixed. Shit, look at Flint's water. Still has an extreme amount of lead that violates the EPA regulations, but they quit discussing it in the media.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","So many rich ppl here...

**IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WITH A SUZUKI KIZASHI HERE??**

I'll rate mine 7/10.

PROS:

* Is relatively rare. You won't see another one for a month or two in the wild.
* Very comfortable.
* Good suspension set up - stable and flat without being too hard. (Apparently it was tuned with the Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class as benchmarks).
* Smooth - CVT does what it should, with no fake gear ratios (unless its in manual mode).

CONS:

* CVT drone if you're running at have your RPM hovering around 1500RPM.
* CVT is not as responsive as you want it to be. No instant ooompf of torque... more like a rubber band or a turbo - needs some time to 'spool' before you feel the power.
* CVT.
* Would be nice if it had bluetooth and a back up camera.",1554077052

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","That‚Äôs an excellent question. Her work is a kind of ‚Äúphilosophical companion piece‚Äù to Amartya Sen‚Äôs economic work on creating capabilities. Sen consults with the United Nations on the specifics of his economic theories to create capabilities. So, yes, the piece assumes that a liberal democratic government would be THE kind of government to achieve the material conditions for citizens to flourish BUT no, she does not state outright that the government MUST be a liberal democracy. 

So I think that‚Äôs why the work really shines. While it‚Äôs not the most out and out revolutionary work of political theory, but the ideas it contains are useful for conceiving of a moral and political framework centering virtue ethics. So while I personally do not assume capitalism‚Äôs existence in my conception of an ideal state, I nevertheless find a great deal of value in this way of thinking. 

Maybe someone who is familiar with the work might be able to tell you why aspects of Nussbaum‚Äôs theory REQUIRES capitalism. If this is true, I‚Äôd be very interested to hear.

She began to sing ""Year 3000"" by the Jonas Brothers, as they had covered that song and the music video for it played all over the Disney Channel during every commercial at that time. I didn't believe her, of course, but I didn't want to call her out on it, as I was a non-confrontational kid. Luckily one of her other friends, who was actually going to perform with her, talked her out of it. She then tried to claim that she wrote it for them specifically and that she wasn't allowed to talk to anyone about it until they released the song, which was actually released a couple years before that (the Jonas Brothers version, anyway), and was just rereleased in their new album under Disney.

Later on she tried to convince us that she choreographed the dance to ""SOS"" by the Jonas Brothers (which, didn't even have a dance or anything in the music video). I guess her 10 year old fantasy was working with the Jonas Brothers.",1554077052
"discgolf","t5_2qk68","So since you are saying that you dont really get any real distance off the tee and that its always ends up being a hyzer, i would suggest that you really should drop most of your high-speed discs as well as dropping most of the overstable drivers, if not all. So until you are getting more distance and starting to throw a bit more flat/anhyzer i would suggest something like this: 

Putters: 

\- Whatever you like to putt with

\- Pure (or another stable/understable)

\- Envy ( or another stable/a bit overstable)

mids:

\- Warrant

\- Something really straight, perhaps a mako3 or a claymore/fuse or even consider to bag both the truth's 

\- Emac Truth

\- Perhaps a Rat aswell if you want it for forehand upshots 

Drivers: 

\-River

\-Breakout

\-Teebird

\- Firebird/felon if you want it  for the overstable slot, but it might not be necessary

&amp;#x200B;

If you take a slower and more understable bag as well as slowing down your shots i think you will get both more distance and control. Good luck with the season mate, hope you will achieve the progress you want!

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","What aboutism is a fallacy. There are ways to talk about and compare the relevant issues going on between this department and the last without using the fallacy of Whataboutism, many on the right simply don't know how.

And actually you would find some very interesting statistics on who keeps their standards despite what their party says. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/760jtn/ooof_trump/doafykp) explains it very well and is all sourced. What do you have to say about these numbers that directly contradict your statement about double standards?

7 million job openings in 2.5 years? How soon after trump was elected did those job openings happen? I'm asking just to find out if it that was a benefit he inherited or not. And appointing SCOTUS judges? You mean appointing one guy of which hundreds of universities and professional lawyers all condemned as not having judicial temperament. Also the same guy who showed bias against democrats? Woo! A biased judge is awesome progress! Do you want to include his dismantling of Obamacare in his lost of accomplishments. How about his blatant lying about facts or his denial of climate change?

We also have his, in modern times, unprecedented nepotism.

Was his restructured federal judiciary where he accused the appointed FBI head of treason or am I getting my numbers mixed up. Or was it where he selected a man who later turned? Or where he shut the government down for the longest time in history because he was unable to negotiate the deal he wanted? Not get what you want -&gt; shut down the government -&gt; get and even worse deal than was offered before. Now thats ""Art of the Deal"" worthy.

I'm very glad trump managed to end three wars. Tell me, would those wars have been able to be ""ended"" if it weren't for the previously mentioned bombings or military operations conducted under the Obama administration? It just seems to me that ending a war is not the same as winning a war so I'm hoping that trump decided to leave only once America or the side they were supporting could declare victory. Does the person handed the baton at the end of a relay race get to keep all the credit, even in something as complex and long-winded as war?

The bombing in Yemen was a tragedy but if I'm not mistaken, he was fed Intel that people of interest were in attendance? Making decisions on wrong Intel is not good but hardly damning.

"AskGameMasters","t5_3986o","
My main tip for where to start is to **start designing how people would naturally guard it**, not how the players will get to it. You should never plan for the players to use any specific solution; heck, maybe you shouldn't even plan any solutions. Plan the appropriate level of defense the villa would give to the object, based on the personality of the owner.

One person made a spreadsheet of times for characters, that they will adhere to unless interrupted. That could be used well for guard patrols; preplanned ""routes"" they go through. Insert a few holes, like at the changing of the guard, or two looking the same way at a time.

The players will come up with ideas to bypass things; let them. Player wants to crawl through the vents (castles had vents! just not powered ones! rain drains too!)? Roll an appropriate die to decide which, or select rooms the vents could connect to yourself. They'll feel clever for coming up with it, and you'll just have to act like it was designed that way all along.

To use indoor maps it depends a lot on how you're playing and the standards you've set before, so I can't help you much there without knowing what standards you've set with your previous ones.

Is magic common in the world? If so, there would probably be a few magic defenses, and antimagic defenses. Traps? Remember that traps have to be *easy to bypass if you know how*, otherwise guards would accidentally set them off on a monthly basis. A simple one is tripwires, anyone can easily walk over them if they know exactly the pattern (counting the torches?)

Inspiration wise,  The *Thief* games are good inspiration, and probably the best video game example. Movies, there's *Heat* and *Inside Man*.

Expect the players to try interrogating someone or looking for notes; if not, try to slightly encourage it. Easy way to sneak more roleplay and lore into it and give them some vague guidance.

Just remember: **a plan only lasts until it makes contact with the enemy**. This applies to both your players' and your plans. You should make sure both of them fail to work completely, but help stop the other, until one breaks through.",1554077054

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Some people say it takes them 1-2 weeks for the hunger to cut it out, IMO it depends on the person. I had 4 hours of horrible hunger where I could not do anything other than stare at the ceiling and think about how utterly miserable I was (was lazy to get up and make food hahah) and the next day I was off and running. That part is usually the hardest for me. Sometimes I do get it some mornings since I do IF and only two meals but since I‚Äôm busy, the feeling passes very quickly. 

Also if you cut out eating your typical portion sizes and your stomach grows smaller, weight loss happens pretty fast. For me doing 1200 makes me drop weight quite fast. 

I also notice that after two weeks of no chips and no cookies, eating food like meat, veg, even w cheat meals like pasta and fried fish, chips actually taste different (and slightly bad) after some time because even my taste buds changed. Crazy stuff.

"Soulnexus","t5_3nzct","continued from above comment...


&gt; Perhaps, but that doesn't change the past -- your statements (in my interpretation) still mean that at one point something did happen to us that was completely against our will, even at the deeper levels of being, and what's to stop it from happening again? And again? And again?

I think I already addressed this in the above talking about truly owning one's space.  Like really owning one's personal power space.  

When we absorb negative polarity and do not heal it ... it festers.  Some of the commonly taught habits here such as avoidance, over-compensating for it (narcissism as one example) do not heal it.  When it is healed the past trauma no longer becomes an issue.  And also it does not drive one to keep seeking it as ..holding any energies whether originally from you or not tend to create desires that drive us to take actions which tend to fulfill that which caused the original desire.  Anyhow I was supposed to cover this in that thing I wrote but I drafted it and it requires edits which require a lot of energy as I had to write it to be usable for others.  The point is when you carry trauma it drives you to take actions which fulfill the same energy as the original trauma.  This is why people who are children of alcoholics tend to drink and etc unless they heal that trauma deliberately.  You do own your space and you can clean it up and never have the past even be a blip on your mind.  There are people who know me who are completely shell shocked I lived through the abuse I lived through.  And the one friend I did tell about my psychic stalking/demon harassment was just like wtf how do you seem so ""normal"" (esp. since the week prior I had suffered a miscarriage as well...cuz life) because well, it's not like I hide it but because I process trauma and transmute it very efficiently and quickly (I'm likely assisted through my connection).  I heal extremely rapidly in general including physically.

While my sister still struggles with anxiety.  Won't discuss trauma in her past.  She has controlled her life to avoid any triggers to the extent that it's like a maze trying to avoid them in my opinion.  It's kind of bizarre to me but I can't help her as she wants this and thinks this is the only way she lives.  She lives her life entirely at the mercy of her past and all the past that has happened to her.  I don't and at one point she actually told me she was envious as a child of me (she's older btw by 4 years) because I seemed so fearless.  The irony is I am actually very cautious with my physical body (as getting another one in the time I need to could be a problem if I were stupid again with it) but emotionally/spiritually I have no limitations.  So yeah I don't live my life as a victim.  I am aware of my own Universe and my own space and I fully own that.  Others aren't my concern because I really want to have them own their space because if we all did this tomorrow I can guarantee a good deal of the world's problems would be cleared up.

There is no paradox in what I was saying.  Like I said the point of view where one is always 100% a victim is the same point of view in essence as where one is 100% always responsible for absolutely everything.  It is very absolute and black and white and pretty much nothing I have ever observed is like this in nature.  The kind of complex view I have is from a lot of direct observation which is why I find it incredibly hard to write anything down because there are so many complex considerations.  This kind of parallel yet holistic thought process is why I also take forever to make decisions as well.

I want to say this is all I can continue to write on this thread.  I have a lot of energetic work I have to do on a daily basis and like I said I really think you should focus on you.  Like your next steps.  Building your relationship with yourself.  I'm pointing back to you.  You alone.

All this philosophizing can never replace your own personal experience of these states of consciousness I am describing and that requires you to focus on you.  In fact these words are merely pointers to an experience and I'd prefer people to have an experience and not read my words.  

What I can say is ... it is useful to approach life with an open minded view where one observes everything, notes it down, and experiences it without any pre-conception or belief.  I wrote an entire comment once on this and will link it here.  This is how I process things.  I think you have a lot of pre-existing beliefs but I suspect they are rooted in your trauma because you are afraid of it.  The trauma trust me is not that bad and you can fix it and heal it.  We all can.  It is impossible to not if you set your intention and mind to it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; The first main benefit is the price, gaming, especially for younger gamers, is a very expensive proposition. A good gaming PC costs $500 to several thousand dollars, on release, the Switch cost $300, an Xbox One cost $500, a PS4 cost $400, a 3DS $250 and a PSP Vita for $250+.

This is a rather insignificant factor here. 

People usually do not buy systems *purely* for gaming. PCs, handheld devices, media systems, etc will still be required for general purposes. At best, you may see consolidation of similar formats into one (eg. 3DS+Vita+Mobile Phone), but that's already happening without the need for games as a service.

In addition, the major costs in gaming (for most people) come from the games themselves, not the hardware. This is even reflected in the way companies function as well; Playstation models sell for an actual loss at release, because the main profit is made through game sales.

&gt; The second benefit is convenience, in theory, a streamed game system if properly optimized and run on nearly any device you may own. Play on your cell phone, your iPad, your Chromecast attached to your 70 inch flat screen, play at your friend's house with only a simple login. Someone wants to watch Game of Throne on the TV? No problem, just suspend your game and resume on a different device completely seamlessly. 

While great in theory, I don't see this actually happening in practice, any more than it happens now. You still need support across all the devices, all of which need the capability to effectively handle even the minimized requirements of the game.

&gt; The third benefit is, perhaps, a ""buy once, run anywhere"" approach that can be used. Nintendo is particularly terrible at adopting this, but, if properly implemented this would allow you to buy a single copy of a game and play it regardless of the generation. 

This isn't a feature specific to video games as a service. 

&gt; The fourth benefit is that competition increases benefits for everyone. Every time a new competitor has joined the fray, other companies have needed to adapt and get better. For example, competition by Sega forced Nintendo to relax their censorship policies, competition by Microsoft forced Sony to improve their online gaming service, etc. 

This is absolutely true.",1554077056

"Adirondacks","t5_2tj4q","You can't go wrong with any of the Fire Tower peaks.  They tend to range from easy to moderately challenging.  Also, the towers on the summits mean you've got guaranteed views (provided it's not a day with low cloud cover).  There is a [guidebook for all Fire Tower peaks in the Adirondacks and Catskills available](https://www.amazon.com/Views-High-Trails-Adirondacks-Catskills/dp/0996116842/) that can help you get started in picking ones to hike.  Some good fire tower peaks in the central Adirondacks include:  

* **Blue Mountain:**  It's a sustained climb with substantial elevation gain, but it's not a very long hike.  Probably not the best peak for your first climb, but this could be a good one once you've got a few easier summits under your belt.  4.0 miles round trip.
* **Snowy Mountain:**  This is probably one of the most challenging fire tower peaks, but it's well worth the climb once you're looking for something beyond ""easy.""  Snowy is just shy of ""High Peak status"" by only 101 feet.  7.8 miles round trip.
* **Pillsbury Mountain:**  This is a good beginner one.  Be aware that the road to the trailhead doesn't open until sometime in mid- to late May.  The last mile or so of road can be a bit sketchy in a low clearance car- some folks like to park at Sled Harbor and walk the last bit of road.  3.2 miles round trip from the trailhead, ~6 miles round trip from Sled Harbor.  
* **Goodnow Mountain:**  Another good beginner mountain.  Goodnow has one of the tallest standing fire towers.  3.8 miles round trip.  
* **Mt. Adams:**  A relatively short hike but super steep near the summit.  This is a good hike to give you a taste of what some of the High Peaks trails can be like.  The tower affords stellar views of the surrounding High Peaks area.  4.9 miles round trip.  
* **Vanderwhacker Mountain:**  Moderately difficult overall.  A bit further removed from the High Peaks but nevertheless still has solid views of NY's tallest mountains.  This is another trailhead that won't be accessible until sometime in May.  Once the road opens up the drive in is fine but be aware that the final 100 feet into the parking area is a bit rocky.  5.0 miles round trip.  
* **Gore Mountain:**  This is also a fairly challenging one so it's not recommended for your first few hikes, but again, once you're looking to up the ante, this could be a solid choice.  9.4 miles round trip.  

Again, not all of these strictly fit your criteria of ""good beginner hikes"" but I included some more challenging options for consideration once you've got an easy hike or two's worth of experience.  Good beginner peaks in the list above include Pillsbury (once the road is open) and Goodnow.  

Be aware also that there's still a lot of snow in the Adirondacks.  It won't finish melting at higher elevations until late April at the earliest.  And it's not uncommon to see patches of snow at higher elevations well into May, even.  So depending on your timeframe for hikes, you might look for non-mountain options to start out with.  There's a number of lakes and ponds in the Blue Mountain Lake area that have trails that should be mostly snow free in a few weeks- including Tirrell Pond, Stephens Pond, Cascade Pond, and Wilson Pond.  

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck!  ",1554077056

1.  Without error (from birth to death)

2.  Be fit for a purpose

3. Fully mature

4.  Fully complete

People typically assume the first is the only definition and yet it is the single definition humans cannot ever fulfill. (except Jesus) 

Sinning is not incompatible with those other definitions.  We just need to learn from our sins.  In fact making mistakes is the only way to ever become fully mature.  Because risk of making mistakes is the impetus for learning.  No risk, no growth.",1554077059

When the DB was in full effect I felt nothing most of the time.

When we started trying to fix it, the emotions for me, it was like all the years of nothing suddenly came out the bottle. I wished I had paid attention to the loneliness, anger and resentment back then.  Maybe it would have spurred me to fix everything sooner, or never let it get as bad as it did.

I think for me, what started everything was hearing ""Anything worth having is worth fighting for"" just when I had finally started write the whole relationship as a failed venture. I just never realized how hard the fight would be, and that even in victory the taste of defeat would be on my tongue at times.

This week I finally felt comfortable with everything to just let go now.  The fight part for me is over. I've made peace with myself and I feel like I am a strong and complete partner for her to lean on. I'll be here to support her as she works on fixing her end. I hope it's easier for her then it was for me.

My good friend has been going through the same thing, he's been dealing with the repairs for over a year now. His TL;DR summary was basically this;

""First I went crazy, lost my mind and then found myself. Then everything kind of hit a honeymoon phase for a bit and then she totally lost her mind and is slowly picking up the pieces.

I Just try and help her out now when she let's me and hope I'll be a part of her life when it's over. I love her either way, but this time the ball is in her court.""",1554077061

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","Here are the tenets of The Satanic Temple (which is different from the Church of Satan and has a very different focus, but isn't all that different ideologically):

- One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.

- The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.

- One‚Äôs body is inviolable, subject to one‚Äôs own will alone.

- The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.

- Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.

- People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.

- Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.",1554077062

You cannot separate evolution from philosophy because the theory itself is a postulation of the worlds origins in direct and purposeful opposition to another philosophy on the world origins...these are not simply my conclusions...but are the basis of the theories existence. 

Therefore the question remains...whether you believe in evolution or any other philosophy...why does a child have any more worth then its usefulness to those who gave it life...according to evolution animals (which in your mind include humans) are subject to survival of the fittest...and as children are physically and mentally weaker then adults, why shouldn't the adult kill the weaker if it benefits the strong...",1554077063

"theisle","t5_366so","I want to start off by saying I'm very new to this game, I've never actually played it but I've sat and watched many YouTube gameplay videos.

There's a lot you can observe just by watching.

These are some suggestions I think the isles should implement to be a more playable and fun game:

I think ""only"" laying down to regain your stamina could be aggravating. I feel as all dinosaurs across the board should be able to regain there stamina (at a slower rate than laying down) simply by walking. When a player runs completely out of stamina, they should have a brief moment of ""walking like it's tired"" animation, before they start walking again.

Laying down should go at its set rate but walking should fill it up at 25% of its normal rate.

Next:

I think each dinosaur should have specific perk advantages that would encourage players to play realistic but not hurt them if they decide to play solo.

For example:
- A [insert herbivore name] might have +5 bite and +10 health for every other one near it.

- A T-Rex might have +50 bite if not within 50 meters of another rex, to encourage them to be solo creatures.

- Migration dinos should gain +10 defence every distance milestone.

- Night time creatures might get +20 bite and health at night

These specific species changes will make some dinosaurs think about there tactics more and would make playing on the official game even more appealing. These are only a few examples, you'd have to do this for each dino, so this can encourage people to play and survive like that dino was meant to.

Achievements:

Achievements should also be catered to keeping everything engaging, fun, and push realism 

All carnos should get an achievement for killing a specific amount of everything weaker than them.

Some carnos get achievements for killing there own kind like the T-Rex.

Water creatures get an achievement for killing a certain amount of things within 20 feet of water

Herbivores get an achievement for surviving a specific amount of time as an adult.  Lets say 40 hours.


These achievements, i feel, should be shot up pretty high as far as reaching them, that way it keeps players keeping the world alive, plus unlock custom skins, color swatches, animations, etc.


I think you should have carnos and herbivores constantly wanting food. And you can do that with specific buffs. These buffs don't hurt solo players though but are just there to encourage playing like your dino should play.

For example:
- If an creature stays 75% or more food for more than 20 minutes they will not only have a slight time boost to growing to the next stage but they will hit harder and run 10% faster. (Realism - fed creatures grow healthier and have more energy)

- If a creature stays 75% or more water for 20 minutes they have 10% more run duration as long as it continues to stay above 75%

These are just a few examples, hopefully you get where I'm going and come up with even more unique ones.

The UI:

I love the clean UI you guys decided, but not liking the way its presented with the claw, water drop, ex.

I think the sprint bar should be at the bottom center of the screen, a wide rectangle, that only shows when either using it or recharging it to max, when simply walking or laying with a max sprint bar, it's hidden.

Health should be at the top left of the screen showing a red bar instead of the screen turning red with blood. Which I guess is ok, but something about it that seems like it's missing.

Food and water can be blue and green bars that sit under the health.

On the right side of the screen should show specific achievements or goals depending on that species of dino.

Blood I think should bleed you out, but there should be ways to help with that better

I think you should play on scent as far as not only marking territory but using the restroom (lol)

If a T-Rex marks it scent on a tree, if within 30 meters of that scent he gets increased stats, maybe 20 bite and 30 health, no other T-Rex can mark anything within that range, this will further create turf wars. Also if within the range of his scent he gets better smelling this should be on a semi decent cooldown. Also if within there sprayed scent its slightly harder for other dinos to track you.

Other dino species might scent multiple trees to confuse while others can only scent one at a time.

I think it'll be cool and fun if you make every dino have to poop. They push a button, an animation occurs and then you see a poop mesh, depending on the dino species, that'll stay for a specific time frame.

If a dino player has to poop they get -25% run speed, lose a certain portion of health if they try to eat.

Pooping hurts and helps everyone, it makes your footprints better read by predators but lowers there smell recharge rate. Stops them resmelling for, lets say 5 min

I feel as with scent you guys should develop that better.

Only water creatures should be able to go underwater.

.....

I think you should give buffs for sound used.

Example:

- If I friendly call, for 45 seconds, it'll lower my defense by 15% it will give 5% more food to the closest dead body around me. (My goal is to show you I'm not threatening right? I'll lower my defense and share my food with you)

If I make a threatening call, for 25 seconds, it'll increase my attack by 5%, with a 45 second cooldown.

If I make a danger call (to alert my kind danger is here), it'll make me harder to be tracked for 15 sec, with a 5 min cooldown.

These are just a few examples. 

A dino should have to hold there eat and drink button down, when holding it down they have 25% less vision

I'm finding this post too long lol but in short I think The Isles is a great game, I just think its lacking a lot and needs a system that'll keep, not only action going on throughout the map, but fun for the individual.

Steps should be taken to somewhat give the player a way of knowing what its like to be that dino, but also try to survive, right now there seems to be you just log on and get to it, there needs to be a sense of direction.

Developing a better scent and call system, buffing creatures based on things they decide to do, making achievements to keep the world growing are just a few ways I think this would be even more of a badass dino game.


Note - didnt really proof read, so sorry about any mistakes ;)

"survivor","t5_2qhu3","I dont dislike Australia, its in my top 10 but Marquesas is better in my opinion. Ive got Marquesas ranked at number 6 because it is truly a phenomenal season.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think I can do the season justice any better than u/CSteino did in the WSSYW thread for Marqeusas

&amp;#x200B;

 

This is my pick for the best season ever. No I'm not joking. This season has literally everything you would want in a Survivor season. However, this 10/10 season somehow becomes *even better* if you watch chronologically. It is such great payoff for the way the first 3 seasons played out and will leave you mesmerized. Let's go over the great things that Marquesas does with a checklist.

* **Great Story**. 3 Checks if not 5 if not 10 if not 100. This seasons has, in my honest opinion, the best storytelling and narrative-building of any season ever. Every episode piles on the tension and reasons as to exactly why everything that happened did happen, and it does it phenomenally. Episodes 1-8 are the best storytelling in any multi-episodic stretch of Survivor ever, and other episodes like the F5 and Finale are also great for conclusive narratives to end the season on a super high note.
* **Great Characters**. Absolutely check. Looking at Marquesas from a perspective of rankings, in my opinion, this season features the Best: First Boot, Merge Boot, Growth Arc, Tribe, and OVERALL CHARACTER, ever. In my mind all of these points are undebatable. These characters are all there and actually relevant to the plot, which makes you invested in the season, in stark contrast to the more recent seasons where only the big dogs get a lot of screentime. Everyone on this cast is characterized and characterized effectively.
* **New and Unique Strategy**. Yep. Marquesas is the first delve into modern strategy aspects ever and it does it phenomenally. While we see many seasons today give us blindsides and BIG MOVEZ with no buildup, or voteoffs that don't make sense, Marquesas does not have that problem. *Literally every single boot* is explained thoroughly as to why the boot would go home. They foreshadow these huge strategical shifts extremely well and Modern Survivor could take a hint from this season on how to sell a blindside.
* **Drama**. Absolutely. If you like your Survivor to come with tension and stakes and social politicking, guess what? The best season has you covered. Episodes like the Merge episode, the Third episode, and the Final 5 episode are all EXTREMELY high stakes episodes that have drama, tension, and real meaning behind that you just don't really get anymore. The editing sells it, the narrative sells it, the characters sell it. Everything works so perfectly throughout the season that you can't help but be enthralled. We have a season that divided the tribes by race, and the Final 5 episode of Marquesas **does a better commentary about social issues, racial issues, and Survivor as a microcosm of society than ALL OF THE EPISODES OF THE RACE TWIST SEASON COMBINED** and that's a *great*thing.

So would I recommend this season? The short answer is Yes. The long answer is Yesssssssssssssssss. There is no reason for you not to watch this season. If you are a hardcore strategy fan, this season has you covered. If you are a hardcore story/characters fan, this season has you covered. It's unfortunate that both this season and Africa are so great yet so underrated since a lot of the fanbase have either not watched them in an extended period of time or they have not seen them period. Absolutely give this season a watch if you have not. I promise you will not regret it.",1554077065

Rabbits are one of the species that are scent-sensitive, and since they're prey animals, they can be very wary, so you need to implement some mechanism to determine whether or not mum has returned by tomorrow morning. Two techniques I know of are 1) place two strings of yarn in an ""X"" shape across the opening to the nest (not floss or string, bunnies can get tangled in it) and, if the ""X"" shape is disturbed by tomorrow morning, you'll know mum came back! Or 2) if you don't have yarn, sprinkle flour around the opening to the nest. The smell doesn't bother them, and that way you can see mum's footprints :) Continue to monitor for \~24 hours to make sure she's coming and going.

- reducing the use of natural gas for heating during winter months is almost impossible for the majority of Canadians that live in areas of Canada that expertise winter for 6 months out of the year, unless they switch to wood stoves. 

- electric cars are still quite expensive and poor and working class Canadian won‚Äôt be able to afford new electric cars without things like rebates or advancements in tech. 

Some people are going to be negatively impacted by this and other who have money to pay the extra tax won‚Äôt even care about changing daily life. 

I think we should be going at this in a different way, maybe by giving tax breaks to people who change and draw on company‚Äôs to invest into the environment and new tech to make a greater impact.

"ShitAmericansSay","t5_2w57u","None of those are the countries I'm referring to. I'm talking about the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and probably a few that I'm missing.

Let me first say that nation, state, and country are not interchange. In most places, they all refer to the same thing, but there are exceptions. 

The name for most countries follow a certain formula: The name of the people (henceforth ""Nation"") + The name or type of government (henceforth ""State"").

Examples:
The United Mexican States (Commonly referred to as ""Mexico""). Their state is a Union (hence ""United""), while their nation is ""Mexico.""

The Russian Federation (Commonly referred to as ""Russia"") their state is a Federation, their nation Russia.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Their state is a Union of Kingdoms, their nations are England, Scotland, and Wales (collectively: Great Britain) and Northern Ireland.

Lastly, The United States of America (Commonly referred to as America). The state is a union (hence ""United"") and the nation is ""America"" 

The history behind the nation known as ""America"" is quite interesting in my opinion. You see, many New World colonies retained their names after gaining independence from their colonizers (Mexico, Peru, Brazil, etc.). They developed national identities around these names, hence why they were retained these names. But America (the nation) was somewhat different. Those 13 colonies that later became the US had developed a collective Identity, united by the desire to rebel from Britain. This collective Identity did not have its own unique name, so they just used what they already had, America.

The Americans, being the only independent nation in the New World at the time, saw little reason to create a new name for their identity. They were the only true ""Americans"" at the time (I use the word true loosely).

Side Note: I'd consider the opinions of the people of the countries you listed on this matter mostly irrelevant because they A. Don't speak English (mostly) and B. Don't live here. I don't really care what they call us in Spanish, Portuguese, or whatever language they may speak, but in English, someone from the United States of America is called American.

Edit: Sorry for the long comment, this is not a simple subject which I have talked about with many people in the past (I went to an international school with man Central and South Americans). I appreciate your willingness to discuss this ",1554077068

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Would she be open to seeing a counsellor with you? Sometimes people find it easier to engage with neutral outsiders, and they in turn can be helpful in keeping conversations on track and moving forward. Especially if she is withdrawing from you.

I was more getting at the idea that if she has one result and you another that merely gives you an idea that you are *different* (as though you hadn't already worked that out for yourself). 

It doesn't mean she can change (and you said she wasn't trying to change, so you clearly think she can and should). By looking at your own test result and asking what you could do to change, it may help you get some clarity whether change is at all possible. Because if you cannot change your blue, how can you expect her to change her yellow?

The same is true for extrovert/introvert: you can modify it a little but you can't really change whether you feel being with people drains you of energy that you need to recharge by withdrawing, or whether you feel energised by being with people and need to see them to feel happy.",1554077070

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt; But the real reason I think I can no longer date white women isn‚Äôt any of that. It‚Äôs because in today‚Äôs hashtag-woke society, there is mad pressure to be hashtag-woke. To be aware of the implications of whom you‚Äôre attracted to and why. Which means that in the eyes of others, the color of the women I date is a big deal. Like I‚Äôm the problem. Like I‚Äôm betraying my people if I date white women.

&gt; But I was taught that we were all one people!

&gt; I see people watching me with a stink eye, noses turned up, as if they think black and brown people would somehow be better off if I dumped my white girlfriend. It‚Äôs a lot of pressure. Along with each watchful eye, the whispers of, ‚ÄúPick a side, Chris, pick a side,‚Äù fill my already noisy mind.

So the author realizes how stupid and toxic the hashtag-woke society is, but he decides to capitulate rather than stick to his own ethos.  

It almost sounds to me like he is trying to justify his subtle racism by blaming the culture around him.  

How about instead of promoting that toxic culture with an opinion piece like this, you actually stand strong to your beliefs and push back on such toxic ideals.  ",1554077071

&gt; If you want to use React to write to the DOM use D3 to calculate the layout of the SVGs

The idea itself makes total sense, but then the question becomes, where can I find simple examples that make use of this proper interaction between React and D3? The speaker you mentioned, Shirley Wu, has a repo [here](https://github.com/sxywu/react-d3-example/tree/master/src/visualizations) that explains *how* to combine D3 and React, but even she prefaces it by saying that these are not good visualizations, and simply are meant to showcase the fact that it *can* be done, which leaves me hesitant in using this repo as a springboard for myself.

That said, I also find myself struggling with mapping raw D3 code to this splitting. Along with that, I'm still unsure what the proper practices are (e.g. whether or not we can use `WillComponentReceiveProps()`, per the first article I linked), or if those are even necessary if I can get by with the method from Elijah Meeks' article, if that makes sense.

What's more (and I don't mean to complain), how do you implement things like axes and transitions when you have this split? The only way I know how to add such are with D3 and its selection methods. Since those are not used, I'm confused on how one would do this with this React-D3 split.

&gt; That's what the link you posted is doing, what is wrong with this method?

Which link are you referring to, as I posted multiple? Just to pick one, if it's the Elijah Meeks article, do you mean to say that the Elijah Meeks article's method of using D3 is *incorrect*, or that it is *correct*?

&gt; D3 is an extremely large library that has many APIs you don't need. You don't need to use their selections or dispatches APIs, you also don't need to use their data transformations APIs either as it's likely you'll be underscore/lodash/ramda already for array functions.

But yes, I too have experienced a negative body self imaging. As I've moved into late adulthood, I've gained some disproportional aspects around the mid body areas.  Battle of the bulge. I'm not comfortable with it but I realize that some of my discomfort flows from masculine stereotypes-men are pressured into have believing that ideal body proportions are part of being 'truly' masculine. Further, we're castigated if we don't with phrases like ""Do you lift?"" As though the human form is completely amenable to exercise and diet.

1. Work reasonably and consistently at leading a healthy life with good diet and exercise. Rule here is: Do. Not. Overdo. Anything. Moderation in all things. Do not over-diet and don't over-exercise. Get professional advice on both if you are able to. Avoid sugar as much as possible- good to hold to no more than 60 grams/day. Keep track of grams of protein and carbs and find out what and how many of each basic nutrient that  you need. Try to get as many of these from fresh foods, fruits and vegetables. 
2. Make a hobby of finding out as much as you can about human biology and nutrition. This will let you focus on goals and help put your situation in a dispassionate perspective. The human body and the biological processes needed to keep us up and running are really a wondrous tale to behold.
3. You've talked with a therapist so that's good. Would more discussion help? I found myself in therapy for first 20 months, then a second time for 15 months and a third time for 11 monthsl all that really helped. I discovered it was taking me a while to get comfortable revealing inner feelings, but once I got to that point, my world view began to change. There's no set time frame; I believe most people underestimate how long meaningful therapy can ensue. Don't give up too soon.
4. You mentioned depression; I know something of that. Learn to live with it and don't wish it away. Diabetics for example know what positive techniques to pursue and what foods to avoid. So with depression. Loneliness is the bane of existence for us depressants; move in social circles (like church groups or discussion groups) to the extent that you can. Don't be afraid of dropping in and out of these circles when you find yourself uncomfortable with the group. Most people who attend the church I go to are very accepting and even joke around with me about my leaving and arriving back after several months of absence.  If religious organizations don't work for you make it a pursuit to find support groups; unless you live in a rural area there are a plenitude.  However, having said all that,  make it a point to stay with some group far past your comfort level. Giving up too soon on a group and you'll find yourself group hopping. Not really useful. Again, know that those tough times where life seems darkest and the most useless are invariably several moments away from the dawning of an uplifting experience. Also, we can learn from those down times. Don't castigate them into the netherlands of doom. It's important to realize that we need to achieve a balance between pleasure and discomfort. Pain,  both physical and psychological, can inform us as to what's going on with our bodies and our inner selves. Avoidance of impending conflict because of the preconceived notion of how much it will 'cost' is not a good path either. Again, moderation will bring rewards. Try to have calm moments (no screens, no phone, no books, no music, as much silence as you can bring) where you do nothing but sit comfortably at least twice a day for 6-10 minutes. This can be very beneficial

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","I never said it was a done deal. You are putting words in my mouth to try and strengthen your argument, which is a fucking strawman. I'm saying that it is wrong to kill gays and that is objective reality. It's universally understood, codified, as well understood through utility that it is wrong to kill people without sound, justifiable reasons. There is no logical argument that can be made that puts gayness within those reasons. ergo: It's wrong to kill gay people. The objective reality has nothing to do with the law, the law is an immaterial construct we put into place as a society. It is certainly a reality that Russia kills and oppresses gay people, it's also a reality that it is wrong.

Whether the law established abortion as legal or not is irrelevant, what matters is if it's wrong or permissible. Due to my understanding of the current debate on abortion--as well as the understandings of most legitimate scholars on the subject--the fetal rights argument has been almost universally dismissed as being logically inconsistent, and therefore wrong. Most actual philosophers on the anti-abortion side now use other arguments to justify their theories on the wrongness of abortion.

Gotta say, that would be a pretty major dealbreaker for me, because there's a very low chance he'll ever break out of this. 

This is *willful* stupidity. 

I don't think *respecting his stance* will get you anywhere, because you can pick up on everything wrong with most of that stance just by what you'll naturally end up hearing or reading in the world... you can't get to that point while still being at all open to what other people have to say. He'll have had a lifetime's worth of jamming his fingers in his ears and screaming ""*I CAN'T HEAR YOU LALALALA"",* because it's the only way to *keep* such a mentality.

You need to tell him, flat out, ""I'm *not* going to have an antivaxxer's kids, dude.""

I suspect the large amount of wind blowing on the mic when riding must send an unexpectedly high current (for an electret mic) to the phone, which it could be interpreting as a different impedance or something? It seems to be adjusting which makes the sound REALLY loud for a few seconds before sensing the correct impedance again and making the corresponding adjustment back. 

Just a guess on my part based on my rudimentary understanding of electronics and personal experience, but wow is it annoying and distracting - And avoidable by eliminating the mic.

The vast majority of kratom comes from Borneo, which is also called Kalimantan and is part of Indonesia. Those names could literally apply to over 90% of the kratom we get. They are totally generic. The rest of the kratom we get comes from Sumatra, which is also part of Indonesia. 

Bali, Malay, Thai, Vietnam, Cambodia, Asia, Super, Elephant, Wild, Plantation, and Maeng Da are harvested in Borneo or Sumatra and have no geographic region that defines them. 

The Indonesian suppliers that I have spoken with have been pretty open about these things. Vendors that have seen production in Borneo first hand have concurred.

Names like Ketapang, Hulu Kapuas, Jongkong and Sumatra are actual regions that kratom is harvested in. However, when a vendor gets a batch of kratom, there is no way to know if it really originated in those regions. While it's entirely possible that there are variations between kratom from these regions, it's equally possible that there is variation within these regions.",1554077081

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","I'm quite happy with my journey: bought a cheap ($600) bike new when I first started out, because I wanted something reliable and not needing work.  Because it was a lower end workhorse, it gave me the ability to do my own maintenance without being afraid of breaking anything. Put a few 1000 miles on it, then upgraded to a much nicer setup (e.g. shimano claris to 105, steel to Alu/Carbon) by finding a great deal on craigslist.  The bike was mint but I got it over half off MSRP and felt confident in my ability to tweak the breaking, shifting, setting up tubeless tires, etc.  

Edit, to elaborate: commuting on the cheap bike for a year also let me figure out which aspects I wanted to put my money towards when I upgraded, as I gained a lot of knowledge by doing my own maintenance and spending so many hours in the saddle.  :)",1554077081

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Just my opinion but I believe Apple and Google have different strategies to your private data.  Google wants all of it - They create features and services as a means to entice user's to provide them with their personal data and in turn it it also allows them to create better services and target you better in selling advertisements.  I believe that a lot of what Google creates also has an underlying agenda to gain or retain access to user data but again, that of course is just my opinion.   I don't believe they sell your individual data so I guess it's still private between you and google.

I think Apple on the other hand wants as little of it as possible.  If they can just collect data on the device to offer a feature, they will do just that.  If there is no reason to collect it they won't.  You can read about apple's privacy here:  [https://www.apple.com/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/privacy/)  and here [https://searchads.apple.com/privacy/](https://searchads.apple.com/privacy/)  .  The downside to their strategy is that many of their services just aren't as good as Google's.

Beyond Android and iOS, Google also has a super popular email service which they collect and mine data from.  They have a super popular web browser and web analytic platform that they collect from.  Apple as far as I'm aware is not collecting a list of all your purchases based on email order confirmations nor are they collecting your web search or browsing history.

When it comes to third party apps, I don't really know.  I think iOS may have a slight edge over Android through Android P at least but I think you gotta be wary of both.

edit:  One question I have in terms of iOS:  My understanding is that Apple maps uses a bunch of third party platforms such as yelp and foursquare.  I'd like a to know what kind of data, if any, that those platforms are getting from Apple on it's users.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","A book you'd certainly want to look at would be *Travel and Geography in the Roman Empire*. Now, I'm only too aware that the book isn't necessarily the most accessible to everybody (*stares in $100+ price tag*), so I'll try to give you a quick summary of the relevant chapter below.

So what you're looking for here is information on the *cursus publicus*, a system set up by Augustus and described here by Suetonius: 

&gt; So that he [Augustus] quickly and easily could receive reports of events
in every province, he stationed first young men, and later carriages, at
points along the military roads. The latter system proved itself more
advantageous, because then the same courier could deliver the message
to its destination and, if necessary, also personally be questioned.

This is helpfully expanded upon by this inscription:

&gt; Not all are entitled to use this service, but the imperial Procurator and
his son. They may use up to ten wagons or three mules in place of a
single wagon . . . ; further, persons travelling on military service may
use public transport, both those who have a diploma as well as soldiers
stationed in other provinces who are passing through. A Roman senator
may use up to ten wagons or, in place of wagons . . . A Roman knight
on imperial service shall have three wagons . . . A Centurion may use
one.

This one wasn't so much a post system as we know it today; this was the official Imperial Post, which operated by the Emperor and for the Emperor. It accomplished that goal spectacularly, however, being able to cut the journey between Hadrian's Wall and Rome down to 5 days - which honestly isn't bad time for a trip in the modern day. However, this was an emergency, priority system - if it wasn't either an emergency or a priority, you weren't using it. So the *vast* majority of communications - including Imperial communications - just took place via courier. For Imperial administration, they would tap individuals within their vast army of record keepers and scribes (I'm not exaggerating, the organization was large enough to be classified in military terms by the 2nd century), for military communications, individual soldiers would be tapped (and there were always men out on courier duty, delivering reports to the provincial governor et al), and for civilians, couriers and merchants were always available (or going to wherever they were needed) for hire. 

EDIT: tagging /u/Khatib because similar question. About addresses, I can actually give you a straight answer on that one, too - the Vindolanda tablets (lordy they're easy to fall back on) being a perfect example. The tablets had the letter on one side, while the addressee was written the other. Here are a couple of examples of those addresses:

&gt; Sulpiciae Lepidinae (to Sulpicia Lepidina)  
&gt; Cerialis  (wife of Cerialis)  
&gt; a S[e]uera (From Severa)  

(clearly sent with a courier who knew to whom he was going and where). Next one gives a bit more, but follows the same format (to give an idea):

&gt; Londini (deliver to Londinium/London)  
&gt; Veldedeio (to Veldedeius)  
&gt; equisioni co(n)s(ularis) (groom of the governor)  
&gt; a Chrauttio (from Chrauttius)  
&gt; fratre (his/your brother)  

One more for funsies:

&gt; Coris t..st (Pretty fragmented, same format - ""deliver to the Corea &lt;x&gt;"")  
&gt; Cessaucio Ni.rin (to Cessaucius Nigrinus)  
&gt; dup(licario) (*duplicarius*, or ""soldier with double pay as a result of valour"")

"interactivefiction","t5_2qyx9","[Mission On Thunderhead](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/85337) was released by Avalon Hill in 1986 and it focuses in part on an *Operation Tempest,* but the game is described as *an action game with a science-fiction theme* vs a text adventure, so likely not relevant. Just in case, here is a bit about it as noticed in a photo of the game's packaging on the site linked above:

&gt;*Thunderhead...is waiting for you, daring you by its very presence.  Built by an alien race that rules the galaxy, its tunnels and complexes plunge deep into the radioactive rock and extend all the way to the complex hovering hundreds of miles above the surface of the planet...You are a member of a secret human organization dedicated to overthrowing the Eternals...*

"Schizoid","t5_2qxro","You kept insisting there's no special sense of emotions, after I said I don't feel anything inside my body. Then you refer to interoception and say you're an emotion researcher (?!) I mean I feel nothing inside my torso, neck or limbs or head, except the sense of muscle strain that's as indistinct as just knowing that an entire group of voluntary muscles is strained, or that I have a serious intestinal cramp, if I focus on it. I thought it was impossible, physically and psychologically impossible, to feel anything inside the torso deeper than the voluntary muscles and ribs, except in cases of extreme pain such as a heart attack that even then would be referred pain to some place where it is possible to feel. I thought it was as impossible as feeling inside the head where the brain is, or feeling inside the bones, or inside the leg other than muscle strain.

If you want to know something about emotion regulation, why don't you try asking some people what they literally feel, as in sense, inside their bodies? Then try to correlate that with what you measure about whether they can change their emotional state on instructions, and how fast they can do that and undo it, measuring what they say about what their emotional state is, along with physiological measures that are correlated. I think you would find that people who don't know about sensing things inside their body, who don't claim any visceral senses, or who say they usually don't feel anything there for most emotions, would  score worse or not be able to do the task at all, not understanding what in the nihil you're talking about, while people who claim inner feelings and especially people who describe in more detail what they can feel viscerally would be able to self regulate the fastest and most accurately.

The problem I've seen in some emotion research papers that were close to getting around to this vital research is that they seem to assume everyone already knows all this about emotions, even to the point of assuming they can give an alexithymia questionnaire asking whether people feel emotions, and somehow the people with alexithymia or low interoception or lack of interoception will score themselves out on the questionnaire from being studied further, even if they've never heard of interoception and if they believe all emotional expressions about the heart are just metaphors. I would have answered, yes, I can feel everything just like a normal person, because I know what my emotions are, in my mind. I believed all emotional expressions about the heart, and anything else sensed inside the torso, and about feeling good and bad, were just metaphors, just old fashioned poetic language, conventional words, and imagination. Then those other studies almost all just focus on whether people can detect the timing of their heartbeat, not the rate or strength, but the sub-second timing of perception of heartbeats, which I guess would be the sense that would have the least amount to do with which emotion a person is feeling.",1554077086

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

We might look back at this moment in history and go ""we had it semi wrong and semi right"" just like the other inventions of the past and how our world has progressed in engineering.  It's what humans do.  we think up new ways of doing things.  the laws are the laws because it's HOW we know them as that.  as we discovered them and made those laws (humans overall) we may find out new things that pertain to NEW laws of science in the future, therefore those can and may be applied to future developments for our energy usage.

we are still a civilization number 0, if even a 0.  we havent yet figured out the most efficient way of harnessing energy.  but we are SLOWLY getting there. the ""electric cars"" you see are going to be a few, but technology will advance. i guess you can view the ones now as beta testing.  the fields and laws can be further tried and further pushed.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

We should get some of these to plant out front around our porch in the spring! What do you think?""

Once we had an occasion coming up and I mentioned, honey you dont have to buy me any flowers. It's so sweet of you but we need the money for other essentials right now.

 I'm not studying in a formal sense. Just in my free time. I say study because ive been reading various things on stoicism since August. Pretty constant. I've read a little about other philosophies, I'm actually about to start reading about epicureanism, the rivaling philosophy to stoicism.

I like to find excitement in the simple pleasures of life. Reading, learning, good conversation. Besides my reading I haven't had much excitement as of lately. How about you?",1554077089

I dont love Yachty either tbh, most people just listen to his songs cause they are catchy &amp; fun

not a fan of that song, Percocet &amp; Stripper Joint is an excellent future cut if you're willing to give another listen (understandable if not)

&gt; it seems he's throwing in random words for nothing, isn't mumble rapping in his top song, ""XO TOUR LIF3"".

nah idk Uzi is pretty 50/50 to me, I either dont care for it or its fucking amazing, he has a great voice and incredible ear for melodies. &amp; xo tour life was an incredible expression of his struggles with drug abuse imo, 9.9/10 song. ""im committed not addicted but it keep controlling me""

&gt; Did someone tell you your favourite rapper was a shitty mumble rapper? Is that what has your panties all twisted?

no, my favourite rapper is Earl Sweatshirt who is the farthest thing from a ""mumble rapper"" &amp; is critically acclaimed &amp; respected for his incredible lyricism, I feel like theres a disconnect here, I'm not that angry I just dislike seeing that term because it is largely baseless &amp; generalizes a lot of very enjoyable music",1554077090

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Depends on what you mean.

If you had all the female characters grab their weapons and gear and fight to the death, it could be kinda bloody. It depends on how long you keep Peri alive and whether Corrin will have her chainsaw sword (because let‚Äôs be honest, Corrin is going to be doing most of the killing while telling people to stop fighting and to walk the path of peace).

If you just got the fans to argue over who is best girl, they would probably be able to eliminate a few characters that nearly nobody cares about, but afterward, I can‚Äôt imagine it being very bloody but rather very fiery. Mmm, flamewars! Well done and burnt to a crisp. Ashes all around. Have you ever tried snorting ashes? Don‚Äôt try it. Just sprinkle them in a dish and eat it.

Sancho on the left, Bailey on the right, both inside forwards. The reasoning behind keeping Chiesa after Sancho's arrival is that he can play on both the left and right hand side with parity, albeit in different roles.

Just remember to keep a spider or 2 at a health lower than the boss so that they'll heal each other instead of the boss. And always leave at least 1 or 2 spiders alive for a while when the boss ulti is ready again so that you can buff up and heal up first if necessary.

Before running static stretching is definitely a no go.  Lots of people grew up doing stretches before working out so that‚Äôs why people still do it...  But over the last couple decades there‚Äôs been a lot of pretty conclusive research demonstrating that it‚Äôs harmful.  As you said, the evidence of post-run stretching is mixed.  At the very least, we can say that it‚Äôs not obviously necessary to stretch.  

Caffeine is extremely well documented to increase performance by lowering the perceived effort.  But it‚Äôs not providing you with energy per se.  having said that, you don‚Äôt need to do anything different at this point if it‚Äôs working for you.

Before you do this the infrastructure will *need* a massive overhaul.

The reason why other sovereign states can have electric cars is because they have a more reliable / lower cost / larger supply of electricity (i.e. nuclear). But if you think the Australian people are going to let morons in government implement a nuclear scheme after :

- NBN
- QLD Health
- Census
- F35 fighter jet
- Zero architectural standards (e.g. highrise buildings)

... You'd be absolutely right. The mere fact the above 5 things are an issue at all demonstrates the fact that Australians are either too apathetic or too stupid to give a toss about long term effects of shortcomings in such problems.

"dragonballfighterz","t5_3ltwg","For all those people struggling with base goku changes or just new to him, heres a guide on some of his practical combos.

Some notes: So for some of these, there are more ""optimal"" routes in the corner, BUT they are very hard to execute and would probably drop online almost 100% of the time. The reward does not justify the risk of dropping a combo. All combos in this video can all be done consistently even in 4 frames of lag.

Base Gokus main game plan now is to try to end with 2SSS when he can and cancel into genki charge. His genki charge is much more central to his kit now, and you can easily get a lvl 1 charge and then meaty jab your opponent in the corner after a 2SSS. Ideally you should try to have a genki charge at all times.

Also major shoutout to all the people down at his discord for coming up with some of these routes and ideas! If you guys got any questions, or even tips for stuff I didnt include, feel free to lemme know :)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One last thing, if you land his heavy command grab, you can super dash without touching the floor and you will get a SKD. If you touch the floor though, you lose the SKD from it and will have to do 2SSS. Also he can solo snap midscreen from heavy command grab.",1554077094

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.

Remember the oldschool T4D endurance meta (disclaimer: I was new at the time so my knowledge comes from forum posts)? It was a Vauban because the only way anything was dying was if they were in a ball and everyone was sniping them, a Trin to give everyone 99% DR and infinite energy, a Frost as a safety net and a minimum-duration Nyx (back when Chaos wasn't recastable) to lock enemies in the initial stagger animation forever.

People like to complain about Nullifiers and their 'anti-fun bubbles', but against Grineer I can walk through a mission as Nyx, spamming 3 every couple of seconds and pressing V (my energy pad hotkey) for an entire mission and have literally 0 chance of taking any damage from enemies or encountering any sort of threat.

My big unpopular opinion about Warframe is that it would really benefit from cooldowns. I'm not sure how you'd implement them on some abilities (anything non-channelled with a variable duration, such as Spores, being the main offenders), but I almost think that DE has the same idea considering that abilities on more recent frames tend to use animation locks as a balancing factor.",1554077095

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","I think most posters here are fairly young. And I'm not, I'm older. I'm fortunate to be very happily married to a healthy guy now, but I've had relationships with a couple of people in my life who are likely BPD, NPD. 

I totally know the attraction. There's nothing like it at the start. Above all else they know how to give us what we want. But when they have us, it seems there's no limit to what they will do to use us.

Getting older ...you start to see that you just can't get old with such a person. Getting old means you need a companion. It really becomes about absolute trust. This person is going to be with you when you get sick, maybe when you die, and vice versa. A person with BPD doesn't have the ability to play that role. 

Oh, I know, you think it doesn't matter because you're young, but you'd be surprised how fast life goes. Decades can go by with you waiting for your partner to be the person you need them to be. Years you could have been with a stable partner. Years you could have built relationships that will sustain you. 

It's hard, but you have to think of these things. No matter how much you think you love someone, in the end, you're left really wanting someone you can trust.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","I think people really don't like to admit it, but Baron Corbin is actually over. I went to a Raw house show a few weeks ago and he was by far the most over heel on the entire card. The crowd really enjoyed booing that guy, especially the kids. I personally find his matches to be a little boring, but it's obvious watching him live that he is very good at playing the heel. 

He is arrogant, smug, and let the little bit of power he had go to his head. He's like the middle manager at your job who somehow got a promotion, even though he didn't deserve it, who always asks you to work on the weekend while he is out drinking with his buddies. He doesn't have any redeeming characteristics as a character. 

There are way too many heels trying to be cool or funny these days anyway. Corbin is a true old school heel. Back in the day, you would never see a heel doing exciting high flying moves or suicide dives. They would be punching and kicking, fighting dirty, and doing anything it takes to win. 

Corbin's entire presence, moveset, and appearance are designed to make sure people don't cheer for him. He gives the audience nothing to enjoy about his performance. He frequently gets his comeuppance without ever losing his shine too. He could lose a 2-minute match to Curt Hawkins and show up the next night like it never happened, and he would probably be more over. That's a rare quality and for all of the things that WWE messes up, I do think they are making the right decision in pushing him. Really, he's quite good at what he does. ",1554077097

Like you I have been part of Alberta elections. I was previously a scrutineer for the PC party 15 years ago. 

How rejected and decline ballots are to be handled is clearly laid out in the Alberta Election Act:

107.1(1) If a person returns the person‚Äôs ballot indicating that the
person does not wish to mark the ballot, the deputy **returning
officer** shall immediately **write the word ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù on the ballot**
and **place it in the required envelope** to be sent to the returning
officer.

(2) A person who returns a ballot under subsection (1)
 (a) forfeits the right to vote in the election, and
 (b) shall forthwith leave the polling place.

(3) **If a person declines to vote, the poll clerk shall annotate the
poll book accordingly.**

---

The government of Alberta publishes the stats every election. Not only that if you go and decline your ballot you are counted as part of voter turnout.

I had to search for it but the stats are still available on Elections Alberta website. You will see that Rejected (spoiled), valid, and declined ballots are listed separately for elections since 1993. Prior to that we didn't have declined ballots:

The stereotype in Argentina is that Santiague√±os (people from the Santiago del Estero province, where Termas de Rio Hondo is in) are fucking slow and lazy. 

It's a damn hot place, ridiculously hot, and rural, so many years ago they institutionalized siesta. At noon, EVERYTHING closes, all businesses, absolutely everything, and everybody goes home and stays indoors during the earth-cracking sun hours that often reach feels-like temperatures of 60 Celsius. 

So they get crap for that, but also for being generally slow. And damn it, they are. You enter a grocery store, and the cashier is slowly packing up the previous customer's stuff, then he talks with him for a bit (in a slow pace), then takes 5 minutes to go get change, and when he's done, he looks around, pauses for a bit, says hello to you, and stalls some more. Buying a pack of cigarettes? 15 minutes, easily, I kid you not. 

They have no notion of being in a hurry, they take their sweet time with everything. They are like sloths, that have evolved to lower their metabolism to preserve energy. 

On top of that, this state never really developed, they are one of the poorest places in Argentina, and pretty much live off the rest of us (60% of the people in the state work for the government, plus another 30% is on welfare). And the general culture of public employment hasn't really made wonders to change that culture. 

And while in other tracks indeed they do a fantastic and selfless job, it's not selfless here, as they are actually paid by the state. You know, because fucking borderline communism. And how are the marshals chosen in here? Simple, political clientelism. ",1554077098

For any given class,

    (Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespace -Class $className -List).Properties
    (Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespace -Class $className -List).Methods

Will give you all Properties and Methods, respectively, for that class.

Once you have the name of a method, you can get derive definition(s) to assist with use from the WMI Class or Instance object, just as you can with any object method.

For ""static"" methods...

    (Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespace -Class $className -List).MethodName

For per-instance methods...

Now he is three and is fear aggressive. He was bred by people who had no clue what they were doing and his nerves are awful. However, he happily goes on walks each day and goes on car rides where he can sit in the car while I run errands with no issues. I just limit his access to people. When we are walking I do not let people pet him, it makes the whole situation less stressful for both him and myself. If there is a new person over at our home, we introduce them slowly and do not let him loose. He reacts when people move quickly and will lunge at their ankles (he‚Äôs a herding breed mix).

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","So just to cross my Ts and dot my Is, you were not in any on-call capacities or any other functions where being alert is mandatory (driver, air traffic controller, nurse, etc), right? Being sleepy as a salesman at your desk would absolutely not rise to the level required for ""for cause"" dismissal.

So you can file for unemployment and if rejected, appeal as your case seems clear cut (from what I hear from you).

One thing I haven't seen in this post is the bonus part. Are you losing on any bonuses because of this? Is it significant? It gets a bit murky and an employment lawyer can help you but don't assume that since it might be policy to only pay bonuses if you're employed, that it's legal. Here are a few pointers to help you decide:

\- Commissions (something miscalled bonuses). You're owed 100% of them

\- Target/Performance bonus. It's complicated but you can sue your former employer if you met the guidelines and they are refusing to pay because you're no longer employed. This usually result in a settlement when they can't fire you ""for cause"".

Lastly, I doubt an employer would terminate a salesperson for dozing off at their desk if they are very good at their job (and bring in the money). The drug excuse seems to be their pathetic attempt to try and justify a ""for cause"" termination. Not sure what industry you're in but salesperson are probably the people who can get away with most things as long as they bring in revenue.

Dad used the exact same spanking ‚Äúmethod‚Äù on both of us.  After a spanking session, my brother would apologize and hug it out with my dad.  Whereas I would stand there stone-faced with hot tears running down my face, but I refused to break, hug, or apologize.  It fucked me up and felt like an enormous betrayal and violation to me.  My brother however, spanks his own kids now- so clearly it had a different result on him.  YOU may think you‚Äôre spanking ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù (I know my old-school dad thought so) but you run the risk of alienating and traumatizing your child.  
I‚Äôm a parent now and can‚Äôt even imagine what my kids could do that I would hit them over it.  They‚Äôre 8 and almost 5, and are really great kids, respectful and well behaved because I model respectful behavior in the way I treat them and others.

The f's all look like figure 8s.

The p's all have a doubled thick down stem and a smaller look done in a single stroke. 

The r's are all flat topped, with the bend on the right down stem go in in a similar fashion.

Clean air was so much more important, and if a driver had to crack the throttle, all momentum was lost for a lap and a half.  It seemed like most passing that did occur was taking advantage of a driver's mistake or issue instead of making the move on your own.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)
   
   In the meantime, make sure to familiarize yourself with our rules.

I specifically addressed this already when I said...

""human organization changes over time.""

That's it.  No reason to read further into it.

&gt; All these man-made constructs are perhaps natural

They are not and that is not what ""natural"" means.  All man made things are artificial.  All things made by nature are natural.

&gt; This is all natural, because it is in our natural urge.

You might mean to say that x y or z is ""in our nature"" or it is ""human nature""?  That would be fine.  However, to say that ""government is natural"" is completely untrue.

She moved stuff around to ""clean"" (I'm not talking about little things, I'm talking about rearranging half the room). She ran up our utility bills like crazy and didn't offer to help pay because she was unemployred and broke. She copied our dvds and lied about it when confronted. She left cabinet doors open (just a pet peeve).

Zorua in ""The Legend of the Pok√©mon Knight""!"", and ""Expedition to Onix Island!""

Those were funny, I enjoyed Beheeyem calling Team Rocket and Ash idiots. Chat wasn't happy to have Pikachu included in that ""small group of people"" lol

&gt; The series' ending did not feel emotional at all. Saying goodbye to Misty and Brock, May and Max, and Dawn and Brock was heartbreaking. Saying goodbye to Iris and Cilan is like...eh, whatever, good luck on your journeys

Just a quick lunch at Vermilion city and a quick goodbye on the Saffron train, less than 2 minutes...writers did them wrong

Agree with everything you said but 1 **con** I may add as well...

* The writers jumbled and fucked up the story line by taking both parts of BW1 and BW2 and meshing them together. Scrapping the old Team Plasma and never airing the 2 episodes and then showing that they were burnt dead to a crisp by Reshiram. Then showing Ghetsis in the BW2 uniform just standing there and doing nothing while Colress ran the show like he was the main boss/villain was boring and a missed opportunity. **If the anime followed the BW2 storyline then Kyurem should have been incorporated and they had plenty of time to write it in with the Decalore islands 20 episodes.**

Also if you follow BW1 then use Trio-Drayden then put Cheren/Roxie/Marlon. I know the game came out (BW2) but mixing them up was a bit odd. Still, this is a 50/50 for me not a complete pro or con.

All in all, it felt like the writers were rushing things and confused with the direction at times because they had to follow 2 games at once, giving a terrible league then leaving an empty void after that...",1554077111

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

Ultimately, money needs to be factored in here, from tickets to merch to eyeballs on TVs, and as good as the league is getting as a spectator sport, it's still currently free to watch and at some point soon that will need to change.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Oh, 150IU/day is an ok dose actually, very surprising you had such bad effects from it, I used the same weekly dose (350IU 3x/week) and had slightly elevated estradiol but nothing crazy (I dropped to 250IU 3x/week now).

The cycling is why it didn't work, when you're on trt your LH/FSH production is non-existent so HCG needs to be used constantly otherwise it's pointless, sounds like you had a pretty shitty doctor unfortunately.

Sorry it didn't work out for you, if you ever consider trying it again I suggest like 600-800IU/week (200 EOD or 250 3x/week for example) for at least 4-6 months and then testing for sperm count (you have to keep using it forever to maintain fertility on trt btw), also always get your estradiol checked because that's the mostly likely culprit in the side effects of HCG.

Whooshed today! New low FINALLY. One of my April goals is now only a half pound away. I'll probably be up tomorrow, but that's okay. I'm going to buy the microwave flower press I've been eyeing for 2 whole years if I hit my next SV by my 7mo marker. I've been more lenient than what is typical for me since SO is not adhering to keto, but having a goal and reward helps keep me on track. Plus I really want it since it's coming to the time when I could actually USE the flower press. 

We borrowed fancy new mountain bikes from the bike shop and biked 17 miles on Saturday. Some off road trails, but mainly pavement which was less than ideal for mountain bikes. We did finish mapping out the commute route from home to SO's office. My office is a little bit further, but not too bad. The off road portion was SO MUCH FUN. I forgot how much I love cross-country mtb. SO went out again today, but my tum was feeling a bit off so instead I stayed home and eventually putzed around the garden. A little more weeded and the hydrangea is cleaned up. 

Okay, I guess I'll go clean up the house now since we have people coming tomorrow. Bleeeggghhh...

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

Regardless of how exciting or boring a specific day might be, you are going to easily get up if you respect your sleep schedule and keep at it for as many consecutive days as possible: Once the habit is cemented into your brain and body, you'll get up automatically and feel wrong for not getting up even if your plans for the day are not exciting.

That ruling was basically against the right to own a sawed off shotgun, since that wasn't a common military arm.  DC. v. Heller clarified that ruling and extended the protection to a lot of other weapons.
  
The key point being that the 2nd amendment was intended to ensure the right of the people to keep their own military weapons.  The ""militia"" bit, if you look at the context of other states proposed versions of the 2nd Amendment was mostly about avoiding the creation of a standing army.   Since our standard issue military rifle typically uses 20-30 round magazines, that would be considered ""ordinary military equipment"" and therefore shouldn't be restricted. ",1554077119

Often, you get a short term private ""flip"" loan at a super high interest rate, flip the value of the property to about double, get renters in for ~6 months, then finance the property traditionally for lower than the total equity (reducing risk for the lender) and using both the property and proven rent-revenue as leverage. Once the property has matured further, you can use that equity to acquire more properties and be your own ""private money."" Lots of others are in syndicated investments which I don't know as much about, but it's basically large group investing using little to none of your own money.

&gt;‚ÄúSo, the full nature of everything has yet to be revealed, and the truth is that I‚Äôve come to a place now where really everything, both good and bad, is actually really informative for me. I still take it personally, but I take it a lot less personally.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, right? And part of being a Trek fan is engaging in that debate. And that‚Äôs the beautiful democracy of that.

"TheMonkeysPaw","t5_3ovsj","Yeah I understand your point. I agreed with you that not all parts of the Bible are correct. But then again look back at their time, an army could just go raid your fucking village kill all of you and rape your women. Don‚Äôt think you necessarily get the harshness of our humanity where we come from. 

The sacrificing was apart of many cultures  because they believed in the ""gods"". They didn't have a fully developed left rational brain to rationalize these minimal ideas we often understand as a child how could our ancestors possibly think like this? Dumb. Because of evolution? Precisely. . At point one where humanity exsisted and started to gain our identity. They didn't know all the answers either and they had to start from scratch. 

You learn from your experiences and evolve. Who the fuck wants to stone people? Let alone who wants to chop people's heads off with a guillotine for stealing? The Bible is a piece of art and it's a part of our human history whether you like it or not same as the statue of David. 

Understanding the evolution of humans is the key to knowledge. How they thought percieved the world and acted upon it because there moral code was pretty fragile just like our consciousness. 

Having a BRAIN to take in information and filtering life events and stories is the first step to finding yourself. Reading material not as if it was written for at this day and age to understand there point. History is made to learn from their mistakes and judge them in today's society. 

So yeah thanks for letting me repeat myself about the same concept I just talked about. Clearly you haven't gave this much thought and came at me with typical well they stoned and killed people and dida lot of things wrong that were told in the Bible. Yeahhhhh but humanity is constantly improving and have to decipher history for your own moral code through ALL experiences you encounter on your journey. 

So yeah I would consider your ahead of the curve because your parents taught you on how to not be a jerk, you don't need a Bible to tell you that but the thought came from someone whether it was the Bible or not. At least you are trying to better yourself and become a better person which should be the goal in everybody. 

TLDR: All experiences need deciphered by your filter to develop your own moral judgment. Whether what sits right or wrong with you is up to you. It's your moral compass that you follow in life. I try to take in other people opinions and learn their point of view and diminishmy ego to get to what is right in wrong in story of life. 

Don't rely on a single source of information to guide you through life. Because you could be going down the wrong path....

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The Global Intelligence Files outline using ""social media as a form of protest"" in partnership with InQTel.

https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1642045_re-analytical-and-intelligence-comments-re-social-media-as-a.html

The Q movement was outlined years ago.

""A figure called Q was the ""founder and runs the IRC. He is indeed in California, as are many of the senior leadership of the group."" Another person called Owen is ""almost a co-founder, lives in NY with family that are also active in the group, including slenaid and rabbit (nicks)."" Finally, CommanderX can ""manage some significant firepower."" Barr believed he had matched real names to each of these three individuals.""

Q is an operation derived from George Tenet of QinetiQ derived from the same exact computer science technique, though modernized, as the John Titor posting.

George Tenet was also the head of QinetiQ where Susan Zimmerman was head, and where she also moved over to CACI, the DIA contractor.

Q is ""Real."" Someone with a few tidbits of insider information and a large artificial shill following. I think we are safe is saying who the shills are that surround Q. Q has a real movement of people with good intentions. The Q movement does great research. I LIKE the Q movement. However, I do my own research and I am cautious of a time when Q is used to unfairly discredit a large number of people by association.

Here is pretty interesting evidence: https://i.imgur.com/gG3YS35.png

That resulted in an overall lower IPC, which meant they had to be run at much higher clocks to achieve performance parity. That made scaling difficult due to thermals and power consumption. This was around the time you saw a lot of crazy cooling solutions among enthusiast circles. 

It was a golden age for AMD. If you were an enthusiast around 2003, you probably had an Athlon XP Barton. Then ClawHammer came along and, living up to its name, demolished Intel. Essentially forcing them to revisit the P6 micro-architecture for the Pentium M and later the Core. And of course AMD lost any appeal they had left when they put out Bulldozer.

Push the sine wave a little faster or slower by loading it a little early or a little late. I don‚Äôt believe HVDC inverters are mindless output devices but are in fact highly controllable IGBT‚Äôs. If I understand the tech correctly, multi-level IGBT‚Äôs are basically big banks of IGBT‚Äôs so you can fill in the holes in your sine wave by PWM‚Äôing them separately. You fire hundreds of times per wave (each timing offset to the next) and this gives you a good way to shape the wave while keeping the noise down. That kind of control should lead itself to an easy method of shaping and pushing around the sine wave. If anything, you‚Äôd have more inertia as you could theoretically sag your dc input more without anything happening. A great example would be offshore wind turbines. A lot of them are pushing HVDC already and who cares if you loose a metric fuck ton of inertia at the rotor. 

I would imagine grid batteries are doing the exact same thing as the same sine wave shaping would apply.

&gt;the entirety of y1 happened in attempt to make crucible 'fair' and it nearly buried the franchise, and crucible still remains terribly unbalanced to this day

&gt;fun concepts for weapons, exotics, and skills that will NEVER be implemented into the game because they'd break crucible

&gt;the one exotic slot limitation exists BECAUSE of crucible, you can never have something like exotic armor sets as long as crucible exists

&gt;supers and weapon that are already in the game are being gutted because of their performance in crucible

Only about 20% of the population ever frequent the crucible regularly, PVP is not popular with the majority of the player base. Most players only ever play it because they have to (quest step, scrapper bounty, etc), the truth is that the PVP crowd are the small (but vocal) minority.
It's not that i want PVP to be removed, more content variety is always a good thing (although admittedly i would not really miss it if they did) but bungie might see the dwindling numbers for PVP and decide it may be more beneficial and cost effective to drop PVP entirely in favor of more robust focus on PVE content, the content that the vast majority of the player base seems to gravitate to.Ôªø",1554077127

For HT if you stand at the right place to use Stunning Strike, you also can hit 2 heads + 2 arms + 1 wing = 5 targets.

2. Spamming Stunning Strike results no delay between skills, probably only after every 30s to use Spike Royales and Unicorn Spike to keep Ignis Roar buff. You do see that there are delays up to seconds after each link skill combo right?

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Northeastern vs. USC vs. Georgetown


Cost: No financial aid for any, 25k merit from Northeastern.

Major: Undecided, leaning towards business/pre law 

Additional: I was admitted to USC for the Spring semester and was so excited at the idea of a west coast school as well as tons of options for an undecided major, but I‚Äôm worried about the social aspect (I‚Äôm more of an introverted person which is the opposite of USC‚Äôs culture) and cost.
I love Georgetown and the type of people it attracts but I‚Äôm worried about the lack of flexibility for undecided majors and tbh I went on the Georgetown.hotmess Instagram and the living/food situation terrified me. 

Northeastern gave me a good scholarship and I like that I‚Äôd get to travel a lot, but I do want to go to a school with some prestige to look good for employers-something that I think NEU doesn‚Äôt have as much as the other two schools.

If your husband gets his way, he will see you in an embarrassing position.   
If you get your way, he will never get to see the birth of his own child.  

Now maybe it's just me, but one of those is a little bit more important than the other. Not only that, but implicitly you're telling him you don't trust him to love you.

The only reason I think YTA a little bit is because of my first sentence - ""not caring about"" gender doesn't magically make all the bad stuff that happens due to gender go away, so you gotta realize that people (including nonbinary people) are all trying their best in the context of this bad system.

Like, gender is still real the way money is real - it's a social construct, and it's bad, but you can't just ignore it, because it has such a huge impact that unfortunately shapes all of society.

"rheumatoidarthritis","t5_jr113","I was already dating my ex wife when I got the diagnosis at age 25. I had planned to propose a couple months later (our one year anniversary together). It didn't really affect that relationship then, but then an MS diagnosis while married changed a lot and she finally decided she didn't sign up for all that. 

I have dated some here and there and even had a two year relationship after the divorce. But she also had RA which was how we met, so that is very different. 

Other than that relationship I've always found it hard. Not knowing your age, I think it could be harder even when younger. I'm older now and imagine it would have been harder when I was younger to try and date. With RA I was still able to work. Now that I'm not able to it created problems for sure. 

I've always felt it best to bring it up early. Also I find that that if they don't ask enough questions, that can be a red flag. To me it always showed they either didn't really get what having these diseases means, or they just aren't interested enough to care. 

A long time friend with MS told me once she felt dating was slightly easier for her because it was easier for her to pick and choose when to tell someone and how much. Her being a single mom, not working doesn't spark the questions it often does for me as a single guy without children. Just meaning that the question of ""what do you do for a living"" is a topic that comes up quickly and isn't easily deflected. 

Which in the end is fine in a way, because I'd rather find out someone thinks these health problems are too much right at the beginning. Rather than either of us wasting time getting to know each other and then have them go running because they found out later. 

In the end there are going to be people that will never give anyone that is sick a chance. Dating is hard even when healthy. This is just another thing added onto the many things we deal with. 

All you can do is try not to let the people that go running get to you too much and keep trying. I say that now that I don't even try to date anymore. But I think most people need to keep trying. 

Good luck to you. ",1554077132
"Beekeeping","t5_2qtzm","So, where are you located? 

Bees aren't native, and they are domesticated livestock unless your from their native homeland. So they have been bred to improve some of their habits over time thus lowering other traits that possibly provided them more survivability. 

They would probably last until winter, Or a dearth, or until the parasitic Asian mite know as varroa destructor kills them over time/infestation. It's a know fact(according to Paul Kelly Master beekeeper from UofGuelph) that varroa mites cause a colony to collapse without treatment.
So unfortunately your best bet is to call a beekeeper club to remove them and take care of them. They gladly would, it's an easy location and would probably only charge for gas if it's their day off lol. Remember for a beekeeper to take bees that beekeeper needs to buy equipment and treat/feed them depending on the time of year. So paying isn't out of the question for easy removals.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Never read Naruto or Bleach, so I can't dispute that. But even if Bleach and Naruto have the complexity of nen they still lack the other two elements that I said that make nen more unique than your average magic ability.




&gt; The fact that you can get stronger invalidates the restrictions placed upon nen. 





How does the fact that a character gets stronger through training invalidate the limitation makes your abilities stronger rule? It's completely unrelated. 







&gt; The author can simply justify an overpowered character by saying he practiced it for years.





Did you know training at things make you better at doing those things? If someone became ten times stronger by training 2 months I'd agree it would be bad writing, but if he is been dedicating his whole life to training and the series makes an effort to explain it I think there is enough justification to his strength.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","&gt; ""Women have become a hazard and liability in personal and professional situations""

I don't find this statement to be discriminating.  It could be used to excuse discrimination down the line, by an idiot, but in itself it is not.  The legal protections of women over men can be truly life ruining to a degree that extreme avoidance is just the safest route for survival and happiness.  It doesn't mean women are lower lifeforms at all.  The men who think they are superior, are probably stupid.  There are women above them, guaranteed.  Stupid people will take ""avoid women"" and turn it into ""women are bad,"" but they don't mean the same thing at all. 

To use myself as an example, I love women.  I'm divorced, and have been so stupidly in love 3 different times that they all almost killed me at some point or another.  Had I had a kid with any of them, holy shit would my life have been over.  I can barely support myself, I definitely couldn't support a child.  The fact that I risked my entire future for that bonding experience is just insane.  

I'm still insane, and am not some kind of MTGOW zealot.  I don't browse the sub or any related forums.  I just agree with the general notion, and follow it myself for now.  I might make that risk again, someday.  But I'll absolutely never get legally married again, or stick with anyone long enough to entitle them to half my life.

Also, make sure you do the fight with at least bahamut and Yuna's overdrive filled up, I did close to 20k damage with bahamut megaflare only. Having Auron, Tidus ans Kihmari overdrive full is also a good help as they do bigger damage.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

So, anyone who's going to complain about how they're not doing anything needs to remember what it was like a decade ago.

They hired more security and better supervisors, and now enforce a strict uniform policy for all the ushers and whatnot.

Here is the thing, after his education accomplishments, with his resume he could have gotten a executive job anywhere he wanted making tons of money, but he knew his hometown was on the list of ten decaying cities in America. So, because he is about serving his country and people he returned to his hometown and turned a once dying city completely around. 



Another thing, he gives Trump no ammunition, he is sqeaky clean, he has no skeletons in the closet and has not been tainted by shady politics in Washington.
He is not a slimy, plastic politician.

"Sekiro","t5_k9vh3","Sorry but I strongly disagree.

This is by far the hardest game I‚Äôve ever played, with the steepest learning curve.

I agree the game does get easier once you‚Äôve mastered the mechanics, but isn‚Äôt this obvious and what ‚Äúgetting good‚Äù is about? 

Dark souls also gets easier once the mechanics ‚Äúclick‚Äù. Its mechanics are so infinitely more accessible though. A lot of the difficulty could be essentially reduced by changing stats, whereas in Sekiro it is all skill based. 

The posture system in Sekiro is incredibly complex for an action game, and takes so much more skill than the hit-dodge combat in dark souls.

The only way in which I could say dark souls is more difficult is in the way it requires level learning, knowing which areas to visit in which order and knowing where a boulder will crush you out of nowhere, but these things always pissed me off anyway. It‚Äôs cheap. In Sekiro, I know that if I‚Äôm good and careful enough, I can deal with anything that comes my way.

Even once the game has ‚Äúclicked‚Äù, it is still very challenging. I went into the Genichiro fight haven beaten Lady Butterfly 100% confident I had the system down. Even though I could hold my ground and survive for a bit, it took me hours of attempts to finally beat him. The designers are probs then aware you understand the system and continue to challenge you by varying it up for the rest of the game.

Sekiro is not at all easy. You‚Äôre on a subreddit of fanatics who have mastered the game within a week of its release. We‚Äôre an extremely small subset of gamers who will play. To the ‚Äúcasual‚Äù, Sekiro will completely trump Dark Souls in terms of difficulty.

Also just had to say you‚Äôre not ‚Äúraining on my parade‚Äù. This game is incredibly fun and that‚Äôs the most important thing to me. I also know it‚Äôs the hardest game I‚Äôve played so becoming more and more competent is extremely rewarding.",1554077139

The reason we're an independent country and not part of the UK anymore is because a majority of our people voted for the pro-independence party back in 1918. The subsequent war of independence was fought because Britain refused to accept the result of that election. Ireland has never taken another country's territory by force without the consent of those living in it - the area covered by the Republic of Ireland was majority in favour of independence. That's partly why Northern Ireland exists, indeed - and the Irish government has never engaged in or supported any military campaigns to take it by force and claim it as part of our state.

If you believe that every country in the world has taken land by force and responded to the fact that a majority of the people opposed this action with ""tough shit, we have bigger guns so we can do whatever we like"", your world view is probably poisoned by the fact that America has indeed done this on several occasions.

2. overpowered?  probably not.  nonsensical?  absolutely.  the whole schtick of kobolds is that they are complete and utter cowards that struggle to do anything without a group of like minded things to trigger pack tactics and fight in numbers.  fear works with breath weapon because dragonborn are imposing, intimidating figures, not meek little lizard rats that literally cower away in fear crying so much that they are distracting as a racial feature.

3. on radiant/necrotic it's probably a bit much, especially with the scourge aasimar existing already doing a similar thing during transformation.  however you could probably just keep it as fire and just name it ""solar's embrace"" or something.

4. radiant and necrotic are already reasonably uncommon damage types, so keeping this to cold and poison probably isn't hurting a whole lot.  although I'd probably reflavor this to base it more on angels and other celestials and their traits than being cold and poison and then adv on poison saves.  maybe tie it to the transformation but make it something more generally impactful like nonmagical BPS similar to the other angels while you're transformed.

5. probably not problematic at all.  none of those are generally going to be as impactful over the course of a game as elven accuracy, and you can already take that as a half elf.  spells can be countered and dispelled, and outside of PWT on wood elf magic none of what is available is realistically that powerful compared to any other feat for once a day.  and PWT isn't doing much unless your party is already going for stealth approaches commonly anyways.",1554077140

As it turns the seed/clay mixture slowly turns into the seed balls as they nucleate. 

Then you just make a scoop (like a kitty Kotter scoop) with a mesh that is the size ball you want to get to and scoop out the ones that are big enough every two min or so. 

The smaller ones go through the mesh and keep getting bigger.

Basically‚Äîmoving environments is scary. Your dog is in a totally new home, with new people, new expectations, new sounds/smells/sights. Depending on the dog, it can take months to really settle in and get used to things. Your dog may be fearful, he may just have been fearful in the shelter, you can't know which yet. He may love other dogs, he may have dog aggression‚Äîagain, you can't know. Give it time, get to know each other, and practice a phrase like ""I'm sorry, we're in training right now"" for when you encounter dogs on walks. Right now, your goal on walks should be for them to be positive experiences where his focus is one you (with the aid of kibble or treats). Practice strategies like cued u-turns and a ""treat magnet"" for passing/avoiding other dogs if encountering them on walks makes you anxious.

You can also look up the 2-week shutdown for ideas on how to keep things fairly calm while a new dog settles in.

So I showered and spent time with a friend of mine and we mutually jerked off each other's dicks. I woke up as I finished in the dream. It didnt directly end in sex but it was odd. 

Another time; there was a huge trojan horse filled w beer in a town I grew up in. I took my current partner home and my ex and his ex wife came home together too. His ex wife and my current partner hit it off really well and was helping my partner pick out clothes to wear. She kept massaging him and started making out with him. I left the room upset, and sat with my ex- both of us pretty miserable. I  comforted him and he expressed sadness about not having a big dick. After a few moments of comforting him, I realized I was really not okay with my current partner and my ex's ex wife hooking up. So I went back in and she was pegging my ""super straight, dont ever put anything in my butthole""  partner. I was livid and scratched/clawed and fought her over it. Woke up as I ripped off the dildo and clawed her face. 

I typically have strange dreams but these really tripped me up for a while.

I don't think we have crossed arguments, just different approaches. To me and most people there is an inferred understanding from the poster, and often explicitly laid out in their position.

If you say unintelligent people shouldn't vote then there is the general tendency to fall back to the pareto principle or to personal knowledge when there are no % levels or intelligence measurement suggested. Given a pereto distribution those in the 20% least intelligent will often, not always, have some sort of mental or physical handicap. Is it wrong to infer from an ambiguous statement that the position holder also accepts this logic and is it not right to challenge the position through supposition? 

As an aside the IQ test does not test intelligence, it tests reasoning, pattern matching and logic rather than emotional intelligence, empathy and non-verbal comprehension which are also valid measures of intelligence.

So I come to the point that you are discussing positions/statements that have no inherent bias or context, which is a fair appraisal of a statement on here if it is a one-liner. However what I'm suggesting is that there is no such thing. People will have their own biases and inferences when making a statement (as shown in the obese voting post that went into detail about the correlations between obesity and inability to govern themselves if I remember correctly).

For purely scholarly debate devoid of emotion it is easy to question and clarify a position that is vague but is timely, however the main aim of presenting a position is to remove ambiguity so the root idea can be challenged. The difference being:

1. Obese people shouldn't have the ability to vote
2. People with low self control, tendencies to addiction and self-destructive tendencies shouldn't have the ability to vote

Both of these statements could be true of each other but statement 2 aims to defeat set fallacies before presented and statement 1 invites them. It is not the fault of the challenger if they present obvious issues for rebuttal even if they fall into the category 'what about the...'. It is not the fault of the challenger if they fall to fallacies when the original position is unclear.",1554077142

"slingtv","t5_35q6u","CNN went to Hell. Fox News was never particularly ""great"" per se. But, it seems everyone including liberals like to watch Fox News. CNN, in losing a ratings battle badly, decided to start reporting on E! Entertainment quality stuff--like what's up with Brangelina?!?! Who has a new hairdo on Real Wives of...whatever. I coudln't give two shits. There is actually a world out there beyond the Kardashians and whatever sex changes happen there. It's just not worth the time to even glance.

It grew worse with the growth of the Internet. Because now some stuff that gets sent on Twitter is rebroadcast ""This just in from the Twitter-verse!"" Nah, man, I get that it's cheaper to recirculate rumors than do hard reporting but look where that got them on the Trump investigation. The only one that had it right is Fox News in the end--but not for the right reasons. Screw 'em all.

Just watch non-US based news sources. We're more propagandized than any other people in the world at this point. About now China, Russia, and North Korea are like, ""What are you doing in the U.S. to get people to be that brainwashed? And, can you give us some tips?""",1554077145

Not OP, but essentially, yes, I'd quit. Most commonly this happens with your first situation. There is no clear signaling when there is no further information to get, unlike a game, where you can just exaust the dialogue tree. The real world equivelent of this is a wall of 'I don't wanna talk about this' or 'I don't know', which is what I assume is what OP is also running up against, but that isn't very clear. It might just have been that I didn't ask the right question or that they're unwilling to provide it, which is why I'd keep asking, until I gave up, since at that point I've exausted or destroyed all alternative routes.

In a game, I'd try alternative routes through the dialoge tree or load up an earlier save, but here, I can't do that. Instead I'm essentially stuck with an unsolvable quest. Communication with that person is now basically impossible (atleast about whatever it was about).

The system we use, that we've always used, is that each individual state makes a choice and their votes are totaled. Higher population states have more electoral votes, they have more influence.

You would take a car that costs $500 bucks, over one that costs $200k, as your ""I'm going to go out and have fun driving"" car.  And when I say ""driving"" I mean, driving, not wrecking, not tooling around in a field until something breaks, not as a getaway vehicle for a heist.

I mean driving.

Cause yea, I'm thinking either you missed the spirit of the metaphor, you're crazy, or you're just arguing the counter point for shits and giggles.

Cause you just told me you'd go to war with a musket rather than a modern rifle.

I mean, sure, ok, you prefer the whole experience of loading and firing a musket, compared to firing a modern rifle....but that's missing the context of the choice.

You would rather have a bare-bones, basic space sim single player campaign that lasts about 10 hours, over a visually cutting edge, feature rich, 20+ hour campaign with a branching story based on your choices in the missions and how you interact with a wide cast of characters.

You want a simple game.

That, was never what SQ42 nor Star Citizen was pitched as.  They were both pitched as intending to be the best that was possible based on the funding they were given.  There was a minimum threshold they wanted to get to, but the intention was always to go bigger and better if possible.

This wasn't a nostaliga project like Descent: Underground, it was always pitched as a ""we want to shoot for the stars and push the boundaries, but we need your help"" project.

So I really, really don't understand people who ""just wanted the basic pitch"", this wasn't that kind of project, ever.

EDIT: and it was obvious for a very long time that it wasn't going to be done for 2014 and there was a long time after that where people unhappy with that could have gotten a full refund.  So I doubly don't know why such people are still around, and still complaining.  I'm sorry you didn't get the game you wanted, but this was never that game to begin with.",1554077149

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","Thanks, that's why I came here. I've read some really supportive stuff on reddit from other users. Sometimes you get to the point where you want to talk to your family and friends but then you just shut yourself off because you know they'll tell you the same generic shit. I tell my wife a lot and she's always been very supportive and encouraging. Without her, I don't know what the hell I would do.

Thanks for the advice and best of luck to you also. College was a great time for me, just stay focused on your studies first and have fun when you can afford it. And remember this to: your GPA DOES matter when you graduate. If you feel like you may not pass a course, drop it and retake it. One ""F"" can ruin you. I graduated with a 2.1 GPA and it has always been a thorn in my side when it comes to jobs. I joined as a PFC; there was no way I was able to be a competitive officer candidate with that GPA.",1554077150

The bit where it stopped a third time with crowd trouble?

The part where fans were trying to fight players on the bench?

The part where they threw objects at the former national team manager and he fell to the ground clutching his head?

Then the bit when the manager was being led away from previously being hit, only to be hit again?

The game where he needed 5 stitches, was hospitalised with concussion? 

The same game where the match was abandoned? That one?

The one where 30 plus fans were arrested?

No idea about how a Napoli fan was stabbed by Besiktas fans in 2016?

Or the one in Kiev where 10 people were stabbed and put in hospital in 2016?

The game in France in 2017 where they fought French Police?

The red star fan who was killed in 2014 by Besiktas fans?

An IPO is just the first time that shares are available for purchase. 

I'm not sure what your argument is here. Are people that build companies not entitled to own even a fraction of the company that they build?

When Gobert is OFF the court, the jazz score 113.7 per 100 and allow 93.6 per 100 - a staggering +/- of +20.1.

I am actually being serious. I'd been an Atheist all my life until about two years ago when I had a spiritual awakening. For a while afterwards my faith would waver but I would always be gently guided back to the path whenever id ask for help. On one occasion it was in my shower. I was hungover and feeling like death having a hot shower to try and cleanse myself when suddenly I felt my bowels gurgle. I decided to trust and released a fart. It was just air. But this was not just air. This was a foul stench of sulphur from the pit of Hell itself somehow manifesting and now escaping out my ass. It hit me like a fist. The steam transformed the gas into some type of malevolent angry hate cloud and I was trapped within it like a prisoner. My gag reflex kicked in and I stumbled clutching the wall and dry heaved over the plug. I was desperate to escape. But the heat the steam and this foul miasma acted like a cocktail on my drunken state and I felt dizzy and nauseous. I groped through the air for something to steady myself with terrified of slipping in the shower, I was home alone with no one to help if I fell. If I fell I might never get back up.

But I was dizzy and the room was spinning, naked and wet I was in Satan's sauna of stench and there's no way he was letting me escape. I sank down into the bottom of the bath beneath the shower head coughing miserably and dry heaving. I thought please God help me escape this Hell. Please Jesus save me! And then I heard the call, the divine intervention. Put on the cold tap child, it told me. This was confusing advice, in my muddled state I hadn't been able to think clearly enough to turn off the water stream to relieve some of the terrible heat. With Herculean effort I reached forward and turned off the shower. I swapped the lever over and turned on the cold tap. Sweet merciful Lord, I rubbed handfuls of the cold pure water into my face and I felt as though I was being baptised. Not in fire but out of stench. It revived me and the room stopped spinning. I prayed to the Prince of Peace to guide me as I ripped back the shower curtain and took in lungfuls of precious air. It still stank like a demons ass but I knew I had the Lord with me and with Him I could face any trial. I climbed out of that shower a broken but changed being. I opened the window and sat on the toilet coughing up that polluting gas that had invaded me. I watched the steam stream out the window like an evil spirit taking its leave. I knew the power of Christ had helped save me from a stinky watery fate.

I found the strength to leave the bathroom that day, but I know I found another strength in Jesus Christ. He heard my pleas and answered my plight. To this day my faith has stayed with me and I've never dared fart in the shower again. I like to think it was all a lesson in belief, all the years of evil thoughts and self doubt escaped thru my ass and assaulted me one last time. I entered that shower to get clean, but I left it cleansed.",1554077154

I wasn't expecting any friends, so I looked out the window, and saw a man standing at my door, and I didn't recognize him. So, I went on over and answered the door.""Hello there"" I said nonchalantly. He responded with ""Hi, I was wondering if you had a few minutes to hear the word of God?"" So I said ""Unfortunately, no, not right now. I'm a bit busy, but if you give me your address, I can swing by later tonight and I can tell you about Atheism."" So he says back ""Well, sir, um... I don't want to give my personal information out to random people..."" So my response is ""What? Why? You don't want a random stranger knocking on your door in the middle of the day and trying to shove their religion down your throat? Kinda hypocritical, don't you think?"" He just looked completely befuddled as he turned away and started walking down the street, off to his next house. As he stormed out, a couple of the passerbys started to whistle and cheer, soon my neighbors joined in and even some drivers. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.

Since Flexeril is not a C-II, you do not forfeit the balance of the prescription.  You can refill it every month, one moth at a time.

I was born into a family of non-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, ""if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya.""

""Yes, pa,"" I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.

""Y'all hitting that *yeet?*"" he would seeth.

""No, pa,"" I would answer.

""Good."" He would then walk out the room and shout, ""If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'.""

It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.

I would swallow my pride. ""No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa."" As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.

One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.

I breathed in.

""YEEEEE*EEEEE*EEEEET!""

My father burst from my closet. ""I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that *yeet*, nibba,"" he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.

I haven't hit that yeet since.

**PART II**

Until today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one.

With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.

""Yeet,"" I spake.

Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.

""Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' *yeet* at *my* funeral?"" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me.

""Not so fast, pa."" I grabbed his hand. ""Yaint thumpin' no mo'.""

My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. ""The student becomes the teacher,"" he said.

""The student becomes the *yeet*cher,"" I corrected him.",1554077155

"hockey","t5_2qiel","I run a pool for a different ""sport"" which has an implementation that might be relevant.

Basically, you can get each participant to pick their top 4 teams in a specific order.

For example, 

1. Tampa, 2. Washington 3. Nashville, 4. Sharks.

Then you create a scoring system that generates points for teams. I guess for the NHL playoffs, you can make points based on game wins. Maybe a win gets a team 3 points, a OTL gets a team 1 point, no points for a game loss. You could then assigned special bonus points to teams with special considerations such as a shutout win, a series sweep, negative points for being swept, making the finals, winning the cup, etc. It's important to properly balance the score key.

The point is that you run that predetermined scoring key over all the playoff series games, and the points each team earns is assigned to the participants who picked those teams. The participant who wins is the one who generates the most points with their picks. If there's a tie, the tiebreaker is the participant to ranked the stanley cup winning team the highest. If both winners have the cup winner ranked 1st, then the tie then goes down to who ranked the 2nd place team in their 2nd slot, etc etc all the way down.

In my system I usually state that you need to enter a unique set of 4, to avoid a situation where there are more than one ""winning"" set, though usually with a choice of 14+ unique teams, the chances of a participant making the same set as another participant is very unlikely (I usually have a pool size of about 50-60 people).",1554077155

"simracing","t5_2quee","I‚Äôm in a similar situation as you with the dilemma. 

I own Porsche 918 rim and McLaren gt3 rim, DD1 with free formula rim on the way.

What I really like about the Porsche rim is the versatility for oval, non gt and GT cars. 

Also the build quality and reliability have been great.

I ended up getting Gt3 rim because I drive open wheeler time to time and the complete round rim didn‚Äôt feel right to me when driving.

I know quite a lot of people like the old and new formula rim but I hate the feeling in my hand with the small diameter of 27cm of formula rim vs. 30cm of gt3, 32cm of 918. I even primarily plan to sell the free formula rim when I receive with DD1.

I have seen the new podium Porsche flat bottom rim with podium paddles, a bit tempting to be honest. But I think the podium paddles are currently useless in iRacing most importantly. I also prefer round bottom for oval and non gt cars. 

If iRacing fixes their paddle issue or I play some other sims that use paddles, I might be more tempted. ",1554077156

Score hidden ‚Ä¢ just now 

Dontstarta conversation like ""Doyou have proof?"" Because yes, I would be saying that he used my modela three 

times in his videos without anything, and this makes you look rude (I am Not saying you are). I saw the video, he 

told us to sign, check the policy of the sites you post and to watermark the model (that is pretty much same thing 

as sign.) Everything I post, I post in DA The models are not accurate and it has a huge watermark in the feet. So 

there is no reason to be confused with oficial content. here is ""the proof"" all videos that they_appeared and the 

original model renders made by me.

Yeah I just did some reverse image search. You didnt make this 101. And it wasnt meant rude. But there are a lot 

of people saying ""Yeah hes bad! Because he did this to me"" and 99% of the time its a lie. So yeah thats why I ask 

for proof. you just posted that with your watermark on it. ugujyourbullshit

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Cal Poly SLO vs UC Davis

Major: Physics

Cost: They‚Äôre both fairly affordable for me and my family, so that doesn‚Äôt really come into play.

Location: I kind of like the location of Cal Poly better, but I honestly have no preference. Both schools are about a 3 hour drive from where I live.

I‚Äôm thinking Davis would possibly be better for me since I‚Äôm not 100% set on my major and it‚Äôs hard to switch majors at Cal Poly, but I‚Äôm still very open to Cal Poly as it‚Äôs an amazing school.

Thanks for your nice reply!
Shame we never met as child royalty in the past ;-)

Has that always been what you need, or has it fluctuated in the past? I have to admit I actually don't know much about that level of paralysis, would love to hear more about that (if you don't mind sharing of course).

Mine is at L1, and even though it's been complete paralysis for years, I sometimes get feelings of impartial, where I would be able to walk a little bit with a walker. This part I really don't understand, because there are days when I want to smash my spine to pieces just to not have to feel anything anymore. I've read others who sometimes feel it needs to be paralysis and sometimes amputations. 

So I don't know if it's my mind playing tricks on me or not, but it is definitely pushing me towards potentially starting to use some kind of mobility aid full time and see what that would do for the intensity of the BIID.

Wow, that's amazing to read about your friends. I am so curious about their stories!

The coat may be a little more curly - but as I have 3 OES that range from almost straight wavey hair to straight-up nappy, I don't think even that is deterministic. 

All OES are grey/white, with the ""standard"" markings being a white chest/neck/head/feet and a grey/black ""blanket"" covering the back and legs. There isn't really a breed standard for markings, but that pattern is the most common. The only thing that's not allowed in a show-quality OES is any hint of brown to the grey/silver/black.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This didn‚Äôt happen to me, but rather a buddy of mine that wrestled back in the 8th grade. He had, and still does, a very severe heart problem. As he tried getting out of starting position, the other guy locked hands, hoisted him up to a fireman‚Äôs carry on his shoulder and slammed him to the mat, quite literally dead center on his chest. The ref called for potentially dangerous and immediately noticed he had no pulse. After he was brought back and was taken to the hospital days later when he came home he described what his image was like to everyone. And that simply was just black, nothingness. In an instant, he was quite literally rendered as a complete inanimate object. None of that life flashes before your eyes, just a straight up transition into lifelessness.

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","When you need a new relationship that combines the old ones you had already. I can give you a few examples from physics. You can find a mathematical relationship- function- for a force exerted on an object by some source. It may be a function of time, or position, or velocity, or whatnot.  Suppose you want to find a function for the net force the object experiences. If I have functions representing all the forces acting on the object, I can add all of these functions together to get a single function representing the total force acting on the object.

Suppose you have a bunch of functions of position that tell you force. Combine them into a single function that gives net force as a function of position. Use techniques from the study of differential equations to solve for the position as a function of time. Now what if the object moving is a magnet? Then you have a function for the force exerted by the magnet on some other location as a function of the position the magnet, so you put your position function inside of the new force function to get magnetic force exerted as a function of time- this is function composition, addition, etc.

When you have a particular goal for a rule to find, your only option is to combine all the rules you know until you get the one you need. This happens literally everywhere in all forms of applied mathematics- the fundamental structure behind any quantifiable science or technology. Perhaps I ask you to find the coulomb force caused by a certain atom. That would depend on the forces caused by protons and electrons, so you need to combine two rules that give the forces as functions of the number of protons and the number of electrons, respectively. You'd discover that the result is really a function of the difference between those two numbers. You might then realize that the difference between those numbers is a function of which atom it is, so now you have a function of the electric force caused by an atom as a function of which atom it is. Now what happens when you're looking at some collection of atoms?

The end goal of many science and technology applications is assembling a single mathematical rule that tells you exactly what you want to know, building that rule out of the rules you already understand.",1554077158
"CruciblePlaybook","t5_37lup","Hey mate, watched your meltdown vid. Don‚Äôt want to be hyper critical or repeat what others have said as I imagine their critique would apply to all the examples. 

1. 2-3 good snipes where you showed patience, eg. warlock early on waiting for the arc of his jump, couple others where you were aiming at head height. 

2. Can I suggest a different sniper such as twilight oath. Reason is Tatara can feel quite clunky, whereas TO will feel much snappier. You won‚Äôt get the 130 bodies but it could benefit your movement. 

3. Move with intent and read that radar. Radar is your best friend, telling you how many opponents there are, distance they are, relative height (depending on map). Base your approach on that information. 

4. Be careful getting caught in the open, use those corners, that is your escape route to reposition and engage. Try sliding corners instead of running in and exposing yourself then turning. 

5. Duke is one hard hitting mofo, time those shots else pair sniper with last word. Use the corners to peak shoot, especially if you hit a body with tatara. 

Keep practising and good luck, sniping can feel very rewarding. ",1554077158

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","# UCSC vs UCR

I'm planning to transfer after 2 years to UCI (local) to live at home and commute so I can save up money for medical school.

^(you might ask, why transfer from a UC to another UC when you can simply go to a CC and save money that way? the reason is because I transferred high schools senior year, so I haven't really had friends/a social life this year, and my parents want me to experience making new friends in college and being a part of a larger community....believe me, I've tried to convince them that going to my local cc is a good option to save money, but they want me to be happy and have friends :'))

**UCSC: (Major: Human Bio)**

*Pros/Cons-*

* Location
   * Santa Cruz seems nicer and is close to the beach and San Jose
   * However, there aren't many hospitals or medical centers in the area, so I'd have to commute
* Environment:
   * From what I've heard, student life is pretty active, and everyone is generally friendly and welcoming
   * imkindascaredofweedculturelol
* Cost: 40k
* Additional:
   * I prefer UCSC's vibe (I'm not big on partying and don't plan to go to raves lol @ UCR)
   * Senior year I moved away from San Jose, and I have a strong connection to a city and my friends there‚Äîit's comforting to be somewhat near my hometown
   * I've already found potential roommates for UCSC and know what programs I'd like to be apart of
   * They have an internship program that sets you up for internships through other universities (does this compensate for UCSC's lack of a medical school? idk)
   * I don't know if it's good for my major (maybe it doesn't matter because I'm planning to transfer after 2 years anyway, but I don't want to struggle finding opportunities for my resume)
   * Farther from home than UCR‚ÄîI know I'm going to get homesick lol
   * Dining hall food at UCSC seems questionable, and housing seems cramped

&amp;#x200B;

**UCR: (Major: Biology)**

*Pros/Cons-*

* Location
   * Riverside seems pretty dead/lack of things to do
   * However, it's more likely I'd be able to bring my car to UCR, so I would be able to drive to places
   * I'd be able to drive home whenever I want (good or bad thing? not sure)
   * UCR has a medical school- good for my major!!
* Environment:
   * I've heard that students are generally unmotivated, and as someone who needs to keep their GPA up as high as possible, I don't think I would thrive in such an environment
   * Student life seems to be based on greek life, which I don't plan on participating in (I'm more looking for active clubs)
   * Commuter school = less active student body
   * However, I've heard that professors are pretty helpful and people are friendly, and that class sizes are smaller
* Cost: 37k
* Additional:
   * I applied to the UCR honors program, so if I get in (I'll know by the end of April) it's a large deciding factor, as I'd get priority for class selection, opportunities for scholarships and internships, and I'd be able to work closely with professors
   * Seems better for my major, but not by much
   * Closer to my family
   * Has a huge gym
   * Don't know if I'd fit in with the culture of the school (my impression is that most people are into partying/going to raves? correct me if I'm wrong)
   * more asians? (I'm an asian girl)
   * My mom prefers UCR lol",1554077159

I was hungovew and feewing wike death having a hot showew to twy and cweanse mysewf when suddenwy I fewt my bowews guwgwe. I decided to twust and weweased a fawt. It was just aiw. But this was not just aiw. This was a fouw stench of suwphuw fwom the pit of Heww itsewf somehow manifesting and now escaping out my ass. It hit me wike a fist. The steam twansfowmed the gas into some type of mawevowent angwy hate cwoud and I was twapped within it wike a pwisonew.

I gwoped thwough the aiw fow something to steady mysewf with tewwified of swipping in the showew, I was home awone with no one to hewp if I feww. If I feww I might nevew get back up.

But I was dizzy and the woom was spinning, naked and wet I was in Satan's sauna of stench and thewe's no way he was wetting me escape. I sank down into the bottom of the bath beneath the showew head coughing misewabwy and dwy heaving. I thought pwease God hewp me escape this Heww. Pwease Jesus save me! And then I heawd the caww, the divine intewvention. Put on the cowd tap chiwd, it towd me. This was confusing advice, in my muddwed state I hadn't been abwe to think cweawwy enough to tuwn off the watew stweam to wewieve some of the tewwibwe heat. With Hewcuwean effowt I weached fowwawd and tuwned off the showew. I swapped the wevew ovew and tuwned on the cowd tap. Sweet mewcifuw Wowd, I wubbed handfuws of the cowd puwe watew into my face and I fewt as though I was being baptised. Not in fiwe but out of stench. It wevived me and the woom stopped spinning. I pwayed to the Pwince of Peace to guide me as I wipped back the showew cuwtain and took in wungfuws of pwecious aiw. It stiww stank wike a demons ass but I knew I had the Wowd with me and with Him I couwd face any twiaw. I cwimbed out of that showew a bwoken but changed being.

I found the stwength to weave the bathwoom that day, but I know I found anothew stwength in Jesus Chwist. He heawd my pweas and answewed my pwight.

""In 2018, Lisa Littman, Assistant Professor of the Practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, published an article in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE entitled **Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Study of Parental Reports.** The article drew attention to a phenomenon that had attracted widespread concern among parents, but which had not yet been studied systematically in the scientific literature.

Following publication, Dr. Littman and her study became the subject of intense criticism from some activists, who accused the author of spreading misconceptions about transgender people and employing biased methods. In response to this criticism, PLOS ONE initiated a re-review of Dr. Littman‚Äôs paper. This week, following the recent conclusion of that review, a modified version of Dr. Littman‚Äôs paper was published by PLOS ONE. And both Dr. Littman and PLOS One have released statements. According to the Notice of Republication, ‚ÄúOther than the addition of a few missing values in Table 13, the Results section is unchanged in the updated version of the article. The Competing Interests statement and the Data Availability statement have also been updated in the revised version.‚Äù

Since the original publication of her controversial article, Dr. Littman has maintained a low media profile, even as her exploration of Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD), a once taboo subject, came to influence the policy debate surrounding the treatment of children and teens who present as transgender. To coincide with the republication of the paper, now titled ‚ÄúParent Reports of Adolescents and Young Adults Perceived to Show Signs of a Rapid Onset of Gender Dysphoria,‚Äù Quillette Canadian editor Jonathan Kay interviewed Dr. Littman about her research. The opinions expressed in this article are those of Dr. Littman and do not necessarily reflect the position or opinions of any institution, organization or company with which she may be affiliated.

**Jonathan Kay: What is the status of your paper with PLOS ONE?**

Lisa Littman: After publication, there was a storm of debate about the paper, and PLOS ONE decided to conduct a post-publication review. The post-publication review was rigorous, and included input from three senior members of the PLOS ONE editorial staff, a statistical reviewer, two academic editors, and an external expert reviewer. The manuscript was meticulously evaluated, and, in response to the resulting feedback, changes were made to several sections of the paper, though the methods and findings remained mostly unchanged. A revised version of the paper is now published along with a republication notice that explains what was changed from the original paper and expands the discussion around several key topics. The original version of the paper is available as supplemental material. Overall, I am very pleased with the final product and [with the fact] that my work has withstood this extensive peer-review process.

**JK: The results from your original version of your paper are identical to the results reported in this republished version. Why was this republication even necessary? To a layperson, it seems that the new paper is just a restatement of the original.**

LL: It was determined that the research needed to be reframed in a way to emphasize that this is a study in which the data was collected from the parents, to expand the discussion about the limitations of parent reports, and to explicitly clarify that ‚ÄúRapid Onset Gender Dysphoria‚Äù is not a clinical diagnosis. Because this paper was of interest to scientists and non-scientists alike, extra care was taken to make sure that certain terms and concepts were not misconstrued by individuals outside of the scientific community. Some of my academic colleagues felt that the amount of oversight applied to my work was above and beyond what it should have been. I felt that my best course of action was to diligently and thoroughly respond, in good faith, to each concern that was raised, which is what I did.

**JK: In your own words, how would you describe the central focus of your research?**

This research explores, through the reports of parents, a phenomenon whereby teens and young adults who did not exhibit childhood signs of gender issues appeared to suddenly identify as transgender. This new identification seemed to occur in the context of either belonging to a group of friends [in which] multiple‚Äîor even all‚Äîmembers became transgender-identified around the same time, or through immersion in social media, or both. The findings of the research support the hypotheses that what I have described could represent a new type of gender dysphoria (referred to as Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria [or ROGD]); that, for some teens and young adults, their gender dysphoria might represent a maladaptive coping mechanism; and that peer and social influences might contribute to the development of gender dysphoria. More research will need to be done to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

**What was the professional background that brought you to this research into gender dysphoria?**

I‚Äôm a physician who is trained in both obstetrics and gynecology, and in preventive medicine and public health. I spent the first few years of my career delivering babies and providing gynecologic care to women, and I spent the most recent decade of my career involved in public health and reproductive health research. I am currently an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences at the Brown University School of Public Health in Rhode Island. Until recently, I was working as a physician-consultant on a variety of public-health projects mostly related to the health of pregnant women (immunizations, smoking cessation, oral health, premature births) with the Rhode Island Department of Health. I am also a mother, a spouse, a daughter and sister who has been extremely fortunate to have healthy, happy and strong relationships with my family. My core beliefs about the importance of family relationships comprise a central part of who I am. Caring about the health and well-being of individuals and families has been one of the guiding principles of my professional and personal life.

**Why did you decide to conduct research in this area?**

I became interested in studying gender dysphoria when I observed, in my own community, an unusual pattern whereby teens from the same friend group began announcing transgender identities on social media, one after the other, on a scale that greatly exceeded expected numbers. I searched online and found several narratives of parents describing this type of pattern happening with their teen and young adult kids who had no history of gender dysphoria during their childhoods. I searched numerous websites, and found only three posting these types of parent accounts at that time. Then, I spoke with a clinician who was hearing her clients describe this phenomenon as something happening in their families. The descriptions of multiple friends from the same pre-existing group becoming transgender-identified at the same time were very surprising. Parents reported that, after announcing a transgender identity, the kids became increasingly sullen, withdrawn and hostile toward their families. They also said that the clinicians they saw were only interested in fast-tracking gender-affirmation and transition and were resistant to even evaluating the child‚Äôs pre-existing and current mental health issues.

I found these stories compelling and heartbreaking. Gender dysphoria has been studied for a long time, and I recognized that this presentation was not consistent with the existing research. I saw that kids, parents and families were suffering, and I felt that I needed to do something to help. If these descriptions of clinicians refusing to evaluate and treat trauma and mental health issues were true, it means that a vulnerable population was being deprived of much-needed mental-health services. As a physician and researcher trained in public health, I knew I had an important skill set and perspective to bring to the discussion. I felt that the best way that I could contribute was to conduct research to better understand what, where, and why this might be happening.

**How did you prepare for this study?**

I reviewed the scientific literature about gender dysphoria and peer contagion and I explored the social media environment around gender and transgender identity. Gender dysphoria has been studied for decades, but, until recently, only two types of presentations have been observed. In one type, called early-onset, the symptoms of gender dysphoria begin in childhood. Early-onset gender dysphoria has been documented in both natal males and natal females. In the second type of presentation, called late-onset, the symptoms of gender dysphoria start during or after puberty. Late-onset had only been observed in natal males until quite recently. About seven years ago, the phenomenon of natal females exhibiting late-onset gender dysphoria first started to become visible. This new type of presentation, largely absent from the research literature prior to 2012, seems to be on the rise. Also during the last decade, there has been a dramatic change in the patients presenting to clinics for gender dysphoria‚Äîincluding a striking increase in teens, with a predominance of natal female teens.

"JustNoSO","t5_3982d","Oh lord girl...  I wish he just ""emotionally"" cheated on me. If you're bored please go back and look at my other posts. Specifically in r/survinginfidelity. He has physically cheated on me with women, men, and transvestites.( Sorry if that's no longer a PC word, I really can't keep up nor do I care)  I wish I was joking. And I wish I could give you a good answer as to why I stay with him other than he REALLY helps me with my difficult teenage daughter.  I think  mentally I already pretty much know I will leave him in the future. Now he's in AA, every single day... At 30. He is broke because he pays for therapy twice a week. I am older than him.  I have my sh*t together (so to speak)...
Only now, after the fact, do I feel like he has my back. Only now do I feel like when he talks about marriage he actually means it.  I actually do feel like he has remorse, yet I don't trust him with a fuck*ng 10' pole but I still believe he is remorseful at this point. Why though is the question...Is it genuine, or is it not? For me it's no longer exciting... it's scary because if he ever got down on one knee I feel like I would say no, or say yes, but not be excited inside....I have always wanted him to propose otherwise.  I feel like it's too late. ",1554077160

If you don't want to experience all of what a medium has to offer, it doesn't sound like the right medium for you.

"BanPitBulls","t5_3d2z7","I think the part about dog bites happening mostly in private spaces makes sense. Also, I‚Äôm not sure how it is in Denmark, but in the USA, quite a few attacks that occur outside of the property that the attacking dog lives on happen when the dog escapes their home or yard. So if a dog doesn‚Äôt need to be muzzled when it‚Äôs on the owner‚Äôs property (which they shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äîthat would be unreasonable), it won‚Äôt have a muzzle on if it escapes from that property. 

I would assume that the biggest impact that muzzling pit bulls in public would have would be related to canine victims. As in, fewer pet dogs would be maimed / killed. Whether or not it makes sense to enact BSL that would mainly protect non-human victims is debatable / unclear. ",1554077161
