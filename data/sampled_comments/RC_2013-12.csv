Unfortunately 3 days before the wedding after being sober for 6 months he decided to have a drink.. Went on a bender and after showing up unshowered with stains on his shirt was escorted out of my rehearsal dinner belligerent and sobbing. He tried to jump out of the car 3 times on the way home and ended up in the icu the day of my wedding. It is the biggest heartache of my life. I walked down the aisle alone. Tear stained cheeks to my amazing husband who met me halfway down the aisle and from that moment on I knew I would never have to walk alone again.","1385856000"

No one agrees with what he did, no one stood by and cheered him on, no one told him to do this. He was just a disturbed gunman like all the others we've seen over the years and was just as much a victim as the women he shot. He didn't just get up one day and go ""ya know I bet people would be stoked if I shot a bunch of women studying engineering"" he was anguished and tortured and got to a point so low and desperate he saw the only solution to his problems as killing a bunch of female engineering students and then shooting himself in the head. If you ask me it is the product of bad attitudes toward men, not toward women. Maybe if he had been able to ask for help, to feel like his pain could be helped with support from others instead of having to be a hero and stand up as a warrior he and his victims would all be alive and happy today.","1385856002"
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There are two reason that I can think of:

1) Sport clubs have a personality.  Club have certain characteristics that make them unique.  Manchester United, for example, has a real comeback/never give up attitude.  This was clearly demonstrated when they had to rebuild their team in the 1950's after the Munich air crash, and when they scored two goals in the last 3 minutes to win the EUFA cup in 1999.  People are attracted to clubs that have an attitude that they admire.

2) Some people support certain clubs because of the players they have.  If someone has a favourite player, there is a good chance that they will support their team as well.","1385856002"

5) Take a brewery tour (these are good ones: http://vancouverbrewerytours.com)
6) The Bloedel Floral Conservatory is a pretty neato place; they've got birds and fish and stuff in an indoor garden

If you have the budget, I'd do food tourism - we've got great restaurants throughout the city, offering a variance of culinary styles.  I agree with previous Redditors; La Tacqueria is great, and so is the Twisted Fork, if you're not looking for fine dining.  

I also agree with the recommend of Brewery Creek on Main Street; I live in that neighbourhood, and stand by their extensive selection of beers.

If you're looking for a night out, Celebrities on Davie Street is a pretty safe bet for a good time. Be warned, though - boozing in Vancouver isn't cheap.

Don't go to Tofino/anywhere on Vancouver unless you're going to have a near guarantee of sunny weather, which is pretty hard to come by. It'll be a waste of time if the weather is crap, and you'll probably have a bad time.

ADD is really interesting, in that all of the people i've met who have ADD experience it differently. I found that for me, I would start thinking of something and slowly fade away from the Lecture going on, then without realizing it, then come back to the Lecture and then realize that I completely got distracted, and Didn't hear anything.

When I was being driven to my Doctors for a Diagnosis, I actually got distracted and forgot what I was talking to my mom about. When i got into the Doctors, I actually got distracted by my thoughts DURING the diagnosis, and came back to them asking me a question that I blocked out.

Mango generally prefers balls-to-the-wall aggression, and so he's frustrated having to adapt to beat Hbox.

They're still going strong for the markets they serve. New websites spring up every day, and so the web evolves. I was just reading about a new website called ""Syme"" which will be a fully encrypted social media site for users who are sick of FaceBook and Google's intrusiveness.

With your attitude a day will come when you're accessing Google owned websites on a Google owned Browser via a Google owned fiber network. And if Google makes a mistake with your account you'll lose everything with no way to even let them know there's a problem.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Fuck, for real? I have two friends that donated their long braids to Locks of Love. Learning this was crushing.

edit: Found this on wikipedia:

&gt;Locks of Love has received criticism for its practice of selling donated hair, rather than using it in wigs as the donors expect. According to the Locks of Love website, some unusable hair (bleached, highlighted, gray, or shorter than 10"") is sold to offset the cost of manufacture of custom-made wigs.

&gt;According to its tax returns, Locks of Love made $1.9 million from hair sales from 2001 to 2006, and took in another $3.4 million in donations. Besides paying for wigs, the money goes to overhead and other costs, including grants for alopecia research. Locks of Love sends the best of the hair it receives to a wig manufacturer, Taylormade Hair Replacement in Millbrae, California, which sorts the selection still further, rejecting up to half.","1385856008"

If it really is just for personal use and practice then I don't see why you would be worried about it. You can't really get in trouble for just showing it to your friends and family. If the copyright holder somehow found out you did this, which they shouldn't if you didn't post it online or at public events, etc. it really isn't going to be an issue. They can't really tell you to cease and desist if you aren't publishing the work anywhere.

Yes, you can film whatever (legal) things you want. You won't get into in trouble if this is for personal use or for telling people you made these films for personal use. 

The only reason that people use Fair Use etc. (which this isn't) is because they want to distribute it in some form. 

You can't really put it in your reel or portfolio though, there are places to collaborate with aspiring writers who will give you their short scripts for free. You are better off making something you can really call your own, even if the first couple don't turn out.

&gt; but when you don't eat meat because someone somewhere is abusing animals just sounds stupid to me.

See, it's not just *someone, somewhere* who is doing this. The meat industry and lobby is *massive*. And of course there are vegans who oppose the idea of generally killing animals, but I don't think that's the majority. Most of them think that you could kill animals (as in hunt them), but what the gigantic meat industry does is wrong. And it's not just someone somewhere, literally *every* meat product you can buy in a regular super market is produced by the meat industry that acts immoral towards animals.

I am not vegan and I don't want to tell you what to eat or anything, but their argument for not eating meat is not that ""somewhere someone is abusing animals"". They do have a legitimate point, whether you agree with their way of living or not.","1385856014"

While it is impressive the buildings have lasted so long that is all they are good for, being impressive signs of longevity. You cannot appreciate their majesty unless they are rebuilt to their original standards.

For example the colosseum, it's just a ruin. It would be far more interesting, and attract a lot more people if it where rebuilt properly. Hell you could even use it for it's intended purpose (maybe less killing Christians though, it's frowned upon).","1385856014"

...

I'm not bitter. I'm really not. It's been a good year for...not being...good. I've finally been accepted to the Evil League of Evil...my arch-nemesis is still in counseling after the beating I gave him. Moist is now the treasurer of the Henchmen Union...they figured no one could grease his palms if they were perpetually damp. 

Of course, the year wasn't without sacrifice.

...

...

These contests...they're nothing but politics, you know, all breaking hands and kicking babies. Whose famine-bomb did you help fund? Whose nemesis did you team up to destroy? 

The entire system of villainy is corrupt! But...not the good kind of corrupt. It's corruption...within corruption. Meta-corruption. The worst kind. Yeah.

And I mean, this contest, it's not just about the money. Well, it's a *little* about the money. It's a lot about the money. But it's also about recognition, about the street cred, all the fame and acknowledgement that comes with Bad Horse's Bridle of Approval.

Of course, there's also the rumor...just a rumor, of course...that the Villain of the Year is also awarded a small sample of Endless Bob's fabled Elixir of Immortality. Just a rumor, of course. But if it were true, just imagine the power that would bring. A supervillain could live forever, or even, perhaps, bring back the dead...

...

...

Well, let's uh, let's check some e-mails. Here's one from...Th3Pen1sMightierThanTh3Hamm3r...looks like we've got a big fan of replacing letters with numbers.

It reads, ""Hello Bil--"" *cough*...um, sorry, still choking on the Wonderflonium fumes down here. *cough* It reads, ""Hello Doctor. I herd u jest got berned by the Eval Leegg of Eval."" Ah, yes, I see the news of my snubbing has already begun to spread. ""I no weve had r differinses in the past, but if u r looking 4 revinj, i may hafe a propasishun 4 u...""

...

...

Uh...sorry, internet audience, I...sort of trailed off there. I'm sure I'll edit that out in post. Anyway, it looks like I may have a way to overthrow this contest's status quo. Because the status...you know.","1385856015"

There are so any poor because the rich pay less and less taxes each year despite having a massive majority of the wealth. There are so many poor because your system is terrible and people can't even get medical treatment without going bankrupt.

There's a difference between having money and politically catering to the rich in exchange for campaign donations.

""Stop repeating the bullshit you've been programmed with and look at an occasional fact and you won't sound so stupid."" That's pretty rich considering you're basically a fox news talking point.

Both Reagan and Obama are right wingers, but Reagan's policies were technically more left leaning. Do you even know about his policies, or are you just repeating what you've been told?

This has been going on since 1991, when the law this notice is enforcing was passed.  But, if it makes you feel better to think of it as a new conspiracy to confiscate your guns, go right ahead.  I guess doing research as to what the law is about is too much given it was challenged in court in 1996 (Richmond Boro Gun Club, Inc. v City of New York) and the court ruled in favor of the city (the case encompassed NY Code 10-301 through 10-310, which, as you can see, includes the relevant section 10-306) and was affirmed on appeal.

Asymmetrical warfare is great for bogging down the enemy, demoralizing them, causing large amounts of disruption with limited resources and guerilla tactics. Of course it played a huge role in many symmetrical wars, but for example, you can't fight Blitzkrieg and attempts to level your country with an informal force.


Two great examples of asymmetrical tactics being used by a formal army are the Winter War and Continuation War. Finland managed to inflict massive casualties on the invading Russians, stopped them and demoralized them, but ultimately the resolution of both wars was the formation of peace treaties in which Finland ceded territory. Finland could have caused serious damage to the Russians if the wars had came to their end without a treaty, but ultimately even though Russian was already fighting on many fronts concurrently they still would have eventually swamped the Finns.","1385856025"

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","A lot of people in this thread mentioned that their fanaticism just decreased over time but my situation is pretty different. I didn't get into kpop until a year or so ago so and I was already a mature adult when I started liking it so I feel like I didn't really get the chance to ever reach fanatic levels of adoration. I remember when I was super into anime in high school, I wanted to spend all of my time, energy, and money on anime and I didn't give any fucks about who knew. As an adult I often get *really* into things but I can't ever let them impede on my daily life. I have adult things to do now. 

With kpop I am super into a lot of groups and I actually like constant flood of rookies because I love new things but I do my fangirling in a highly prioritized fashion. I pretty much just stick to gushing on reddit and occasionally soompi and other sites. I recently discovered that there is a group of kpop fans that meet at my university but I find myself not wanting to be part of their group because they're treating kpop like I treated anime in high school. I would love to occasionally just get together and binge watch all of Infinite's reality shows or try my hand at learning some fun dances with friends but the people I talked to in the kpop club don't know when its time to stop. If that's the way they want to live their lives then that's their prerogative but I just can't connect with people who *live* for kpop like I used to be able to connect with people who lived for anime.","1385856027"

It's an introductory book, aimed at people who have never seen ""real mathematics"". The format of the book is similar to what you'll see in any college-level mathematics book. Not method, method, drill, drill, drill, but rather: definition, proposition, proof.

The author works up assuming little more than a background in basic high school algebra. He goes over the general idea of mathematics as the study of unambiguously-defined objects through logic.

The obvious rational solution is to legalize and regulate all drugs, and treat drug use as the medical problem it is, rather than the legal problem it isn't.  If people want to be drug addicts, let join some program, work a dead-end job for their fix, and have a safe, reliable source that the government can profit from.

If drugs were legal and regulated, a huge portion of the organized crime world would disappear, because they make almost all their money from providing a product that people want, but are otherwise not allowed to have.

Every country that has decriminalized drugs or otherwise made them easier to obtain has seen a massive drop in drug related violence and crime.","1385856028"

The way there was on a super windy road and eventually I fell asleep because it was dark and my high was wearing off. When I do wake up we're in the in-n-out parking lot. Awesome!

1. Santa promotes the idea that someone out there recognizes and rewards good deeds. This is false, good deeds as their own reward, but the act of starting to do their gift-giving just as they're old enough to stop believing should help get that message across. 

2. Kids will hear about Santa from their friends/classmates no matter what, so why not help them take part in the fun of it instead of being the early skeptic? Mystery is magical to kids. 

3. Santa is a safe, loving, neutral character. I have read the sweetest stories (and sometimes heartbreaking, which I hope won't be the case for my kiddo) -- the sweetest stories about what kids will ask Santa for, and confide in him. 

4. Santa draws attention away from that whole silly Jesus in a manger thing :P","1385856031"

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I think others have said it as well, but there is a lot going on here that isn't ADHD.   

Aside from that though, his medication should help - but it isn't a panacea. Plus, even long-acting meds like vyvanse only last so long. And come-down can be a b!#ch: for some people it can feel worse than no meds at all, but be worth it even so. What we need to do is use the medication to help us learn *and then employ* other ways of coping. By that I mean being able to do the things we want to be able to do. He has got to want it. What's more, he has got to be able to see that there are other ways life can be. 

For example, when I take my meds, I can sit here all day and read reddit. I can do it really well and write wonderful, insightful posts. Or, I COULD get up and do one of the million other things I have to do. The medication makes it possible, but I am the person who has to break the habit, you know? Same thing for your man. He has gotten into some bad habits. He has to choose to break them. The medication is the first step. A big, important step, yeah. But still only one step. 

You can't change him, of course. You can only change you. It's an old saw for a reason. You can help him change once he indicates he wants to, but that is it. What you can do now to help your ADHD-related relationship issues:

-  Let him know what is going on with you. We add'ers can be totally clueless about other people's internal processes. He might be totally shocked. Preferably do (gently, respectfully, non-threateningly, not in an ""unburdening myself"" style) it in writing because we forget stuff and miss stuff and it will be good for him to refer back to. I might say something like, ""Hon, there are some things that have been bothering me lately. I am going to write them down and email them to you so we can work it out, okay?""  
- Figure out what you want. Figure out how you can get it. Both with his help and input and without it. For example if you want to be able to go on vacation without having to worry about his behavior toward travel companions or him getting overwhelmed, you could ask him to be sure to modulate his behavior by not doing X,Y, or Z (this is a perfectly valid thing to do). Or, you could decide to not go on vacation with friends and make it a bit more of a low-key affair. Ideally, you would do both. Let him know what you are planning to do, and why. 
-  Get educated on ADHD. You sound really compassionate and patient and like you really want to work through this. More information on the disorder, what it is and isn't, and some tips for living with it can only help. 
- Figure out what you can and can't live with. Is the pr0n a deal breaker for you? Or maybe just the using it while at work? The complete lack of companionship? It is completely fair to have your limits, communicate them to him and expect him to respect them. You may have to help him figure out how to do that - and you should certainly be willing to do so if necessary - but it is absolutely okay to have them, whether or not he has ADHD.  
-  Cut your losses. One of the most helpful things my therapist said to me was that I may never get a handle on the housework thing, and that maybe I was one of those people who should just hire a weekly cleaning service, and that that would be okay. I finally accepted that and called the housekeepers. Cut my stress level in half. Sounds like you have done the same with that one. This may be an extreme example, but maybe he just isn't capable of the type of sexual relationship you need and you should write that one off and go for an open relationship. 

A couple of things: First, like everyone else in the world, he is trying to fulfill his needs. His needs might just be different than your typical ""unafflicted"" person (for increased stimulation but not too much stimulation, for example) You guys have to figure out how he can fulfill his needs while still maintaining your relationship. Just a bit of perspective shift that might help ;) Second….hell, I don't remember what the second thing was.  

Well, good luck!

You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and you're just feeling overwhelmed at the moment, and you are experiencing pressure from your father to believe one thing, and pressure from your youth group to believe another.

See if you can get in contact with someone you trust to talk these things out. The less biased they are towards one way or another, the better. Take this time to focus on yourself and what you think is right. It's scary to try and live without the safety net of a church, but it can be done, and it will help you come to grips with /why/ you're falling into temptation and peer pressure now.

You're a strong enough person to do the right thing, no matter what your situation. Keep that in mind, and don't stress too much. Shit sucks donkey balls when you're a teenager, but even if these years feel like an eternity, they'll be over before you know it and you'll be able to go to whatever church you want without your father breathing down your neck.","1385856047"

Such rules are mainly for the spectators to keep things smooth, and not staring at indefinite pauses. However, there is absolutely no reason to not allow a team to play 4v5. We all have stories of winning games 4v5 in solo queue. Sure, this is fives, and it will be much harder, but the team with 4 doesn't have no chance.

Shortly after the surgery, me being on crutches made sense but as the weeks went on, rumors started that I was just using the crutches for 'attention'. I didn't have a cast, no brace, regular shoes. By about 3 months in, the rumor was that I had never had surgery at all and was just using crutches to be dramatic / get attention. Also as occasionally I would walk across the room or up/down stairs without using them out of convenience, that confirmed I didn't really need them.  I really didn't care that people thought.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Something I haven't seen really mentioned is trades of draft picks. You can have a mediocre team trading a pick to another team to get a good player now, but with them being a veteran, they don't have the longevity to them, and since they have to switch to a new team/scheme, they might not live up to expectations. That negates the benefit of the bad team having the high pick and helps out the good team.

Same thing for draft day trades of picks. You see teams like the Pats trading to move down and stockpile picks, where as you can see those bad teams will be the ones who pay to move up, sometimes just a few spots.

Although I guess this is a specific detail of what falls under a bad front office/bad draft. A bad front office does a poor job of determining value in trades, resulting in a bad draft (and helping other teams have a good draft, which hurts them even further).

Then, when you have such a bad front office, or impatient owners, the front office/coach can get fired pretty quickly. This does nothing to help with stability in the process of building a good team. The new coach and GM can have an entirely different idea of what to do with the team, and need more time in building the team that they want.","1385856053"

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","&gt;Wii U gamepad's main features is playing with two screens 

Xbox One does this with Surface though too. But I guess you're right, considering the system focuses so much on the gamepad since it comes with the system, there is more emphasis on second screen utilization. 

I think for most people this could be a pro as well as a con, though. Developers forcing usage of the second screen just for the heck of it isn't always a good thing and doesn't always improve the experience. But that's up to the individual.  

But again, the others do have this capability. I suppose then the difference between Nintendo and the others is the emphasis placed on the feature, seeing as this capability *coming with* the system is the one thing that sets them apart.


&gt; Off TV play for both Wii U games and Wii games

*Some* games, not all. PS4 will stream *every* game on the system on the Vita, so this isn't unique, or as good as the competition. Especially considering you can be outside your home and play on wifi, whereas with the Wii touch screen controller you need to remain in the house. Even then, from what I've read, it's a max of 30 or so feet.

Also PC has that capability with the Nvidia shield.

&gt;controller itself being touch screen capable just like the DS

Every other method of multi screen gaming I've mentioned (Nvidia shield, Microsoft surface, and Vita) are all touch screen capable, so that isn't really unique.


&gt;The fact that you need an entire system like the Vita or the Surface to replicate this is a joke

That's irrelevant to the discussion, and completely subjective. If we're gonna go down that road, the Wii U having 7 year old tech ""is a joke."" The new Mario not having online play ""is a joke."" 3rd party games looking better on 7 year old systems ""is a joke."" The fact is, the capability exists on the competitions platforms.

&gt;If you can't admit this I feel sorry for you.

Hm, thought we were having a discussion here. If you want to resort to passive insults, we can just stop replying to each other. I have no emotional investment in it, I'm not purchasing any of the next gen consoles any time soon. And I certainly don't have anything against Nintendo, been playing their games since 1990.

The only solution here is that you need to let enamels dry for a few days before touching (I sometimes use the sniff test). The upside is that this can allow for color blending if you do it at the right time, akin to oil paints.

Sherman was actually a great humanist, and one of his greatest quotes is on the danger of glorifying war: ""Young men think war is all glory. It is all hell.""

To be fair, though, Sherman's men did do a lot of burning. The point of the march was to crush morale and help bring about a swifter end to a terrible conflict, and it certainly did that.

"DetroitRedWings","t5_2resw","Every move (almost) by a GM is a huge gamble. Aside from free agent signing a huge name, which isn't always a guarantee (LeCavalier). I judge GMs on a relative scale. Do they strike gold more than they fuck the monkey? Getting Pav and Z late in drafts like he did makes Ken loon like a hockey evil genius. Signing Cleary again now makes him look like a drunk with the wings check book. But what has more upside? Ken's ultimate wins or his colossal screw ups? I would take Ken Holland over any GM in the NHL of I shit a brick of unobtanium and used it to start a hockey club. 

I don't like having Sammy on the team and thought he shouldn't have ever come back here. I can't fault the Cleary signing. Danny had been a proven 3rd line winger with some ability to score and grind through a season game in and game out. Gus was still gonna be there and trough the course of a season stuff happens, guys get hurt, trades come up, Griffs players always contribute to Wings' successes. 

Despite everything I just said, Kenny needs to quit fucking around and trade or cut Cleary and Sammy. If not both, at least one. Make the room we need for Gus and Danny D (next captain). The trial run is over, thanks for everything but it's not working good luck and bye. 

TL:DR, Ken Daniels is awesome, but Cleary and Sammy gotta go. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm writing a term paper but reddit keeps pulling me back. ","1385856066"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc"," My logic was pretty much stated in the last sentence. When a change is possible, we look at what we get or lose out of it. Part of that consideration is what this means for the future. If there was a change put forward, like ""Ban the Bloc Québécois from running for election"" (using an example from my country), the lawmakers would hopefully see that such an action would not bring any benefit, or would make it too easy to continue such actions.

 My main concern is this ""Overton Window"", which seems to be some magical ""scientific"" idea for use by any Libertarian. The Overton Window doesn't really state any limits. It could be copy and pasted on ANY argument, from ""Provide Free Dental Care"" to ""Embargo Corruptistan"".","1385856068"

"UCSD","t5_2r6sq","Let me give you the professor's perspective. Quarters are better--you learn more material. There are basically two types of classes: standalones and sequences. With sequences, you are learning the same material regardless. With standalones, most classes only have 7-8 weeks of material that the professor actually wants to cover. The rest is filler necessary to make it into a full class. On semesters, that means you are getting about 6 weeks of unnecessary material. On quarters, that means you are getting 2 or 3.

Also, in response to:

&gt; Being an engineer a lot of my classes are in sequence and if I miss one, I have to wait an entire year to make it up which makes studying abroad less likely.

This is the same story at a school with semesters, so it's not an argument either way.

It might have been when I called her best friend the next morning and told her that she was brain dead.  It might have been telling my father that his wife would never wake up again.  I'm not sure.  It was a surreal 36 hours.  

   If it wasn't any of those moments, then it was definitely the moment I saw her for the first time immediately after the doctor told us that the brain aneurysm plus the lack of oxygen completely ruined her.  I had seen her earlier that night hooked up to all the machines at a different hospital, when there was still an illusion of hope.  Not going close to her meant not having to deal with my mom being very sick because she was going to get better and there's no reason to get needlessly upset or scared.   I should and control how scared I become. But walking around that corner into her room, seeing her like that.  It fucking got me.  I couldn't hold the tears back knowing that nothing would ever be the same again.  No laughs, no tears, no looks, and no goodbyes.  No goodbyes.  Huh.  No goodbyes, I couldn't have told you then the last time either one of us said I love you to the other.

* 1 loaf Italian or French Bread
* 8 lg. eggs
* 3 c milk
* 6 tsp. sugar
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 1 T vanilla or Grand Marnier
* 2 T butter, cut into small pieces to dot over casserole

Grease 13x9 inch pan. If bread isn't sliced, cut into 1"" slices and arrange in buttered pan. In large bowl, beat eggs w/milk, sugar, salt and vanilla and pour over bread. Dot with butter. Cover tightly w/foil and refrigerate 4-36 hours. (I always do this the night before.) Bake uncovered in a preheated 350 degree oven for 50-60 minutes---should be puffed and lightly browned. (Don't put a cold glass dish into a hot oven.) Let sit for approx. 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

It looks like the most information you're going to get from that one is a behavioral fingerprint, so you can spot the same guy when he repeats the same scam.

My husband had been repeatedly raping my little sister for years. Starting when she was only 10 years old. My mom found all of their emails, with explicit details. He described in detail all of the things he loved doing to and with her. He had her convinced that she was his soulmate and that as soon as she finished school he would leave me and they'd be together. 

I didn't want to believe it. I just sat there in the front yard, reading the emails over and again. It was pitch black outside and a police officer stood over my should, shining a flashlight on the papers for me. ","1385856081"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","There are many different kinds of compression, and different tools that do similar kinds of compression. Let's talk about zip, since it's a fairly common form of lossless compression -- the kind you're talking about.

Everyone here has already described something called dictionary coding, but there's another important type of compression that's done by tools like zip.

A single byte of data can represent 256 different values. English has a 26-letter alphabet, computers have a 256-letter alphabet. Each of the values in the computer alphabet can be translated to a numeric value; an [ascii table](http://www.asciitable.com/) shows all of the different 256-bit values. So, in ASCII, the 49th letter of the alphabet is ""1"", and it looks like 00110001 in 8-bit binary.

What if you had a file that didn't have all 256 different values in it? If the file only had, say, 30 different values, you wouldn't need 8 bits to represent every value, you'd only need 5. You could create a sort of dictionary at the beginning of a file, describing which characters had which binary values, and then for the rest of the file, you could use just 5 bits instead of 8 for each value. Your file would get about 30% smaller, but it would still mean the same thing.

But, most data doesn't have a perfectly even distribution of values. That is, it doesn't have the same number of ""A""s, ""B""s, and ""C""s, and so on. It might have 10,000 ""A""s and only forty ""C""s. So, you can improve the situation even more by saying that every ""A"" will need only two bits -- 01 -- and every ""C"" will need three or more bits -- 101.

This is the basic idea behind Huffman encoding.

This is why some kinds of files compress really well, and others don't. A text file written by a human will probably only have around 70ish unique values in it, and there will be lots of ""e""s and not as many apostrophes. Compression algorithms can squish these kinds of files really well just by re-encoding the characters in the text file. This type of file has low ""entropy"".

But a video file is all binary data. It will have all 256 different values in it, and there's a pretty good chance that the values are evenly distributed -- there's about as many ""e""s as ""1""s and other things. These files have high entropy, and Huffman encoding can't do very much with them.

Which is part of why you can't zip a movie file and have it come out a lot smaller. It's also why you can't just zip a file over and over and over again until there's nothing left -- the first time it's zipped, it becomes a file with high entropy.

edit: most of this is from memory, from ""the Data Compression Book, second edition"", which is still sitting on my bookshelf but hasn't been picked up in a long time. I've also been a programmer, professionally, for almost 20 years, and as a hobbyist for even longer, working on lots of different systems. I've oversimplified some of my explanation, someone will probably come along and correct it.","1385856082"

"introvert","t5_2qlr2","I tend to lean towards the middle of the introversion scale, so I don't get too exhausted juggling a few text/IM conversations at a time. And honestly, and I know it's not fair, it's really important to put in the effort to be more punctual with replying to certain things. Ignoring a few texts that aren't really very urgent, or you know will lead to annoying conversations, isn't a bad thing. If someone knows you well they will know not to be offended. It *is* important to give people heads up about plans and other things like that. Currently I am in a situation with someone who is doing it to me, and even as an introvert it fucking sucks to sit here wondering if she is going to back out of our plans tonight. I know deep down, since I know she is more introverted than myself, that she doesn't mean ill, and that she is probably just exhausted. I just want her to tell me so, because I can't help but worry that she's ditching my plans for other reasons. 

Now imagine that situation for someone who is very extroverted. It would ruin their day. I mean, not every situation is so drastic, and most will not jeopardize your friendships. But if you can get into the habit of just giving a small heads up, something like, ""Hey! Can't talk right now, really busy. I'll get back to you."" it will put their anxiety at ease. I know it seems shitty that *you* have to put in more effort for these sorts of things, but society tends to lean towards extroversion. It's not because there's something wrong with introverts, or people hate us, it's just the way the world works. So we have to try a little harder to maintain our friendships. But in my opinion it's worth it, and it gets easier. And your true, good friends will learn to understand that you need your alone time as long as you let them know. ","1385856084"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was August 2011.  I had just graduated high school in June and I was having an extremely hard time adjusting to the post-high school life.  Throughout the summer, I was constantly worrying about the future.  I'm a computer engineering major, so I knew it was going to be hard.  Will college be too hard for me?  Will I have any free time to see my girlfriend that was still in high school and that lived 30 minutes from my house?  Will I be able to handle the math classes since my high school barely taught us algebra?  Will I have any free time to enjoy my life?  Will I make any new friends?  Working 40 hour weeks after college will never be as easy as bumming around in high school.  Thoughts like this were just flowing through my head from the day I graduated and it was giving me panic attacks.

So to make the story short, that summer was terrible.  For most of June I tried to get a job, but when I was offered one at Home Depot I turned it down because it was 30 hours a week and that felt like way more time than I could handle at that point.  Most of July I just sat around my house on days I didn't go to my girlfriends doing nothing.  I pretty much just looked forward to going to my girlfriends house because she made me not worry about that crap while I was with her.

Well the second week of August rolls around and she breaks up with me out of no where.  She was my first ""real love"" and I had been with her for about a year and a half.  I'm of course devastated and try to work things out with her, but it never goes anywhere.  I spend the next 3 weeks hanging out with my friends everyday to get my mind off of it.  Then college starts at the end of September and all of my friends leave to go off to their state colleges (I was going to community college).

Cue the worst 3-4 months of my life.  Extreme depression.  No friends.  A ton of free time because my schedule that first term was insanely easy.  Almost every waking moment sucked during this period.  A few good things did come out of this, though.  I started exercising to burn some time and to get my mind off of her, which got me in shape and allowed me to continue to workout through the present day.  It also forced me to focus on school.  Because if I was doing schoolwork 24/7, I wasn't thinking about her, which has given me amazing grades.

After about a half a year, I moved on from her.  College ended up being everything I feared (hard work, no free time, little friends), but it doesn't really matter as much now.","1385856088"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Thank you for your response. I did have to look up quite a few things.

My issue is not as much with individual people living there as with the expansion of territory that comes with it. If the people moving there treated it as moving to the territory of another country, and the territory would be and stay under control of e.g. the Palestinian Authority (in theory and practice), with reasonably free passage for Palestinians, I would be perfectly OK with it. My issue is that it looks like Israel is turning it into it's own territory by slowly creating de-facto Israeli soil there, and the settlers (especially the ones creating the illegal outposts that sometimes get legalized later) being a willing part of it.

[Example of what I have issues with](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron#Palestinian_and_Israeli_parallel_rule):

&gt; The Palestinian population in H2 has greatly declined due to the impact of Israeli security measures which include extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian commercial activities near settler areas and settler harassment. 

&gt; Palestinians are barred from using Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare.

This should also address your question about Israeli Arabs vs. Israeli Jews.


I do understand why the wall was put up, but I think that restricting all Palestinians (including the peaceful ones) and forcing restrictions upon them that make everyday life really hard is not justified. If Israel wants a wall, fine - but it should build it on its own undisputed land, not into disputed territory.



My personal opinion is that in the short term, the restrictions and barriers may prevent terrorism. In the long term, they foster it by making Palestinians feel opressed.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","This, but at the same time, I think a lot of PUA techniques not only improve your ""game"" but improve you as a person.

Warning: Wall of text of pure anecdotal experience

Acting confident and being decisive is a skill that's going to help you in all aspects of your life, and I think that's something that everybody should attempt to achieve (unless of course they are truly not interested in but, but it's whatever).

Being witty and charming and funny is something that most people would like to be, and if you like it - keep going with it, obviously. It might take a little bit of extra energy, but keep going through with it.

There are a lot of PUA ""techniques,"" mostly to do with inner-game, that I believe are a core part of (mostly) everybody's goal to work towards and become a better person.

I've always been very, very insecure and needy and clingy and a whole ton of other adjectives, stemming partly from my immaturity and partly from the way that I grew up. I was not confident, I was very clingy and needy, *I was not a desirable person.* Sometimes I told myself that I was perfectly okay with being like that - but in part - I was very, very frustrated that I could not ""turn it off."" Literally the day that I stepped it up, I got my first girlfriend (who I met that same day) and took monumental strides towards becoming a better person, which in turn helped me maintain relationships, develop confidence, which in turn raised my social awareness and intelligence, etc. etc. 

There were always qualities from people who had ""serious game"" that I always desired, but eventually I turned the qualities that I liked into my own, and they became a *part* of my personality. I never had to ""turn them off"" because I only did things that I *wanted to,* and I only became things that I *wanted to be.*

There are many Asians and Turkish etc. people in Germany who call themselves German. Just another American who think America is a unique multi-ethnic utopia.

This is one the few assertions that one can make about Judaism that is universally agreed upon by all Jewish groups, sects, and denominations.

The more complicated question is whether a Jew who does not keep kosher is considered a sinner (or, at least, non-observant). According to tradition, the obvious answer is that a Jew is obligated to obey the dietary laws (they are called ""laws"" for a reason), and this is the position held by Orthodox Jews. Non-Orthodox groups have their own opinions, but even the most traditional will rarely say that the dietary laws are binding in any consequential way.","1385856097"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Please do. You didn't contest my point that for all of their violations they attempt to justify in legal terms.

But that is entirely the point. There is no arbitration process and they can veto measures in the Security Council. 

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean, here. Are you saying that the state can avoid investment arbitration even though it has a legal obligation? Or are you saying that it can avoid having a legal obligation at all?

Either or, depending on what length the state is willing to go to enforce their decision.

&gt;In the former case, you would be wrong. They can't withdraw from the obligation in order to avoid arbitration. Quite apart from the fact that it's never happened, the home state of the alien would be allowed to enforce it with countermeasures or retorsions.

That is completely immaterial to a states ability to do it. What you are talking about is the practical nature of the conversation and discussing how great of an effort it would require to enforce without other nations intervening. That is secondary to the issue of sovereignty.

&gt;It's important to distinguish the words 'enforcement' and 'binding'. There may not be very much enforcement of a law, but that doesn't mean it isn't a binding law which guides behaviour. 

It isn't binding period. It may guide behavior because of the *current* state of geopolitics and the world economy but that doesn't mean it *always* will if it is suddenly in a states interest to withdraw from the process (should they be willing/capable of enforcing this decision). 

That's what sovereignty means. It isn't a right, it's something you have to be able to take and defend.

&gt;Even then, there actually IS enforcement.

Because of the international agreement of *other* states. If a state is able to withstand this then what?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I get what you are saying, but I would like to get my understanding of it out there, if you'd read it. There are proven differences between the brains and behavior of men and women. I am honestly not going to get deeply into that because people spend their lives studying it. But whether you have a male brain or a female brain is decided by the hormones you are introduced to in utero. And it is possible for a man to be born with a female brain and vice-versa. Your chromosomes, I.E., XX or XY is called **sex**. Your brain type, whether it is female or male, is called **gender**. This unfortunately means it is possible for someone's gender and sex to differentiate. 

Now, if your sex and gender doesn't match, you have a strong chance of feeling different - alienated, uncomfortable, alone. You'd want to fix this, yeah? You just want to feel ordinary, like everyone else. It is a horrible feeling to be different. So one way to finally feel ordinary for these people is to change either their sex or gender. **As of right now, it is impossible to change your gender**. That leaves only changing your sex. Well, **you can't change the number of X chromosomes you have either.** So what can you do? You can alter how your body looks so that people see you and treat you like a female or male- which is what you want. You want to be treated like what you are. I don't know if you are a man or a woman, Spreetard, but I'm sure you'd be uncomfortable being treated like the other sex **your entire life**. Therefore, yes, you have a point in saying ""if you need surgery to 'be yourself', it's not who you really are."" Because they don't *need* surgery to be their selves- they *need* the surgery for others to treat them as they *need* to be treated to be happy and contributing members of society to their full extent.

Now, I'm not asking you to change your opinion. Good for you for having a well thought-out opinion, really! But I'm just giving a little perspective from their side. Also, just because someone is transgender **does not** mean they are gay. Men who have women's bodies can be attracted to men or women, or neither. Women who have men's bodies can be attracted to men or women, or neither. Sexual orientation isn't necessarily black and white - but that is irrelevant.

I hope this helps prepare you for the shit storm you may face! Also, fuck any one who believes in that whole ""cis-gender"" crap. It is abnormal for someone's gender to match their sex. You don't need to normalize them. That is no way to accept someone, it is glossing over what makes them unique. Okay, hippie-post complete. Hope this makes sense! :)","1385856103"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","From what I understand is it will get better.  I'm struggling a bit myself, but not because some girl came onto me (heh, that would be interesting), but partly it's torturous trying not to look at anything that triggers you.  I don't know anything about supposed super-powers but I do know that I should feel better knowing I conquered my body and mind.

I was almost to the point of fapping just before reading your post.  Not because I was actually triggered (although I'm a bit on edge right now) but simply because I felt in a mood that would feel better after I had fapped (maybe relieved for a very short period of time until the next time).  Not exactly depressed, not exactly having urges, but a bit on edge and a bit moody.

I think you don't really want to be that guy anymore.  The guy that's always sexualizing every female he sees.  The guy that's into deviant tastes so much that he feels like scum.  You want to be the guy who has complete control.  Where he could take it or leave it, but not have it mastering his very thoughts.

You want to be the kind of guy that does stuff.  That honor's a woman.  That has enough self-discipline to do EVERYTHING in moderation because he knows that's right.

As far as the urges go, I believe they will subside in time.  Maybe they're never gone, but eventually they will be pushed back into your mind, like some strange incident that everyone got all stressed out about when you were 2-4, but all you remember is based on what others told you, knowing that if you thought about it you could probably freak out about it, but also knowing it was way back in the past where you had no control, and you came through it and now it's just a memory that someone else remembers.

There are 80000 more men and women here to support you, if you'll let us.  Go ahead and write several posts and vent how the world is unfair and how everything triggers you and how you're mad or sad at the world because these urges have thus far been controlling you.  But doing so for the simple reason that you want this off your chest so you can continue striving or the ultimate goal.

You're not doing this for super powers, you're doing this for YOU.  You're doing this for your future girlfriend or spouse, for your family, for all of us!

(I don't mean this as condescending) You need to man up! (again I""m not saying this in a condescending way, as I need to do the same thing).  We need to get this thing done, because we're men ( at least I think you are, and even women should 'woman up' :-P ), and we get things done!

I'm willing to bet that carefully timed attacks on the asteroid could get it of course, especially if there is a 75 year timeline and the full force of earth's united forces and resources used to counter what would effectively be Armageddon.

But the Doctor is different, he feels intensely. He is joyous and exuberant and deeply empathetic. In him we have the character that can be both ultra-smart and still wholly won his feelings.

That's literally why alimony was invented.  To help women who need to leave, leave.  Withholding money or even being so degrading as to give an adult an ""allowance"" keeps them financially hostage.

""My mom doesn't have access to the bank accounts or credit cards, but that's okay because my dad earns the money.""  Is fucked up.

&gt; 2

That's manipulating.  The very fact that you pointed out that this ageless 100 year old monster applies to schools that are beneath him for her is sending the condescending message that he's too good for her.  If he applied to actually decent schools and pointed out that he could commute anywhere (being a vampire) is the obvious actually-supportive thing to do.  He might as well have flat out called her stupid.

&gt; 3

""I'm all wrong for you, and I *know* I'm abusing you, but I'm not leaving- *you* leave.  Good luck surviving without **my** money.""  The list even mentions saying 'you deserve this' or 'it's your fault' which applies every time he does something wrong and says ""well there's the door!"".

Abuse is both physical and psychological.  How many women with black eyes defend their men the same way you (and countless tweens) defend

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A bit late to the party, but I always feel that this story is worth telling:

I (a male) was sitting at home with my girlfriend one night and an old friend showed up. This old friend has been a friend of my family for fifteen years, on account of my mother having been good friends with her uncle. I opened the door and she had this look on her face like her entire world had been destroyed. ""What's wrong?"" I asked. She told me her uncle had died. I invited her in and we went into my mother's bedroom (I lived with my mom at the time and we've never really been living room people) and me, my mom, and our old friend of the family talked about her uncle and how much he meant to us. We were only in there for twenty minutes or so while my girlfriend waited in my bedroom. To kill time my girlfriend called her mom and the topic naturally went to, ""I wonder what's going on in there?"" Well, apparently, my girlfriend's mother had been filling her head with things like; maybe I'm cheating on her or trying to start something of a sexual nature with my old friend. So, my girlfriend's mother came to pick her up. When I got out of the bedroom with my old friend and said goodbye, I was surprised to see that my girlfriend had left. I called her, found out where she was, and left to pick her up. When I got to her mother's house, her mother was very accusatory. I explained that my friend died and that I was consoling his niece. I remember one thing that she said very specifically, and I'll NEVER forget it. She said, ""Your friend died? Is that the new excuse?"" implying that I was using the death of one of my best and oldest friends to sleep with a friend of the family. She knew that this was in my mom's bedroom too, as my girlfriend, upon being asked, had explained the situation to her. So... if I WERE having sex or whatever with this person, it would have had to have been in the presence of my mom.

**tl;dr: My girlfriend's mom said that I had been using the death of a friend as an excuse to cheat while my mom watched.**","1385856109"

The Last of Us too - not a hugely significant game as far as I was concerned. It feels like Resident Evil should have been given a nod ahead of it, as that's a game that sparked the entire survival horror genre. Although I suppose the justification for The Last Of Us was more about the emphasis of story-telling on modern gaming.

- Kent County is suburban (WalMarts and Malls with sprawling parking lots), over 150,000 people, with the west end rural and forested again (this is a trend).  

- Washington County is 3 times the size of Kent County with just over 100,000 people.  It is the most rural of the bunch.  Lots of colonial villages, farms, forests, and beaches.  At the very west end is Westerly, where some of the rich and famous galavant around (Taylor Swift and Conan O'Brien live there in the summer).  There's also Block Island, which is like the lower-class, laid-back version of Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket (Christopher Walken, etc).  

- Newport County consists of 2 parts: the islands (including the original Rhode Island), where multi-millionaires, mansions, tourists, and a smattering of regular folk intersect, and the east bay, which is connected to Mass and separated from RI by water, and is rural, farm, and beach.  There are only 80,000 or so people living here, but in tourist season, it jumps considerably.

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","You can't kill a wither with turtles AFAIK, because it only has a 1x4x1 hitbox and destroys everything in a 3x4x3 radius when he gets damage. Having the turtle above or below could be fatal too, since they are not a full block IIRC(unles they still didn't fix it) and the wither would move into ""their block"" and destroy them on a hit. Not to mention the explosions would probably kill it anyway.  
I also strongly adivse against using turtle for any kind of mob farm, they usually turn out to be killing the tickrate faster than anything is not done well (and almost all people do it wrong).

I wonder how much of your pain/headaches are psychosomatic. Meaning that there's psychological suffering that is manifesting itself in physical pain. This is a very real condition and can often be alleviated with some professional help.

You mentioned that you do not have insurance, do you mind me asking where you're from? There are generally low cost/sliding-scale fees and/or free clinics that provide those types of services. I'd be happy to help you find some.

As for being poor, there are so many free places to educate yourself on line. [here are a few dozen of them](http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/11/15/12-dozen-places-to-self-educate-yourself-online/). If you lack motivation to do it, here's a [video I recommend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) to get you going... also you should read [this comment from r/getdisciplined](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?context=3).

As for being ugly and obese, those are your perceptions. Others may view you very differently. Also, there are many people who prefer hairy men and don't mind small penises. Again though, that's your perception and may not be accurate. After all, you have your negative glasses on! 

Also, you aren't alone. You've got me. I'm forever in your corner and you should feel free to message me whenever you'd like and as often as you need. I will always reply ASAP. 

Your plan sounded great but life got in the way. Does that mean you throw in the towel and give in? Or should you say, ""fuck it, I'm going to do the goddamn best I can with what I've got!""... It sounds better to me than giving in and leaving this world as ""an ugly, obese, hairy, small penis, failure"" as you describe yourself... that's not the legacy you want to leave behind is it? Let's friggin change that into something awesome and wonderful! I know you can do it. I've seen it so many times.

Can we please try?

Anne Lamott put it well; ""the opposite of faith isn't doubt, it's certainty"". I am not a student in a educational, go-to-school sense, but I like learning from those around me, to take time to and be a part of the bigger picture not apart from it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;If for hundreds of years your ancestor were not allowed to buy or own real estate based on race (as a physical and social identifier, as in looking at skin color and family to determine it) than today the land will be unfairly distributed in that it will only be in the hands of a certain race (and class).

But that's my point, you cant tell someones ancestry by their race. Most of the living descendants of Thomas Jefferson identify as black if I recall correctly, and you can'tell from looking at a white person which part of the world their ancestors are from, how long ago they immigrated to the USA, how many black slaves are in their direct lineage. You cant tell much about who a person is by looking at their race. All you can do is project onto them what you think their racial characteristics represent. 
Even if you could accurately know someones family history from their race, A person is in no way responsible for the actions of their ancestors, whether those actions were good or bad.

No.  It was... really, incredibly stupid.  Like, stupid on every side.

Nobody represented the actual Bedouins.  Everyone just came out to wank over their own partisan politics.  There was no actual Jewish representation, either, no ""counter-protest"" like you would normally see if an Arab nationalist rally was held in, say, Jerusalem.

The protest went on with standard protest activities for a while until ""five Communists"" decided to chuck rocks at the police.  Nobody knows if those were agent provocateurs (which the Israeli military police have admitted to using, occasionally), or just a bunch of angry Arab 15-year-olds starting shit for the lulz (of which there were plenty) in Hadash (Stalinist-Communist) Party T-shirts.

They also put some cement stuff in the collapsing sides to wedge them up straight again.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt;I think Starting Strength crucially lacks some sort of horizontal pulling movement, i.e. a row.

The impression I get from hearing stronger people talk about this on the Internet is that you don't really need to worry about it at the beginning because you don't get strong enough to create enough of an imbalance to be a real problem.

But frankly, I already started with computer-guy posture (and in 2013 that's got to be pretty common). I don't particularly care if my pecs (lol) aren't what's causing it. And I've discovered that I actually quite like doing body-weight row exercises on rings. (Out of curiousity, why do you suggest a one-arm exercise, in a program full of compound barbell lifts?)

Though I will say that I find this bit from the wiki vaguely amusing:

&gt;How do I warm up properly for my training sessions?

&gt;Rippetoe recommends that you first warmup by doing a few minutes on the bike *or a rowing machine* prior to starting your workout. The idea is to get a general increase in body heat and metabolism (no, not for fat burning). This will help prevent injury, as a warm group of muscles and tendons are less prone to injury. You should also do warmup sets for each exercise, although fewer warmups are generally necessary later in the workout, as the squat and press will get most of the body warmed up relatively well.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A bit late, I think, but reading through the answers made me want to hug so many of you all, and I thought I'd share my own story.
When I was 20, I was going to school and wanted to say goodbye to my mother before leaving the house. She'd been ill for about a week before that, and barely eaten anything during the last few days. And when I knocked on the door to her room, she was completely unresponsive. When I went inside, she was wide awake, but when I tried to talk to her, she wouldn't respond, or she'd reply in a completely nonsensical manner. At first I thought she was ignoring me, which really hurt, because she'd never done that before in my entire life, but then I started to worry that something was very wrong. I tried calling my dad, but he was working. I got through to my mentor at school instead, and she told me to call for an ambulance. I was in shock, and hadn't even thought that I would need to, but I did, and they arrived very quickly, thankfully. It took ages just to get her to go in the ambulance. My dad finally arrived at that point, and we waited together for hours before my mum recieved any treatment. She almost died, and then had to spend months in the hospital to recover. It turned out that it was Herpesviral encephalitis, which is a very rare infection of the central nervous system. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviral_encephalitis) The doctors were optimistic and told us that they'd never seen anyone with as good chances to recover, but also warned us that she might never be the same again. And she never was. Some of the effects of the illness were memory loss and personality changes. I had hope at first, because I believed that nothing this bad could possibly happen to me, and to my family. But I eventually had to accept that my mother that I used to know was gone, replaced by this new version that was so different from what I knew. In a sense, I felt like she had really died that day at the hospital. Thank god for my dad though, he was my support through the entire ordeal. He's probably the strongest person I know.
We're all ok now. Mum is much happier than she ever was before the illness, and has no memories of all the hardships she'd had before. So maybe it's better this way.","1385856125"

Edit: Incoming edit

Edit: I used to be a terrible liar when I was a kid some of the first times I really learned to start lying were due to stupid crap. I forget what happened, but I was COMPLETELY honest about it, and put in a timeout room until I was willing to tell the truth. In there for hours told I can only come out when I am willing to tell the truth. In that time I concocted a decent lie that explained everything and worked it all out. Tell them I am willing to tell the truth now, lie to their face. Get let out and ""Thanks for finally telling the truth"" That was when I learned I SHOULD lie to satisfy those in charge.

So we'd appreciate it if people would stop assuming that the mods of r/ChelseaFC are literally the devil when we just want the sub to have good content and improve, along with getting over this stupid drama, just like everyone else.

I had the shakes VERY bad and I dry heaved every few minutes for days. I also had this weird thing happen where I totally lost my equilibrium. I could NOT stand up without falling over and literally had to crawl where ever I needed to go for a week. Took me a month to get my balance back to normal. This is why you don't want to take your drinking too far. 

I literally just realized I am commenting on the totally wrong post (Thought I was leading up to gauging how bad somebodies withdrawal was going to be up until this point haha) but I'm gonna do it anyways because there is not much good to come if you continue drinking! Honestly man you feeling like you can't talk to her is the disease talking! Your chances of success will skyrocket if you clue your lady in, possible family too, hit up some meetings/support groups, and get a sponsor even!

Something I think you could do though is remove the stroke on the photo (excuse me if you don't have a stroke, it just appears to be one looking at it, however it may be the light) and add a slight drop shadow to the login header.

 Another thing that may look cool is moving some of the items on the menu bar to a sticky footer. This would make the menu less cluttered and you would have more room for other elements such as page icons. As well as this you could add a notifications section to the sticky footer as it would always be visible, thus being an ideal place.

Also if it isn't to much trouble could you give me a download link to the picture behind the ShotBow logo (the higher the resolution the better :D). This is because I am working on a secret project for ShotBow (I am not revealing it yet as it is going to be a suprise) and I think this photo may work well with it.

Everything you have done so far is great and I hope some of my ideas may help you in your further creation of the website!

The guy who refused to train, he'd go to the drill seargent everyday and said ""I don't wanna be here Drill Seargent"", and they started doing his paperwork.

Well, honestly, he did the rest of the program with us, passed everything, we liked him, and we thought he was a giant idiot because he passed everything, cut mustard, and could have graduated boot camp with us.

So when we got back from our final FTX he was still doing things around the barracks(like cleaning), and he was there at graduation, where he watched, and then they put him in a holding platoon or something, we don't know, we went to our duty stations.

Argentina has Mascherano, perhaps the best defensive midfielder in the world (probably third behind Busquets and Javi Martinez).  What they need is a creative midfielder, a Riquelme in his prime or someone like.  DiMaria is too much of a winger.  However, with Gago and Banega coming back soon, Argentina will be much much stronger. 

Evidence:  Nearly all of Argentina's dropped points in qualifying were low scoring matches.

D: Bolivia 1-1

D: @Peru 1-1

D: @Bolivia 1-1

D: Colombia 0-0

D: @Ecuador 0-0

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Pros: 

* You can tailor the system to your NEEDS and your WANTS.  Do you need a monstrous system to do video editing or bleeding edge gaming?  Great.  Want it somewhere in the middle?  Awesome.  Want onboard-wifi?  Sweet. Need aftermarket audio?  Cool.  Don't care about x, y, or z?  Cool, you don't have to.  You get exactly what you want -- for the most part.
* As a sub-point to above:  Aesthetics.  Case options.  Cable options.  Color options.  That kind of stuff.
* Another sub-point to the above: You know exactly what parts you're getting.  No cheap Whatever-ese power supply and a motherboard that's some bulk Foxconn whatever.
* Cost tends to compound as you hit higher end.  Meaning that it's harder to build a system for $400 that's competitive with a $400 Dell or HP bargain bin rig because they save so much on volume buying hard drives and OS.  When you start looking at 1000+ though, you start to see eeking more performance out of the same amount of money.  
* Aftermarket cooling.  'Nuff said.  Whether that's a Hyper 212, a Noctua tower cooler, a closed-loop liquid cooler, or a full custom water loop.
* Pride.  Let's be honest, you can say, ""Yeah, I built it myself.""
* Direct warranties.  You RMA your part to a vendor, or to the manufacturer directly.  This can be a blessing or a curse.  Generally it's a good thing as long as you get good brands.
* You're not tied down.  You do whatever you want with whatever you have.  

Cons:

* You're on the hook for support.  Something breaks, it's on you to do something about it.  You can't just call Dell support and tell them to send you a box and fix it for you.
* Every part has a different warranty.  And it's your job to keep it all straight, and take care of any returns yourself.
* Nobody is directly holding your hand.  You have to go and find help when you need it.
* You actually have to put the thing together.  I find this fun, but it also means you have to spend a day doing it which can be rough.  When something goes wrong during build, it can be stressful figuring out which of the half dozen parts might be broken.
* If you aren't knowledgeable about it, you'll have to learn.  This can be quick and dirty, or long and tedious, depending on what you're doing.  
* See cost compounding in the pros.  If you want to build a 400 dollar system, it's a consideration.  ","1385856134"

The guys under me, and also above me, were some of the best friends I've ever made. That is, the ones that stayed around or were around longer than I was. We all got along because I treated them with respect, joked around with them, brought food in for everybody and generally tried to make the work environment light hearted and goofy. 

Because of this, many of us hung out after work, drank together and gamed together on a nightly basis. I still have these friends to this day. 

I also saw at least one douchebag manager in that place who everyone hated. You can't simply label it in some black and white fashion where front line is good and higher up is bad and evil.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I once found a dead, naked, *still burning* body in the woods. They never found the guy who did it, so it didn't end in jailtime.

**EDIT:**

Due to popular demand, this is the story. I was working at a national park, driving down one of the roads in the park with two coworkers when we saw some smoke near the side of the road. The road was up on a hill about 10 feet above the regular slope so we didn't see exactly where it was coming from, but it was autumn and we assumed someone had flicked a burning cigarette or something like that. We drove up to a little pull-off spot and parked the truck.

While we were walking back to the smoky area, I remember making a joke about it smelling like a BBQ. In hindsight, that was an odd comment to make. Anyway, we walked up and my coworker yelled ""It's a body!"" I looked and saw a large, fat, naked man's body. He was lying on his back, arms out to the side...and he happened to be on fire. That image is basically burned into my brain. For quite a while after the incident, I could see that body in the darkness and I was afraid it would be behind doors I opened.

When we saw the body, we all sprinted back to the truck! We didn't want to give all of the details over the radio to law enforcement because the public listens in on it, so we just said there was a fire and we requested law enforcement assistance. We also had a wilderness fire crew at the park so they responded as well. We all gave written statements about what happened and left the scene.

We found out later that someone reported seeing a guy parked in a pickup truck right where we found the body...about 5-10 minutes before we found the body! That means the guy had just dumped the body and lit it on fire right before we got there!

This was a few years ago, and now it's just an interesting story I get to tell people. Not everyone has found a dead, naked, *still burning* body in the woods!","1385856136"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","&gt; Some people on Wall Street are good at making money from their investors' money, not making money in general.

While the shitty brokers might not make a lot of money themselves, they make their firms a lot of money through commission, fees, and just a general increase in funds. The market could trade sideways for 10 years and the big firms would still make money off of commissions. There are plenty of funds with INSANE MERs.

&gt; Why would you work a shitty job 12h/day if you had enough capital to live from? 

Why do super-millionaires and billionaires have their money in the market instead of just retiring?

&gt; So if you see a 10 dollar bill on the street it can't be a 10 dollar bill, because if it were, someone would pick it up! Markets are, as we all know, perfectly efficient.

Not the same thing, *at all*. Markets aren't efficient in real life, but when the fat cats find a reasonable way to make money off of people's stupidity, and there is low risk involved, the generally jump at the chance.

&gt;  How much would you invest in something that has, say, 90% chance of dropping to zero, and 10% chance of rising 100x? Just as an example.

Not a large percentage of my portfolio, and certainly not a lot of money that I would ever need at a future date given my current earnings (I'm well into the black this year because of smart+lucky investments, but med school is expensive). Some people have put a massive amount of their money into bitcoin based on a pipe dream.

This is the same bitcoin that dropped from $900 to $500 and back up again on the same day less than a week ago.

&gt; just on a whim basically

Just because you've made money (if you've actually realized gain) it doesn't mean that it wasn't a stupid ""investment"". Plenty of people bought Tesla at $110 this year, but plenty of people bought it at $190, and quite a large amount of people bought it at $175 the day before their earning's report. Right now it's trading near $130.

This is a company that actually has a potential to generate money. Bitcoin is a currency not backed by anything real, and it trades based on sentiment (tulips).

Also I don't know if you've noticed the huge influx of Bitcoin trade in the Chinese market. That's basically because *a lot* of the mining is going on in China, and guess what's happening to all those bitcoins generated? They're being converted into tangible money after being sold to people in the US who think Bitcoin is the future of... well, everything.","1385856136"

I suppose to be fair, we could ask if your dad has a valid concern about you being brainwashed. Which I really doubt. Still, might not be a terrible idea to consider if the pastor is basically regarded as totally infallible, unaccountable, and if there is a sense that you are only safe/can be saved by continuing to attend this specific church. That would be bad.

Anyways, there is a huge amount of resources available on the internet. Forums like this reddit, there are denominational subreddits, sermons in podcasts and in transcripts, books of theology you could find online in the public domain or at your local library.

It isn't a matter of intent. If the disparity of force is enough to where you can reasonably justify use of deadly force, it's done. If an elderly women is trying to be knocked out by a young black teen, I think most reasonable people can come to the conclusion that she might just die or otherwise be seriously injured once her head hits the pavement. Just imagine your own grandmother taking a punch to the head from a normal teenager. And it isn't like they are going to be calling her an ambulance.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Here are some suggestions I'll give you.

First there are a lot of great resources here on loseit. You were already directed towards the FAQ which is a great help. In there you will find many tools to help you on your way to leading a more fit life.

Secondly, that's exactly what you should set your goal to be, leading a more fit life. Your mindset shouldn't be that you just need to go on a diet or need to hit the gym for a few months to get the weight off. Can you do that and get results? Yes. Long term however, what you want to do is make a lifestyle change. 

Thirdly, I have always found external motivators to be very ineffective. This is a decision that has to come from within you. If you commit to going to the gym a few times a week it will eventually become habit. It may help to find a friend to go to the gym with, someone to hold you accountable.

Fourth, check out /r/Fitness. They have a ton of resources that will help you with getting into better shape. Personally I started with doing a lot of cardio, my goal was to run a Tough Mudder, which I did last summer. After that I got very into weight training, starting with stronglifts 5x5 program. I would HIGHLY recommend this program to someone looking to lose weight.

Fifth, remember that even if you don't see progress on the scale, every time you go to the gym, or eat healthy food, you are making progress towards your goal.","1385856142"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Orianna, Leesin, Shaco, Syndra

Ori hasn't really been touched since before S2 world champs and every fucking year when worlds rolls around is one of the most contested picks.

Lee is still strong all over the world, and Shaco is making a comeback in S4 from what I can see at least.

Syndra is also strong as a motherfucker, and is starting to get picked up by pros.

The problem with ""high skill champs"" is that League is a not a high mechanics game. Compared to Dota or SC2, so mastering these champions, at least for the pros is pretty straight forward and just takes time. Then once, one person masters that champ, they are stupidly dominant because high-skill champs tend to have a super crazy high potential so that they can still be viable for less skilled players. And once that person is dominant (insec/leesin, faker/ahri, Misaya/TF, any korean AD/Vayne) then it becomes a necessity for other players to learn. Because Riot puts so much emphasis on keeping competitive balanced these champions then get nerfed, or the meta gets changed to to make them less effective.

TLDR; Its just the circle of life at work.","1385856142"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;The EC forces the candidates to focus on the nation as a whole.

[Only 18% of the country lived in the 8 swing states in 2012](http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/11/politics/btn-swing-states).  The candidates spent the vast majority of there [advertising budget](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/) in these states.  To me this doesn't sound like a national focus, this sounds like a focus on only 18% of the population.  The electoral college focuses campaigns on those states where the population is the most evenly split between the candidates.

For perspective, the [70 largest cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) in the US combined have a similar population size.  They come from over 30 different states.
So if we had the national popular vote and a candidate campaigned hard in only the 70 largest cities in 30 different states and won every vote in them all, they would get to 18% of the 50% required.  Yet with the electoral college a candidate that wins just 51% of the majority of swing states wins.","1385856151"

One film I know is bad, though, is *Russian Terminator* .. or at least that's what I think it was officially named (my cover says Russian Ninja.) It's literally so bad it makes for great entertainment as long as you recognise it as terrible. Of course, it doesn't compare to *Clash of the Empires* [(aka Age of the Hobbits or Lord of the Elves)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_the_Empires) which is downright hilarious to watch for what it is. These are no fun at all to watch alone, so I wouldn't necessarily call them guilty pleasures, but I believe they fit the theme going in this thread.

On a more serious note, **Bitch Slap** is definitely in there and **Sucker Punch** as well. It's purely for entertainment purposes. The former having good babes (not gonna lie) and the latter having good music and absurd amounts of fun cliché fantasy/sci-fi/game references (and also short skirts) ..

*Dead or Alive* (follows the video game philosophy of the series), *Ultraviolet* (Milla Jovovich with like 99% screentime) and the whole *Transformers* series - no offense to fans of the original series or anything, but I personally watched it just for babes (the Australian not-showing-off girl is actually hottest of the bunch imho) and high budget action scenes.","1385856151"

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","Various other comments:  (Good page in general BTW, I'm not dissing you, just being pedantic :) )

&gt;Provide include guards for all headers

Identifiers starting with `E` are reserved for the compiler; so using the style `H_INCLUDED_ALPHABET` avoids a clash.

&gt;Immutability saves lives

`sum(xs, sizeof xs)` should probably be `sum(xs, NELEM(xs))`

&gt;Trie

You use `Trie` in examples in various places but don't show a definition for it. If you're passing a tree by value, that could be considered inefficient; and if it's a pointer typedef then I would consider pointer typedefs to be ""Bad"" as there are a few surprises in store for a user who doesn't realize that a type is actually a pointer type.

&gt;Don't be afraid of short variable names

A trick I found is to use names like `ii`, `vv` instead of `i` `v` ; this means that when you search for them in your editor, they all pop up highlighted, without a dozen false positives!

&gt; Explicitly compare values, don't rely on truthiness

Disagree, truthiness is a valid programming concept and if the intent of the code is to measure truthiness , and the code tells the reader that we are measuring truthiness, then we have written good code.

&gt;Always use brackets

These are normally called ""braces"" or ""curly braces""; ""brackets"" means square brackets in C.

&gt;Avoid unsigned types

Disagree; I think the unsigned conversion rules are clear and the signed rules are murky!  For example you can cause undefined behaviour by assigning an out-of-range value to a signed type, but there are no such pitfalls when using unsigned types.

The version of `NELEM` with the cast is bugged, it will give the wrong size if the number of elements exceeds `LONG_MAX`.

The code example using `-1` in a variable that is later used as an array index would be considered ""Bad"" by most ; the language definition defines that the array is indexed by an unsigned type anyway.

&gt;Using parentheses

Come on, there's no ambiguity in `&amp;x-&gt;y` . Using parenthese here is just obfuscatory.

&gt;Don't use switch

Disagree completely; switch is very usable and easy to read.  The only reason I would consider it bad is if you have non-trivial flow control happening as a result of the cases, then you can end up with code that is hard to read.  But it is good in most cases.  I consider it easier to read than a long series of `if ... else if` , you can easily see where the switch begins and ends, and easily pick out the cases.

&gt;If a macro is specific to a function, #define it in the body (minimize scope)

`#define` isn't scoped; if you do this then you should also `#undef` it at the end of the piece of code that uses it.

&gt; Prefer compound literals to superfluous variables

Disagree, I find the ""Bad"" version easier to read in both cases.  As a rule of thumb if you have to split a call to a 3-parameter function over 4 lines then you probably had a better option!

&gt; -Wwrite-strings

This makes the compiler diverge from the C standard, but earlier in the document you advise sticking to a standard.   

In the earlier example, perhaps it depends on how you are using the strings ; it's rare to send null bytes in I/O . If the `write` function will also be called in other places where the data is generated at runtime, it'd be an undue constraint for it to be required to have a null byte on the end.

&gt;Always prefer array indexing

`i` should be a `size_t` here , although you could micro-optimize it to `int` if you knew that nobody was ever going to send a large string to your program (famous last words...)

&gt;use `assert`

This depends on what your code is going to be doing. For throwaway code, sure. But in production code that has a user interface, you really do not want your program to abort and toss up a cryptic assertion failure message. In production code you should have proper error handling for every single case where you would want to use `assert`.  

&gt;avoid void*

`void *` has its place, IMHO. For example, if you're wrapping `malloc`. But ""avoid"" is a fair enough term, I suppose. Liek you, I dislike using it for polymorphism.

One place I use it is for functions that expect an array of char, but for whatever reason you're unable to consistently use `char` or `unsigned char` in the code that calls it. By using `void *` you avoid having to fill your code with casts.  (This is well-defined by the C standard).

&gt; Use structs to name functions' optional arguments

That's pretty clever, hadn't thought of that!   I do program in an environment where sometimes C90 compatibility is important though. But having said that, I use the C99 variadic macro sequence and C99 comments a lot; and as time goes on these enviroments are going to get more scarce.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Thanks, but it more or less says what i thought.  Median rent price isn't a good indicator of actual housing prices in NYC due to the prevalence of rent controlled apartments.  Basically there is affordable housing but you can't access it.  Its usually kept until the tenant dies then the price skyrockets.  For instance I have a family friend who has lived in a rent controlled loft in soho 2br 2bath for 1k a month since the 1960s.  When they do pass, the space will jump to 8-10k a month if what happened elsewhere in the building is any indication.   Obviously this is anecdotal but it isn't a unique experience.  Read this article for more info.  

http://www.businessinsider.com/the-8-reasons-why-new-york-rents-are-so-ridiculously-high-2013-7

According to the article the median market rate for rentals in nyc is actually 1550/month and the average rental price in NYC recently climbed above 3k a month - more than triple the national average.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, that's the thing. For a lot of people, it's not easy. Even if they recognize it as an attempt at conversation, which they often don't, they may have no idea how to proceed with a conversation, even if they wanted one, which, again, they often don't, and don't get why you would want to, either. 

Imagine someone you barely know handing you a three-page form requesting a full medical history of your cat. This is in no official capacity, the person has no expertise in cats, and you don't even own a cat. While they stand and stare at you expectantly, you are thinking, ""Why the hell do they think they have a right to expect me to exert myself to dredge up all these details, which I can't, as if it were any of their damn business, which it's not, even if it applied to me at all, which it doesn't? What in ruddy blazes is going on here?""

But you've been taught good manners, so instead of telling them to bugger off, you politely explain that you don't have a cat, trusting that will be the end of it, and hope that the busybody goes away. Instead, there are shocked gasps and concerned looks from all and sundry. *Why don't you have a cat? What happened to it? You've* ***never*** *had a cat,* ***really****? But surely, you must have... no? Well, what have you tried to get one?* . . . and so on.

This doesn't happen just once. It's regular occurrence. Over time, you come to accept that you are going to be handed the forms and asked the questions over and over, but you never really grasp *why*. You try asking people why they would want to know these things, and they just get indignant. *How else are people supposed to begin regularly exchanging detailed medical histories of their cats if one of them doesn't do it first? It's not like it's* ***hard*** *.* 

The people who do this are ever-present, and never seems to question the idea that this filling out and exchanging of excessively detailed questionnaires is a necessary or even a good thing. They just do it, and expect you to go along with it, always.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt; It's pretty silly of you to complain about me quoting partially, when you do the same. Highest velocity and highest armor still takes you a long way, in addition to the DPS.

As I said, Prowler has the highest DPS, and Vanguard is heavily penalized for missing shots because of the long reload. And missing happens more often when the Vanguard has to move over terrain. Magriders have more consistent DPS, but their velocity is slow and projectile gravity is rather high. Both could use some tuning. 

They overnerfed the Magrider, but it is still strong at longer ranges because of the mobility and evasion, Prowler is strong because Lockdown, Vanguard is strong in close range engagements when the enemy can't run. But how often do those happen compared to long range standoffs, where Mags and Prowlers have the advantage? 

&gt; However, due to the NC and TR overabundance of ridiculously cheesy and effective AV-weapons

Please show me that effective AV weapon the NC MAX is supposed to have. Falcons are a joke after the massive nerf, Ravens are too slow and limited, and Pounders have always been broken. The only viable AV/AMAX weapon other empires have is the Fracture, while Comet is death for any MAX or vehicle at close/mid range, and there is no defense against Vortex sniping. Those I would consider ""cheesy"". 

&gt; I had a fully certed Vs MAX long before the ZOE was released, and posted several videos of me massacring dozens of opponents, in an attempt to prove how useful the VS MAx was, despite it being widely regarded as weak.

VS and TR always had the more versatile MAXes, while NC had their close range niche (with some exceptions). And because VS/NC couldn't defeat the NC MAX in its niche, they thought their MAXes to be weak instead of playing to its strenghts. It took the ZOE and the Fracture to make them use their MAXes in numbers.

&gt; It's actually not that huge of a difference. And of course we will have more kills in total, if we have more MAXes. What kind of argument is that?

If one faction has their unit type used far more than the type of others, it means that the natural counters are not working as good as they should. The natural counters to MAXes are C4, dumbfires and AV MAX weapons. ZOE is far harder to nail with the first two, and only the Fracture is a serious threat to them.

&gt; The NC and TR MAx are also practically straight upgrades. 

No, they are not. They are slow, huge targets, C4 and rocket magnets and have limited range. The ZOE, on the other hand, is faster, more mobile and has more health and firepower than regular infantry. It completely eliminates the disadvantages of being a MAX.

&gt; If you're going to say that the NC have better K/D, because they have better pilots, then you cannot possible dismiss that the VS have better pilots, because we had a better K/D pre ZOE.

Last statistic that was discussed here was that NC were dead last in K/D on every server. I'm talking about MAX statistics, and as I said: Longer range allows the VS/TR to have higher KD (pre-ZOE) than close-range NC MAXes, which are far more vulnerable to C4, dumbfires and tactical nades. They were just underused.","1385856166"

Now, pot, pills, and hallucinogens were common in my school and cocaine and heroin were around to a much lesser degree.  But nobody, and I mean nobody, did crack.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I've spent a ton through Gyft and I do love them. But, to be fair, unless you are actually gifting the cards to other people, it's kind of a hack. A stepping stone to bigger and better things with Bitcoin. It would be far more convenient to pay directly to the merchant via Bitcoin.

And there are occasional headaches. Like the time I ordered $1,000 worth of custom framed art from Art.com, only to find out they only allow 1 gift card per order. And Gyft only sells $300 gift cards for them. Which meant laboriously breaking my order up and paying a little under or a little over for each order.

I can't wait until all these merchants can accept Bitcoin directly! Maybe Gyft needs to inform them of how many people are buying gift cards for their stores via Bitcoin.","1385856172"

I'm gonna get fired from my 1,000,000/year shilling job...if..you..just...posted...my..history..,of...defending...Feinstein's...politics.   

Actually there was no projection in my previous post.  I'm pretty sure you have zero corporate or big business experience.  Maybe fast food was a little over the top.  But still.  

So to sum: you accuse me if being a shill for not just Feinstein but for all liberals despite having not a single shred of evidence.  In other words; just another typical /r/conspiracy jackass.

Gems such as the cheese monster &amp;quot;Eurodans&amp;quot; and the latin disco-fuelled edit of Jacko's &amp;quot;Can't Help it&amp;quot; under his Tangoterje edit-moniker instantly made industry types and clubbers alike go bananas, and whatever the 25 year old Norwegian puts his fingers on, it always comes out with that crucial blend of musicality and playfulness.

Your team can't score if the other team has your flag. So instead of blocking for your own team's FC (flag carrier), or defending a base that has no flag in it, GO CHASE! I ran around for minutes at a time evading 3 opponents, plus having to evade 2 of my own team because they decided it was better to follow me around and block for me than return our flag.

Also, some disagree with me on this, but:

Your team's FC always has the right of way. So if both you and your FC are about to run into each other, move out of his way. It's more important that he continue evading than that extra second of you having to re-accelerate to keep on moving the way you intended.","1385856173"

Also:

&gt; In the 1960s and ’70s, Led Zeppelin’s tough negotiations with record companies and concert promoters helped transform the music industry. Now the band is poised to make a change to the industry’s latest hot sector: online subscription services.
&gt; 
&gt; The band is in negotiations with a number of subscription services for the right to stream “Whole Lotta Love,” “Stairway to Heaven” and the rest of the band’s classic catalog. If it does reach a deal, the band — one of the biggest-selling acts in history — could help legitimize the subscription market, which has been slow to build a large customer base.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Led Zeppelin to activate streaming rights for their catalog,” a spokesman for the Warner Music Group, the band’s longtime record label, said in a statement. “We’re supportive of the band’s discussions with W.M.G.’s streaming service partners to create a window of exclusivity to maximize the impact of this launch.”

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was working as an advocate in a public interest law firm. I had a client who was a brilliant college student on home for break, and being from an under-represented background, he was picked up for drinking, jailed and found hanging but alive in his cell next morning. That's when he entered the disability community. I met him nearly fifteen years later, dumped/abandoned in a psychiatric facility, no wheelchair or communication board. Turns out this guy was going to be worth a few million in with a final pay-off from lawsuit. The public guardian had eyes on that money and my client just would not die. While we were attempting to get a guardian change, in the dead of night, they smuggled him to a rural nursing home five hours away. I worked at a public interest law firm where my fellow employees and I reported our ED for harassment. We were all fired or forced out. Unbeknownst to me, no one took over my cases. I got a call from a volunteer advocate in the town where the nursing home was. it was five months later She was crying, saying my client was starving, and that the law office was doing nothing. I searched court records, found his family had been purposely cut out by the guardian. i tracked them down and they got him moved here. He died three days later. I went to the wake and it broke my heart to actually experience murder by greed and apathy. Fucked me up for a while, then taught me to never, ever trust someone else will handle a crisis on behalf of a person with a disability when there's still something I can do. ","1385856173"

My dad was not the kind of guy who would pay a vet to take care of an animal that he couldn't bring home and eat or put to work when it was well.  I think he probably just turned it loose in the woods and it died of natural causes.  At least it didn't get run over.","1385856177"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","a) You're still not giving names. And what does this have to do with the unaccounted for Pentagon funds?

And to be clear, you were using these unaccounted for funds as proof that these people are connected to 9-11. That makes no sense if these things happened before 9-11.

Your link doesn't even mention the word ""lobbyists"", so I don't know what you mean by that.

d) Iraq earns money from the sale. And you don't think access to oil is important? Wars have been started over that. If you're thought process is ""X benefited from Y ergo X caused Y"", then China was clearly involved.

Besides, you know Exxon Mobil had to pay for those fields to begin with.

e) None of the accused hijackers were Iraqi. If the goal was to create a reason to invade, why not just make a few of the patsy's Iraqi agents?

Occam's Razor is getting dull here.

&gt;Maybe you're [sic] memory is weak but Saddam was intially targeted for supporting Al Qaeda which caused 9/11. When that claim did not stand, human rights and WMD came into play.

I think you're mixing up the chronology here.

&gt;Your question was related to semantics.

No, I'm just demanding that when you accuse individuals from a pretty specific profession of doing something, you should name at least a few of the accused and state how much they made.

But fine, you finally named someone you think benefited from 9-11, Exxon Mobil. It's kind of vauge, since a lot of people work there, but it's a start and it's better than ""Hey, some people at the Pentagon are corrupt so that means 9-11 was an inside job.""

So, who in Exxon Mobil was involved in 9-11 and/or the alleged coverup?","1385856180"

I decided to finally ask her out after midterms. This was a huge step for me, even though I'm college, I had never asked anyone out before due to my introversion. But I felt like I had a good chance since everyone was telling me I'm missing the hints she's been giving me. So after I got assaulted by my midterm I asked her to grab some lunch at our campus dinner. Once we finish complaining about how ridiculous that midterm was, I decided to ask her out for a dinner and a movie. Turns out a guy in our class had asked her out a few days ago. She felt so bad about it and tried to apologize and told me I should have asked her earlier. Apparently she did like me and I'm a complete dumbass for missing all he hints shes been dropping. I tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal and that I was cool with the situation. This was the first time I ever got rejected in anything. Completely changed my mood and mindset for 2 weeks. I lost interest in everything, I didn't show to class for a week b/c the guy she's dating would sit next to us and it drove me insane. It's been a month and I'm still hating myself for not asking her out earlier but I can't do anything about it because she seems happy with him.

That means you only really bother with knowingly unwarded lanes, pushed lanes, and counterganks till 6. On a champion like Vi the only time I would gank for the sake of ganking is when I plan to back to get major item, or obviously if ult is up since getting it on cooldown with a kill is how you play Vi.

But how poorly they work, and how often they inexplicably change, shows that they don't really take privacy seriously at all, and it's even reflected in their mission statement.  So why on Earth would you choose to trust someone with your privacy when they've continually made it obvious they don't care about your privacy, and would rather you not have any because it makes their advertising more effective and their company more profitable?

As far as your faith is concerned, the very fact that you're concerned it's disappearing is actually a great sign that it's strong! If you weren't worried that it was going away, that'd be a lot worse.

As your 'dark side' is concerned, remember that you're completely covered by what Christ has done for you! There's nothing you can do now that will separate you from him. He loves you so very dearly and that love is unchanging. It doesn't matter if you do the worst things you can imagine, he still loves you as his son.

There's definitely a need for community though as a Christian, that's a very real need for growth. Do you have phone numbers or anything of the youth group people? Any of them go to your school or anything?

Sadly, it does. I tried, just like you, to build a team without Politoed (I wanted to play UU) - it never worked. In this one turn to just set up the rain the opponent has one free switch, hit, hazard, boost, whatever.  Plus the lost itemslot if you use a damp rock...

Poetry has some value, and everyone should read some of it.

That seems to me to be true in a world where time is an infinite resource, since you can say that about everything.  Underwater basket-weaving has some value, and without any additional constraints, it provides value for everyone to do it a bit vs. not at all.

But the real world has massive time constraints, so I'd ask you to refine your statement to include *what we ought to prioritize poetry above*.  With time as a constraint, is poetry more important that some level of math?  Or literature?  That's really the key question in my mind.  For example, if you said that you think poetry ought to be prioritized above algebra, I'd consider that to be a very contentious statement.","1385856196"

"solar","t5_2qq8l","What do you think about these larger projects (even in their enormity we still have yet to break 1% of US energy usage) value in helping to bring cost down via the volume of hardware needed for them (and all the infrastructure that comes with it) and their PR value? Truth was - residential PV wasn't moving along all that hotly (and reality is - the majority of 'residential' PV today are solar leases which ARE NOT residential PV as you are arguing for in this post) and needed the broader industry scale to help.

The grant was another tool to help business (obviously) - but it was just an accelerated tax return in my mind (with a couple of fewer rules).

Yes - site of use installations are better, but truth is, the tools to roll them out seem not there (except for Solar Leasing through the big boys of course - but my opinion is that not enough benefit trickles to the customer).

In terms of the USPS it is domestic. The only issue is the distance, which depending on where you are shipping to and where they ship from is much closer than many states, specially states like Alaska, or Hawaii --unless you are in the continental US West coast.

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","&gt; I know enough that it involved a lot of redistribution, government spending, public works... 

Lets be clear, in developed countries, I absolutely support these, and oppose laissez-faire economics. At the same time, I would argue that for a poor nation, laissez-faire as a means to attract foreign investors makes sense temporarily, until basic urban infrastructure has been built up (at which point, the government should step in and artificially redistribute wealth).

I see why you find the economist's data unconvincing, so here is HDI (Human development index, it measures access to education, life expectancy, and income) for several countries. China, India, and Bangladesh are shown to illustrate the massive growth which the above process (outsourcing in laissez-faire conditions followed by the creation of government regulations to redistribute wealth) produces. The US is shown for comparison, and to illustrate that outsourcing did not cost the first world. Hungary and Greece are shown in response to criticism levied against HDI in a different thread, which pointed out that Hungary, despite being in a state of economic collapse, somehow had a high HDI. As you can see from the graph, Hungary's de-regulation-induced crisis and Greece's austerity induced crisis are both shown on the HDI graph as stagnations in HDI or drops in HDI, so HDI is an accurate indicator. Hungary and Greece's high status simply reflects the fact that both were very prosperous before their crises hit). Africa is not shown because the AIDS pandemic dropped HDIs even in prosperous nations like South Africa, and serves as a major confounding variable. http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kthk374hkr6tr_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=indicator_103106&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:1603:7703:9003:9203:4103:22103&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false


In other words, the data shows that 

1: If you are in a poor country, implement laissez-faire to attract foreign investment and urbanize (though it may also be wise to restrict the ability of your people to leave, to prevent brain drain. I am willing to discuss this point further if anyone wishes).

2: If you are in a rich country, implement regulations to redistribute wealth to your lower class.

If the above process is followed, steady growth and good conditions result. Deviations from the above process (poor countries trying to regulate, like Zimbabwe or the PRC under Mao and under Chang Kai-Shek before, or rich countries like Hungary or Russia in the privatizations trying laissez-faire) almost always end in disaster, though there are a few exceptions like the USSR, which went from poor to rich with little foreign investment (which is why I find the Soviet Union so bizarre and fascinating, it broke the normal laws of all economics somehow... though AkivaAvraham argues below that they did in fact get foreign investment. Sadly I cannot find statistics for how widespread this actually was)","1385856201"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two years ago my dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He went through two rounds of chemo before they deduced that it was probably best to remove his bladder and prostate. He went through the surgery, and it was classified as routine. He spent the next day in the ICU and his vitals were very low. For a few days he didnt really show any signs of improvement but we were hopeful. Afterall, hes a tank of a man, and only 53 so he had alot going for him. It turned out that one of the stitches inside of him had popped, and the artificial bladder they made for him wasnt functioning. Because of where the hole in the artificial bladder was, all of the bacteria wed normally expel by using the washroom was all over his body and he became severely infected. 

Which brings me to the two scariest moments in my life. At about 5am, I got a call from the overnight icu doctor telling me my dad was not going to make it and that he had put me down as his emergency contact.  I wasnt aware of this but he later told me that he knew I was the only one he could count on. He told me that I was strong and that he saw alot of himself in me. I was then left with the task of getting in touch with my mom, his new wife, my brother, my grandmother, my uncles and aunts to break the news. 

Fast forward to later that day. The doctor tells us that since they located the issue( but that damage had already been done) there was a chance that going back in to clean him out could save his life, but that he likely was too weak to make it thru the surgery. They gave him about a 10% chance. My dad, awake at this point, with a feeding tube down his throat that rendered him unable to speak asked for a piece of paper and looked right at me and asked me if he should do it. I hated that my answer dictated whether or not that was the last conversation id ever have with the man who taught me to be a man. I told him he had to. 

The scariest moment of my life was when I realized that I might have to finish growing up in a world where my foundation was gone. 

Which brings me to the happiest moment of my life. He woke up, and a year later is still recovering. Talk about being fucking alpha. Fuck i love that man. ","1385856204"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; 1) You have already discussed decoherence in depth as an approach to explaining the appearance of wave-function collapse.

I presented decoherence as a way to understand that wave functions of sub-systems with entanglement can take the appearance of classical probability distributions. Full stop. The actual apparent collapse of that into a single value perceived by the experimenter is left as an unexplained axiom, the so called type (3) rule in my original long post.

&gt; Decoherence is currently unfalsifiable in the same sense that ""many worlds"" is unfalsifiable.

I take ""decoherence"" to refer to the fact that wave functions (actually density matrices, but whatever) of sub-systems do not show the same kinds of interference properties as the pure states of the full closed system. Full stop. It that sense it is an irrefutable notion as it is a mathematical result of Schrodinger's equation. As I pointed out in my original post, this comes *close* to explaining our perceived classical world in that we can see probability distributions arise out of pure unitary quantum mechanics, but it does not explain our actual experimental results. Again, this is why I insist that quantum mechanics, and in fact *any* theory of physics, requires a type (3) rule to dictate what we humans should expect to actually perceive. These type (3) rules can be completely bizarre. The only requirement is that they yield a self-consistent theory.

Am I explaining this point of view clearly? Could I trouble you to read my long post again?

&gt; 2) The measurement problem is, despite being not ""science"" in your technical science, certainly looms large as an important and famous problem in ""physics,"" whether you like it or not.

Agreed. I definitely think it's important to discuss in general and in /r/askscience. I only meant to say that once we arrive at a discussion of why we actually perceive we have to be careful to make clear what are the axioms and what is logical result of those axioms. Again, this is why I separated my type (3) rule out as its own axiom.

Some of our discussion here seems to be fed by different notions of what a few key words mean. I hope this post has helped clarify my own perspective.

I much enjoy this exchange.","1385856207"

"uwaterloo","t5_2rb5s","I know that it's reasonable/legal to ask for last months rent at the time of lease signing, but I've never paid first months rent until I moved in. I wouldn't be comfortable giving a landlord 2 months rent at once, especially before I've moved in, but that's just me. 
Here's the city's guide for renters:
http://www.waterloo.ca/en/contentresources/resources/living/guide_to_rental_living_complete.pdf
And here is a direct quote from this PDF about what your landlord can do:
collect a rent deposit – It cannot be more than one month’s rent, or if rent is paid weekly, one week’s rent. This deposit must be used as the rent payment for the last month or week of your tenancy. It cannot be used for any other reason, such as to pay for damages. A landlord must pay interest on the deposit every year.

There is a service on campus where you can submit a potential lease agreement and have someone critique it. Groups I have lived with in the past have done this and as a result we ended up not signing a lease for a place we liked because it had some shady things in the agreement. I can't recall the name of this service but I'd assume you can find the link on the OCH webpage. 
My own personal advice is to trust your gut and know your rights and don't do something you aren't comfortable with. ","1385856207"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; So the only thing that makes it not ok to kill things is humanity? So, am I ok to buy a sniper rifle and shoot all the barking dogs in my neighbourhood from my rooftop? Can I do that, by your rules?

Maybe I simplified my answer too much, what I'm trying to say is that we just have other rules for human beings. Snipering a human is seen totally different than snipering a dog. I'm not saying you can kill all animals like you want, I'm just saying that you can never kill a human being.

&gt;And, if my girlfriend is getting raped in an alley, and I happen to find a large solid pipe, can I hit the man in the head with it? Or is that not ok, because he has humanity?

Point taken. Self defence is one of the few exeptions.

&gt;Also, what is the definition of humanity? Is it simply being human, or are there other characteristics, in which case, what are they?

Nope, that's it. It starts with a fertilized egg and ends with brain death. What happens when we make contact to higher aliens or invent a high artificially intelligence is of course another question.

All I'm trying to do is make you admit that the lack of self awareness is not a good reason for killing a fetus because animals are self aware (at least in the same sense a baby is) and we kill them nonetheless.","1385856218"

&gt; 
&gt; -4. Nazi Germany had one of the largest public welfare programs in history, based on the philosophy that all Germans should share a standard of living. 
&gt; 
&gt; -5. The Volkswagen. No explanation needed.
&gt; 

&gt; -6. While not originally conceived by the Nazis, Hitler was an enthusiastic supporter of the Autobahn, the first freeway system in the world, and pushed for the largest network of roads to be built across Germany. Thousands of countries have emulated the system Hitler put in place, including America and Britain.
&gt; 

Pretty ridiculous. I love the 'No explanation needed,' which is apparently true for the others also as they don't stand up to scrutiny (excepting perhaps the anti-tobacco campaign). Hitler's shit regime did a lot of things and was pretty thoroughly repugnant and evil whatever the consequences of their policies. For instance the public welfare wasn't very inclusive of all Germans (and they went about changing who was a German afterall).

But but but the nazis they had firefighters and sometimes their police stopped bad people. Give me a break. ","1385856225"

"rugbyunion","t5_2qkbe","To be fair, we made a lot of progress this autumn, it's just not the type everyone likes to see on the scoreboard. We had injuries to 3 world class players and now we have developed some serious depth. Scott Williams could probably start for any home nation and now he will go back to the bench. Samson lee came on today and immediately we turned the scrum from struggle to IMO dominant, even if Barnes didn't think it was legit. There was another when we got a nice drive after he was on too - he will replace Adam eventually, but rhodri looked great in the lose in the other games, suddenly we won't crumble in the scrum when the subs come on in big games, and we can rotate the older props to keep them fresh in tournaments. 

Owen Williams and Corey Allen will have learnt a lot and now we can watch them develop - Williams defence was poor today but you don't get a harder test as a defender than Australia so he will be better after it. Got rhodri Williams on and he looked ok, Lloyd was shit vs tonga so now we know our back up 9. 

Other than that, we played much more open rugby when possible, the tries vs Argentina in particular we ran from deep when there was space, and pence got involved in the attacks much more. North has started attacking more in open play instead of just coming infield. 

The fact is, you put those 3 players we lost back in today or the Boks and Wales can win those games, I genuinely think today if Roberts and JD were the centres out defence would have been 1 try better, and that's the winning margin, but at world cups injuries happen, so you need to have players with experience to fill in and we have that now at least. It's also worth saying that a month ago we probably would have won that game but Australia and Folau in particular have improved so rapidly that they are unrecognisable from the early games of the tour. They deserve the 3rd ranking. 

Oh and finally we did win 2 AIs so we broke one bad streak, and I'm quietly confident about the 6N - we have 3 home games this year after all, and we start against Italy - so maybe we can set a good record for once in getting 3 6N wins in a row. I'm going for 6.5/10. ","1385856225"

"nyc","t5_2qhu2","A few reasons: first off, the way that the system is constructed, even if someone wanted to decide 'no more pensions'! the people in the system already would be entitled to one. They pay in. With a few exceptions, pensions are not free, and are funded by employee contributions. So you can't wake up one day and take that away. You can gradually decrease what's given new employees, but the current ones will still collect. 

Secondly, for some jobs, deciding to work in the public sector means that you will never, ever be wealthy. While some jobs have no equivalents in the public sector (like the guys in the NYT article), the city hires doctors, lawyers, engineers and other people that could, in the private sector make far more money. 

Third, and this relates to the first and second one, people decide to take a civil service test, and devote their lives to public service, in part because of the benefits. When the economy is good, some of those jobs go begging. Not everyone wants to spend years driving a city bus, at midnights, with Tuesday Wednesday off. And when the economy is good, someone with a newly minted law degree can make far more at a legal firm than being a city lawyer. So, one of the carrots used is a pension. Obviously when the economy sucks, more people are willing to work in the public sector, at all levels, but when there are more attractive job options, something has to be used to entice potential employees. 

City pensions are organized by [tiers](https://www.nycers.org/). Every few years the tiers become less attractive. Some people think that eventually there won't be a pension system, and instead there will be some sort of mandatory 401K system. But before that, the current tiers are nowhere near as generous as some of the old ones, as far as age at which you can retire and percent of your final salary you will collect. 

The oldest tier, Tier 1, did not require any contributions, and allowed people to retire after 20 years, regardless of age. That tier is long gone, and the people left in it are all about 63 years of age or above. The current tier, 6, is far more stringent, as far as collection, age at which you can retire, and contribution rate: https://www.nycers.org/(S(p2yqhifentta4g45fvtso355))/Pdf/forms/993.pdf


There are some very dedicated and smart people in civil service in NYC. And you want that, for the next 9/11, Sandy, Zombie Apocalypse, etc. Clearly defined benefits for the people who do the work a large city needs, is a good tactic.

At 50 points you can fit in damn near everything you need to take on anything.  This is nice as the game comes down to who is the better general rather than being blindsided by a nifty new tactic, or not being prepared for a deathstar.

I prefer 35 because its far more challenging in that regard.  You REALLY have to think about what you are bringing.  And then you really have to think about what you are doing on the battlefield.  You don't always have all your bases covered at 35, so you really need to play smart.

The new Kinect allows you to navigate with voice commands and uses facial recognition to log into your profile. Because of all the NSA leaks, normal people are rightly concerned about gov't intrusion into their private conversations, while the conspiracy people (to grossly generalize) seem to think this the coming of 1984.

The result will be that lots of these game consoles will indeed sit in people's homes, a very very few will be used to monitor people directly, everyone will have more data about them generated for marketing research, and ultimately nothing important will happen.","1385856228"

"GreenBayPackers","t5_2qqd2","Chris Banjo (S) - He's a camp body. It might be worth seeing if he can make the 53 again.

Evan Dietrich-Smith (C) - He's been solid and worth keeping around. 

Jermichael Finley (TE) - The real question here is wether or not he is even able play football again. 

Matt Flynn (QB) / Scott Tolzein (QB) [RFA] - Bring them both to camp and have them battle it out for the number 2 QB spot. The bottom line is we need a reliable veteran behind Rodgers. I would also like to see TT look for a QB in the draft to bring in and develop. 

Rob Francois (LB) - It's time to move on from him.

M. D. Jennings (S) [RFA] - He is not a quality starter but he adds depth. If another team wants him bad enough, let him walk. Otherwise he's worth keeping around.

Johnny Jolly (DE) - He really helped boost the run defense this year. It's worth giving him a shot in camp to see if he can make the team again.

James Jones (WR) - He is worth keeping around for the right price. With the rise of Boykin and TT's ability to find WRs in the draft, Jones isn't worth overpaying for. We also don't want to set a precedent of overpaying wide receivers when Nelson and Cobb's contracts come up. 

John Kuhn (FB) - It's time to cut ties with Kuhn. 

Jamari Lattimore (LB) [RFA] - Keep him.

Mike Neal (DE/LB) - He adds depth and versatility to our pass rush. It's worth keeping him around.

Marshall Newhouse (OT) - We have enough young players that add depth on the O-line. It's time to let Newhouse go. 

Ryan Pickett (DT) - It might be time to let Pickett go. He is getting old and doesn't offer much in the way of pass rush.

Andrew Quarless (TE) - With Finley's future in question and the lack of quality pass catching TEs on our roster right now, it's worth bringing him back. 

B. J. Raji (DE) [Voidable Year] - We've already offered him a contract, so the ball's in his court. He is not likely to get more than we're offering on the open market. If Pickett leaves we can move Raji back to Nose Tackle, the position he is happiest playing and had his most productive years at.

James Starks (RB) - I wouldn't be in any rush to re-sign him. If no other team wants him, it would be worth giving him a shot in camp.

Seneca Wallace (QB) - Gone","1385856231"

"bjj","t5_2qn02","My daughter started at 7 a year ago.  We've gone through a whole bunch, including a short stretch where she was doing too much and we took a break for a little while.

She was in a play with multiple rehearsals every week, especially on BJJ days.  It was just too much, she was stretched thin, tired, etc...  I negotiated a break with her for several weeks.  I didn't say, ""well, just stop for a while"" because that is open ended and it could be hard to start back up.  We agreed that we would skip BJJ until the play was over.  This was about 3 weeks, which is forever in 8 year old time.  During this time there was only occasional discussion of BJJ with maybe a mention of how she is resting until after the play.  When she got back, I emphasized seeing her friends again and other fringe benefits that she was missing out on by not being there.  We're back in the swing again and she's super excited, just like when we started.

"knifeclub","t5_2ulfn","There aren't any advantages and there aren't many disadvantages to them.  They are a lazy solution to a nonproblem with good marketing.  Blade shape doesn't determine strength that is determined by the geometry of the grind.  The tanto tip isn't inherently any stronger than a regular drop point tip ground to the same thickness behind the edge.  However due to the steep angle of the front portion of the blade, they don't penetrate particularly well either.  The transition between the front and rear section can be hard to maintain, but besides that they aren't any more difficult to sharpen.  You just sharpen the front and rear portion separately.  There is a lot of misinformation about straight edges being better for utility which isn't true.  Considering utility isn't a specific type of task should be the first hint at this, yet the B.S. continues. Yes certain blade shapes can be more ergonomic for certain tasks, but grip and angle of attack (I don't like that term, but go with it) are usually what determine how well a blade performs at a task.  The wharncliffe (straight edge) being the utility shape of choice crap started because utility knives use razors which are sharp, they are cheap and easily replaced by people that can't sharpen.  Not knocking wharncliffes just pointing that out.  Their real advantage is the lower tip position so you don't of to rotate your hand as much to get leverage on the tip.  The transition point can be used as a faux tip if the knife is ground thin enough and the sharpener at the factory didn't round it off.  The practicality of that isn't overly high, and again there are many blade shapes like the wharncliffe and sheeps foot that have easily accessed tips for opening boxes and blister packs or other tip work.  

I'm rambling so I'll just finish this up with a final thought.  There are no advantages to an American tanto.  However if you like the way the blade looks, it probably won't get too much in the way of use so go for it if that is what you want.     ","1385856235"

2. [refurbished G75VX](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834231136) - it will be probably more cool and more quiet.

Various stylistic studies have attempted to demonstrate a difference between Paul's later and earlier epistles. These differences can mostly be explained based on different amanuenses (literary assistants), development in Paul's thinking and style of writing through time, different audiences and situations addressed, etc. From my viewpoint, the problem of postulating pseudonymous Pauline letters fails the test of Ockham's razor, especially when there is evidence from Galatians (one of Paul's earliest epistles) that Paul already had to take pains to authenticate his letters as coming from him (6:11; compare Romans 3:8).","1385856237"

The problem is too complex to be solved by simple legislation and I guess that applies to both sides of this argument equally. I personally feel that completely ending the war on drugs and providing free mental and health care will do more to stop violence than simply banning a tool.","1385856244"

Normally when you want to find a tangent to a point on a curve, you pick another point right next to the first, then connect them with a straight line. The closer the points, the more precise your tangent will normally be. And normally, there is a mathematical trick to get ""infinitely close"" to the original point. This trick was discovered independently by ~~Lieblitz~~ Leibniz and Newton and is called differentiation.

But this curve is not differentiable. You simply can't find the slope of the tangent. If you come up with an educated guess, I can simply zoom in further and find a different slope that is way off your first guess. And then you can do the same, and the same, but we won't come close.

"Naruto","t5_2quts","I'm going with the 3rd Raikage.

We have no effective feats of Prime Hiruzen so ranking him as of now is very difficult.

The Third Kazekage wasn't very impressive, so I'd peg him as the first to die.

Ohnoki is pretty underrated, but I don't believe he can pierce the Raikage's armor with Particle Style.

So essentially the Kazekage gets wrecked pretty early on, Hiruzen could probably figure out the 3rd Raikage's weakness, but has no way to carry it out, and Ohnoki has no way to hurt the Raikage nor can he outlast him, so I favor the 3rd Raikage.

I didn't get a period until 4 months after I stopped and that's also when the breakouts started.  My derm prescribed Retin-A-Micro at night with Clindamycin lotion twice a day which seemed to help a little bit but mostly it was just that my body needed time to re-adjust after the BC.  Fast forward nearly 3 years later, I'm still dealing with acne though its not as bad as it was.  I've since switched to Epiduo gel and so far so good.

I'm pretty sure my acne is hormonal since I get breakouts at random times throughout the month varying in severity but I still change my pillow cases, shower towels and hand towels **religiously**.  Even if its hormonal, it can't hurt to rid yourself of some of the bacteria that can appear on those items.  Also, if you are using CeraVe in the tub, it could be contributing to your breakouts.  It makes a lot of people breakout, myself included.

First, work on getting sponsorships. Not just small ones, aim for big companies who will donate $1000 or more. Robots are expensive and it's better to have more cash than you actually need instead of limiting your robots design or capabilities due to lack of cash.

Second, you're posting in /r/startups Have you considered building a product or service related to what you're doing? Even if you don't make much from it, you gain exposure in your community &amp; give sponsors a reason to pick you instead of a different team. When I was on my FRC team, services like [The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com/) and [Chief Delphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/portal.php) were extemley helpful and great examples of what I mean.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;God commands circumcision, and circumcision can not only kill you but radically deform your penis.

What you're talking about is very rare.  I'm not saying people haven't died from circumcision, nor a botching can happen (because a quick search on google will show otherwise) and thus cause a deformation, but it's statistically unlikely to happen.  Statistically unlikely, as in, it's outside of two standard deviations and is considered ""unusual"" in statistics language.

&gt;Yes but rrrrrrr777 said he didnt believe god would command us to do anything that would destroy our ability to enjoy life.

I can't speak for rrrrrrr777 but that's not how I would have said it.  God gives commands that may limit the pleasure we'll ultimately receive in this world, but that's because it heightens other pleasures as a result.  For instance, I know the taste of bacon cheeseburgers and shellfish.  I don't know the feeling of sex with a foreskin, but I know how sex feels and it's pretty enjoyable.  I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  Just as someone who loses their sight or hearing tends to have increased senses, so too do I have increased pleasure receptors since I don't overload mine with things God has told me I should avoid.

&gt;That sounds like it might somewhat affect your joy.

If you're talking about death, that's kinda moot.  If you're talking about deformity, I agree.  I don't know what options exist for repair in that department.  If you mean living life circumcised, I'm pretty happy and I have no complaints from the time I was sexually active.","1385856258"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","Southeast Louisiana resident here. I usually have the opposite problem. Etouffee I can make plenty spicy, Jambalaya is a different story although a true jambalaya will not be spicy. Actually, most Cajun food is not spicy as most think it is or has to be. Boiled seafood is the common spicy Cajun cuisine. Most other Cajun dishes are pretty normal heat wise. And etouffee has no cream in it unless you are just meaning a creamy texture. It is simply a roux gravy that makes the ""sauce""","1385856266"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Reductio ad absurdum is a propositional logical argument. All propositional logic arguments, if attempted and not fulfilled properly, become their fallacy counterpart. Therefore reductio ad absurdum, in this case, is a fallacy. Here's why. B (that we want to ban camera phones) does not follow from A (that we want to ban google glass). If someone holds up their phone and is pointing at something, you can tell that they are video recording something or taking a picture of it just by the orientation of their phone alone, but also through their demeanor. You could also see from behind them whether their phone is operating as a phone, camera, or not. These principles do not apply to google glass. You cannot know, unless you were to ask the person, whether they are capturing footage or images that include you, or not. Again, therefore B does not follow from A. From this conclusion you cannot prove that A is false using [reductio ad absurdum (A, ~B)], and an attempt to do so renders the argument as false i.e. a fallacy.","1385856269"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Maybe this will help even more then: every single negative in every single game is really an opportunity in disguise.  Sometimes there are opportunities to take objectives and get closer to winning -- for example, the enemy jungler is camping top, that means we can push hard bot, get some damage on turret, maybe even take a dragon.

And sometimes there are opportunities to improve personally.  These are the opportunities that you need to identify and take if you're going to improve.  The enemy Jax is fed and Jax eats ADCs for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner ^(at the same time).  How can I mitigate that and keep myself alive as an ADC?  I can enter fights late.  I can position myself so the rest of my team is between me and Jax.  I can use my escapes early -- if Jax chases, I've effectively removed him from the fight; if he doesn't chase, I can double-back and continue contributing to the fight.

Truthfully, the best things you can do for yourself in Bronze are being optimistic and tryharding.  The game is hard enough without your ego getting in the way, so don't let it.","1385856275"

Even if someone signed up with knowledge that they're going to war, if you haven't been there it's next to impossible to truly understand what that means.  No one thinks it's going to be like Stripes, but they don't understand how bad it's going to be.  They can't.  Especially because the people who've been there often do not want to talk about the worst parts of it.  I know two people who were in Vietnam.  One was an Army clerk, he was always willing to tell stories about wacky adventures like you'd expect from Good Morning Vietnam.  The other was a Marine, and generally speaking he doesn't tell stories.  I know he was wounded by grenade shrapnel, and then later had blood poisoning from bits that got left in.  I know his MOS was 0351.  But if he's even a little sober, I don't hear stories that happened between his training and his discharge.","1385856276"

The former is, as others have mentioned, for you to figure out(I know it's not easy but you're the only one who can hear your heart.) The latter is the bane of our existence- those of us that have to balance extroverted intuition with anything else. It's constantly asking, ""what if?"" or ""what else could be?"" But remember, you probably know lots of ENFPs, who have it as their dominant function, that never stick to anything and it leaves them unhappy also. 

This inner conflict resonates with me a lot. On the one hand, I have an adoring boyfriend, a stable job, great hobbies, etc... but on the other hand, I fantasize about running away, different lives, travel, adventure etc that I just don't get in my normal life. But the fantasies are just ""ideals."" They'd never turn out that way. I'd miss things about my old life, and this life can be reconciled to make me feel less trapped. It IS, though, SUPER hard to make the changes to make ourselves happier! I am struggling with that every day! You do not come off whiney to me. Change is hard to make.

Now my best guess is that since you're considering the IT field, you already have some knowledge of this stuff, so you could get a better internship/part-time job now.

For those of us who aren't having an event for charity or what not, I believe two weeks is a good balance. It gives new streamers an opportunity to get their name out, giving them more than one shot and also not letting them flood the subreddit.


In my experience, /r/LOLStreams currently has an overwhelming majority of people posting their own stream, and very little people who check the subreddit actually looking to watch streams.


For those saying to only allow streamers to post ONCE if it is not an event, put yourself in a new streamer's shoes. If you make your one post, and it doesn't really gain traction, you have exhausted a big resource to attempt to get viewers on your stream.

ANd I too caught on the fact they said they are not aware of anybody with telekinetic powers and wonder if they are going to stay away from that power.

As for the why, as other stated it will be due to rights held by Fox and Sony. However, Fox and Marvel/Disney have come to agreement to use two mutants in the next avengers as long as they do not mention their mutant father, or xmen.

The honeymoon stage never lasts, so if I continue to do that, I'll never be able to settle down. However, with your situation, perhaps there are some legitimate concerns. If you feel that his way of life is going to affect your happiness, then you should think about moving on. And it's true that if you wait too long to make that decision there could be other factors that make it harder to break up. But, just make sure you're absolutely ready to do this.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Well, time to get started. Spoiler warning to anyone reading these.

&gt;Hermione is capable of time travel...however this is never used again aside from saving BuckBeak.

Herminone used a time turner, someone thing she given at the beginning of the third book and gave back at the end of it because she didn't need it anymore. If you pay attention during the climate of the fifth book the room with all the time turners in it was destroyed, meaning no one else for the entire series was able to use them again.

&gt; In Goblet Of Fire it’s stated it was Barty Crouch Jr. killed Nevilles parents, but in Order Of The Phoenix it’s switched to Bellatrix Lestrange just to fit in with the beginning of the story.

OK now I know you didn't pay attention to the books you supposedly read. Nevilles parents never died, they were just driven to insanity via torture. Barty Crouch Jr. caught them and Bellatrix did the torturing. 

&gt; The entire school changes as the plot requires it to: ""We see Hogwart’s properly in seven movies and throughout that time it never stays the same. Chris Columbus’ films for the most part stuck to the same model, but then along came Alfonso Cuaron, throwing out many elements from Philosopher’s Stone and Chamber Of Secrets. Not necessarily a bad thing.

I don't think you understood how massive Hogwarts is. Its a giant castle with a shit-ton of secrets, at one point Dumbledoor said that even he, who had devoted a huge chuck of his life to the school, didn't know all its secrets. Also, your kinda talking about the aesthetic differences between the movies now. JK Rowling didn't have any control over that.","1385856291"

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","1998, 12th of September, Anjou. Tension is high on the run down streets of Judith-Jasmines. The two young prostitutes Roxanna and Isabelle (fictitious names) plotted to assassinate Adonis and Fox according to legal documents consulted by La Presse. 

Adonis, 21 years old and Fox 23 were always inseparable. Together, they founded the Obsession escorting agency with another one of their gang members, Pascal Almonacy. A fourth man would later join their ranks. 

The girls, between 17 and 25 years of age, would work 24/7. They have no right to leave the building without authorisation. Every one of them in love with a member of the gang. 

Adonis pimps out two young ladies. Isabelle had already been an erotic dancer before they met. “I want someone like that,” she said as she saw him. Adonis would later recruit Véronique, the second girl, at la Ronde, where she worked. At the end of one of her shifts, Adonis invites her to a party. She was ready “to do anything for him” as she would later testify. 

He promises them fiancés. To get there, a lot of money was needed. Prostitution is only “temporary”, just a quick way to get to their main objective. 

The gang members would even get money from the girls’ purses. They would leave them 10-20$ to let them eat at Mcdonalds. 120$ per hour for sex. Isabelle figures that in a few months, she’ll be able to get 40,000$ for Adonis. 

Vengeance in the Loung 

In the coming months, the situation worsens. The girls get beaten when not enough cash is brought in. Fox rapes when he pleases. 

One day, Isabelle confides in Roxanne that she wants to kill Adonis. He’s been beating her more often as of recent. One day, he brandishes his knife and asks her to choose: either she gets it up at the ass or he sodomizes her. 

Roxanne convinces Isabelle that it’d be best to go straight for the head, Fox, instead. She’s got a client who can take care of it. 

Before anything is set in stone, Isabelle reveals everything to Fox. He is furious. That night, the gang punishes Roxanne while Isabelle is forced to watch. 

Fox starts things off and literally jumps Roxanne, seated on the divan in the lounge. Adonis and Pascal join in. Blood begins to flow. Fox pulls a knife on the young girl. He continuously places the blade only millimeters away from her skin. 

“Everyone beat me. You get punches on the head, in the ribs, in the face.”, Roxanna later testified. 

From a broken nose to a fractured jaw, every single member made her suffer. The next day, she was beat once again. Exhausted, she denounces Isabelle who is “stealing” the gang by keeping the “extra” money given from clients. 

Now, it was Isabelle’s turn. Adonis hits her once in the face. 

“After that, he took the knife and put it against my fingers upside-down, but I still felt it’s pressure.” 

Adonis didn’t follow through with the threat and only remarked “Come to bed. You know that your my woman and that I love you, right?” 

Anything Goes

To continue the torture, the guys come up with a new idea. They organize a boxing match between the two “conspirators”. 

Adonis lends them a pair of gloves. Anything goes. “If I didn’t knock out Isabelle, it would be Fox who would knock me out.” Explained Roxanne. 

Near the end of September, Roxanne finally begged her way to be allowed to go to eat out with her father. She swears she will tell him nothing. She does her best to hide her bruises with excessive makeup. But once in front of her farther, she bursts into tears. She recounts her nightmare. He hides her in a safe place and she would later go to the police. 

Roxanne’s disappearance brings about agitation. The gang moves the girls around from one motel to the next. Since the police never came, they would later return to the apartment in Anjou. 

In the morn of October 21st, the police enter the establishment. The members are cuffed and the girls are taken away as well. They would reveal everything. 

No less than 32 accusations are placed against the four men, prostitution, death threats, assault and battery. 

Olympic Dreams

A few days after their first appearance in front of the judge, the accused beg for their liberty. 

“My goal is to go to the Olympics. Before the arrest, I was training myself regularly six hours per day. I train in the morning. I run for two hours”, testified Adonis. 

The judge refuses to free the gang. Too dangerous. 

Earlier this month, we ran into him while he was training for his fight on the 30th of November in Quebec. The boxer allowed us to go back on a few elements of his past. 

He paid some lip service, regretting what the girls had to endure. 

Adonis would later assure that he has “cleaned up” his entourage since then. 

Denunciation 

At the hearing, the four girls would denounce each of the accused. 

None of the accused would attempt to defend themselves. As he would recall, Adonis was ordered not to testify. “Of course there’ll be some repercussions if you talk. In those types of situations, you can’t talk. I respected that.” 

La Presse would later find two of the gang’s victims to shed some light on the role Adonis played back in the day. 

Despite the amount of time that has passed, the two still tremble to the thought. One no longer despises the boxer. The other has never forgiven him. 

“He doesn’t deserve to be admired the way he is after what he’s done. What would you say if that happen to your daughter?” says the one who still despises him. She was fuming when the boxer would appear on the show “Tout le monde en parle (everyone’s talking about it)” last year as they depicted him as the girls’ “bodyguard”. “He was Fox’s right hand man. He was more than just a body guard.” 

Even if he refuses to admit it, Adonis beat those girls, confirms the other victim. “I think he was just following orders ; to stop Fox from killing us. It was to protect us from the worst.” Says the one who had forgiven him. 

“The other guys were manipulated too, not just the girls.” Adds another. 

At the time, Adonis was often at the gym “I think it was his escape. He definitely wouldn’t admit it, but I think he was also afraid of the boss.”. Confirms another victim. 

Life in the shadows. 

On April 2nd 2000 at the Rivière-des-Prairies prison, Adonis is placed in the “protection” section of the prison alongside another one of the accused. The men are confined to their sells 23 hours a day. 

At 5 o’clock, it’s visit time. The detained wait for their doors to open so they can get to the booths. One man lags behind: Adonis. Another inmate, Guy Langlois, impatiently screams “You coming out or what?” in a disrespectful tone. 

Adonis respondes “You talking to me like that?” The man replies “yeah” in the same tone. Things do not escalate any further. 

At 7:30 pm, a brawl breaks out between about 10 inmates. Cries resonate through the halls, tensions rise. As the guards arrive, Langlois is out on his back in front of a cell.  Adonis violently kicks Langlois in the head. 

“I dreamt about that for 3 days. I had never seen anything so violent in my 11 years.” Says one of the agents. 

Langlois was bleeding from the mouth and was having convulsions. He was later transported to a hospital in which he would later fall into a coma. Despite the double fractures to his skull, he would be hospitalized for 10 days and later survived. 

Adonis claims that he  was jumped by about 10 men, some armed with make shift shivs. He responded by KOing 5 or 6 of them before the guards arrived. 

“They knew I could box. They wanted to test me. That’s what prison is like” says the boxer. 

The striking Verdict 

One month later, judge Jean-Pierres decisions strikes as painfully as an uppercut (corn ball)

“There is no doubt that the accused have borne the fruits of labour from the prostitution ring. These young girls were severely beaten. They were forced to beat each other. They were forced to commit lesbian-like acts. They were threatened if they even suggested leaving the group.” Fox however, was definitely the head of the group, as was declared by the judge. 

Adonis had control over two young girls who would bring him money, stated the judge. He bore witness to the gang’s criminal activities. He was present when the girls would get beaten. 

The accused were found guilty. Fox would receive 5 years in prison while Adonis and Pascal are sent to jail for 4 years. 

They had already been in preventative holding for 20 months. Back then, that counted as twice the amount of time. 

The boxer’s legal troubles did not end there. Another trial would have him testify for the scuffle that took place last time he was imprisoned. He was accused of attempted murder and aggression.  

To his delight, the heaviest accusation was dropped. In September, he pleaded guilty to the aggression charges. He received an extra month in prison. Once  released in 2001, he would make a pact with himself. Never again would he go back. It’s time to get back to the gym.

Ah yes. Nice handwaving the fact that pretty much nobody agrees with your hilarious assertion that ZvP is predicated on a coinflip from the start.


&gt;That's a whole lot of mental gymnastics to get around the simple fact that opening pool first is bad against gateway expand.

It's not really a lot of mental gymnastics at all. I said the same thing in three different ways so that you wouldn't miss the point. Unfortunately, you did.

&gt;I never said it's super amazing autowin. I said JD was behind the whole game from that.

Sounds pretty autowin to me...

&gt;If JD would have hatched first, he probably wouldn't have lost those 2 queens early on and probably wouldn't have had to make that spore at his 3rd.

Totally useless and nebulous speculation. We have no idea what JYP would have even done if JD Hatch first'd.

&gt; If you think that stuff doesn't matter in a high level game, then you shouldn't be involved in a discussion about high level starcraft.

I'd say the same thing about your Pool first vs Hatch first dichotomy.

&gt;What's the benefit of having guesswork? It's supposed to be a skill based game. There are supposed to be ways to ENSURE you have the right information. 

It's called scouting?

&gt;You always have these unknown protoss players plowing through one tournament before they fade away into obscurity.

That's not really from coinflipping though. It's from inventing some sort of all-in that nobody knows how to deal with. If they were truly flipping coins, they wouldn't fade into obscurity: they'd keep getting cheap wins because of randomness. But they don't.

&gt; Because protoss is more reliant on these sneaky, guess-based strategies than the other races.

Sounds like you just watch WoL or something.

&gt;Well no mathematically that would be impossible. 

We have nothing even resembling randomness, though. 

&gt;he question is how are people winning? Are they winning because they flipped a coin and it came up ""WIN"" or are they winning because they outplayed their opponent? I'm saying there are things in this game that are FAR TOO dependent on coin flipping.

Yeah, and you've basically got no legs to stand on in this assertion, because the recent metagame/tournaments don't attest to it at all.

That said, I sold a few when they started crashing, made quite a bit in PPC at FTC (my first shot at day trading) and bought back into LTC when I'd made a fair bit and LTC was low. My plan is to wait and see what the new year brings. First few days were stressful trying to buy quickly and concentrating on the rates all the time.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I may be uniquely qualified to comment on this -- I was accepted to an Ivy, went to a top public school instead to study engineering, went into management consulting (one of 3 strategy firms), now work in Private Equity, and have a few healthcare deals under my belt. 

First thing you need to do is to resolve this medical school / business school path. If you want to be a doctor (which you say you do not want to do), graduate and go to medical school. If you want to be in business (which it sounds like you do), DO NOT go to medical school. You'll get your business career started way too late, miss out on a lot of opportunities, and the medical degree isn't going to help you (Wharton has a healthcare focused MBA if that's what you want). 

I was just involved in a mid-cap healthcare deal. Out of all the officers in the company, the entire deal team, our bankers and lawyers, you know how many had an MD? ZERO. MBAs all around (except the lawyers, obviously, and the pre-MBA associates on the finance side). Unless you want to do R&amp;D, you're not going to learn ANYTHING that you need to know about the healthcare industry in medical school. You're just going to be an ancient associate when you finally get started.

So, let's say the right path for you is the traditional consulting / finance path. You graduate, work at Bain for 3 years, go the HBS / Wharton for 2 to get an MBA, do an investment banking internship, go back into consulting for 2-3 years, and jump into the buy-side from there. That's usually how it goes (add those years to your medical degree and you'll see one of the reasons the MD sounds crazy). What's the best way to do that?

Staying at the Ivy. M/B/B interviewed nearly 100 people at my state school. Between the three firms, THREE offers were handed out. In my associate class of 30, nearly everyone was Harvard, Penn, Chicago, Northwestern, Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton. I wasn't the only state school kid there, but we were not well represented.

Honestly, 100-150K in debt sounds like a lot. But you know what? My bonus exceeded that 4 years after graduation. Debt is a conversation worth having if you're looking at careers that are 80k vs. 60k, but if you jeopardize a super-lucrative path just to save a few thousand bucks up front, that's not a good tradeoff. 

Which brings me to my last point: This path is at risk. 3.3 GPA isn't going to cut it. You WILL NOT get an interview Bain/McK/BCG with a 3.3; it's just not going to happen. I was one of the guys who, once a year, sat in a room for 8 hours looking at resumes to fill out the interview schedule; there was no firm line, of course, but 3.3 wouldn't cut it for any major at any school. 

So, in summary, I went to a lower-priced state school instead of an Ivy. It worked out for me, but I wouldn't recommend it because it makes it much harder. Even being at an Ivy, you're in trouble with that GPA -- get your act together. McKinsey doesn't hire B students.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Careful now, skipper.  All this empathy you're feeling might give you a wrinkle, or an aneurysm.

&gt; This is a semantically empty statement. Everyone you claim has no empathy for anyone can ""understand"" the feelings of others. Let's just drop that criteria there... you only included it because it contradicts what I'm saying and it sounds good in your fuckwitted notions of the subject.

Actually, it's quite literally the definition of empathy.  I included it because it's the definition of empathy.  My fuckwitted notions also happen to be based on the definition of empathy so the fact that it contradicts what you're saying speaks less about my fuckwitted-ness and more about your suppressed anger.  Wow, you are angry.

Mirroring emotions is something psychopaths do which, as another poster suggested, you seem to be.  I make no assumptions but you do seem enraged by the fact that empathy is something people have, that is, an ability.  Do you have empathy?

I think it would behoove you to study the English language.  That's not meant as an insult, a suggestion.  All those words that seem irrelevant in the definition, aren't.  Every little word, however small, carries with it energy and embedded meaning.  Messages encoded by all who have used the words before.

So you're right. No one can ""share the feelings of others.""  That's why the definition specifies *share **in** the feelings of others.*  Did you catch the difference?  Share in.  Their pain doesn't become ours.  You can't feel *for* someone else but you can feel *with* someone else.  And yes, it does happen whether we understand it or not.

With the exception of psychopaths, most people are empathetic.  They might feel sadness.  They might feel rage.  They might feel disappointed.  Hell, they might even feel sympathy.  But they don't feel empathy, because empathy isn't something you feel.  It's sometime you have.

As for my being functionally illiterate, I took the most amazing shit this morning.  From the wellspring of my bowels came one of the pillars of Hercules.  A turd by which to end all turds.  As if mighty Zeus himself descended upon the earth from my colon.  Yes sir, it was the crap of all craps, the poop of all poops.  After shedding the weight of a thousand suns, I finally knew - my shit is complete.

There are other options to consider, like when do you reasonably think you will be able to move out? Considering you've suffered this for a long time, calling the cops on your father would unnecessarily strain your relationship at home and you might leave prematurely without better planning from home. What would calling the cops do to your family? Would it possibly also harm your sister in any way? By that I mean socially or monetarily harm your sister who though is treated unfairly, but hasn't done anything wrong?

If you are talking about Cornell, Brown, Penn, or Dartmouth, it changes the balance. It especially changes the balance if you are planning on going to graduate school. 

For Econ, pedigree matters pretty significantly, especially if you are apply to jobs straight out of undergrad, you will have to heavily rely on your pedigree and alumni network. For med-school pedigree matters much less and almost not at all.

A bit of unsolicited advice: it sounds like you are a bit undecided on what you want to do with your future. You need to decide soon. $150k is a lot of debt for an econ/biology degree that you could hopefully use to work at a Big 4 making $50k-65k out of school, or try to use an undergrad bio degree and make $30k (if you are lucky). Your student loan repayments will be ~1/3 of your take home for the first ~4 years. You will definitely regret that. Get good grades, network, and internships then you should be fine.","1385856307"

In ancient Rome, virgins were women (and only women) who were financially independent.  It had nothing to do with sex.  Colloquially now, it means someone who hasn't had ""sex"", but (as you point out), there are wildly differing definitions of what ""sex"" is.  

It used to be very clear that a woman lost her virginity when she broke her hymen and bled, to the point where women were killed for not bleeding on their wedding nights -- but it's easy to break that through non-sexual activity (horseback riding or gymnastics, for example), and the breaking of the hymen is a little controversial to begin with.  So that doesn't work as a definition.  (And I find the idea that some people skip PiV sex and go straight to anal in order to preserve their virginity utterly ridiculous.)  

It's silly to say that lifelong lesbians stay virgins.  It's silly to say that any sexually active people are virgins.  It's a term that just doesn't mean as much as people think it means.","1385856313"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My friend and his fiancee were on a registry. It was one for Williams-Sonoma aka the whitest store in the country. I swear, the place had its own neighborhood watch. I'm pretty sure Kenny G was playing over the Musak, too.

Anyway, I walk into the store and immediately felt out of place. Everyone else was dressed like they had just been magically transported from Cape Cod during the height of boating season. Polo shirts, khaki shorts, and sandals with socks everywhere I looked. Me? I didn't even have a windbreaker tied around my waist. They all looked at me like I was their gardener and I had just invited myself to brunch. I hadn't felt that unwelcome since I was ten and my mom forced my sister to let me join the slumber party her and her friends were having.

Anyway, I start making my way around the place. The place smells like sparkling wine, cedar, and Ralph Lauren (not the cologne, the actual man; he smells divine). I'm checking out some of the stuff, kind of scoping out what I should get for my friend's wedding gift. I spot a fancy-looking blender. It has great curb appeal. Really has that ""wow"" factor. Upon closer inspection, I come to discover that the fucker costs more than my car. Sticker shock hits me like a positive sign on an EPT. 

Setting my sights lower, I run through the list of items of the registry that I had printed off in anticipation of my visit. ""Cutting board"" jumped out at me. I snatched up a wooden on that had a nice heft to it. I remeber thinking to myself how one could bludgeon someone to death with such a culinary implement. I must have been in a hurry to get myself out of that place because I didn't even look at the price tag before I brought it up to the counter. It couldn't be much, right? I mean, it's a *cutting board.* It's not meant to be shown off, it's meant to take abuse like a car's clutch or a mudroom or a ginger stepchild. 

So, with this in mind, I approach the sales clerk. He eyeballs me like I'm about to stick my finger in him. For just a moment, the thought of bludgeoning him with this cutting board crosses my mind.

""Nah,"" I say to myself as I set it down on the counter.

""Did you find everything ok?""

""Yep. Thank you.""

""Your total comes to $134.76.""

""Go fuck yourself!,"" I ejaculated. The words were not of my choosing. It was more of a knee-jerk, reflexive type of response. I quickly laughed, like it was a joke that poor people use all the time. ""Sorry. Um, can I put $53 on my debit card and then pay the rest in cash?"" 

In the end, I'm not sure my friend and his now wife liked it that much. They make a big show of using it whenever I come over. She will be all like ""Look how great it is for chopping vegetables!"" Well, the $4 bamboo one at Price Chopper would work just as well, but I'm glad you like this $134 one all the same.

The moral of my story is that I would *love* to be on a registry like this.","1385856315"

The cheap couches (self assemble) are very uncomfortable and the comfy or nicer looking ones are way over priced. The cheap ones are also easy to break. IME couches are worth being durable as they take most abuse in an apartment next to maybe the bed. 

I would recommend finding a factory outlet store in your city (If you have an ikea you have an outlet store) Tell them you want to pay cash and often times they will sell it tax free and include delivery. The quality of these places is the same as the brick or anywhere but tend to be a lot cheaper.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","1. The 6950 despite what some people may think from the name (being a lower number, people usually think its not as good) is a pretty good GPU good enough, I think, to handle BF4 AND AC4. I think the problem is most likely lying with your CPU since the Phenom isn't the best match with your GPU in terms of balance to begin with (In my far from expert opinion) 

2. The FX-8350 is a good CPU but the 8 cores make it more useful in multitasking, If you plan to stick with AM3+ I wouldn't recommend going any higher than the FX-6350 (Still a good 6 core CPU at £100 (i'd think around $150 if my conversions are correct)) The 6350 will get you out of the ""CPU-Bound"" situation (If it is a CPU Problem) and should last you long enough until you decide to grab a decent i5 (4670k Maybe?) and a Z87 Socket Motherboard to go with it

But yeah, TL:DR Most likely a bottleneck problem, save up for a new Z87 Mobo and something around a 4670K or solve your problem now with a cheaper 6350

P.s. I'm far from an expert, so I'm sure somebody will throw very angry words and call me a dumbass for something I said, in that case I am sorry. I also hope all of that made sense, I usually just write what's in my head and hope to god that its not complete gibberish.

She was a lot more ready for it than i was, she practically invited me to put my hands on her. My parents are awesome and left us alone like the whole time. Anyways i eventually just went for it.

Leaned into her and put my mouth against her.

We were both each other's first kiss so we were both really aweful. It was awk but also really great because i was a really fucking thirsty teen. She was my girlfriend the majority of the summer and after that like all we ever did was make out, which was totally worth it because i got a hell of a lot better at it lol.","1385856318"

"Digital_Immortality","t5_2z1f3","&gt; I feel like the D.I. movement is somewhat a branch off of transhumanism.

Definitely.  There are a lot of anti-uploading/anti-immortality transhumanists.  *reads further*  Oh.  Heh.  You said that.

&gt; At some point the benefits of living a life as a digital mind will far outweigh any reasons to remain human.

Tell that to the Amish.  There's no accounting for taste (and that same sentiment could be applied to us) - some people will just prefer to keep their augmentations at the level of ""clothing"" and ""glasses"".

&gt; In the beginning, I envision there will be substantial resistance from people who consider the human body/life to be in some way sacred.

Did that happen with pacemakers?  We might be able to avoid this resistance altogether if DI comes as a gradual progression available to the whole world from the beginning, rather than a single big change all at once.  In fact, that's kind of what transhumanism is already - a conduit for gradually introducing these ideas into the mainstream.

Also, I just had an idea about terminology: making a distinction between ""digital beings"" and ""humans"" might get in the way of mainstream acceptance.  If we're developing a vision of a future where mind uploading is becoming about as remarkable as girl scouts, we may want to focus on the commonalities between digital beings and everyone else, and minimize the differences as much as possible.

Energy: agreed.

Space travel:

&gt; Eventually we will permanently leave Earth

Interesting - abandoning Earth is a new idea to me.  Could you say more?  Or are you just saying we'll colonize additional planets?

&gt; I’m not inclined to think that a person could transfer their consciousness across the universe using light or radio waves to transmit the data

This is actually the prediction I've heard most often, as far as space travel/exploration is concerned.  As I understand it, the theory is that it will never be cost-effective (to your earlier point, this really means ""energy-effective"") to transport significant amounts of matter off of the planet, but once uploading is developed we can just launch communications equipment.

Avatar design: avatars aren't important to me, but it does seem like there's some interest in them.  I can't tell yet if they're integral to DI acceptance or if they'll introduce further risk and effort.

Mind design: I'm not sure I understand how you're defining ""mind"".  Could you say more?","1385856320"

The amount of info you can exchange in a call is way bigger and can be done way faster than through texting, so texting has always annoyed me. Also the anxiety of calling someone over the phone prevents me from abusing the privilege of a phone call as well.

So I guess it was kinda intentional in the decision to just leave it in, but a bit of an accident.

It honestly doesn't make much sense for Sakurai to want to keep the tactic in. The characters are just magically sliding across the ground. Note that I'm not against wavedashing as a competitive tactic at all; I think it adds a lot of depth to players' spacing games, etc. But it strikes me as something that Sakurai clearly would not want to have in the game again, because of the nonsensical element.

Note that both of these powders are the OPPOSITE of what you requested of a powder that will take up a lot of case space.  But they are both awesome, versatile, clean burning powders.  Also, because you use so little of them, your cost per round is less.  As far as double charging a case, pay attention, no matter what powder you use.","1385856325"

Current advice should continue to be to wear a condom prior to any genital contact in order to minimise unintended pregnancy and disease transmission. It is tempting to speculate that the use of withdrawal as a means of contraception might be more successful in some men because they are less likely to release sperm with their pre-ejaculate.

If money is tight, I'd switch to an AMD Radeon 7870 to make up the difference.  Consider getting a hybrid hard drive.  It will cost the same, but it will boot a lot faster.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well, it's a bit of hair-splitting. 

&gt;They concluded that 62.1 percent of the (1.5 million) bankruptcies were medically related because the individuals either had more than $5,000 (or 10 percent of their pretax income) in medical bills, mortgaged their home to pay for medical bills, or lost significant income due to an illness. On average, medically bankrupt families had $17,943 in out-of-pocket expenses, including $26,971 for those who lacked insurance and $17,749 who had insurance at some point.

The point is that the situation is grossly exacerbated because virtually ALL health care costs are *substantially* higher in the US. 

 In most  western countries, medical bills would either be significantly lower, or completely non-existent.  In many of those countries there is also a more robust social safety net to backstop even those lower health care costs.


Yes, medical errors are a problem also.  ( BTW - Do yourself a favor, in the future link to the study, not that guys website, as he is really pretty questionable)","1385856334"

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","Ya know, I've been thinking about the tax rate issue, and it might be better just to have it flat. A major flaw in my argument was that I was conflating individual income with household income at times.

If you have an individual income, by the time you start paying higher tax rates than the status quo, you're pretty high up on the totem pole, since ~$60k for an individual income is much higher than it is for a household income, which often have 2 or more possible income sources. And if you have a household income in the range I was worried about, then you're gonna have 2 UBIs in the house anyway, so you're still likely gonna see lower taxes. So you won't even see higher rates until you're over $100k, which means that for most people it really won't be a tax increase at all.","1385856335"

So if your problem is that plugins start using too much memory while there are players on, you're SOL because they'll disconnect.

People, and young people especially, move to the bigger towns for education and job opportunities – not much to do besides fishing in these communities. At some point the number of inhabitants in these “bygds” meets a breaking point, and the community just isn't sustainable. I also think its official government policy not to support bygds with less than fifty people (number be slightly off).

In the case of this bygd, can’t remember the name, it was situated very near to the capital Nuuk. We sailed there, the trip took about 45 minutes, and I can imagine that the close proximity to the capitol might have made the abandonment easier.

I think it's great to know what colors conventionally look good on your skin, however even after you know what ""works"" for you, if you don't like those colors then scratch that. If you like a color, wear it! 

If you're finding the lightest shade too dark for you, I would check out Meow Cosmetics and order some samples. They have an extensive shade range, along with a pure white base if you need to go even lighter.

How correct is this from the Buddhist perspective?

Brahman is not said to have a different essence from creation - no Atman (of any entity) is different from Brahman.

***

Also:

&gt;What is ultimate truth/reality, according to Na¯ga¯rjuna? To understand this, we
have to understand the notion of emptiness, which for Na¯ga¯rjuna is emphatically
not nonexistence but, rather, interdependent existence.

This doesn't preclude the existence of a substance that permeates everything, right? ","1385856345"

"GameDeals","t5_2qwx3","It kind of pisses me off that it would have cost me *more* to buy just the DLC, having already paid the full $60 for the game at release, than the cost to buy the complete edition. Seems like a big ""fuck you for supporting the release"". I definitely won't ever pay for another bethesda game until it's a dirt cheap complete version.


edit: To everyone missing the point and telling me how I paid extra to get it early, yes, I paid extra to get it early, and was glad to do so. If you read my comment, my issue is with the DLC pricing making no sense. I'm saying that all this time later, I look at the price of [DLC] which is higher than the price of [full game + DLC], not at different times, but simultaneously. That doesn't make sense to me. How is DLC &gt; DLC + Main Game?

edit 2: Still getting replies from people who don't understand that we're in a steam sale thread and the issue is with the fact that the sale price made the DLC more expensive than the legendary edition. I'm not complaining about paying more to get something early(I waited for the DLC to go on sale, obviously).  I'm not talking about prices changing. I'm talking about the steam sale because I replied to a comment about skyrim in the ""Steam Autumn Sale"" thread in /r/GameDeals.","1385856349"

"chess","t5_2qhr7","Hi All, as you can see, I have been appointed as a moderator in order to assist in the moderating as well as to appoint a new mod team. In order to clear up any questions, I was not involved in the purge of the previous mod team. I was brought in because as /u/jamesinc because I currently have the time to moderate the subreddit, I play chess and I have been an active redditor for the past couple of years.

When submitting an application to be a moderator please outline what you can contribute to the moderation of this subreddit. Also outline the direction you with this subreddit to take. We want to gauge what direction the subscribers of /r/chess want to go in as well as to be as transparent as possible.  

My personal opinion on some of the issues raised here is as follows. I think it should be up to /r/chess to determine whether something is worthwhile or contributes to discussion. I am only in support of removing something if it is completely irrelevant or is plainly abusive. I am not a great fan of memes but if they are related to chess and contribute as being informative, humorous or whatever then I think that they should be allowed. I do not believe in in banning anyone unless they are repeatedly abusive or are spamming. I am also inclined to appoint some of the previous mods of /r/chess as they have experience. However this should be seen as an opportunity for /r/chess to definitively determine where it wants to go and as such all applications will be determined on their merit and their support. So if you like or don't like an idea say so.

Sorry to hear you had problems as an early adopter, If these problems have not been resolved please let me know and I will investigate.

I think it takes a lot of vision to be an early adopter of any new technology and in my opinion the ""scale out shared nothing"" architecture (which Nutanix use and some other vendors are starting to use) is the way of the future, and will be a major part of the market.

I have written a few articles which discuss some of the benefits of this architecture, and why traditional centralized shared storage does not scale well.

http://www.joshodgers.com/2013/10/26/scale-out-shared-nothing-architecture-resiliency-by-nutanix/

http://www.joshodgers.com/2013/10/24/scaling-problems-with-traditional-shared-storage/

Having a VSA is actually a huge advantage as Nutanix has read/write cache in every compute node, as well as localized persistent storage. This reduces latency, reduces the dependency on the storage network and helps eliminate ""noisy neighbour"" issues among other things.

Nutanix runs a VSA (or Controller VM as we call it - CVM) on each node,  which does use some compute resources to provide the benefits mentioned above. The size of the CVM can be varied depending on your workload type and reducing (or at least maintaining) the size of the CVM is something actively being worked on by me personally, as well as other members of the performance and engineering team.

Happy to answer any questions on the Nutanix Technology, or scale out shared nothing benefits in general.","1385856350"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Yeah we use it because our group is spread out over a couple states. It's extremely nice. It being free is just amazing, and you can make pretty much everything you need. And if you want more specific tiles for building dungeons, taverns, houses or more tokens for enemies and players, packs of them usually only like 5 dollars.

For another 5 dollars (a month though) you can get dynamic lighting, which lets you set a sight radius for each character, and anything outside of that radius is hidden (darkness). It adds quite a bit of an exploratory feeling when moving through a dungeon or forest.

The only thing I wish is that there were more bubbles. There's only 3 bubbles per character, and we usually keep track of HP, Surges, and use the third one for something else (ranger uses it to keep track of arrows). If we had more bubbles, I'd put AC, FORT, REF, WILL, etc on there as well.

Roll20 has virtual dice as well, if you don't have a set, which is nice. We prefer to use real dice, but it's just because rolling is fun. They have voice and video chat, but from what I've heard, its not that good and you should use something else like skype or teamspeak or something.

All in all, roll20 is really awesome, you should totally check it out. Make sure to watch the tutorial/introduction video (which i didn't and missed out on some cool things I could do for the first couple sessions).","1385856351"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","* Stannis, mainly because I think he's really being prepped to take Winterfell and have Jon join him. I mean, come on, I don't see George killing him off, and I think it's a kind of obvious watershed moment for Jon, and about he's about go into a different direction as a character.

* I honestly don't think I can tell from what we know right now. I think Stannis has been pushed away from Melisandre, but i can't think of other candidates for him.

* Jon Snow -  for reasons spoken about in answer 1, I think Jon's going to team up with Stannis. This will lead to Davos giving up his position to the Young Wolf because, let's face it, the guy's nearly finished. Maybe he's got one last thing to achieve for his king, but I don't see him making it through the next book, let alone the winter.

* This is a tough one. I think we're going to find a Tyrell somewhere on this list, and it might as well be here. Loras Tyrell is young, famous (very important point here, a great pawn for a king in need of popularity), and very skilled as a swordsman, and it would seem from the way we see Jaime pondering about him often and of his ability to lead as a commander, he is really being prepared for the role.

* Littlefinger! Oh man, I've been wanting to speculate on Littlefinger's role for ages, and I think all this man really has to do is get in touch with Stannis and offer him the most valuable thing he has, a Stark. How could any king refuse such a brilliant piece in this game? The momentum swing and renown it would gain him alone makes this move extremely desirable. This could also lead to Sansa becoming his Queen (or maybe two? Queens of Ice and Fire anyone?).

* Master of laws, hmm... I would hazard a guess of another Tyrell to be honest, I haven't read up as much as i would have liked on the Southron conspiracy to know if they've got plans to be the rulers, or support one, but i figure a big family like this is too important to not have some big positions. Garlan Tyrell is my vote on this one.

* It might be naive to say it, but I think this role won't exist. Stannis is going to be different.

* The Bastard of Driftmark baby! It really fits his piratey nature, and he is on the run from Cersei.

* I think Stannis is going to bring the North under his rule, so I'm going to say him as well for this title.

* Lord Dunstan Drumm. He almost had that crowd at the kingsmoot, and I think his weak gifts will fade pretty quickly once they see how ambitious Euron is, and how they see him getting them into stuff that they do not want to participate in. 

* The Blackfish. I think the absence of a confirmed kill on his is very important, and that the reader is going to see him pop up somewhere as a rebel. 

* Littlefinger. I see him making a deal with Stannis and staying alive, and he's already the Lord of the Vale.

* This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think it's likely that Euron will claim at least SOME new land for those Iron Islanders. Westerlands goes to the Drumm family. 

* The Tyrell family. Really only because I don't think that they are dumb enough to lose the very seat of their power. 

* Stannis. You bet your sorry ass Stannis is going to reclaim his homeland.

* Hard to tell honestly. I do not think the Martell family will be the sovereign of Dorne by the end of this series, but I don't know enough about Dorne to talk specific families. 

* Samwell Tarly! Hot of out Oldtown, brimming with knowledge and confidence, our young friend winds his way up to the Night's Watch. The Watch recognizes Hero Sam, and he is elected into the Office of Lord Captain Commander of the Night's Watch. 

* The prophecies are bunk and I don't believe a word of them.

The only reason I have not killed myself yet is because I keep hoping one day he will contact me. I see him every day still.

Since, have been told that X or Y was just being mean and while it may have been, has still knocked my confidence tenfold. I didn't take a job that would've been a fairly steep pay increase on what I currently am working at. I also have little to no motivation to finish my work course.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","why are friendships the most important thing in your life? you make it sound like a game, where you're focused on a reward that isn't actually meaningful to them as it is to you. you sound like you want lots of people around so you always have them there, so you can get on your motorcycle and pass by someone's house and know them so you have something to do. it sounds like you have very little to actually do that's meaningful, and this is all about filling your life.

but actual relationships are about something beyond that. you don't have friends so you can have people to fill your time, it's to actually cooperate together in a significant way to accomplish something real and important.

this is tricky to explain, so maybe think of someone who volunteers at a lot of places. they always have something to do, somewhere to be. they go to the homeless shelter and spend hours passing out free soup to people. they go to the animal shelter and give dogs baths. they go to church and bring the kids on a trip camping. 

this person says they have a full rich career, and work hard. but this is all about them. it's all to fill a void in their life, and the person doesn't actually commit to any one thing and build a relationship with any true loyalty.

someone else will volunteer at the homeless shelter, but they actually integrate theirself into the organization. they become part of the committee, where they attend meetings and vote on actions they do as a group. they share ideas and know the other people personally, where they work to build something together.

that's totally different. they actually are part of a family, and others can depend on them because there's a commitment where it's not just about one person volunteering when they have time, it's where the other people in the organization can call and say, ""i need you to come in on saturday"", and you do. why? because you're devoted, which means you leave your schedule open so that you can be flexible for your group you're married to.

you're not married to anyone. you're like a promiscuous floozy. if you were committed to your best friend, then you'd leave openings just in case, and you'd shift things around for them.

it's like how your wife doesn't have to ask if you're free to go to a restaurant, because your committed relationship implies that you already have pre-scheduled date slots. sure if you have to do something for a friend or your business then she will be flexible and understand. but her being your wife means you promised her a big chunk of your attention, and she is allowed to cash that in whenever she wants, where her request takes priority over others.

what makes this person your best friend?","1385856364"

You're correct, only way to stop the violence going on in Mexico is for the government to stop trying to police the whole world and just legalize and regulate drugs already.

You could have a good K/9, but it could be because you're getting more chances, not because you're particularly great at striking guys out. If you want to isolate strikeout ability, K% does a better job.

If we're using binary classifications, I agree with you. His greatest skill over that period was inducing weak contact. But I think strikeouts and limiting walks were also a big part of his game over that period and shouldn't be overlooked. He was a complete pitcher and that's what I prefer to remember him as.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Nothing i said is bullshit, and let's try and keep the aggression levels down. I'll try and be reasonable too.

1) The only budget cuts that were made were to the desk jobs in the military, there was a call for ""more teeth and less tail"" in the military. They redirected the costs of the office jobs towards the front lines, bear in mind my original comment (maybe not clearly) was saying how Canada was buying instruments of death. Regarding the Environment budget cuts, bear in mind their original budget was only vaguely around $1 billion. The cuts to that department were much more significant than to the ones in the military, a military which arguably needed to be cut anyway. 

2) You are right, no planes have been purchased and there is a waiting game, but should the F-35's seem promising, then there are plans to spend $16 billion over the next few years on upgrading the fleet (I'm not sure on the condition of the current fleet, or if it needs upgrading, I don't know much about planes as you can tell from my mistake by calling the F-35's raptors) 

3) I never really put blame on the types of planes we bought and i did not mean to imply that they were the cause for the high spending. But if you wish to discuss/ debate/ argue about planes with me, then i'd say  this: Do Canada really need jets? Sure, they're good for wars, but are these wars necessary in the first place? such as Libya which was really just a conquest for oil. If Canada continue in these Americanized wars, then sure the purchase of Jets is necessary, but then it will confirm Canada as purchasers of instruments of death. What happened to Canada's image as a peacekeeper? If we are to potentially spend $16 billion on jets, why not helicopters which we can  use to deploy peacekeeping missions? After all, up until 1993 Canada had been involved in every peacekeeping mission to that date, and had thousands of peacekeepers involved. Today i believe there are less than 200, and Canada often don't become involved in peacekeeping missions.  ","1385856368"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt; The reason LAN gaming is so rare nowadays is that it's seen as an anti-piracy measure...If you must authenticate and connect to their servers, you won't be able to enjoy a big chunk of the game if you pirate it.

Yet another instance of punishing the paying customer to address piracy, and a poor solution. Plus, it doesn't work, people are pirating the games anyway and playing them offline. Personally, I'm appalled that even many single player games now require an internet connection to play. If you're travelling, you may as well forget gaming on your laptop with today's games.

&gt;Now, another reason (and I think perhaps the bigger) LAN play is not as popular anymore is because it's not necessary. It used to be a real pain in the ass to play a game with a bunch of friends.

See, I never saw it this way. Getting together to play is part of the experience. Also, that's no reason to not include LAN as an *option*. See Torchlight 2, for example. Solo, LAN, and online play as options. LAN play is fairly simple to set up compared to netplay over remote servers, despite the bullshit publishers and devs feed us about it today.","1385856370"

"circlejerk","t5_2qpol","Seriously. I'm gonna type a long winded sentence now about my life story reddit! I hope you enjoy! :D :D :D Okay, so it started in 1923. On 17 January 1921, the Sovnarkom of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic published ""About Air Transportation"". The document which was signed by Vladimir Lenin set out the basic regulations on air transport over the territory of the RSFSR. The document was significant as it was the first time that a Russian state had declared sovereignty over its airspace. In addition, the document defined rules for the operation of foreign aircraft over the Soviet Union's airspace and territory. After Lenin issued an order, a State Commission was formed on 31 January 1921 for the purpose of civil aviation planning in the Soviet Union. As a result of the commission's plans, Glavvozdukhflot (Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet) (Russian: Главвоздухфлот (Главное управление воздушного флота)) was established, and it began mail and passenger flights on the Moscow-Oryol-Kursk-Kharkov route on 1 May 1921 using Sikorsky Ilya Muromets aircraft.[12]:1 This was followed by the formation of Deruluft-Deutsch Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. in Berlin on 11 November 1921, as a joint venture between the Soviet Union and Germany. The company, whose aircraft were registered in both Germany and the Soviet Union, began operations on 1 May 1922 with a Fokker F.III flying between Königsberg and Moscow.[12]:2 The service was initially operated twice a week and restricted to the carriage of mail.[12]:2–3
On 3 February 1923 Sovnarkom approved plans for the expansion of the Red Air Fleet, and it is this date which was officially recognised as the beginning of civil aviation in the Soviet Union. After a resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Enterprise for Friends of the Air Fleet (ODVF) was founded on 8 March 1923, followed by the formation of Dobrolet (Russian: Добролёт) on 17 March 1923. Regular flights by Dobrolet from Moscow to Nizhniy Novgorod commenced on 15 July 1923. During the same period, an additional two airlines were established; Zakavia being based in Tiflis, and Ukrvozdukhput based in Kharkov.[12]:2 During 1923 an agreement was signed establishing a subdivision of Dobrolet to be based in Tashkent, which would operate to points in Soviet Central Asia. Services between Tashkent and Alma Ata began on 27 April 1924, and by the end of 1924 the subdivision had carried 480 passengers and 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) of mail and freight, on a total of 210 flights.[12]:6 In March 1924, Dobrolet began operating flights from Sevastopol to Yalta and Yevpatoriya in the Crimea. Dobrolet's route network was extended during the 1925–1927 period to include Kazan and regular flights between Moscow and Kharkov were inaugurated. Plans were made for Dobrolet flights to Kharkov to connect with Ukrvozdukhput services to Kiev, Odessa and Rostov-on-Don. During 1925, Dobrolet operated 2,000 flights over a distance of 1,000,000 kilometres (620,000 mi), carrying 14,000 passengers and 127,500 kilograms (281,100 lb) of freight, on a route network extending to some 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi).[12]:7 Dobrolet was transformed from a Russian to an all-Union enterprise on 21 September 1926 as a result of Sovnarkom resolutions, and in 1928 Dobrolet was merged with Ukrvozdukhput; the latter having merged with Zakavia in 1925.[12]:6–7
Formative years


The Tupolev ANT-20bis was used for cargo flights from Moscow to Mineralnye Vody before World War II
Responsibility for all civil aviation activities in the Soviet Union came under the control of the Chief Directorate of the Civil Air Fleet on 25 February 1932, and on 25 March 1932 the name ""Aeroflot"" was officially adopted for the entire Soviet Civil Air Fleet.[12]:10 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union Congress in 1933 set out development plans for the civil aviation industry for the following five years, which would see air transportation becoming one of the primary means of transportation in the Soviet Union, linking all major cities. The government also implemented plans to expand the Soviet aircraft industry to make it less dependent on foreign built aircraft;[12]:10–11 in 1930 some fifty percent of aircraft flying services in the Soviet Union were of foreign manufacture.[12]:8
Expansion of air routes which had taken shape in the late 1920s,[12]:8 continued into the 1930s. Local (MVL) services were greatly expanded in Soviet Central Asia and the Soviet Far East,[12]:11–13 which by the end of the second Five-Year Plan in 1937 was 35,000 kilometres (22,000 mi) in length out of a total network of some 93,300 kilometres (58,000 mi).[12]:13 The agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany relating to Deruluft expired on 1 January 1937, and wasn't renewed, which saw the joint venture carrier ceasing operations on 1 April 1937. On that date Aeroflot began operations on the Moscow to Stockholm route, and began operating the ex-Deruluft route from Leningrad to Riga utilising Douglas DC-3s and Tupolev ANT-35s (PS-35s). Flights from Moscow to Berlin, via Königsberg, were suspended until 1940, when they were restarted by Aeroflot and Lufthansa as a result of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and would continue until the beginning of the Great Patriotic War in 1941.[12]:5

"creepyPMs","t5_2ug83","No problem. Just wanted to quickly add that this kind of thing *can* happen to anyone. No one would have expected that she'd end up being abused (or putting up with it). She was a very confident and headstrong young woman. She'd known him for a couple of years before they got together, during which time he never gave off red flags. Then when they were married it started slow and very gradually became worse over a few years. She honestly thought it was stress at first, and she kept making excuses for him because he ""really was a good person"" (and to be honest, he had appeared to be a good person up til that point).

She left him, traveled and worked around Europe, returned to her home country and she is now married to a man who treats her well, no matter how upset he is. : ) Don't settle for less than that. (hugs)

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","As far as moving between the anime and manga are concerned, the swap is a rather simple one, both are comparable in terms of strength well before you enter the current material.

With regards to knowing what is going to happen in the anime, there are things that are explained better in the manga, and there are things explained better in the anime. I didn't understand a lot of the events in Punk Hazard until I saw the anime, cleared most of that right up. But at the same time I have a better feel for Law's character based on what I've seen of him in the manga (not just the stuff that's ahead of the anime, a lot of the jokes involving Law are just played off better in the manga.)

The interesting thing about the art style is that the way Oda drew the characters the fight scenes are still incredibly crisp in the manga. While the anime does the fights better (usually) you do not feel like you are missing out in the manga. This is part of the reason for the extreme body proportions of the crew.

Especially with the guilt I had.  But I am glad we got to work things out before he died.
I lost my job because they didn't want to give me time off, and I also had to drop out of school for that semester.  I got really deep into drugs and alcohol after he died and ended up getting arrested a few weeks after and spent a month in jail. Defiantly the worst part of my life.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","No! not at all.

I've experienced this. A LOT.
It's a mix of things, because.. on one hand, some people are chasing things so far away from themselves that they leave us behind. Like, they're not sticking with... Something, something true, they leave their hearts behind to pursue.. I don't know, medicate themselves away? Hard to explain I guess.

On the other hand, it can also be because we're just different from them. And by that I mean that something about us pulls towards something unique, and that something unique can sometimes pull us away from all the other people we know, because our.. like desires, you could say - our path, is very much.. in a unique direction.

Having the feelings that you have, especially if they aren't shared by others around you, means that you have a darker place, not a bad one, but one that other people may not want to feel.

I also think it means that a certain grace is a part of this, a certain level of greatness.

You may need to find a passion, a meaning that goes beyond the depth that the others have wanted to go towards.

As we get older, and we're not really taught this - part of us needs to expand, as we get more complicated. Our meaning and responsibility changes. Our values mean everything, sometimes - whether or not we feel like partying, what we watch, what we participate in, what kind of food we believe we need eat, it all CHANGES us, and people like us, we feel drawn towards something darker.

It's also because our level of responsibilty changes - we become more.. powerful - like.. we are the ones who are going to make the world a better place, right? It's up to us.!

All of our experiences change us, and sometimes we need to find people who are more into the experiences we have.

I hope that's helpful. Clothing and shows and stuff can be a way of finding others.

It may also help to bring people to you, like, playing music at places and stuff. I tell my friends I'm playing shows at this open mic, and if they want to come and see me at this open mic that's cool, you know?

I don't know I'm not super connected to what you're saying, even though I've been through it.

I've had to rage and scream and hate them, downright hate them for abandoning me. And to a large extent it was true, but I also realized that where I was going and what I wanted to become - it was a very different place than the futures that they were imagining for ourselves.

Maybe it's something like that - what kind of future are we painting? what are we creating?

We don't think about that enough, I think.. On Some level. I mean, we put so much towards creating the future, but a concrete understanding of where we will be and what we can do? I don't know.

Sometimes I think music is about creating that - creating the future

Let me know what you think about that

I think you can find new people. :) ","1385856384"

A couple examples from hadith:

""Satan sets his throne on the sea, then he sends off his troops; the closest to him (i.e., most beloved) is he who causes the greatest trial. One would come to him and Satan would ask him: ‘What did you do?’ and, he would reply: ‘I did such-and-such.’ satan would remark: ‘You have not done anything important.’ (This will continue) until one comes saying: ‘I did not leave him until he divorced his wife’, so satan would bring him near to himself, saying: ‘Yes, you are the one, you are the one’.”

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay here's what you do. 

You need two friends to help with the set up/execution of the plan. You'll also need a car, some kind of tv remote painted silver with some flashing LEDs on it, some duct tape, a blindfold, corn chips and candy of your choosing, a portable gaming device, some strobe lights and a dry ice machine, a secure safe house and 2 airline tickets for Panama. 

Step 1: you need to acquire some kind if document with Bradley Coopers handwriting on it. Then spend the next 2 months - 9 months learning to forge Coopers handwriting. Once this is done write a note declaring Coopers undying love for Renee Zellweger and stating that he can no longer live a lie and he is leaving. 

Step 2: with Step 1 complete you are now ready to action the plan. You will need to kidnap Cooper, with the held of your two friends. I would suggest outside the gym because he will be fatigue and less able to resist. Tie him up with the duct tape and blindfold him. Then drive him to an undisclosed safe house and hold him there. 

Step 3: break into Suki's house and plant the note somewhere where she will find it. She may think it's a joke at first but after a few days of not hearing from Cooper she will believe it. 

Step 4: you will have to closely follow Suki after step 3 is complete to figure out when it is a good time/place to action the next phase of the plan. This is where the corn chips, candy and hand held gaming device come in. This will be a tedious task and you are likely to get bored and hungry. You are looking for a point in her schedule where she will be on or near a public road, possibly while she is shopping. 

Step 5: now it's crunch time! Once you have picked the location you need one friend in the car and the other manning the strobe and dry ice machine. The friend in the car attempts to run Suki over. At the last second you appear in a flash of light and smoke (courtesy of your friend) and save her. 

Step 6: you'll need the tv remote we prepared earlier. You need to convince Suki that the remote is a time travel device and that you are her husband from the future. You came back to save her from assassins sent by Bradley. You also have to convince her she won't be safe in America. 

Step 7: once step 6 is complete all that is left to do is whisk Suki off to Panama and enjoy your life together. 

If you follow my instructions perfectly you should be able to achieve your goal. If this doesn't work I don't know what will. 

Good luck and God speed. 

Note: what you choose to do with Bradley Cooper is up to you.

With my first injury (a2 pulley rupture on ring finger after a sloppy dynamic move to a pocket, the classic) I got really frustrated and stopped climbing for almost half a year, and then I went full speed again. Not so smart. These days, I try to change my routine so I can keep climbing while recovering. 

So you won't be grabbing two finger pockets anytime soon, and given enough time and rest, it will heal. In the meantime, and after the initial healing phase you can start climbing again and work on stuff that doesn't involve locking off on small holds. Do core stability exercises, become a certified slab meister, work on endurance and on really easy routes, get used to open hand grip on holds that don't necessarily require crimping, find creative ways to climb harder while pulling less. You will likely emerge a better climber. Good luck! ","1385856399"

That being said, he has had a mediocre schedule this season and limited weapons. Additionally, his rushing yards have left something to be desired because they rarely run the pistol. He has mixed fantasy matchups the rest of the way, too.

In terms of next season, I think he's only going to get better as his career goes on and could be a great sneaky pickup next season if he falls later into the draft. It's tough to pinpoint his precise issues this season, but I think it's a mixture of a lack of chemistry and established trust without having Crabtree (and the fact that any decent corner can shut down the 49ers air attack without Crab). He also needs to be more decisive with his reads. He's not a finished product, but I have a lot of faith in his potential. For me, he's matchup based play ROS.","1385856402"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;But when you take into account statistics from other races and other cultures you see that there is more to it then the money. You have father statistics that just make me sad, and you have moms that hit their children far more often than other cultures. You have the anti education mentality going on, and it shows. You have drug problems and gun/gang violence statistics that don't show in the other cultures like they do here. Don't get me started on jail and prison statistics.

Your reasoning is circular here. Jail and prison statistics, drug problems, etc. are absolutely products of poverty, racism, and marginalization. Blacks don't commit crimes more than Whites do; they are, however, subject to harsher prison sentences. White collar crime is a huge issue in the United States, and is arguable more detrimental than ""street crimes"" that are more common in urban areas. Also, what are you even basing this concept of ""black culture"" on? Anti-education mentality? Huh?

&gt;So you can go as far as to say that they ended up where they are because of this (But I would still argue that the numbers are not really accounted for here. You have reasonably comparable poverty statistics for the other races. It's not so disproportionate as some people might want to say.)

I would argue that no other race has been subjected to oppression and racism (in regards to sheer scale and time frame) to the degree that the African people have. Besides, you can't really compare two cultures like that; there are so many other factors that come into play.

I agree that it is a complex issue. But the poverty and racism issue is **huge**. Blaming the state of a culture on individual members, or saying that it's somehow inherently ""bad"" is totally simplifying the issue.","1385856404"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Something about this comment struck a chord with me. My father was a hemophiliac who received HIV infected blood transfusions in the early 80s, and his life was utterly destroyed by it, and ultimately, taken from him.

He experienced severe discrimination at his work, his mom stopped talking to him and his father disowned him, he was asked to leave his deaconship at church, people burned ""FAGGOT"" in our front yard, my mom debated leaving him... We lived in a small Pennsylvania town, once word got around, he barely left the house because of the glares. It really made the last three years of his life difficult and miserable.

What sucks is that nobody really understood what AIDS was or how it was transmitted. It was heavily prevalent in the homosexual community, so if you had AIDS it was assumed you were gay, and you were definitely ostracized for it. Nobody would listen or even bother to ask him, and if they did, they wouldn't believe him. 

Edit: Wow, thank you for the kind words and gold... It's people like you all that make reddit such a worthwhile community that I'm happy to be apart of. I've commented on posts on this topic before and every time I am humbled.

Edit2: With it being the holiday season and Thanksgiving just passed, I'd like to end this on a happier note. My father was a compassionate person who couldn't bear to see others suffer. He ate with homeless Baltimore, MD citizens every trip to the hospital for treatments. To that end, here is a transcription of the letter he left me, which I have shared on reddit before. It brings me immense comfort and happiness. I realize it may seem sad, but **please read it with the understanding that my father was at peace with his passing and deserved to be free from the years of pain and suffering.** This Thanksgiving, I am thankful for the influence he has had in my life.

""My son,

Seldom in my life have I been lost for words as I am now. I still remember when I held you in my arms for the first time. Your little hand may have grasped my finger, but it captured my heart. I have been the best father I knew how to be. Raising you and your sister has been the most rewarding experience in my life.

This world is filled with so many things that I wish I could be there for you to experience, but that is not how it will play out. I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am for leaving you. It was never my intention, and if there was anything I could do to prevent it, please believe that I would.

There will be days when you blame God, me, and maybe your mom. You will curse and scream and cry, but you won't find any answers in anger. The measure of a man is not what he owns but how he owns himself. Accept that I have passed, and know that I will always be with you. No matter what you do in life, you will always be my son. I am proud of you. Keep after your mother and sister while I'm gone.

I love you.

Dad""","1385856405"

"netsec","t5_1rqwi","This is why projects like  [Novena](http://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page) are so important.  Piece by piece we need to open up the platform, firmware, and silicon, right now that laptop has open firmware, but it uses a Freescale arm cpu among other chips. We need to not only open cpus of the capacity of an ARM,  but also methods to check the chips for circuits in areas that don't seem to be used normally that might of been added rouge prefab, and verify they were not added postfab.

Projects such as [Simha Sethumadhavan's](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/) FANCI are slowly making progress is such objectives:   
&gt;FANCI: Identification of Stealthy Malicious Logic Using Boolean Functional Analysis (Best Student Paper Award, CCS 2013) ([pdf](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/preprint_ccs13.pdf)) Detecting stealthy hardware backdoors using static analysis.


If we can get the community to design the relatively easier and vital chips(motherboard storage controllers, external communication) like Ethernet, and get any large corporation like AMD, Intel, ARM to donate the most complicated chip, the cpu design(or do it ourselves if it comes to that), in an act of good faith and to help restore trust, even if the design is a bit dated, we could finally have all the tools and infrastructure to have a say on what is going on.  

While specifications like HDMI that probably will never have an open chip(if it does, then substitute the plethora of other propitiatory specifications), and the chips on hard drives themselves could be suspect, for example radio frequency remote activation and emitting information([""So I discovered that my HP laptop leaks/transmits its built-in mic audio somewhere around 24Mhz""](http://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/1le3if/so_i_discovered_that_my_hp_laptop_leakstransmits) ), they lose a lot of their bite when the wires that control them can be routed to mitigate such sidechannel attacks, and suspect features of the devices are not relied on.","1385856406"

In Trek's history there was a eugenics war and/or a World War 3 (depending on which narrative these are different wars or the same one) these conflicts drastically depopulate Earth just before first contact with the Vulcan explorers who discovered Earth (and bring humans into galactic society). 

From a fan theory pov you can argue that Earth's prosperity in the Trek canon is really the effects of rebounding populations and expansion due to colonization... but that ain't canon either. ","1385856412"

Oh, you mean when they groom a child? A child can not give consent. Tricking or manipulating a child into an act is incredibly easy. Why? Because they implicitly trust those older than themselves and have no experience or knowledge of just how sick and disgusting people like you can be. 

Coalinga is a perfect example of how well these ""thought exercises"" actually work. Warehouse them and warehouse them until awkwardly you realize there is no way to ""cure"" someone of a sexual impulse exclusively focused at children, there are only ways to prevent it. 

Love is not a crime, but a paedophile can never love a child. You are destroying their first forays into sexuality, you are destroying any sense of trust they may have, you are destroying their innocence. Anyone who has experienced love could never do that to a person they love.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","So the monarch anology does not exclude competition or alternative workplaces. There are many countries to move to but does the ability to live somewhere else really make up for having no democratic voice? Sorry if that point wasn't clear.

&gt; We've been seeing it (obsolete skills, cheaper labor, new techniques, changing demand) for generations of employees and the US has been and still is growing without worker-representation on the boards for the vast majority of companies.

The US is growing but for whom? Over the past 30+ years we've been seeing growing inequality and a shrinking middle class. The issue is not just changing technology. In last year's American presidential race we were introduced to Mitt Romney, who even the conservative Texas governor Rick Perry called a ""vulture capitalist"". His business model was to take over controlling shares of a company on the cheap, sack the employees, gut the company and rake the short term profits. While this enriched him and a few of his partners, it did not help the overall economy. One such company was K&amp;B Toys. Kids still play with toys and games, that hasn't changed, but it is possible that during an economic boom K&amp;B had grown bigger than what the demand for toys could handle. That wasn't the worker's fault though and there are different solutions to that problem. It might mean downsizing, or it might be retooling their stores to include other products or investing in online markets? If workers were presented with a management board advocating one of these solutions vs. just outright dismantling the company for the benefit of only a few investors, which do you think they'd choose?

&gt; If the company kept with textiles as the workers wanted, the company would have been bankrupt today and everyone would have lost their jobs.

I guess there's examples both ways. Again this is why I'm arguing for a compromise. I don't think the two-tiered board system would've prevented Buffet from saving the company, but it's possible he would've had to work harder. But I do believe this system of encouraging compromise is good. If economic prosperity excludes stake holders, workers and the majority of the population then what's the point of it all?

The world seemed a brighter place with him in it, and we seemed so perfect for each other, but over time he became obsessed with the fact I'd had previous boyfriends and it manifested in his mind turning him to cheating numerous times and both mentally &amp; physically abusing me.
Throughout the relationship he hadn't been diagnosed but I always felt there was something not quite right. A few years after we split he told me he was bi polar and is doing a lot better now. 
This hurt the most because I knew it wasn't him hurting me, just a chemical imbalance, but by the time he'd sorted himself out I couldn't take it anymore. 
I still think of him every day and how one medical condition can ruin lives. It makes me so sad to think that he has to handle it for the rest of his life and always be wary of whether the thoughts he's having are normal or not.","1385856418"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Sorry, I was trying to explain my reasoning, since you had a massive problem with my apparent assumptions.

My problem is this: your post does not fit with the other's. It's a joke about RL redditors on the opposite spectrum being trapped in a room. Followed by the insinuation that the fact some have guns and some don't might end badly. And then you say ""My .45 and 12 gauge disagree with that sentiment."" What does that even *mean*? What about the sentiment of the OP do your guns disagree with? That one of these two groups don't like guns? That the fact one group has guns and the others doesn't *won't* end badly?

I don't see how to make this any clearer since I have repeated this from my very first post: you bringing up guns was *completely* irrelevant to the discussion. It added nothing, if it was a joke, I don't see what was meant to be funny? Are you a part of one of these two groups? Which one?

Bringing up that you own guns for no good reasons is like me bringing up the fact that maybe I slept with a famous person last night, and then me denying that I'm bragging. What place did your comment have here?

EDIT: to say, just to make that clear, was not bring up the fact I slept with a famous person last night, but as a similar example rather than most examples on Reddit than include Hitler and/or some other abomination.","1385856420"

"" What I’ve come to understand about science and religion is that they are both valuable tools, but they each come with their own set of limitations. It’s critical to understand what they have to teach, but it’s also important to understand the limitations of what they CAN teach. Science, for example, can only gather data about what’s empirically observable in the past and present of physical space. This might seem all-encompassing, but stuff like consciousness is very difficult to empirically measure, so science turns a blind eye to it, even though it’s quite literally the most important thing about our entire existence.

Religion can give us wisdom and philosophy passed through generations, but we should never rely on any small specific detail being factually true. It is ridiculous to claim that any religious text is the infallible word of God. We should study religions for the messages imparted by the people who thought that all this stuff was important enough to write down (back when doing so was no easy task), but we can’t allow them to block our minds from receiving new information. Even if religious texts are largely fiction, sometimes there’s a greater truth to fiction in a deeper philosophical sense. Once you start appreciating religions on that level, the core differences between them start to melt away.""

"FutureWhatIf","t5_2v3da","For the first few days, it might be okay. Flights don't get delayed as often, homes are safe from storms wrecking havoc on their roofs and walls, you can walk out with your things without worrying about  you or your stuff getting wet, public events can stay open longer, days aren't too gloomy, and places that receive flooding annually can take a breather. But as time goes on, weathermen, meteorologists and the general public alike begin to notice a problem. 
 
In America, in the Midwest in particular begins to experience lots of drought. On the west coast forest fires begin to ravage everything. Closed bodies of water such as lakes start to dry up. Goodbye great lakes. Rivers shrink as the drought spreads nationwide. Though we have massive aquifers (like the Ogallala Aquifer) to satisfy us for a bit longer, with no rain they begin to dry up even faster as we take more and more water from them, and just like that they're gone completely. Crops that depend on these aquifers slowly begin to die out. Farmers take the hardest fall, and now penniless because their main source of income is gone, they are forced to move and find prospect elsewhere. The breadbasket of the world crumbles and Americans alike awake to find that store shelves are dwindling. Growing concern turns an orderly fashioned line of citizens waiting their turn into a zoo where it’s every man for himself. Martial law is implemented after weeks turn into months with no rain and water dwindling. Water overtakes gold and silver as the number one trading item. Around this time, we've probably turned to desalinization of the oceans to curb this growing crisis. The process is quite expensive and as a result, our economy begins to shows signs of fracture. With not enough water to meet the demand, most of North America is left in ruins. Society collapses and the US economy takes a nose-dive, taking Europe and most of East Asia with it.

The lack of rain begins to affect people globally and places like rainforests die out, and the millions of species that thrive there all go extinct. Goodbye “Lungs of the World.” Mass extinctions start to occur as the food chain begins to break down.  Livestock die with no water left to give them. Meat that was plentiful at one point goes scare and humanity is pushed back to the Paleolithic age. The Sahara and Kalahari deserts grow and quickly consume all of Africa, causing millions to die and war to erupt everywhere. The Middle East, especially in places like Dubai return back to the desert whence they came and that cushion of wealth evaporates. Governments have agreed to use the freshwater from the ice caps to supply the survivors with freshwater, but this ultimately exacerbates climate change dooming us even further. 

Perhaps we've begun to seed the clouds by now and force rain that way, but by the time we've done so the damage has already been done.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","The whole thing you aren't realizing is that the OP wants to get the ""pedophiles"" help BEFORE they act, to prevent these acts from ever taking place. As for ""Forgiveness is for those that do something forgivable."" That's completely relative to the person. What you find completely abhorrent and atrocious, (not necessarily this) someone else could find perfectly normal and forgivable. Some people forgive their spouses for cheating on them, and try to make the relationship work. Others completely break off the relationship and block the cheater out of their lives. In extreme cases some people would even go to violent crime or murder in revenge to being cheated on. I'm not disagreeing that pedophilia is a terrible crime and of course it can't be undone, but that leads me to agree even more with the OP in the fact that we need to make it apparent that we can help get these people counseling, therapy, or whatever it takes to help them before it escalates to the point of the action even taking place.","1385856431"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","I am currently using this setup with my rear-projection TV. I thought about replacing it, but there is nothing wrong with the TV, it's still HD, and the huge size is worth the built in surround sound. I'd also be spending almost $1000 for the same setup but with an LCD/Plasma. The value of rear-projections might have depreciated, but that doesn't make them cheap.

I have an HDMI to Component box, but I only paid $40. I wouldn't purchase this from Best Buy because you're only going to find prices like that.

I originally bought the box for my Apple TV (I've also used it to HDMI my laptop to the TV), but when the One came out, I decided to try it first before buying a new TV. Works great after changing a few settings, and I didn't have any HDCP issues.

Initially both balls move down at the same time, in the same way, and when the system of two balls hits the ground, they are going at a velocity v - found from this equation: mv^2/2 = mgh. Then comes the tricky part. The basketball below bounces back and instead of having a velocity of -v, now it has +v. So the velocity changed by 2v. However, the tennis ball bounces OFF the basketball, so if you fiddle with the frames of references, eventually you'll realise the the tennis ball is traveling upwards at 3v after the bounce. Solve the trivial equations to find the height of the ball and H = 9h + d."")

[Answer (b)](#s ""Do the same as before, and now you get a sequence of velocities for the highest ball. It goes {v, 3v, 7v, 15v, ...} Basically (2x + 1)v if x is the velocity of the ball below you. Interesting, this ends up being (2^n - 1)v for the nth ball. The mathematical proof is left to the reader because it is interesting. Now you can solve this for the height and get H = l + (2^n - 1)^2 h. Piece of cake."")


[Answer (c)](#s ""Here you merely APPLY the answer of the previous section. If you have h = 1 and H = 1000, you can see that l is going to be insignificant (also because you can't possibly know l).

"chemicalreactiongifs","t5_2u506","&gt; At the nano scale. Hence nano-technology.

Just because something exists at the nanoscale does not make it technology. From Google:

**tech·nol·o·gy** *tekˈnäləjē/* n. 1.

• the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, esp. in industry.

• machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.

• the branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences.

Butterflies certainly use nano*structures*, but nobody engineered them. Nobody applied scientific knowledge to develop them. No sentient being made a conscious choice to employ them. So they simply aren't nano*technology*. 

&gt; Yes there is [a ""lie"" going on], unless iridescence is not a thing anymore. There's clearly a difference between the two and pretending like there isn't is pointless.

Lying implies intent. For example, even if you say something that turns out to be false, if you honestly believed it to be true when you said it and you had no intent to deceive, you weren't lying per se. Since ""nature"" is not a conscious or sentient entity, it can't have intent. So it's completely nonsensical to say ""nature is lying."" The word ""lie"" might be used for illustrative / hyperbolic effect, but it's not an actual lie.

Hate to break it to you and your upvoters, but big_dingus is right: the statement ""butterflies use nanotechnology to lie about their color"" is utter bullshit. If the video had said ""butterflies use nanostructures to appear as a different color (than they otherwise would)"" it would be an accurate sentence that means what they're trying to say.

They would. Good idea. You have to be really careful how you do it, with strict instructions (not yet written) for programmers (that would include not storing keys in RAM for too long. Even DRAM has persistence, see ""practical cryptography"") and operators (power down machine completely after generating key).

Operationally, making the TPM do it is easier, and easier means harder to do incorrectly.

&gt; Or even more extreme solution, having an airgapped computer with only purpose to generate keys.

The key still has to exist in RAM on the target system in that case, since the TPM is programmed on that machine.

&gt; Getting entropy would probably be an issue unless you get hwrng, which would possibly create similar trust issues that generating keys directly on device.

Right. The TPM is already the RNG at the moment, so it'd be a question of whose RNG you trust most. I'd trust an auditable software one seeded by many RNGs most.","1385856437"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Hang on, while we're ""admitting"" things; in light of my argument, can you now admit that I did not, as you claim, commit an argument from fallacy, and that you were wrong about that?

In the original comment, you were totally committing the fallacy fallacy (basically negated in your reply, though, you're right on that). By just posting a wikipedia page on a fallacy, it's not remotely a stretch to interpret that as dismissive or even a little hostile, the latter especially kicking in if the person is already in a defensive mode. Given the average source, it reeks of implications like ""your argument is bad because of this fallacy,"" with a dash of ""it's not worth my time explaining it to you."" Second one's a pet peeve of mine; if you're honestly trying to sway someone or initiate a discussion, at the very least give them the respect of explaining how it relates to their words or their concepts, using the fewest assumptions you can about the extent of their beliefs. 

Also, even if you weren't committing the fallacy fallacy in your head, you said nothing else implying otherwise. Most people don't know about formal logic, and even out of those who do, most don't do much (or any) research into it. *note: whether you are or aren't one of these people is not the point of this reply, it ended up mostly as tips for initiating productive critical discussion* 

&gt;Letting somebody know the problem with their argument is useful for a number of reasons:

&gt;1. It lets other readers know that the argument is invalid and so not to trust the conclusion based on it.
&gt;1. It provides the opportunity for the person to try to make a better argument in support of their conclusion, rather than people just read their initial argument then ignore it because it's invalid.
&gt;1. It educates the person who made the argument as to the fact that the argument they used is invalid, which means they can avoid making the same mistake in the future.
&gt;1. It's useful for others to see why an argument is invalid so that they don't then repeat it to others while erroneously thinking that it supports the conclusion.

Here's the thing: I don't think the way you critiqued his argument educated anyone at all. People aren't swayed by posts entirely consisting of a quote and a link to the wikipedia page on a fallacy. 1. You didn't relate it to the reasoning behind what they said, just some offhand comment they made. 2. They probably just think you're being a dick, and I don't see them modifying their own argument or changing their minds by what can easily be interpreted as someone being a dick. 3&amp;4. Not changing their minds means they will keep doing it in the future. 

Your reply later negated the fallacy fallacy for sure, and it's a shame the other guy didn't play along and explain his pattern of thinking, but you probably should have included a condensed version of that in your original post. If your main point can be summarized in a link, explain what parts of the link apply to what parts of the other person's post. I pretty much auto-dismiss replies to me that are basically, ""here's an 18-minute video that may obliquely address part of your argument"" or ""here's a wikipedia page on a thing"" and nothing else, because 

1. unless you relate your point specifically to a thing I said, it implies a lack of understanding of the subject matter in general. If you aren't showing you understand what you and/or the other person are talking about, or asking questions, you're not likely to change anyone's mind. 
2. a video or an article cannot reply to questions that aren't already posed in the video or article, so if I have what I believe is evidence that refutes something that the video/article assumes is true, there's no one to prove my counterargument wrong so as far as I've seen, I've had the last word and my opponent cannot respond, meaning I'm still winning

&gt;I'm unsure why you accuse me of that, since I did not ""GTFO"", and am in fact here responding to not only you, but to the person who made the argument after he responded, which, incidentally, was before you wrote your reply to me.

When I said ""GTFO"" it was just a colorful way of saying ""end your point right there."" Generally, if you actually want to initiate a productive, respectful, and non-confrontational discussion, don't even bring up fallacies until you've already established mutual respect. Never assume the other person is familiar with formal logic unless they show they do (or attempt to), because damn near no one is actually familiar with formal logic. For most people, telling them that their argument contains a fallacy implies their entire argument is invalid; and telling them that their argument is fallacious implies that their argument is wrong. (rather, it's inferred, but I'm not rearranging that sentence)

Instead of posting a wikipedia link to a fallacy, or even explaining why the guy's argument included a fallacy, I think the best route would have just been to directly question things he said. Something like:

*&gt;quote what the guy said*

    ""I've heard this sometimes but I've never really bothered to ask.
    Break it down, how does point A end up at point Z?"" 

    (or ""How does this work?"" or ""I'm unfamiliar with this topic, please 
    explain"" or ""I'm on the fence about this issue, please clarify"" or some 
    other question dependent on what fallacy you believe the other 
    person is making)

or if you feel like you *must* bring up the fallacy, maybe even straight up but respectfully:

    ""I believe that in this quote, you commit [some kind of fallacy]. I'm
    sure you have more to say on the matter, can you explain your
    reasoning behind this?""

Basically:

1. Question specific elements of their argument to get their attention (you did this part well enough, too)
2. Use your own words in a non-hostile way to get them to respect you
3. Avoid assumptions about the other person or their beliefs
4. Actually ask them to clarify the element you're questioning to show that you're treating them like a person instead of a stranger who it's okay to make snap judgments about
5. Keep in mind that most people don't bother explaining why they believe a thing to be true/false or good/bad *unless* specifically questioned about it. If you're really interested in the pursuit of truth, or even if your mind is made up and you just want someone to recognize a flaw in their reasoning, the most productive assumption you can make is that **everyone has a reason as to why they believe the thing they believe.** 

Wait for them to explain it as far down as they can until they reach a loop or start avoiding answers to very specific questions. Watch out for loops in your reasoning, and don't evade questions about your own beliefs. 

Wow, I rambled long as hell. 

*tl;dr - if your reply is centered around pointing out a fallacy or fallacies, you're going to come off looking like a dick. How to get a conversation started or get your point across without looking like a dick: avoid using the word ""fallacy"" unless you have previously established that you aren't a dick, ask clarifying questions, explain your own reasoning, give explanations/summaries of sources and how they relate to the thing, base your gentleness vs. harshness level on how you and the other person stand in relation to others who are also replying or voting.*

&gt;Ironically, I can't see what value this conversation is adding to the discussion.

I'm hoping to change your mind on what you see is a productive way to start a well-thought-out dialogue.","1385856437"

They've only announced 2 festivals in Germany so far, but there will be more dates getting announced, and they'll likely appeal more than a 4 day festival with such a hodge-podge of music like Rock Am Ring has.

I've been to Europe 3 times for Maiden gigs, and **as long** as you keep your trip to a reasonable amount of time (~7-10 days), watch flights daily for the best deals, and don't care about 5 star hotels, you'd be surprised how (relatively) affordable it is to go to Europe.

"FL_Studio","t5_2rig0","I'm going to have to make a tutorial or some post one of these days but make sure you understand these things:

***Basic composition:
For example, things should be done in 8-16 bar rounds. In a dubstep track you're safest with a 16 bar drop after 32 bars (around 55 seconds). 

Make sure you understand basic orchestration and sound design, 3xOsc is one of the best native plugins and learn massive, sytrus (to a basic extent) and get some cool plugins like CamelCrusher. Know how to manipulate sounds. Sampling is nice too, and if you have the time re-sampling is enormously useful in Dubstep production.

Make sure you understand the different native plugins. Know how to use delay, reverb, etc.

And learn EQ. Very well. Mix at -6db, learn basic mastering, turn off the limiter on the master track when you're making the track, and cut the low frequencies off every sound that is not the sub bass or the kick drum (if you're sidechain compressing)

Learn by doing and compare your tracks to the real deal.","1385856442"
"writing","t5_2qh2n","I don't plan scenes out; at least not directly. I consider my outline as my obstacle course; all of the things I need to get across and when. The actual writing is me negotiating that course. 

Each ""obstacle"" is just a point I'm trying to get across. ""Villain A is bad."" ""Hero A wants this."" ""Hero B is being held back from doing something because of his own self-doubt stemming from his disappointing past and his lack of a support system to give him the strength to act,"" etc.

So, what's the point of every scene you write, and is it necessary? A lot of these will be obvious; to drop a key plot point or character development. I'd argue that this method is much less constraining; you can do all sorts of things to get a point across if you know specifically what point that is.","1385856442"

&gt; The coach signed his new contract a few weeks after ending speculation that he would leave for an NFL team after leading the Tigers to the Bowl Championship Series title, their first national championship in more than four decades.

we know how that turned out


and with Miami Dolphins

&gt;On November 27, 2006, The University of Alabama announced that head coach Mike Shula had been fired. Nick Saban was rumored to be at the top of Alabama's wish list, but Saban refused to discuss the job while his NFL season was still underway.[22] During the month of December 2006, Saban was repeatedly questioned by the media about the Alabama job, and he repeatedly denied the rumors in his weekly press conferences, stating on December 21 ""I guess I have to say it. I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.""

Nothing is official until the season starts.

That would have been way more fun than the truth, which was that he split my lip open for the 20th time, dumped a gallon of milk over my head, and spit in my face, and then I moved away to live in a cockroach infested studio apartment, bawling my eyes out alone and miserable for the better part of the next 2 years until I finally got over it.","1385856446"

"TEFL","t5_2qq76","I don't think I can disagree with any of what you said.  The more I read your post the less sure I was that you were being 100% serious with it...

The writer is pretty all-over-the-place with her points, really.  I honestly question the validity of 'asking students what they think good teaching is' if you're dealing with kids.  Myself, I deal 90% with adults so anyone there is taking lessons having selected the school from among the competition; they've chosen because they like the teaching.  I speak some Japanese and my students know this right from the start; I agree with the writer that knowing your teacher has studied a language too and is genuinely interested in your culture is really helpful for students.  But like you, if they ask me a question or supply an answer in Japanese, I will try and get them to use English, because sometimes it's a lack of vocab but other times it absolutely is laziness.  I believe in stretching them anyway.

Culturally I think Catalonia is kind of a special case here; a cultural crossroads in which Spanish and Catalan are both already acknowledged to be valid and strong cultures, and neither of which is in imminent danger of being squashed by English-speaking cultures (at least I don't imagine it's so; maybe not, you tell me).  I'd agree that your students don't really have much to worry about with that.  But many other places do.  

Japan sees more and more encroachment of English into language, often with significant modification of both phonics and meaning, such that ""That's Japanese English"" is something I'll be guaranteed to say multiple times every day.  Besides that, it's a basic requirement for university entrance and many people study and take tests because it translates directly into a larger salary.  The tests people take and the language they study are largely dry and utterly humourless, and school and test English is dreadful, ancient and irrelevant to their lives, or indeed to actual communicative English, so in my context, it's not so much that Japanese culture is in danger of being suppressed, it's that English-speaking cultures are in danger of being totally misunderstood and in all likelihood loathed, not to mention resented because of the importance attached to it.

Love the idea of your election debate.  I've never done that, but I do base many free conversation lessons around contemporary topics in the local news or culture.  I've also had some really interesting comparative debates about stuff like feminism and business culture.","1385856447"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was raped. I was 17 and a stupid teenager. I went to a typical highschool party and the guy I had been seeing was there. I got really drunk really fast and I get really flirty and promiscuous when I'm drunk. So I was all over him and makin him think I wanted to have sex. Well then I got sick and started puking so that thought quickly went away for me. The party was at one of my good friends house so she told me I could go in her room to lay down. So drunk me stumbled up to her room and collapsed....i forgot to lock tho door. I remember slipping out of consciousness and then seeing tho door open and close I thought it was my friend but ibwas wrong. He got on the bed and started asking if I was ok I said yes and then he started kissing me and kissing my neck and pulling my shirt and unbuttoning my pants. I kept saying no no not right now. But ibwas just to drunk to fight back. He said you wanted this! I kept saying no but he ignored me and continued. It seemed like it lasted for hours. I dint sleep that night or for many nights after that. I went home the next day and sat in the shower for at least 2 hours long after the water ran cold. I just felt like filth like the pure scum of the earth. I knew it was my fault I brought it on myself and I didn't tell anybody I didn't call the cops. I got pregnant from it and had to have an abortion from it. This was the summer before my senior year. He had told everybody that ii had wanted it and the only person I told about my abortion my so callin best friend told everybody when she found out what the guy was saying to everybody. When I went back to school I had no friends and was labeled as the school slut and my car was keyed with the words ""baby killer"" into the side of it. Its taken me a long time to come to terms with it. I've never told my mom about it. I have been hospitalized for suicide and depression twice and all my therapists say that is the root of my depression. I haven't forgotten it I probably never will but I can live my life now and it has taken me a long time to trust men again but my boyfriend now is great and I wouldn't trade him for anything.","1385856449"

How can one make this claim either way reliably? Which is worse, rape or murder? Being objectified for your looks, or that your suffering is less of a concern?

&gt;Historically throughout the majority of all of known history men have always had advantages over women.

More accurately some men have, and even as a group men didn't have all the advantages.

&gt; In fact, until the last few centuries women where mainly considered property of their husbands or fathers and had no say in their lives.

No, that is conflating coverture and chattel marriage, the former of which has been the normal for centuries in the West.

&gt; It was common for husbands and fathers to assert violence if they wished without repercussion, see the rule of thumb

There is zero evidence as to that being the origin of ""rule of thumb"".

&gt;It was only in the early 1900's that women even began to gain rights of normal citizens, being allowed to vote, have careers, and even a say in their reproductive rights or well being.

Um, the pill and modern abortion techniques had not been invented yet. Further, most men could not vote for most of history as well.

&gt;I would reference you to the movie The Invisible War

The Invisible War is a classic example of picking a few extreme examples and treating that as the norm for a political narrative. The actual evidence says otherwise, and a command's response and training regarding sexual assault is not at all like what media portrays. Anyone who has been in the military is aware of this.

Here are some more sources for domestic and sexual violence victimization:

I have some more showing evidence of female perpetrated sexual victimization of males in prison by staff if you like, but will have to hunt it down again.

&gt;I have no expertise in this field, so perhaps my claim was unfounded, though I would love to see evidence for, and against my viewpoints (my comment has garnered enough attention that I am getting quite tired of trying to research every claim made be each individual on my own).

[Here is a pretty good list](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11lsrw/feminist_myth_of_women_earning_072_to_a_mans_1/c6nmfiv), and a discussion about some of its nuances to some degree as well.

Things to inquire about are CBT treatments for anxiety. Strictly speaking, AvPD is only somewhat similar to General Anxiety Disorder (but more similar to Social Anxiety Disorder), but the techniques of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy are generally applicable to both, and highly effective.

CBT focuses on how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors interact with each other, and how modifying one can modify the others. CBT can modify the way you analyze situations, so your symptoms end up muted.

I have also heard that Kantor's books on AvPD are very useful, but I haven't started in on them yet.

Full disclosure, the reason I'm so knowledgeable on this topic is because I recently realized that I have AvPD, in particular, so it's a learning process for me as well. AvPD is not very well known, but there is good material out there.","1385856457"

1/4 cup flour, seasoned with salt and pepper

1 tablespoon (1 turn around the pan) extra-virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons butter

2 cloves garlic, chopped

1 large shallot, finely chopped

1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

1 cup dry white wine

1 cup chicken broth or stock

1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice

1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined

12 leaves fresh basil, shredded or torn
1 lemon, zested

Hot, crusty bread, for plate mopping
Serving Suggestions: Asparagus with Prosciutto
Dessert Suggestions: Lemon sorbet dessert cups


Lightly coat the sea scallops in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Discard remaining flour.


Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil (1 turn around the pan) and butter. When butter melts into oil, add scallops. Brown scallops 2 minutes on each side, then remove from pan.


Add an additional drizzle of olive oil to the pan and add the garlic, shallots, and crushed red pepper flakes. Reduce heat a little and saute garlic and shallots 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add wine to the pan and free up any pan drippings. Reduce wine 1 minute, then add stock, tomatoes and saffron threads. When liquids come to a bubble, add shrimp and cook 3 minutes. Return scallops to the pan and cook shrimp and scallops 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer shrimp and scallops to a warm serving dish and top with basil and lemon zest.

She told me by text she was doing it. Called when she got to his house to gloat. She'd been planning it since we moved into a place together. She had me thinking that, everything was just so much more expensive in this area.. I had to live off bread, cans of spaghetti and butter most of the time. 

We had been married three years. I never thought I could feel so many things so strongly at once. It was a few days before I could really do anything but.. what broke me is realizing my shit job couldn't pay for anything but rent.

Always told me we were forever, that she'd love me even though I was transitioning, I'd have done anything for her and I didn't care what she did, I just wanted her back...

What really broke me, was having to leave my home of three years.. The only place I've ever felt comfortable to live in this fucking garage. So much of my shit had to just get thrown away so I could move it. All the furniture I'd saved for months to buy, the paintings I'd made for her, our photo albums.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","The thinking among many Americans -- I am a gun-owner myself but do not share this mindset -- is that private firearms ownership is somehow essential to our liberty. That is clearly nonsensical, for the obvious fact that no personal arsenal can stand against a national military. It would be like me hoping that buying low-fat foods might prevent me from eventually dying. Many of my fellow citizens seem to have some bizarre notion that they could hole up and plink feds and get something out of that. The only thing I can imagine that getting anyone is dead. I consider it a very chidish notion, but it's apparently common.

I've got nothing against gun owership -- as I said, I'm an owner myself -- but I've also got nothing against laws limiting ownership or use, since I make no rational connection between that and civil liberties. Even as gun owner, I see the Second Amendment as woefully outdated and not rationally applicable in our time. And I firmly maintain that it's gotten a lot of people killed for no reason or need whatsoever.

Related to that, we also indulge a robust national paranoia along with a very stupid notion that many problems are solveable with violence. When you combine all that, it's not hard to understand why our gun death rate is more than three times yours.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","To be completely honest, despite how much I used to argue with Capslock, there aren't many players capable or willing to theorycraft. Capslock is one of the few that actually can. Also, to theorycraft you usually need a group of good and experienced players to bounce ideas and test them. Random people, who, statistically speaking, aren't good at the game, will probably not get anywhere theorycrafting alone.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I am a vegetarian, and have been for more years than I can remember...7 maybe? 

I used to eat meat, and think nothing of it. It wasn't until a high school science trip to the Body Worlds exhibit that I began to see things differently. I realized before, that what I was eating was an animals body. Everyone knows that. But somehow, it just never realllly registered with me. When I saw the first dissected body, I immediately thought ""oh my god, this, looks exactly like the meat I eat. I have been eating another animals body"". It then really hit me. How would I feel, if I was one of these animals, potentially tortured before i'm slaughtered, butchered, and eaten?? I couldn't imagine. I've always loved animals, and was horrified. How could I do this? 

My family was at the time, strictly carnivorous, and I knew very well my mother would not take it well if I went vegetarian. I pretended not to be hungry so I wouldn't have to eat the meat, but I could only hide it for so long. Thanksgiving came days later and I was too scared to face my mother's wrath. The next day, I had a leftover ham sandwich for lunch. I forced myself to take a bite, and got a vein stuck in my teeth. I started to cry, and that was the last bite of meat I've ate. 

I very much feel that all life is very precious. Human life, and wildlife alike. I know I don't need animal products to live and thrive; I have been thriving for many years. If my health was deteriorating, I would have ate the meat. But, if I can thrive without causing unnecessary death, why eat it? Why cause that fear and pain in an innocent and helpless animal? 

You may not see it the same way I do, and that's perfectly ok. To each his own.","1385856461"

Everyone, seriously, everyone goes through periods of unbelief. No-one escapes the dark night of the soul. Even the saints write about praying with a dry heart, about spiritual dryness and deserts. You may wish to simply turn away from those who say you can't be Catholic if you're experiencing this. If that were true, there wouldn't be many Catholics in the world.

Instead, look on the positive side. Keep going to Mass, keep reading, keep acting in the world (your charitable works, etc.), remembering Matthew 7:21 (""Not those who say, Lord! Lord!, but those who do the will of my Father""). Your faith may return to you when you least expect it.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","You're calling your deck aggro-midrange, and technically, that's not wrong.  However, you seem to be using the worse parts of each.  Shock Trooper fits in a burn deck, or maybe as a 1-of in an aggro deck's sideboard if there's some weird meta call for it.  Ghor-Clan is another card that's just better for aggro, but you might be able to make him work in here.  Really, aggro-midrange deck should either be big aggro (meaning that your creature curve rests mostly at the 1-2 spot with a few curve-toppers.  Google ""sledgehammer red"" for a good example) or low-curve midrange.  Burning-tree emissary is a good card that might actually work if you moved your deck in a certain direction, but she just doesn't mesh with your deck as-is.  In order to play her, I want at least 6 other creatures that cost 1r, 1g or RG.  Boros Reckoner  just doesn't work with this mana base.  You have 6 lands that can't cast him, and if you play one of those lands early, you delay him coming down on curve.  If you play around this and play non-forests when he's in your hand, you delay your other creatures coming down on-curve.  I'd take out it, Mindsparker, Spark Troopers and BTE for more call of the conclave, selesnya charm and mizzium mortars.","1385856463"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","As I've told a bunch of people just starting out in a language, I recommend forgoing the books and step by step guides. Pick a project and learn as you go. Start by making a console window display ""Hello world!"" like normal, then progress naturally from there. Make it so the user can input their name, and the program says, ""Hello &lt;your name here&gt;!"" Progress further and make a number guessing game out of it where the user gets three tries. 

Google what you need to know. Google ""echo to console java"" and one of the first results is [this](http://www.particle.kth.se/~lindsey/JavaCourse/Book/Part1/Java/Chapter02/printConsole.html). You don't need a book or a guide, you're a smart human being and can figure things out without being spoon-fed by an author! If you have any questions you can't find using Google, you can always post here!

If you need the very basic, initial set up (like a code editor, a compiler, etc.), you can use [this guide thing](http://java.about.com/od/gettingstarted/ss/firstprogram_2.htm). It'll walk you through the first Hello World thing so that you can get a fundamental grasp on how to run Java programs and stuff.

The coding part you should try to figure out on your own though, through Google and stuff.","1385856467"

"politics","t5_2cneq","What you're forgetting is that it's extremely easy to simply lie on the applications for food programs to get more money than what they are ""owed"" through it.  I've seen it time and time again; people not disclosing all of their income or assets or all of the people who live in their house.  Let's say there is an elderly, disabled couple and they get on food stamps.  But, out of those food stamps, they're feeding 2 additional unemployed people in the house that shouldn't even be there that they **don't** disclose.  Or there are 2 additional employed people in the house (but if reported, would disqualify them for more benefits).  Regardless, money intended to feed only 2 feeds 4 and undermines the purpose of the program.

There are people out there that legitimately need assistance and are trying. But, the system is so easy to game and manipulate that we end up with huge amounts of waste and the politicians use it as a football to kick back and forth because people get emotionally involved in the issue of feeding children &amp; the elderly and they know that.  So, it becomes one of their favorite bargaining chips.  

The programs don't offer real help; they offer the illusion of help, a temporary band-aid.  Food assistance doesn't remove all incentive to better yourself, but it does make the pain of a situation easier to bear and makes a person less likely to act and sometimes, the assistance itself ends up being a trap.  My elderly mother couldn't go to work as a cashier to bring more money into the house because my elderly father would lose his disability benefits.  It would actually **cost** them money for her to go to work. The system isn't designed to help people out of poverty, it's designed to keep them **in** it.

Now, lets go back to the illusion of help. Every decision that a human makes is based on pain, where real, implied or imagined, but none the less pain. It can come in many forms like mental anguish that can broadcast into every aspect of the human mind. Your pain may be working 12 hours to the point that you would want better working hours for the same money. You can stay at the job in a self imposed misery or you can find one that fits you. What pain s worse? Finding the new job, or dealing with the extra hours? No matter what decisions you make, they are pain based or a fear of pain.

When I can lay here and play videos for a living (government pays), why should I work? I actually know people who admittedly state that they work for the government! But doing what? They say ""living my life"".

Yes, these are real world examples that I have personally seen with my own two eyes.

It is the illusion of help, because to the human mind, they have become dependent on the government. ","1385856469"

Your first step is to rework your code to let it breathe. Something like [**this**](http://pastebin.com/g7CVd9zC).

"bestofworldstar","t5_2ttoo","That's not the point. Every name derives from something. English names are usually Christian or Roman hence they have a 2000 year old tradition. They are used to honor saints and other influential people of the past and they became part of our culture. If it's not Christian it's usually Norse/Pagan. Those names are also not that uncommon. Now let's disregard the fact that black US-Americans have practically nothing to do with Africa.  
 So they want to take an African name?  
 Good, there is a ton of names from Africa that are pretty popular. Now they would have to choose the language (which they don't speak). You can't take European influenced languages like Afrikaans so they'd have to stick to black african dialects. Sharkeisha is not part of those languages. Names aren't inventable. You can't take an animal and add some ""african sounding"" syllable to it. That's like calling white kids ""*cow*eal"" or ""*horse*us"". This is not only stupid regarding your kids future but it's also pretty stereotypical. Africans find it actually offensive if somebody just assumes that they make ""weird noises"" or have ""weird names that end with ""eisha"". ","1385856478"

- Instead of taking up a bullet under Education, move the expected graduation month/year and replace the ""-Present"" on the right side. If you list 2010-2014, they'll figure out when you're supposed to graduate ;)

- I would move the ""Relevant Coursework"" (note: you misspelled it) under the Education section, and make it a multi-column list to make it easier to read while taking up minimal space (took me some effort to get it to work in mine)

"EQNext","t5_2saln","&gt;But if a new expansion comes out and all the mobs suddenly deal light damage and now you need some light resistances to complete the encounters you have added progression without watering down all your current stats and gear.

&gt;You can now quest to attain resistances to this damage which lets you beat the mobs and then get new items, the new items don't have to have higher stats at all but they could have differences like passive effects, special procs that interact with an existing ability making it work differently in combat, or clicky effects that let you replace a memorised skill.

&gt;New expansions can be about the fun of adventuring through the content and beating the encounters, rather than the gear treadmill of repeating encounters again and again until you get all the best gear then doing nothing while waiting for the next expansion to make all your gear obsolete again.


THIS:

The devs said there are no levels. You still need a way to power up your gear, give you a sence of accomplishment. So if you you enter a region dominated by the Cult of Shadows you might have to work for gear with Shadow slaying and shadow resistance.  (ie. I have a sword with shadow slaying VIII and my armor has resistance IX)  keep things low, say 10 tiers, and don't make it so OP that it is required (perhaps 1% buff per tier) 

tl;dr have gear give buffs based on content ","1385856486"

I'm not objecting to him being a decent player, but there are thousands at or above his level so I don't understand your worship. There are thousands of players you could similarly build a team with if they were willing to commit, it's more about motivation. For instance his play in take 5 was good enough to beat a second tier team, so like many other pubstars he can probably get better by practicing with a proper team.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","*Why are you so quiet?* 

Well, I'm not only an introvert, but also have disorders that inhibit socializing... I observe and listen rather than interject... I usually don't talk much unless I really want to.  Sometimes I don't know what to say when I do want to talk.  

Sometimes I spew nothing but bullcrap or some obscure facts/pieces of information when I don't know what to say... but really, really want to interact.  I can't hold that back sometimes.

*Were you born deaf or did something happen to make you deaf?*

Born deaf... profoundly deaf.  Parents and family worked their asses off to raise me to be as normal a kid as possible... and they did succeed at that.  I talk normally, which is rare for those of us that were born deaf.  

Don't forget this deafness problem is on top of my disorders... my brain has worked hard since I was 8 months old which is when my parents got me my first set of hearing aids.  My brain is still stuck in overdrive... and due to the disorders, it comes up with all kinds of random untrue conclusions at times... which isn't necessarily a good thing.  Kinda makes it hard to trust someone, and often makes things more difficult than it needs to be.

*How do you know so much?*

By studying things of interest to me... cars/trucks, I read articles and forums about the vehicle and its problems.  Same for a lot of other mechanical objects.  Nature documentaries are another way to learn... found the more recent one on Wolverines to be quite interesting.  Throw in some of the History Channel shows when they actually were the History Channel... and many other sources of interest... it is all archived in my brain... it may take some digging to get what I need, or it might take what I'm working on to be related to the information before it'll be pulled from the archives and rerun in thoughts, but it's there...

Storing all of this takes a toll... remembering short term stuff doesn't work well at times.  Sometimes I miss appointments set ahead of time, too.  In other words, info storage is usually more important than a lot of other stuff like doctor's appointments and actually got in the way of me taking care of myself.  Getting lost in thought happens fairly often.  Focus can sometimes wander and change in minutes, sometimes seconds.  Some get completely confused when I change from one topic to the next in a discussion.  I try not to do it... but sometimes, I'll get on a ramble that changes topics faster than people can keep up.

Trying to explain this to everyone, one at a time, gets kind of tiring... yet I would much rather not explain it all while standing behind a podium in an auditorium.  ","1385856492"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","&gt; No you don't. The saddest part of your bizarre screed is that LibreOffice would probably satisfy your needs both for home and work as a replacement for Pages and Word. But you're too opinionated to simply try it for yourself.

This is utter nonsense.  There's no ""bizarre screed"", and the only ""too opinionated"" is ironically coming from you, as made clear by *multiple* posters in systematically gutting each of your contentions in turn.  You're attempting to counter objectivity with irrationality, and it's entirely and obviously based on *opinion*, not any fact you can present.

LibreOffice would *not* ""satisfy my needs"" in any way superior to *Pages*, let alone in any way superior to Office 365.  Requiring a Java runtime to run an app that doesn't fully take advantage of the OS it's on, lacks features I use, and is not on the platforms I'm using is not any sort of ""satisfy"".

&gt; Since you hadn't been paying attention, the hierarchy goes something like this:

This is exactly the sort of trolling nonsense that gets you labelled as a coward.

&gt; LibreOffice = Google Docs &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Notepad.exe &gt; iWorks &gt; TextEdit.

Still waiting on even the smallest bit of evidence to support any of this, *nevermind* the *significant* counter evidence you seem keen to ignore in every post.

&gt; Libre and Google have very different strengths, but nicely complement each other. Their interchangeable files, available Android apps with OpenDocument and Google Drive syncing means that together they are a formidable option.

Not for Pages users, they aren't.

&gt; On the low end, even Notepad gives better forward compatibility than anything in iWorks or the vile TextEdit

Ridiculously, demonstrably false.  You simply eliminate all credibility with claims like this.

&gt; unlike with iWork, which already broke compatibility between versions

Unsurprisingly inaccurate.  It broke *backwards* compatibility.  The old versions don't open the new files, but the opposite is not true.  This also wasn't done in a vacuum, either: it was done to establish a unified document standard for use on multiple platforms.  It's a comprehensive redo of their document structure designed from the ground up with synchronizing to the cloud in mind.  I'm going to go ahead and think that's a good thing.  Feel free to disagree.

&gt; You may think you can be happy with Pages, but I'm telling you now that it's only a temporary satisfaction.

And your opinion is somewhat meaningless, given it's biased, based in ignorance, and almost willfully obtuse.

&gt; It will eventually pass. And until it does, you're nothing more than a hostage in Apple's walled garden

Export works just fine.  Viewing in the browser works just fine.

&gt; despite your obvious Stockholm Syndrome.

Trolololololol.

&gt; You can't frame an argument so you resort to name-calling? Classy, aren't you?

Get bent, troll.  You've ignored or dodged every argument, and what little you've presented has been countered.

&gt; 12% and shrinking. That's Apple's market share, down from 14% last year. 

*It's not just Apple I'm talking about.*

&gt; If you're attempting to internally justify your move to Apple with this conversation, you should be aware that you're moving to a dead ecosystem that nobody really cares about.

I don't really see what's supposed to make those ""primitive"" compared to other objects. Also, if you call default built-ins ""primitives"", you should perhaps include Array in that list.

(By the way, that's not the spec.)

Anyhow, from my point of view, everything-is-an-object languages simply don't have primitive data types. They have built-in basic types, but not primitives. Primitives aren't objects. They hold this one value and that's all they do.

Having primitives in the language is one of Java's warts, for example. They were added for performance reasons and because it made sense at the time. Nowadays, many view this as a mistake since it makes the language less consistent and kinda messy in spots.

Thing is, making primitive-ish data types look like regular objects to programmers doesn't necessarily mean that you have to implement them as such. Under the hood, you can do whatever you want.

Modern JavaScript engines, for example, will turn your `Number`s (doubles) into whatever looks more convenient to them. As long as the result is right, you're free to take as many shortcuts as you like.","1385856498"

One absolute that I would like to say everyone can agree upon is that they are all not true, I've yet to see any reason why the Christian religious texts are superior in truth to any of the other ones other than the area where I live has a majority of Christians.","1385856504"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","We seem like opposites in a lot of ways; I live in a country where growing up in the '90s meant that every kid who got into any trouble at school had AD[H]D. Turns out, I was one of those ADD kids (surprise!). Of course, the irony in my case is that I actively refused my medication when it was prescribed to me as a child because I hated the way it made me feel.

My prescriptions ran the gamut from Ritalin to Adderall and everything in between — if there was some new experimental medication for ADD, I was on it because the previous prescription wasn't ""working."" I had better grades while my parents were making me take it, but I was miserable and I was pretty seriously underweight. There are pictures of me at 10 years old where I look like little more than skin and bones. I hated my parents for making me take the stuff, and I still find myself subconsciously holding it against them from time to time.

Unfortunately, after what I'm just going to refer to as an episode, I stopped taking the medication and quickly became overweight. My grades suffered because of it and I'm still trying to lose some of that weight almost ten years later, but I actually got into less trouble in school after I stopped taking the medication, and I felt considerably more mentally stable, though it was a definite shock to my system to suddenly stop taking prescription stimulants twice a day every day after doing so for 8 years. To this day, I still don't understand why people would use that junk recreationally.","1385856508"

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","I think it's worth pointing out that though this is how tabs should be laid and generally will be laid there are a lot of dodgy people making blotters these days.

I have read a fair few posts on here from people claiming to have unperforated, unprinted blotters. If they are the sort of tab in question then all bets are off. Might be the best dose ever, probably you just got ripped off.

I have known small time dealers to ""lay"" tabs with regular 100 hit bottles and dropping the drops directly onto the blotter. Consistency of dose across those isn't likely.

I have had my fair share of poorly laid tabs in the past. I'd suggest the only way to avoid that possibility is to get your LSD from a source you can trust.","1385856508"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","The problem is that there are 4 things you can use to attack:
- Tilts (slightly tilt the joystick, press A, don't tilt for jab)
- Smashes (rapidly move the joystick, press A)
- Specials (stuff + B)
- Grabs (Z, Shield + A)

Only using the C-stick means you don't use jabs or tilts, which tend to be your character's faster moves.  One of the big steps up for players who are learning the game is knowing how to use the entire moveset, especially tilts (which are usually very good).  Since smashes are slow and powerful, they tend to be called out for new players who mash them expecting people to walk into them or pro players who know when to use the smash.  For pros, the c-stick is used for weird advanced techniques with unpronounceable five-letter acronyms that take advantage of how it is input-mapped.","1385856508"

I grew up in a very cold scientific family that never really gave me any emotional support. although it presented me with many advantages, I never really grew to understand my own emotions. Because of that around the age of ten I went to an alternative school program because of my violent and sudden outbursts. Every day was a nightmare. Kids would pick on me to get some sort of reaction because I was known as ""that crazy freak"". I couldn't go a day without having shit thrown at me, or having a casual ""faggot"" or ""wetback"" thrown in my direction, or some kid shoving me to see if I'd do something. The only thing that got me through the day was being able to come home and see my dog, Colita. I would play with him all the time, and take him out with me to the woods to dig holes and explore whenever my parents were yelling at eachother. I gradually made it out of the alternative program at around twelve and integrated into the regular school system. I was still emotional though, and the bus ride home never got any better. Over time I made some friends who came and went; but through it all Colita was always there. My parents eventually divorced and my mom got custody of him. Things were getting hard finantially and my mom was thinking of giving him away. I was never going to let that happen. One day Colita jumps the backyard fence and runs away. We looked for him for around week, and after visiting several animal shelters one afternoon we finally found him. I thought he was dead so naturally I was in tears. It was around 50$ to get him out, my mom tried to pay in credit but they didn't take it. We said we'd be there the next day with cash. The next morning I went to school and my mom went to get him. I went through the regular routine hoping all the while to be able to see my buddy. I get off the bus and see my mom sitting alone at the kitchen table, her eyes puffed up and red. I never saw her like that before. I knew what happened before the words even left her mouth. At first I was furious, I was so angry. I yelled ""How the fuck could they kill my dog"" over and over and over, the feeling of helplessness washed over me and my yells degraded into wails, and gradually into sobs. I was broken for months, I'd have dreams where I could hear him scratching at the door to come inside. I'd believe for a moment that I just misundrstood, that it was a mistake. He came back and he's here again. But I'd wake up. It was a dream and he's fucking dead and I can't do anything but look outside and scream into my pillow. 

I'm applying for colleges now, I made some big strides in understanding myself and controlling my emotions. But I still can't read anything on reddit about fucking dogs without thinking about him. Those pounds are straight from hell.","1385856512"

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Be very careful when fighting bots because you can develop very bad habits if you don't pay attention. Level 9 bots play some things perfectly (better than any human), and some things terribly. So if you only play level 9, you can get into this auto pilot where you do bad moves that only work against bots.

When I was starting to practice shuffling, I would do it mostly against bots. But I noticed that after a couple of minutes, I would stop short hopping and do awkward double full jump aerials - because it worked all the time, the bots would never dodge it. Whenever I would short hop and try to aerial them, they would immediately counter attack (because they have perfectly timed responses) and it wouldn't work. So after a while doing that I developed a bad habit of jumping really high, and then dropping down with an aerial, which any idiot can shieldgrab.

When I practice now I try to pick the AI level randomly between 1-5, just so they play slightly different and have different DI, and I remind myself that I'm playing against the computer, and not ""real"" melee.

His passive keeps his early level and late game pretty solid, while you are dealing with his passive his Q scales very well with AD. He could fare with Corki with ease in laning phase and with blue ez, teamfight wise they both have different skill sets tho as all adc's do. Lucian wasn't out when Cait had the ability to build up passive on towers though.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","The best way to get better with building is to build. Though looking at other peoples stuff helps as well (it can definitely inspire you). Try to develop a certain style you can fall back on if you need to (I like to build medieval, so I tend to use stonebrick, oak wood planks and oak logs for the structure of my builds and then decorate the insides from there, adding carpets, flower pots, paintings etc. (See here for an example: http://imgur.com/a/vTjsK)), though it's good to branch away from this style now and again ( This is a cathedral I worked on for approximately 8 months, still WIP but you can see how I've went away from my normal style: http://imgur.com/GbrIClY).

If you really want to get better at building, try thinking of a large build you can do in creative (skyscraper, cathedral or a large castle). First select a pallet of colours and blocks to use for it, move on to designing small, repeatable parts (like columns or floor sections), work out the layout of the building and then build it. Believe me, that advice helped me a lot when I first started doing larger builds.","1385856523"

"90daysgoal","t5_2s0sd","No worries about the long responses - I usually write long things, too, and I have no problem attempting to help out :D

Okay, that's awesome that you can just focus on yourself for cooking.  Honestly, I'm super boring and have no problems eating the same exact thing for days on end… so what I do a lot is eat eggs and chicken sausage (Trader Joe's brand, but pretty much everywhere has them now) for breakfast, and then for lunch I'll have a big salad with veggies and chicken or something, and for dinner I'll usually have chicken and cooked vegetables.  I cook a huge batch of chicken at the beginning of the week and throw it in a tupperware, and then every night for dinner I'll just heat it up and also heat frozen veggies or a sweet potato in the microwave, and sometimes I'll add hot sauce or pesto or some sort of sauce to liven it up a bit.  It takes the guesswork out of cooking and it doesn't take too terribly long and is easy, and I really don't get sick of it since you can switch up the veggies or sauces if needed.  Not having to run to the grocery store or do big elaborate meals definitely helps me stay in the routine of eating healthy.

Yeah, it's way easier to get exercise out of the way right in the morning so that afternoon energy lag doesn't sway you to skip it after work.  Hopefully scheduling and rescheduling it actually works :)

I think that 3-4 weeks will definitely be enough to get into the habit - from what I've heard and read and experienced myself, it usually takes a few weeks of consistently doing things for them to become routine.  It might totally stink until you get used to it, but eventually it's just normal!

Hmm, I personally did it all at the same time and found that eating right and exercising and losing weight all went hand in hand.  When I started out, I started eating healthy so that I had enough energy to fuel my training, and I stopped napping during the day because I had more energy from eating healthier foods, and I would totally pass out when I got in bed at the same time every night because I was tired from working out, but working out in the morning still managed to give me a ton of energy for the day even though I did it first thing.  And because I was doing all these things - eating clean, calorie counting, and exercising - the weight came off like it was ""supposed to"".  So it might work that way for you, too, but maybe not - it might be really overwhelming to think about losing weight on top of changing all these habits, and that's okay… you can try to just build the habits and see what happens with your weight naturally, and go from there.  Are you planning on following any specific diet, like keto or paleo or anything, or just going to be watching portions/counting calories or something?","1385856527"

Ah, the misinformed ... . This has nothing to do with the gas. Tymoshenko signed a contract in around 2007 for 10 years with Russia. In the contract, Ukraine agreed to pay the price for the gas at approximately the market level. So, Russia can't increase the price because of the contract, and Russia never threatened to do so. What they threatened with is to cut the supply **if** Ukraine is unable to pay up, which sounds reasonable. But last time this happened, Ukraine stole the gas designated to EU countries.

Since they don't need the uncalled random exposure and the ones who would need it wouldn't get it, I don't see what the community could gain from re-allowing stream posts.

There were some edge-cases that I found personally interesting, like when people posted about CLG and CRS streaming their scrims and linked the various streams. And with that some discussion, a lot of trash talk and juicy drama in the comments.

That one was nice, because there was a lot to talk about and it wasn't just some polarizing (is this a word?) ""personality"" where the only things in the comments would be circlejerking how good/funny/nice/whatever the streamer is by their fans and insults or trolling by others.

&gt; Has the removal of general streams led to an improvement in the subreddit?

It didn't affect it much, because not a lot of streams made it to front-page. As an average user stream spammers weren't really visible to me. My main concerns about the quality of content are about reposts of bugs/ riot-pls/ dae ward/ get-out-of-elo-hell/ be-nice etc.","1385856533"

"rpg_gamers","t5_2su0w","Alright, lemme see if this helps:

The graphics are charming, beautiful. The dialog is very well written. Ive is dripping in sarcasm, her impatience in the situation is a fun contrast to the adventure struck hero.

Add a small button prompt to dialog boxes, so I know if I need to press the button to continue the dialog, or to end it or not. It doesn't have to look like a specific button prompt, it can be something in game or a small bubble of sorts. Just something animated enough so I know that I need to press a button. A lot of JRPGs have this, and this is probably where I'm conditioned from (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, Tales of Symphonia).

The spuds mechanic is neat, reminds me of Rune Factory, only you aren't growing little flowers and potatoes to tell, you are making ammunition. Neat trick. But, going through the option to Weed/Remove Rocks, Till the Ground, Plant the Seeds, then Water it? A bit tedious. I think tidying up that menu should prevent people from pulling their hair. I think a good idea would to have a sort of area to pull a larger menu where you can quickly plant, harvest, etc. So if you want to slow down and see how your garden is doing, it's there. But if you need to quickly equip for your next adventure, the option is in plain view.

If you don't plan to have voice acting in the game for the dialog, can I suggest voice clips similar to the Legend of Zelda series? I think it would add to the immersion of the characters.

Battles are a strange beast, currently. Bare-bones, I see what you have going on, though. Steal from Final Fantasy X, and add a turn queue for greater strategy. Also, let me know if I got the jump on an enemy, or if they got an ambush on me in the beginning, if that is a mechanic. It will create less confusion and frustration. Frustration is an easy way to get a player turned off from your game. Angry gamers lead to bad word of mouth.

I like the overheating mechanic, but I do not like the sound effect accompanying it. The bloom doesn't do me much favors either, as it begins to hurt my eyes. I think something cuter and easier on the eyes would be nicer, like big sweat drops coming from the character, and eventually leading to the character fanning himself, slumping while running. That can lead to the faint.

Healing with Amon's skill out of battle would be a godsend, even if it uses special power charges(?).

I wish there were explanations of what each spud/pearl and skill did. Even if most of it is small flavor text.

I enjoy the fact that you reward perception and exploration. That is something most RPGs just don't do anymore. Thank you.

The first boss, the Onyx Crabbler(?), I think a gimmick wouldn't hurt here. To teach players more mechanics. If anything, remind the player that two SP from Gnart is a useful thing to use here. Make Gnart pipe up and say something about Guardian Force.

Frog statue explosion hurt my frames per second. :v

Welp. Once I get a new job, I know what game I plan to kickstart/buy. I like what you got going on. Thanks for the demo, I enjoyed it, and I hope your development goes smoothly. These sorts of RPGs are a lost art, anymore.","1385856534"

I was out of school for about three weeks in total. Due to my illness, I was forced to miss my friends birthday party, which upset her.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I have been deeply conemplating Nature vs. Nurture for about 6-8 months now and I am coming to some very compelling conclusions.

People have a vested interest in finding behavior to be either purely Nature or purely Nurture. For instance, feminists firmly state that rape 100% nurture and is 0% nature. Gay men often assert that homosexuality is 100% nature and 0% nurture. But the more I discover about people, the more I find that these assertions are overly confident.

I am coming to the conclusion about sexuality that your genetic self is not a very accurate machine. You are just made to be turned on when the time just generally is right, and then society (nurture) defines the boundaries and conditions in which it specifically happens. Whenever you pierce this veil and see through to the truth that a lot of rules around sexuality are arbitrary, it all becomes gray. Being gay or straight is not a binary state.

When this gray interpretation of sexuality sinks in you learn a few things. You learn how easily we can all be fooled, and you learn how important it is that we treat each-other kindly since none of us know what the fuck is truly going on. 

I would say take this experience of yours as a learning point. Consider that most boundaries that humans draw are often arbitrary and that a lot of people get hurt in the process. Whatever you do, don't become bitter. Grow stronger. Explore your sexuality, and fulfill your every benign fantasy. If you become uncomfortable, that thing is not for you.","1385856540"

Try to save up $1600. You can get an ok bike for 1200, $50-70 helmet, $50 used jacket (wash it first lol), $50 gloves, and that still leaves you a bit of money towards insurance. A $1200 bike will by no means be perfect but you probably won't have to work on it as much as a bike from the 70s.

I recommend an older gl1100 or pretty much any goldwing. Those get 200000 miles with basic maintenance and they're fun from what I've heard and easy to ride. Also, the aftermarket on those is big so parts won't be killer expensive","1385856543"

So here's one to mull on: applicability/relevance, by which I mean, ""who will care"". Not right now, but tomorrow, or in a week. I'm not expecting it to take very long, so this should make an interesting experiment.

Novelties like these have a half life measured in hours. Thousands of people simultaneously yell ""me too"" in the most derivative ways imaginable as soon as they realize there's something to yell about, by which it progresses from an in-joke, to saturated, to tired, to outright tedious in remarkably short order.

You'll always see a few people who can't let go try to keep it going and some stragglers who were late to the party, so of course nothing ever *truly* dies. But here's my bet: I don't think this stupid joke will survive the storm of ep3, maybe ep4 at the latest- it'll either be universally annoying or replaced by then.

Sets of 5 are popular because they're low enough that beginners don't get burned out or run out of energy on the more CNS intensive lifts (squats, deadlifts) and the intensity is such that it allows full recovery while also being easy to progress with (sets of 10+ is a little less predictable than ~5). You could just as easily do the program with however many sets and reps you want, be it be it 4x4, 3x6, 5x3, 4x8, what have you. The key is progression and consistency, not any specific rep scheme.

BUT, he keeps seeing these flashes of Touma, he thinks more of her than just friends. He even said: *""Damn it, why do you have to be so amazing?""*, like he's struggling to keep his feelings in one place. He's inbetween Ogiso and Touma right now, S.S. Touma is still afloat. 

And above all, when he was on the train, he had two options:

* Going to Ogiso's party alone, with a high chance of Touma not showing up
* Going to Touma's place, to get her to go with him.

He chose Touma, meaning he'd rather have her with them than not have her with them and be with Ogiso alone.

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt;But it would be a mistake to say that Romanticism does NOT use organic or natural characters in the sense that I think fond_of_you meant.

I don't know exactly what fond_of_you meant, but often the ""unorganic"" line is used by many people who dislike Rand or romanticism for whatever reason, and it usually followed by ""organic human beings have flaws."" To which I usually respond: ""What kind of human beings? Is it impossible for a human being to be flawless and for his values to follow a logical progression of events? Or just it's rare? I agree that such phenomenon is rare; but I think *that's* the human and the situation I want to see depicted, not the average.""

&gt;This sense of humanity, I've always thought, was absent from Rand's cast of characters.

I do see what you mean.

Some of Rand's characters don't experience meaningful conflicts, and I think *that's* what makes (some of) them feel not human. John Galt (and to a lesser extent, Roark and Francisco, the oly exception of the latter is his lamentation of lost love) never felt human to me, because he never experienced any meaningful conflict, neither internal or external. It was more a ""I'm right, you're wrong, and I'm acting in the right in response to your wrong actions.""

Sure, his actions were logical in respect to their romantic ideals, but if romanticism, in Rand's words ""trains and equips man for the battles he has to face in reality,"" John ""doesn't-flinch-at-torture"" Galt didn't teach me anything about humanity.

The characters that felt the most human (and by human, I mean interesting) to me were the ones who experienced conflict (Gail Wynand, Hank Rearden, Eddie Willers, Kira Argunova).

Ayn Rand talked about drama and melodrama, the former being conflict within a man and the latter being external conflict, and that drama told through melodrama provided the best plots. So I guess I would say that the less ""human"" characters Rand wrote were the ones that didn't experience drama (unlike Victor Hugo's Javert, an *excellent* example). But she mostly wrote solid characters and excellent conflicts, so I love her for that and her ability to put a sentence together.

Wow, that post went off on more tangents than *Les Misérables*!","1385856550"

I can't tell what nibs they are, but from your experiences, it doesn't sound good. The ink is fine, I have used them before.. could be better though! Perhaps if you have other kinds of ink lying around, you can give those a try.

Yes, you can run a flame through the nib to burn off the coating. You can also try rubbing alcohol to remove the oils completely. After this you should not touch the tip of the nibs with your fingers, as the oil from your fingers may rub off on it.

The tines should not be too tight. They must be symmetrical and line up perfectly. It must not overlap each other (like scissors) nor be so far apart that you can see light between them. The ink will not flow in either case.
When I have problematic nibs, I dip it once in the ink, then very quickly dip it again in clean water and write immediately. This helps a little. Sometimes before starting, I 'stick' the nib on the paper to create a small dot of ink, then start writing from there. The little bit of ink already on paper will encourage flow.
But.. it already sounds like your nibs are problematic to begin with! Study the tines and if they still look wonky, are not symmetrical or just plain bad, then I'm afraid you have to get new ones. But just as you said, poor equipment will make things more difficult so you might as well get the good stuff now :)","1385856550"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","You really think Apple could resist a ""Games for Everyone!"" event? They will likely bring out the hardware and controller, and then announce the games all together.  I chose COD 4 and GTA IV because they're games that defined the early part of the generation, aren't first or second party exclusives, and don't really sell on consoles anymore. It would be a license to print money with IPs that are pretty much doing nothing at this point. Besides, Rockstar has already released GTA games in the Apple App Store.

Truth is that the mobile platform is just advancing at a rapid rate that consoles just can't keep up with, unless they are expandable and upgradable (like a PC). Apple dramatically upgrades their iPads every year. They're running a 64 bit processor right now, with a gig of ram. Nokia has a tablet with a 2.2 ghz quad core processor with 2 gigs of ram.

Eventually, and it could be this generation, mobile platforms will have the processing power to match consoles. And that will be a very interesting situation. 

PC's will maintain the gap between tablets for a very long time. I have no doubt about that. In fact, I see tablet gaming having more similarities to PC gaming than I do to games consoles.

My guess is that Tablets will have optimization settings, similarly to PCs. So the cutting edge iPad will be able to run the newest games at their best settings. The older ones will be able to run the newest games at lower settings.

The great part about this is that as long as they're still on the iOS/Android platform, all games will be reverse compatible. 

As long as I get a great controller, and I can play my games on a full sized TV if I want, I'd be more than happy with this. ","1385856551"

English is now the primary spoken language, though Mi'kmaq, Gaelic and French are still heard.
Later migrations of Black Loyalists, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the eastern part of the island around the Industrial Cape Breton region. The population of Cape Breton Island has been in decline for almost two decades with an increasing population exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.
According to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton Island in 2011 was 135,974,[2] a 4.4% decline from 142,298 in 2006, and a 14.1% decline from 158,260 in 1996.","1385856554"

He is no different from a coach in any other professional sport.

The fact that some teams don't use this to their advantage boggles my mind. 

It is completely fair play - because the coach is limited to the same information that the team has - he just has more of a ""birds eye"" view as he can see multiple perspectives.

It relieves some pressure from the IGL - but I would wager that for the most part, only one of them is actually calling strats. Two people calling strats doesn't go well - especially when things get stressful, adrenaline gets pumping, and people get emotional.

I see the IGL as more of a ""captain"" similar to NHL. They make the on the fly adjustments and do their best to maintain motivation etc - but the coach has the best seat to be the strategist and point out weaknesses that he perceives in the enemies tactics. At execution time he's probably fairly quiet while the team does what they need to do.","1385856554"

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","Actually [humanity has lived under communism for millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism)^1, before the Neolithic arrived. So, it is certainly possible, at the very least with small-scale communities.

Now, for communism with roughly our urban, technological, scale economies… that's another topic. Short answer, yes. Long answer:

The implantation is possible. Everything is connected, and if enough people are willing to push for communism, there's ways to make a soft transition. Some villages (Marinaleda is a known example) are *de facto* socialist, within the possibilities of a capitalist State.

The maintenance of the system is simpler than with capitalism, since many problems are cut from their roots. It's also self-enforcing, and more in sync with the principles of human motivation (instead of relying on extrinsic reward).

I'm kinda tired now, so feel free to ask for clarification and I'll reply the next day.

Also: if you have post-war level scarcity, you're screwed either way. But if you talk about ""technical scarcity"", i.e., you cannot waste as much as you can, then it can work.

1: The primitive communism part is confirmed, the primitive accumulation theory not so much, AFAIK.","1385856556"

"Marvel","t5_2r40o","I see thane as a good person at his core, but as Hickman has eluded to Ebony Maw is the most sinister of the black order and with him in Thane's ear there is no telling what they will do next but it will surely be pure evil as long as Ebony Maw is in the picture.

As far as Thanos is concerned, he is the least of the Illuminati's worries right now. Black Swan laughs in the face of their ""victory"" and says it is just the beginning. The mapmakers are coming, the Black priests, are coming, The builders were nothing compared to the horrors that await.  I can see Thanos being used as another weapon at their disposal, how they will be able to control him I do not know, but he is a powerful weapon and they are building up quite a nice prison of weapons.

All in all infinity was an AMAZING event, not only on its own but as an event with lasting consequences across the universe and setting up even bigger and better stories to be told in the near future, with multiple questions coming immediately to the forefront...

What will happen with Black Bolt and all the new Inhumans?
What will happen with the Kree, Skrull, Shi'ar, and the Annihalation?
How will the avengers react to the Incursions that are STILL occurring?
What will the Gardeners do, will they reappear?
When will the mapmakers make an appearance?
Will Thane be the new, biggest, threat? or will he destroy Ebony Maw, and use his new powers for good?

I'm glad I'm switching, though. I feel like for math you either get it or you don't. The only reason why I got straight A's in my other math classes was because I was with my friends and I felt like I could compete with them but you just can't do that in the higher level math classes.

Green has only recently shown his ability... plus... ULL didn't exactly ""groom"" Green to be a huge-threat-TE. Green still has a LOT of developmental work to put in and as Cin-D coordinator, I play off the potential Green has to screw up.

Conspiracy theorists and technology scolds are crucifying Microsoft for putting a gesture recognition feature on their new game console. This system, ""Kinect,"" was created to compete with the Wii, which kicked MS' ass last generation. The new Kinect allows you to navigate with voice commands and uses facial recognition to log into your profile. Because of all the NSA leaks, normal people are rightly concerned about gov't intrusion into their private conversations, while the conspiracy people (to grossly generalize) seem to think this the coming of 1984.

The result will be that lots of these game consoles will indeed sit in people's homes, a very very few will be used to monitor people directly, everyone will have more data about them generated for marketing research, and ultimately nothing important will happen.","1385856565"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Looks like an entertaining game :)

I usually prefer to go for a fast sightstone and then a sheen. After that I'll work towards either randuins, spirit visage or triforce depending on how the game is going.

Full build usually ends up as relic shield, CDR boots, triforce, randuins, spirit visage and sightstone. And I actually get to 6 items quite often as support GP. Even before 3.14 I often finished two items beyond sightstone, while still spamming wards.

I've also had some success with the crit route that you took, but I personally feel more useful to my team as a peel-focused off-tank. The slows from passive and R, combined with the speed buff from E, makes it possible to effectively protect your backline, and even with just a sheen your damage is high enough to kill off a soft target if they ignore you.

I've never ranked higher than 1900 elo, so my opinions is not shaped by top-level play, but at least in the skill ranges I've frequented GP makes for a pretty solid support. Even more so after the off-season changes. I truly do think he's overpowered as a support right now. He racks in completely obscene amounts of gold. It's not uncommon for me to end up with 3rd or 2nd most gold on the team.

PS: He does have a few **really** bad matchups though. You can do very little against a caitlynn, and a good janna support will completely fuck you up. On the other hand you can absolutely demolish a fiddle support, which is always a blast. Sweet sweet revenge :)

PPS: triforce - warmogs - atma's impaler is also a very potent build in some games if you need more damage than tankiness but still need to be a bit more beefy than a crit build will make you. GP is one of the few champs that atmogs is still good on, in my opinion.","1385856567"

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","I went to an engagement party that ended up being a wedding! It was a lot of fun and everyone was very surprised. Most of their friends/family were in town so it was pretty easy. Here's how it went down. The bride's name was D and then there was her FH.

D was my baby sitter starting when I was 9 months old so I had known her my whole life. She has always promised I would be her flower girl although as I'd grown up she had never got married. She eventually got together with her FH but I was 16. They got engaged and I didn't expect to be a flower girl but was excited.

They had a big engagement party in a big round ballroom. About an hour into the party I was standing around talking to my parents when D came up to me and pulled me into the other room. In this other room stood her mom, aunt and brother. D explained to me that they were getting married in about five minutes and we helped her get ready. 

While I was helping D get ready her FH took the mic and started to make a toast. He explained that he and D felt so blessed to have so many friends and family around them. While he was talking the officiant slipped in the back of the room (so everyone's back was to him since all eyes were on the groom). FH explained that he and D were so in love and felt the love in the room that they simply didn't want to wait. At that moment he had walked over and opened a door that was connected to the room that D had gotten ready in. She walked out in her gown, he snapped on a tie and they both grinned.

The other thing he does is control the mood of the music, and that's what the left arm is doing. He uses his left arm (higher or lower) to indicate when the music should be louder or quieter, and uses the way he moves his arm along with facial expression and body language to indicate how the orchestra (or a particular section) should play -- gently, furiously, briskly, etc.

Quite enjoying it so far. In fact, it's addictive! That being said, the game wasn't terribly interesting for me until World 7-4. Up until that point it just feels like a glorified version of the side-scrolling Mario games. But once you hit 7-4 the game starts throwing levels at you that do things they simply *can't do* in a 2D game. It's fantastic.

At the same time, it makes the initial E3 reaction to 3D World all the more understandable. 3D Land is rather limited in certain wayss. 3D World seemed very similar at first, but I'm glad that 3D World is evidently a much bigger beast than this game is. I'll have to try it sometime.","1385856575"

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Aviators don't work on me either. Except... one time I tried on some cheap $25 aviators (with polarized lenses) at an outdoors store (EMS) that look great. I wear them for driving (and have done cross-country NY to CA and back drives several times with them).

Sitting by themselves, you can't really tell them apart from the typical Ray-Ban ones. I mean there are slight differences, but it isn't at all obvious why they should look better on me than the Ray-Bans.

As for Wayfarers, my regular go-to pair of sunglasses are Ray-Ban New Wayfarers. The original style Wayfarer looks dumb on me, but the New Wayfarer works (though it isn't perfect and I'm looking for something a little better). I thought the new Ray-Ban Meteor would be good, and I like the one that folds up, but it looks bad on me.

So what I'm saying is you just have to try everything on. Every time you're at the mall or in a store with sunglasses, even just cheap ones, try some on. Try shapes you wouldn't normally consider. I have a couple other pairs of inexpensive ones in slightly different shapes (though wayfarer inspired) from places like Nordstrom Rack that look good on me too.

Some people look good in basically any style of sunglasses (though the ones you linked to and others in that style I don't think ever really look good on anyone, like the other guy said). Some people don't. Those of us in the latter category just have to keep trying everything until we find something. When you get a hit and you look cool for once, it's a fun feeling, heh.","1385856582"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","DLNA does not support voice. DLNA is simply UPnP that is used to find media over a network, and play it on one device, while controlling it, either on the rendering device, or from another device entirely.

Voice controls are a matter of *one* of the Xbox's 3 Operating Systems. Specifically, it's the responsibility of the Windows 8 OS that trimmed down, and customized for the Xbox(which is partially why it's currently not that efficient, or capable).

The Xbox currently does not have DLNA. But it does support Microsoft's version, PlayTo, which allows any Windows 8(and possibly Windows 7. Not sure though) device to tell the Xbox to play any supported media file from it's own set of files, or from another computer's, over a network. But unfortunately, the Xbox itself, does not allow the user to browse a network for media to play, so it must be done through PlayTo.","1385856584"

Anyway, the idea was that while it *tries* to stop piracy (which it does for a large amount of casual, un-tech-motivated customers), the fact they are charging three times the normal price for said memory cards disagrees with this being their only reason. Plus it is still possible to load emulators and what-not onto a hacked Vita, proving their attempts at removing piracy were for naught.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","&gt;I'm not saying an independent Scotland couldn't have an operational Defence Force - of course they could. I was expecting a thorough defence analysis though! It didn't happen.

I don't think that could happen until negotiations begin. 

At the moment, if the white paper had specific numbers saying ""we'll get X from the RN, Y from the Army and Z from the RAF"" then it'd only require one of those numbers to be shown incorrect/unobtainable  and the entire report would be rubbished by the media. Rather than that they've given their view of what Scotland needs and how to achieve it and people can make their own decisions - it's up to others to say why it isn't achievable.

&lt;bit of a rant&gt;
As it is, the UK media is trying to sow enough fear so the Government doesn't have to make any case for staying in the union. At the moment there are people quoting 50 year reviews as if those 50 year figures are set in stone and therefore independence is terrible, because the Scottish Government hasn't provided alternative 50 year figures. But where are the requests for comparable figures from the UK Government. And even if there were 50 year UK figures, no one would expect them to be accurate. 

And the media will have some topic showing how the Westminster Government has fucked something else up, be it the economy, the health service, the police, the prisons etc etc and then seem dumb struck that anyone would want to be rid of shitty Westminster party-politics. 

As Richard Littlecock says, you couldn't make it up.

"EQNext","t5_2saln","&gt; People do play it to role-play.

True, but they're a *very* small minority, and quite frankly they're a bit daft. RPing in MMOs doesn't work very well because you have to function within the confines of the game, which defeats the point IMO.

&gt;Are you suggesting such a set-up is not possible in an MMO?

Yes.

&gt; your definition shows that optimal is inherently nothing more than an opinion. 

No. I'm sorry, but that's an incredibly stupid thing to say. What is best is not a matter of opinion. For example, the wizard is *objectively* the best class in D&amp;D. No other class comes close to matching its strength. 

For most of Burning Crusade(WoW), warlocks were the best DPS class and Shaman were the best healers. These are facts, not opinions. There were reasons to bring healers that weren't shaman of course, but the most common one was ""we can't find enough of them.""

&gt;If you were trying to start a raid, but the group that you were able to put together was not considered by the elite guilds as ""optimal"", would you still attempt the raid?

Why would anyone put together a raid and then cancel it because the composition was bad?  You filter before you invite people, not after. Regardless, if I'm pugging it likely means that the content is trivial and I wouldn't care about the raid composition. My main goal in such a situation would be to minimize competition for whatever I need. If that means taking 10 warriors, I probably would.

&gt;Would you try to change the way those people play their characters in the raid?

It depends on the game. If it were something like Guild Wars and switching builds is very easy, then absolutely. If someone had a shitty build I would suggest something better before we even start.

If it's a game like WoW where personal skill is the main determinant then you don't really have a choice but to proceed and make changes if/when you fail. If someone is failing to perform at the level required of them they'd be removed, because you can't fix someone's playing quickly enough. Fixing a bad build is easy. Fixing a bad player is very difficult and often impossible.","1385856592"

In my youth I was a speedy winger who could put a decent ball into the box and get on the end of through balls, but as I've gotten older and played more and more futsal/small-sided games, I've developed the skills necessary to play as a deep lying distributor (Pirlo, Scholes, and Gerrard are the players I model my game after, youtube them!) and because the team I play on (semi-pro in Boston), plays a double pivot, I had to learn how to play with a midfielder next to me and a midfielder in front of me.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","That's a one-sided relationship, generally. Let's take the first three Devil May Cry games. I bought the first one at a used game store a couple months ago. Cost $1, but there was a B1G1 sale, so I got it for no dollars.
Now: Devil May Cry. 4-hour game. Definitely worth the $0. But imagine that it cost $20. $5 an hour for the game. You may feel a little ripped off, but the game was great, so win.

Let's move on to the sequel. The game was leagues worse than its predecessor, but imagine that you got it for free. You'd say ""It wasn't great, but I didn't pay anything for it."" Things that are free are usually worse than things you pay for. But had you paid $40 for the game, you'd be a little mad at Capcom. How dare they charge you for mediocrity.

Now the prequel. DmC 3 is seen as much better than the previous ones combined. I bought this one for $5, and it was about a 15-hour game. $3/hr. That's a little better, price wise. The game was also great.

Bottomline/Tl;dr: If you have a price-hour ratio for your game, anything less than $4:1 is a good deal.

Update: Bought Dmc 2 today. Those that have it know that the game comes with two discs, 1 for each character.
Spent $10 on it but it was B1G1, so another Dmc game for free.

**The game came with the second disc**  I paid for Dante, but I couldn't play as him because I was given the wrong disc. Feeling ripped-off right now.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt; Most of Reddit's audience is composed of these people. They are:
Young, living at home, posing to appear more adult than they are.
People working do-nothing jobs who hate those jobs.
People on disability, or mental disability, mostly confined to home.
Those for whom socialization has failed on all other level.

Hit the nail on the head here. It's why *every* Redditor seems to be some ultra-poor college graduate working a dead-end job. 

On Reddit, there is nothing more admirable or noble than being poor and having a shitty job. Conservatism doesn't applaud that like liberalism does, so they can't stand to see a Conservative voice on Reddit. ","1385856595"

There are not many things someone can say that will help and only time will heal you that is the truth and you must find the strength from things that make your life full for the moment . You will find joy and you will find someone . Life is hard man however cliche that is its the truth and it gets better sometimes but it is hard .

And don't let this thing drop you to your knees , you sound like a good guy and you will eventualy find a person you can share joy, pleasure , ups and downs without them walking away or steping on you so they can just throw you away like a use tissue .

Other than that, I don't tell anybody and they usually have no clue. I hope this provided some insight.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Fallout (3 and NV) is to Elder Scrolls As StarCraft is to WarCraft. Fallouts combat has VATS which let's you pause the turn of combat to focus on a target. The AP points determine how many shots like mana for magic. 

Although in ES you have many different melee skill trees Fallout has many different types of gun trees (big gun, electric) along with one tree for unarmed, one for melee.
However you still can. Play the game in a merit of different ways, stealth, strength, wisdom. 
One of the bigger differences is the lvl perk system. For example Skyrim let's you put points into a skill of one tree when achieving a lvl and your skill trees lvl based on what skills you use in the world. Fallout let's you put points into each skill and then select a lvl perk (ex. Lady killer, animal friends) 


These are only a few examples but over all I feel the games are two sides of the same coin.

I don't know many people here in the UK who call Americans Yanks as an insult, even when they use it its not meant usually as an offense, much like how us Scots get called Scotch for some odd reason, rather than ""Scottish"". you'd think it'd be obvious that it goes English, Irish Scotish yet some people still call us the Scotch.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Middle school was far worse for me...it had way more cliques, people were really dickish to each other because their hormones were all messed up for the first times ever and no one had any idea how to handle it. Everyone was slightly awkward and did slightly cringeworthy things. No one knew how to properly express their emotions, so they over reacted to everything as though it was the most important moment in their life. 

By high school, everything is usually better. People can handle themselves without freaking the fuck out, and people generally stopped being so clique-y. The reason you hear more about the sucky things in high school is because the kids in middle school aren't easily taken seriously, because they're all dicks to each other, but put the same stories in high school and people see more developed, less batshit insane/ emotionally unstable people and so can take things more seriously.

 For an example, a kid in middle school has a boyfriend who breaks up with them. the kid cries and freaks out - her life is over. A highschool kid has a boyfriend who breaks up with them. The highschooler is assumed to be more rational and less childish, even though there may only be a few years difference between the two, and therefore anything she does, even if it's a similar response to the middle school kid, is considered to be more justifiable.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I looked around this thread and couldn't find a mention of it, so if it already has been posted just let me know.

For me personally, it's got to be the Siege of Maarat during the 1st Crusade.

Some back story: This takes place soon after the successful 1st siege of Antioch. As was usual with Bohemond and Raymond (two of the most influential leaders of the 1st Crusade) they were squabbling over who controlled Antioch. While they were busy doing that, winter was fast approaching, and the minor knights and soldiers were getting impatient.

Food stores were running disastrously low, and many of the crusaders weren't too happy with Bohemund for claiming he was the ruler of Antioch (thereby breaking his promise to Alexius).

A few days south of Antioch was the city of Ma'arrat al-Numan. As the crusaders were scouring the nearby lands for supplies, they eventually came upon this city and besieged it. The defenders were just urban militia, and the city fell quickly enough. The citizens fell back to the heart of the city, and Bohemund negotiated their surrender, after which they were massacred.

Bohemund and Raymond were busy arguing over who owned the towers and who owned the interior to care much.

Finally, as winter truly fell, near the end of the year, both Raymond and Bohemond were away. Raymond was busy trying to get the leaders of the troops to press on to Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, the occupying crusaders found that Ma'arrat lacked the food stores they had hoped. They were starving, the crusade seemed stalled, so they did what desperate men sometimes do in those situations.

They **ate** the residents of Ma'arrat.

The records are fuzzy at best, but there are enough accounts of this event that we can be pretty certain it did happen. The details tended to differ, of course.

According to Fulcher of Chartres:

&gt;I shudder to tell that many of our people, harassed by the madness of excessive hunger, cut pieces from the buttocks of the Saracens already dead there, which they cooked, but when it was not yet roasted enough by the fire, they devoured it with savage mouth.

**The crusaders massacred this city, then ate its inhabitants.** There are even accounts of children being impaled on spits and cooked over a fire.

For all the atrocities of the Crusades, this one for me is the worst of all.","1385856613"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to run the photo department at a drug store in my hometown.  We used to get lots of nudes, and since these were people bringing in rolls of film and handing them to a teenager, you can imagine that the people were neither of good reputation, nor the kind of people that you would want to see fucking each other on camera, which they usually were.

One set came in where a dude and three women were taking some steamy, Maxim-magazine esque photos.  But since this was the early 2000's and Photoshop was still a bit of a mystery, you could see all of the stretch marks and everything.  They weren't very well taken, except for the ones of the guy, where he was lashed to a bed, blindfolded, and had rose petals covering his fun zone.  He was the one who came in and picked up the film when it was ready.

The worst ones I saw were from a very methed-out looking couple who were getting graphically nasty on camera.  I'm talking lots of spread eagle shots and pics of the wiener breaching the doors to the doo-doo dungeon.  And it was hard to tell, but there was speculation among the photo department workers that the woman could very well have been on her period.

I hope that anybody reading this who ever took in n00dz to be developed when film was a thing knows that everybody in those stores takes an opportunity to look at those photos.","1385856614"

If you want your mind to be at peace, deactivate twitters and facebooks and the likes. The less you know about someone, the easier you deal with them face to face. Stop caring about her opinion because it doesn't matter. If it's bad, then she shouldn't be around you. If it's good, then keep on being friends with her. Also, for a shy guy, it's best if you don't mix yourself with girl friends. Find guys to hang out with, you'll need it for the future. The connections and relationships you build with guys can set you straight and relax your anxiety. Dealing with a girl is different unless you can see her eye to eye as a guy simply because you don't care about guys' opinions so much.

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","&gt;a turbo kit on the s2k adds 75ish pounds of weight directly on the front of the car and starts melting things. adding a turbo would also require a full engine rebuild, clutch, and transmission rebuild.

I've done several turbo builds (on Hondas), never had anything melt other than a splash tray I didn't trim enough. Good friend of mine has a turbo S2k, hasn't had any melting problems - also ran fine sans rebuild for well over a year (while tracking it) until he decided to go bigger on power and turbo - then he went crazy with it. Of course you might have to reroute a few things, but you'll be doing that with either build. All in all, don't cut corners and its no big deal.

Unless you've beaten up your syncros, I don't see why you would need to rebuild the transmission. Other than the syncros, Honda manual transmissions will take a ton of abuse.

&gt;i do not track the car, i am just building it to be awesome when i drive it every day. 35mpg's and 350ft lbs of torque sounds hard to argue with

As long as you have the time and money, more power to you. If you've taken a project on like this before, then you know what I mean.

&gt;edit: once again, im not here to discuss why i should turbo it. I want to know what this will do to mysteering geometry, what its affects will be, and ideas on how to fix it

Well you are asking a bunch of **Engineers** this question - of course we're going to want to know WHY and suggest alternatives. 

You'll probably have to play with the toe like the other poster said...make a friend with an alignment rack. Even if you add longer tie rod ends to compensate for the increased difference, it will likely change the relative side-side motion since the rack will be further back. You can draw it out on paper if you know all the dimensions to see the change if any.","1385856624"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was Halloween two years ago and I was with my four roommates down at the Up And Up in Bellingham, dressed as Hunter S. Thompson; we'd been smoking weed and cigarettes, had done lines of blow and dips of Molly, and it was now time to hit up the bars. My old roommate noticed an acquaintance of his while we were playing foosball and they started talking when girl dresses as the Jaegermeister deer came over to talk to the new guy and noticed my costume. She really liked it, struck up a conversation with me, and my old roommate led the other guy away so it was just me and the girl. We chatted for a while, drunk and high and excited to celebrate, but she was called away by her friends and I by mine.

That Friday my old roommate came over (he'd moved out recently to live with his girlfriend, who I had introduced to him) and told me about a missed connection post on craigslist by a girl describing my costume in exact detail. My friends proceeded to congratulate me and write a bunch of highly offensive replies to the post. I replied with my own; she invited me to the Up to get a drink with her and her friends, so I invited my old roommate, not wanting to go alone. Down at the bar I ordered a beer and texted her my location, the waited for her to show up. She said she was there so I looked around through the crowded bar. I saw a girl using her phone right as a crowd of people split up. She looked up and we just stared at each other...

After drinking with her and her friends we went to the local gay bar/club. While we were dancing my old roommate left with her friends - it was just us. It was the best dance of my life.

Drunk, we found our way back to her place and talked forever after some passionate, intense sex. Everything just clicked into place in my mind, indescribable. It felt perfect.

We've been together ever since. ","1385856625"

Sorry, but your brain is part of the nature.
The brain of humans is very complex, but it's still nature.
You would be completely lost without that direction that your brain gives you. Without your reward centre in your brain you would be completely lost. Completely fucking lost. Like flying through an empty dark room without walls.

Be grateful for the direction nature gives you. The opposite is a nightmare.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I agree in principal. You want to pay for performance. But, many of the people hired as CEOs weren't just sitting around waiting for their next gig. So, in hiring a top notch company manager, you need to compete with other firms that want that very same person.

"funny","t5_2qh33","It was more than ""they all grew up"", to be honest. For the first 3-4 books, it was whimsical because at that point, Harry (and us as readers) had never experienced anything that would completely change his worldview (Edited to add: Well, besides that whole ""you're a wizard!!"" thing that happened at the beginning of the series, lol). Sure he battled basilisks and helped his estranged godfather escape from capitivty, which indeed is incredibly rare for a Hogwarts student, but after those experiences he could still regroup in the Great Hall and look forward to who won the House Cup. Even when the absolutely terrifying Dementors were introduced, we were told immediately that you could negate their effects with chocolate or a happy thought (followed by the appropriate spell), so while there were potential massive consequences for situations that could have completely changed Harry's (and therefore our) perspective, those consequences never happened. Harry and the reader could continue to travel through Rowling's universe rather lightheartedly. 

Once the fourth book ended, everything changed. Never before in the series had Harry or we as readers experienced something as traumatic as Cedric Diggory's death. Harry experienced something that no 14-year old should ever have to experience. Then right after Cedric's death, Harry hopelessly watched as his sworn enemy, the man who killed his parents and was obsessed with murdering him as well, took bodily form once again at full power. Prior to the end of the fourth book Voldemort was just a spirit, still capable of evil but not technically alive. Now he was alive, he tried to kill Harry, and was not going to stop until Harry was dead. Suddenly, who won the House Cup didn't matter as much. As the entire series is through the perspective of Harry, it would have been downright irresponsible for Rowling to continue to write the remainder of the books in the same whimsical way after these two massive events took place. The beginning of the fifth book even explained the shift in writing mood with the introduction of the thestrals, which are the physical embodiment of the loss of innocence.

The fifth book did an amazing thing (most people I know didn't like OotP, but it's my favourite of the books for this reason): it showcased Harry's anger. Not only did it showcase his anger, but it was impossible to look past it. It didn't treat Cedric's death or Voldemort's rise with kid's gloves, as the other books did with certain events. In great detail, it showed the immediate effects those events had on Harry and how they impacted both his general behaviour and various relationships. In my opinion, this is why Rowling decided to have the Ministry/Daily Prophet/other classmates disbelieve his story, as it gave her more opportunity to elaborate on his frustrations, angst, and isolation.

So yeah, it's important to remember just how crucial, shocking, and life-changing the ending of the fourth book was for Harry, and how necessary it was for Rowling to evolve the way she wrote the remainder of the books. If she hadn't made that shift in mood and continued to write with that whimsical style, I don't think she could have ended the series in a way that was satisfying for the reader.","1385856635"

"spiders","t5_2r1sf","These aren't very aggressive spiders. The Greenbottle blue is usually put in the intermediate level difficulty for pet tarantulas, however, I think they aren't too far above beginner. GBBs are a skittish spider most of the time. The like to run, and will even flick hairs when they feel threatened.  I was able to gently scoop him out of his cup he was in without any problems at all. He almost flicked some hairs, but as soon as he was on my hand he wandered around for a minute before I transferred him. 

As for aggression, I'm assuming you are still pretty new. There are species out there that will make this one look like a childs toy. In fact, I don't think I would call a GBB aggressive at all. I've never seen any aggression or defensive positions from mine ever. He will always just run and hide. 

If you are thinking of a pet tarantula and haven't owned one before, I think that this could be a viable option to you. Most people are going to suggest the basics like a B. smithi, G. rosea, or an Avicularia, but these GBBs really aren't really harder to handle than any of those. They are fantastic and voracious eaters, and are very hardy. If you are confident around spiders, and know that you can handle one if it suddenly darts out of it's cage, then you can easily handle one of these. ","1385856639"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You're telling me that if someone has reached the skill ceiling on a difficult champion, that the champion should be inherently more powerful than those that did not require a learning curve? The ability to outplay is different from being a better champion. Should Zed be a better champion once you are around the skill cap because he's more difficult to play than, say, Annie? If someone is outshining other champs because at high level they are better, then they should be toned down. I agree that some champs should shine more at lower levels of skill, but that doesn't make them overpowered, because if you understand some mechanics and can play your champion well, then the ""low skill"" champs aren't inherently better than yours. However at high levels you're saying champs that are classified as ""high skill"" should just be better, and that would break the game don't you think? I understand that the vast majority of players (90%+ I believe) are in gold, silver, and bronze, but if you break the game by making skilled players better because they play certain champs then you will see the very same banned champions even if the meta changes, and that would cause the LoL esports scene to be worse. 
Also, you made a point of ""...why waste your time trying to get extremely good at said champ to only have the power of another champ that someone picked up a day ago"". I know that I personally have a style of champion that I like to play, and because of that I started playing certain champions more than others. Orianna is a more difficult champion than, say, lux is (in my opinion). I really like the way both champions play (I'm a mid laner, go figure), and I think that there is a time and place for both of those champions. I'm not great at Orianna, and I'm certainly better at Lux, but I still want to learn her because she fits my style of play, and she is good in the hands of a player that knows her well. The point I'm trying to make is, you're saying you feel champions with higher skill caps should just be stronger? I can't say that I agree.","1385856639"

Also, you're running Diva without a level 5 synchro (most choose Catastor because it's pseudo monster removal) or Armor Kappa Kappa (which effectively lets Diva pop any face up card on the field).  Most importantly, DO NOT run Moulinglacia without more access to Dragoons (via an Undine engine or whatever).  It's a coin toss against Dragons and wildly inconsistent.  Oh an Megalo should be at 3.  I respect Sorosh but I really hate that he started the Megalo at 2 nonsense.  Megalo pushes the OTKs and generates so much momentum for the deck.  I'd rather have 2 Megalos in hand than none.

"peacecorps","t5_2rh24","My SO left for the Peace Corps about 6 months ago. We were both aware of the dismal statistics on couples remain intact, but we still decided to stay together. There have been difficulties, but having been through almost a quarter of the deployment I don't see anything looming that will break us apart. Here's some things I wish someone told me before she left, we've been just kind of learning them on our own so far.

As with any relationship, communication is important. With long distance, it will be even more important. With long distance where you are going to possibly be incommunicado for long periods of time it's really really important. If you are going to possibly be without electricity, then let your SO know. Your SO should also know that unexpected events happen a lot more over there and you won't always be able to talk or text. Sometimes the cell networks drop calls, texts, or they delay texts by hours or a day. 

If you can, get a phone with 2 SIM cards in it. Cell networks will go down and it's nice to be able to still make/receive calls and texts. For the person who is staying behind, make sure they can make international texts. If not (or it's expensive on their plan, try [Rebtel](http://www.rebtel.com). One thing I do is timestamp when I send my texts, and also add an incrementing number to the end. 

* 11:00pm - Good night &lt;3 +114

* 7:50am - Good Morning! +116

* 7:51am - How was your day? + 117

That way, my SO can tell if she got a text really late, or if she missed one in the middle. In the example above, it shows that there is one missing text numbered 115.

Communicate when either of you is feeling left out, or if the other person is asking too much. It is really easy to get overwhelmed with work, and just day-to-day stresses while you're serving. Keeping up a 'normal' long distance relationship communication schedule is probably going to be too much to handle. Do you want to call whenever is convenient? Do you want to set up dates? Whatever works for both of you, as long as you're both clear on it.

Communicate what you're feeling even if it seems obvious. There are so many things you communicate through body language, sometimes you forget about that and expect a long distance conversation to go the same way a conversation in person goes.

This may just be me, but putting together care packages and sending them makes me feel like I'm a part of my SO's life a little bit more, one of the greatest difficulties I've felt as she has been gone. Make a budget (it gets very expensive sending things to Africa), figure out if you are going to pay your SO back for certain things and what's going to be just nice gifts from them. If you send food, double bag it in ziplocks to try and ensure rats don't smell it and eat through the box/packing to get to it. Write ""God is watching"" or something similar on the outside of the box to reduce the chance it will be stolen en route. Be prepared to have it sit in customs for a LONG time (a month or so is not uncommon).

EDIT: My SO said that most people just write something like ""Jesus loves you"", I am apparently very aggressive in my package protection. On the upside, all of the care packages I've sent have gotten to her intact (=

Stay busy! Both of you. The first 3 months she was gone I wasn't working and it was horrible. I couldn't stop thinking about her and how she could be in danger or all the hardships she was going through. For the past 3 months I've been in grad school and working, and it helps SO much to have my mind occupied with other things. She has been lucky to be in a town with some other UN and Peace Corps members, so she has people to hang out with most nights.

Some days, it will suck. There's no getting around it. Sometimes you can call and talk, sometimes the lines are too horrible and you can't hear each other. I spent a couple days crying myself to sleep when I didn't hear back from my SO. It turns out she just didn't have a way to recharge her phone and with no internet she couldn't contact me.

Make friends there. Some days you'll just need a hug, or someone to talk to. Even if your SO was the go-to person for these things before, they can't be for the time. If you like cats, get a cat. They'll help with killing insects/rats also and satiate a bit of your desire to cuddle.

Last, but not least, share with each other. Talk about stupid stuff, like when you tripped on a chair in front of your class. Talk about important stuff, or that rash that just won't go away. Make sure you're a part of each other's lives even though distance makes it difficult.


I wouldn't say this as advice, but before my SO left (and during difficult patches) I've told her that I am not allowed to break up with her and she is not allowed to break up with me while she is deployed. The reasoning being that during her stint there, she is under so many different stresses that have nothing to do with our relationship, any decision about our relationship should be made under more 'normal' circumstances. It's kind of half a joke, but half serious. I don't know if it's a good idea though.

Have fun digging.

Actually keeping track of retraction and the reasoning behind them is a relatively new phenomenon. Prior to resources such as the one above, there was rarely any transparency in the retraction process. [Explanations did not have to be publicly explicit, falling under a small range of categories.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction) Interestingly, the blog above was initially worried that they wouldn't have enough material, as the number of annual retractions when they first started was estimated to be about 80 per year. (Rarely would the reasoning behind them be made public.) Once they got going, their first year showed over 200 retractions. A number well beyond the estimate.

Edit: [Forgot to mention that in recent years, there has also been a trend of increased retractions. This would be percentage-wise, not numerically.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/science/rise-in-scientific-journal-retractions-prompts-calls-for-reform.html?_r=0) This becomes extremely significant in cases where a company who funded research will produce junk science in support of their product. Regardless of retraction, the initial positive claim may still be utilized as marketing and advertising are not held to any actual rules regarding the use of scientific research. (It's not actually false advertising as you're using such studies to support a claim, not make one. This is independent of contradictory evidence which is its own can of worms.)","1385856656"

Everyone got a 0 for that question, but I got my test back ripped in half (she was quite angry).

We also had an experimental merit/demerit system implemented at the time (for those unfamiliar, you would get merits if you ""exceeded the teacher's expectations"" and if you get 10 you won an award. If you disappoint the teacher, you get a demerit and if you got 10 you were sent to the principal's office). I usually got one or two demerits from teachers in a semester (for forgetting my books, etc.), but when my mother was my teacher, I got 30- just from her.","1385856657"

I don't know how the people sympathising with ""Diane"" feel, but I'd rather they take their time and deal with whatever they have to do with the plane properly than do a rush job in order to keep their schedule. Airplane safety is surely more important than on-time departure. What are the flight attendants supposed to do about it anyway? I hope Diane eats several dicks. With cranberry sauce.","1385856658"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","The thing with bundles is that while the price per game goes down a lot, the number of games you buy goes up a lot. Thus basically the whole thing turns into a zero sum game, as you still end up spending more or less the same money as before, but instead of buying one game a month, you end up being three bundles and get 15 games or so. Since it's all digital the amount of games comes at no extra cost to the developer and of those 15 games, 14 will likely stay untouched and just sit around in somebodies Steam account. So the money in the industry stays pretty much the same and the amount of games people actually play stays the same, but some databases are filled with a few more owned games.

It's also worth to mention that the whole bundle thing is really just another business, it's not charity, the charity is just a marketing gimmick. Almost all bundles these days impose a minimum of at least $1, but frequently as high as $3-$5. And even if they have a minimum of $0.01, like Humble Bundle, they now require at least $1 for Steam keys and $6 for the extra games. So it's not really pay-what-you-want, but more like ""if you don't pay enough on average, we raise the price or remove the extras"", as said, it's just another business.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","Essentially, countersinking and filling allowed me to make exterior connections on everything without showing screws. [This] (http://i.imgur.com/PIjz2Wr.jpg) should illustrate what I mean. Had I not countersunk and filled, I would simply have been painting over screw heads and it would've been pretty ugly. I watched [this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fa-vBbP_7o) and bought [this countersink bit] (http://www.harborfreight.com/1-2-half-inch-six-flute-countersink-93342.html). Probably should have known, but the Harbor Freight bit was absolute shit and just straight up didn't work.

"books","t5_2qh4i","I agree with Kavalier and Klay. The concept and subject are infinetly interesting, and even the characters chosen had good backgrounds and motivations (paralleling the actual creators of Super Man, etc). But the timing was bizarre, the plot would leap from youth to settled life in a chapter, and it just focused on the weirdest moments. Not the creation or height of their fame, but on the sadness in a middle life crisis, etc. Which would be fine if the author wasn't so keen on creating the next ""American Novel.""

The book would have been fabulous as a mixed media, almost graphic novel style piece. Imagine the text (changed to be less boring or poorly prioritized) inter-spaced with actual comic strips, the evolution of the character and medium in visual as well as descriptive format. This is not a new idea; one only has to look at a host of post modern novels to understand that creative structure is welcome, from Alasdair Gray to Nabokov.

"cringepics","t5_2va9w","I find it sad that it has gotten to the point where this is actually a belief someone can have. I like the show, but I like it because I find it lighthearted and a good escape from depression, as well as having well-written characters. Not as well as, say, Lost or Breaking Bad, but good well-written nonetheless. I read some fanfiction, and some of it was quite good. (Fallout Equestria, Past Sins.) So, I decided, what the hell, might as well go to a convention. It was 6 hours and 20 dollars out of my life, and it might be great.

When I got there, it seemed cool enough. There were some guys having a Soul Calibur tournament, a Catan table, the usual nerd stuff. Some of the fan-art was cool, and a lot of the panels were interesting. Then, suddenly I began to see a... different side of some of the people.

I was talking to some guys around one of the art tables, and I overheard one of the customers asking the artist if they drew any erotic art. The artist said something to the tune of, ""hell no. There are kids here, asshole."" Now, the fact that his reasons for not selling was that there were kids there slightly bothers me, but I respect the guy. He was doing something good. But then the customer started stopping by every table.

At the other side of room, he leaned down on the table. Now, he was a heavyset guy. Not making any judgement, I just wanted to put that out there. So, he did the usual thing; at least, I imagine he did from the other 3 exchanges I heard. Only, this time, the artist actually slid a drawer out and pullet out an image. Now, I couldn't see the image clearly, but I gathered what it was from the context. The guy handed him the money, and the artist put it in a manilla envelope and called it a day.

From there on out, I noticed this more and more. Apparently images where ponies wear socks are supposed to be representing sex. Some guy walked in wearing a full-on fursuit. Now, I shouldn't really have been this disturbed. After all, most people there were fairly normal people like me. They liked a show, they latched onto a fandom or what-have-you. They played video games, read Tolkien, the works. So, I left the thing a bit worried, but with a general attitude of ""shit could be worse.""

Then I went to Fox 4's website.

They covered the event, but do you know what they covered about it? The fursuits and suggestive drawings, the overweight men in brightly colored T-shirts. It was one of those broadcasts where they open and close with, ""you won't believe this,"" and mild chuckling. It ruined my affiliation. I didn't want to be associated with these people, no matter how much I like the show.

And then, I started watching the show again. I didn't read fanfiction, I didn't try my hand at art, and I didn't listen to the music. I spent my money that I was going to use on a copy of the documentary on a Steam Sale. But I did watch the show, and I enjoyed it. Then I got really into Reddit.

So, when I come here, everybody outside of /r/MyLittlePony (a Subreddit which I think really should have been left to the traditional audience) *hates* Bronies. Like,  they think that they are all basically sexual deviants who want to fuck cartoon horses. Some are, sure. That is there own thing, and even though I find the idea disgusting, such is life. Over time, I began to feel a responsibility to protect the ""bronies.""

I don't flood my life with the show, I don't draw pony stuff anymore, and I sure as hell don't wear shirts about it anymore. I was never attracted to candy-colored ponies, and a lot of people who watch the show are the same way. So please, understand that not everyone you meet who tells you they are a brony thinks that way. They are just the vocal minority.

That said, they are only interested in maintaining it cosmetically, making it look like it's in good condition. It could be a pile of rust inside and not many people would know. 

Before anyone could even try it would need a lot of inspections, and probably a few million dollars in maintenance. Just look at the N&amp;W 611, and it was only retired (serviceable) just over 20 years ago. That's before you consider how difficult it would be to get it out of the museum and onto tracks - CSX is closest, but they apparently have a pretty active ban on steam using their tracks, which means probably trucking it out to NS at Alexandria or Manassas, or beyond.

That's a lot of money and trouble for a PR campaign, effective as it may be. It'd then have to be out running excursions for years, and then the Smithsonian would have just lost one of it's exhibit pieces in the museum.","1385856664"

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","There are a multitude of reasons why Mystical Refpanel was cut from most Dragon Ruler decks. First of all, after its primary success at ARG Ft. Worth via Dalton Bousman and Brady Brink many people were able to play around it by siding out draw cards and by using MSTs to get rid of it and not care about it. It also became easier to read as time went on. Then at ARG Columbus, Dragon Ruler decks started changing by slowly cutting CoC from their lists due to the fact that it made dead hands worse and good hands only slightly better, and giving their opponents more hits for Refpanel was bad enough that there wasn't really a reason to run it. Now, Refpanel only realistically has 3 targets out of Dragons 40 cards and you can only side it in when you are going 1st to actually get real value out of the card (the most times a Dragon Ruler player will be activating Swords is on Turn 1).

Protoss is on 4 bases and Terran are on 5. Together, they control roughly the east side of the map.

Zerg is on 7 bases and controls pretty much the west side of the map
No base changes beyond this

**NOTES**

* This episode is poking fun at two aspects of the current metagame.  The first is the absolute devastation the Oracle causes whenever there are light units for it target (A major complaint, especially in PvT).  The second is the squishiness of the Oracle, with it being completely annihilated by only a single Missile Turret (A major complaint by may Protoss players).

* I think 19 SCVs and 12 Marines is accurate (85% confidence), with many being in the pile of dead bodies.  If you come up with a better count, please let me know (with pictures, even!  I like pictures!) as always :-)

* The posters in the bunker indicate a WoWCrafts is coming soon.

* The Marine hiding in the bunker has a little Carbot Zergling on his backpack

* The Zealot is using an Observer as a spyglass

* The medic poster is a reference to the [BW Medic quote.](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/StarCraft_unit_quotations) (thanks to [u/iHiroic](http://www.reddit.com/u/iHiroic) for pointing that out)

"BPDSOFFA","t5_2t6sm","&gt;  but the other person is simply not in their mind set to understand that they are being absurd, and therefore everything will go from one ear to another without registering. So, and unless you really need to say something for yourself to feel better, I'd think twice. Sometimes maybe disappearing is better than trying to explain.

This is a good observation - the state you're describing is called ""emotional dysregulation"".  When someone (and this could be anyone) is highly emotionally-charged, trying to reason with them is bound to be ineffective, because they are NOT integrating all the available information, they are ONLY looking for confirmation that their current emotional state is valid.  This is called the ""refractory period"", and it lasts much longer in people with BPD than in non-BPs.

&gt;*Ekman then describes a serious consequence of being hijacked by emotion, namely that you are prevented from having access to all the information which otherwise would be at your fingertips, if you were not emotional.  When you are gripped by emotion, you interpret what is happening in a way that fits how you are feeling, ignoring what you otherwise know. Emotions change how you see the world and how you interpret the actions of others. Rather than questioning why you feel an emotion, you seek to confirm it.*

http://coachingcounsel.com/awareness/ekman-emotion/

As you have no doubt experienced, this is why trying to defend yourself is ineffective when the other person is in an emotionally dysregulated state.  Defending yourself is an attempt to force them to integrate counter-emotional information, but while they are in the refractory period, they are not able to integrate this type of information.  On the other hand, they ARE able to process validating information.  Therefore, if you try and defend yourself, they use their psychological defenses to try and discount that information so that ""reality"" matches their emotions.  The result of this is that they get further removed from your version of ""reality"", because they're fighting against your attempt to change their emotional state.  However, if you validate their emotions, it brings their version of ""reality"" more closely aligned with your own version, therefore facilitating conversation.

&gt;it is also very upsetting to hear someone you care about to accuse you of being selfish and above just because you're not dropping absolutely everything to go be with them.

Definitely true! If you keep in mind the above information about emotional dysregulation and the refractory period, however, you will easily see that the things they say about you are not ""what they secretly think but are usually too nice to say"", but rather ""the easiest way to bring reality in line with their emotional state"". If they call you ""selfish"" (and believe me, this happens all the time, it happened to me last night) you shouldn't interpret that as ""from my observations, your actions tend to be selfish on average"", but rather as ""if you *were* selfish, it would justify me emotions.""

People in the refractory period *don't change their emotions to fit with reality, they try to change reality to fit with their emotions.*  Once again, this is true of *all* people, it's just more pronounced in people with BPD because the refractory period can last a very long time.","1385856672"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I don't think there is one universal answer, it depends on marketing and perception.

For example, [a typical album on bandcamp](http://music.soundoftheaviators.com/album/mirrors-deluxe-version) is pay-what-you-want with price tags such as ""Buy now for $10 or more"". I perceive those $10 as the default price and everything above that as a tip for a great artist.

I personally perceive the price of a humble bundle as the average payment for my platform, with the option to pay less or pay more depending on how much money you have available and how much you appreciate those developers. I agree that there is no canonical price and wouldn't view the minimums as the actual price but as a guideline at best. Humble Bundle can expect this treatment because it aggressively markets itself as pay-what-you want. The first sentence on the front page is ""Pay what you want"". This sentence is repeated three more times throughout the page and once in the trailer.

In the case of the Game Music bundle, the way it plainly says ""24 Albums for just $10.00"", this creates a clear perception for me that $10 is *the* price for those 24 Albums. Outside the payment form, the leaderboard is the only thing even indicating that payment amounts other than $1 or $10 are accepted. Pay-what-you-want is never explicitly mentioned in any variation, just quietly implied. They don't market themselves as pay-what-you-want (at least not on the front page), and as a result it's understandable that people don't perceive them that way.

tl;dr: The Game Music bundle doesn't market itself (well) as pay-what-you-want, so it's normal that they aren't treated like pay-what-you-want.

Even a person as dispassionately scientific about the processes of our reproduction as I am recognizes that care and consideration need be taken.

I would definitely just ask her out again over the phone, or text. It might be your preference to do it in person, but I think you already jumped the gun once, and you need a more relaxed approach for a second try.

"StLouisRams","t5_2v44q","I agree with you, but I believe we have that already with those 3 guys (Quick, Givens and Cook). I think we just gotta give them more time to get better, although Cook has been in the league awhile now its still his first season with the Rams. Quick has the talent and the frame to be a pretty solid WR just needs more time I think. Givens is has been absent lately (Most of the year it seems like) but I think thats more of a sophomore slump type deal with him. I don't think we should draft anymore offensive weapons until the second day, we've already drafted the pieces we need they just need time to develop. We can't rush into drafting more WR just cause they haven't adjusted or developed yet to the NFL. I still think two OL in the first would be awesome, I also like the idea of a G and try to get CJ Mosely. ","1385856685"

"BMW","t5_2qn3a","My family has always been into cars. Granddad was a mechanic at Volvo and I guess my dad just was born into the car culture. 

Originally he got the M3 because he was sick and tired of the Volvo's he had been driving and wanted a car more like his Porsche 928 S4 to use as a more or less a daily driver. (Partly why he got a 4-door) 

We had tons of fun with it the first year. Went down to Germany, got it tuned by Hamann etc. But with the winters being what they are in Sweden my dad kinda wanted the M3 to stay as a summer car to save it from all the chips you get from loose tyre nubs and gravel during wintertime. So he got an E61 535i after being really satisfied with my how my moms E91 335xi behaved (awesome model, especially in snowy Sweden). 

The dealership had this M5 and my dad bought it more or less unseen since it had real low mileage, with a good price, and it must be 2 times better than a 3? Turns out he really didn't like the gearbox and don't want to drive it too much since it's ""rare"" with a low mileage one. 

It wont return the investment ever most likely, but at least the hand-in price will be better whenever he gets around to trade it for a F12 or whatever the next car will be.

* Grey Skull LP doesn't Squat every day nor does it define if you should bench or OHP. It also is lower volume for squats. 

* How long have you been lifting? The 3x10 squats are not necessary. One of the biggest criticisms of Starting Strength is Squatting 3x a week grows HUGE legs while the upper body lags behind. Trying to add more volume on SS Legs is defiantly not needed. Just stick to the program; especially for squats.

It's 'we've donated heavily to your party/you in the past, and these are the goals we have'. Note they aren't asking the candidate to do anything about it, they're simply insinuating that come re-election time, their campaign chest might be a little lighter than it was due to lack of a further donation.

I agree it's a *very subtle* difference, but it is indeed an important one in the legal sense of the idea of 'bribing of public officials' being illegal. There's no reason why we should mandate a law that states 'lobbying is illegal, don't do it'. There'd be no way that *any* interest-groups would have their voice heard short of shouting in the streets. We all know how well that works.

Thousands of people on a single tube train? Responsible for their lives when there are plenty of systems that will stop the train in the event of driver error? Maybe we should make sure the depot workers, signalling designers and technicians are all paid more instead and allowed to make sure the equipment is tip-top?

Yet in the very same city there's a driverless mass transport system that has worked very well for the decades it has operated. It's not underground, but it wouldn't be an insurmountable obstacle to get it done below the surface. The Underground itself already uses a system where the ""driver"" doesn't really drive under normal conditions, they just do the doors and press go. The system regulates the train's speed, brake demand and stopping for stations.

Other countries have driverless underground metro systems and they seem to get on fine. 

Hopefully it will come sooner rather than later - the abuse of union powers by the few to vastly affect the millions of people who live/work in London needs to end (and similarly for heavy rail across the country) - strikes should be for genuine grievances and safety issues, not ""the Olympics are on, I want more money and I know I'll get it because the government won't let a strike happen"" or petty crap like not being allowed to wear union ties.

I may have given the wrong impression, but most likely the terrestrial planets didn't pick up much hydrogen or helium in the first place during its formation because too close to the Sun, some of the light elements cannot condense. The place in the solar system where the temperature becomes low enough for hydrogen and other light compounds to condense is called the *snow line* or *frost line*. Behind this line, hydrogen for example can freeze into ice grains and alike which are much easier to accrete. Other planetary systems also have a frost line and we see many gas giants far inside these lines. As I said, we believe they were formed outside the frost line and then migrated inwards after being formed.","1385856702"

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","I was actually thinking about this issue, and I think you're right, might be best to leave it flat. A major reason I changed my mind is because in my head I've been conflating individual income with household income (that and complexity). While it's not particularly hard for a middle class family to get to $60k a year or whatever on household income, you're pretty high in the percentiles reaching that by yourself. Heck, since most of these households often have multiple income sources, you're gonna have multiple UBIs.

So say we have a 40% flat tax (seems to be what my latest projections are). If you're making like $100k between two people, you're only getting a 10% tax rate, since you would have $30k, not 15%, offsetting the tax rate. That's LOWER than I was originally aiming at by the chart I'm responding to. ","1385856703"

You could also put them on a pebble tray for humidity if the relative humidity in your house is very dry. And make sure they aren't being exposed to cold drafts, either from the window itself (like a leaky old window with cracked glazing), or from when people open an outside door nearby.

 She had gone through a brutal 14 years of her life with having alot of operations because her rare genetic disease Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (OFCD) and on top of that she has aspergers. It's heart breaking that among all the support we try to give her, her aspergers plays such a big part in the way that she thinks. Once she does have an idea of doing something she doesn't think of the consequences she just does it. For example, if shes hungry she will go eat. If shes want to go for a swim she will swim without taking in any consideration of other things. It's such a scary thing and the fact that she wanted to die was very very shattering. She did not second guess and just did it because that's how she is with things. 

She is fine now. We have arranged things in place so it is impossible for her to harm herself and we also got her a dog to keep her occupied from her thinking that way. She is extremely happy with her new dog and she makes me feel so proud and lucky to have her in my life. She is so strong and have been ever since she was born. She is just amazing. ","1385856711"

It might take some working out, but it would be none-the-less worthwhile.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Not quite.  The difference in flight time has a small effect, but it really is quite small, and is one of the reasons that the drop when shooting up is slightly different from the drop when shooting down.  The biggest cause, however, really is simple trigonometry due to the different frames of reference for gravity and the bullet.  The accelerative force of gravity causes an acceleration of the bullet in both its X and Y axes.  From gravity's frame of reference the X component is always 0, but the bullet's frame of reference is rotated by the angle of travel.  In the bullet's frame of reference gravity exerts a pull parallel to the direction of travel of G x sin(angle), and a pull normal to the direction of travel of G x cos(angle).  When the bullet is traveling horizontally then this vector is (0, G), so the bullet is pulled straight down, if the angle is non-zero then the vector is (g x sin(angle), G x cos(angle)).  When shooting downward the bullet will be pulled forward slightly by G x sin(angle), and downward by G x cos(angle).  When shooting upward the bullet will be pulled backward slightly by G x sin(angle), and downward by G x cos(angle).  The slight acceleration/deceleration of gravity parallel to the axis of bullet travel is very weak compared to the initial velocity of the bullet and the deceleration from the air, so it doesn't really have much of an effect.  It becomes important in artillery trajectories, but at that point you're really going to have to solve the full system of integral equations (where the angle is continually changing over the bullet's arc).","1385856718"

I woke up with a searing headache and blurred vision[f]. Everything was swirling around me, I felt dizzy and confused. I had no idea where I was, and I had no idea who the mysterious man hovering over me was either. I don’t know what I was more worried about, my vision or this mystery man. I could see his lips moving, and my vision was becoming clearer. His voice sounded muffled and my head was pounding and pulsing. I stared at him for a minute as I began sorting thoughts out, and my senses came back in the meantime. I came up with a game plan just incase the man was hostile and going to sell me to the slave traders, or worse. I had no sense of time and it felt like it had been ages, but finally I could hear his voice loud and clear. I took a look at his face. He was a balding man who looked like he was in his fifties, he had a white mustache and his eyebrows were pointed up. His eyes sagged with age and worry[g]. He looked into my eyes and tried once more to talk to me, this time I could hear him loud and clear.
“Hello? Can you hear me? Nod if you can’t talk. But let me know if you can hear me.”
“I- I can hear you?” my voice was raspy and broken[h], but I could still speak.
“Good good, why don't you stand up and walk over here to the vigor tester? This will judge how messed up you got.” He stared into my eyes, and placed his old wrinkled hand on my shoulder, aiding me up from the old bumpy bed. I slid my legs off the bed and I felt sore, my legs cracked and burned as I placed them on the ground. I put my hands on my knees and pushed up, throwing my self up off the bed. He looked at me and nodded me towards the vigor tester. I began walking towards the huge brown machine that had lights going up and down the sides like something you would see in a movie theatre. The floor creaked and groaned as we walked over it. I examined his house and noticed some interesting things, next to the bed he had a med-set to create medical supplies. He had a desk with blank papers strewn all over it and a huge paper weight sitting towards the back of the desk next to an old broken lamp. We finally made it to the vigor tester and I placed my hands on the cold metal. It powered up and put up a loading screen as I went threw and evaluated myself. It took a couple minutes and once done he took a look at the results on the screen.  He tugged on his mustache and turned towards me
""I guess that explains how you're still alive. You're built solid as an oak.""
“Uh, thanks I guess.”
“Why dont we go in that other room over there and have a seat? There are some papers you need to fill out. We’ll talk all this over.”
He took off into the room leading the way, I was left behind to walk for myself. It was weird, It was like I was learning how to walk all over again, but not really. Something was wrong, and I could physically feel it. My head ached and I was rather confused. I began following after him and only after a couple steps I was in the room, he was sitting on a red egg chair with a music stand beside him. He motioned towards a faded green couch and told me to take a seat. I sat down and looked around the room, there was a fire place and lots of book shelfs lining the walls.
“Im going to show you some cards, I want you to tell me what they look like alright? [i]Just a simple test to test your vitals.”
He began shuffling threw the cards on the music stand and there was about 10 of them. They were random pictures drawn with ink and he wanted me to tell him what they looked like.
“Well, atleast we know your vitals are good. Now just sign this medical release form and you can be on your way. This is just to make sure you dont have a family history of being shot in the head.”
I took the papers from him and signed in two spots.
“Alright, you’re free to go. I’d stick around the town for a while and get to now some people. You might also need the time to recover some more, although you were out for a decent amount of time. You should be fine, but I suggest you stop over at the Goodsprings tavern and get to know some people. My names Doc Mitchell by the way. You’re welcome to look around the place and take whatever you think you’ll need. Whats mine is yours.”
“Thank you, I really appreciate this. If I get the chance to ever re-pay you, I will. I might have a look around for some supplies if thats fine.” I stuck out my hand for him to shake, and he did.
“No problem, come back some time will you? Just not for more medical care heha” He cleared his throat and began walking towards the front door. I walked back into the room with the vigor tester and began looking in some of his crates. I found a lazer pistol and some ammunition. I took a rustly old crutch that was sitting against a rusty shelf. I found a .9mm pistol and 12 rounds of ammunition. I remembered the Medicare center and walked over to make myself some meds. I made 2 stimpacks and a hit of Jet. I walked into the room where I the couch was and looked around, there was nothing there except a pair of old black glasses with thick frames that were bent on a table.[j] I picked up the glasses and put them on my face. My vision improved but it was a shock, I was dizzy all of a sudden.[k] I left that room and when down the hallway to the left, there I found several ammunition containers and some more meds. I walked threw the hallway and looked at the rest of his rooms, he didn’t have much, just a bathroom, his room, and a kitchen area. I decided I had enough and walked back down the hallway when I noticed another book shelf with some bottle caps ontop. I looked at him, and he wasn’t looking. I know he said I could take anything but I didin’t want to rob him, but I did anyways. I pocketed the bottle caps and walked towards him, feeling a tad bit heavier.
        I approached him at the door, trying to keep the bottle caps from shaking around too much in my pocket. I nodded at him and reached for the door handle when his hand reached out and stopped me. I looked at him confusingly.
“I got somethin for you here.. This was my late wife's Vault 21 jumpsuit, and I think it would fit you just fine. I also got this rusty ol’ [l]Caravan shotgun if you’d like to have this, you know its a tough place out there and you could use this here gun. Old but trusty, got me threw some hard times that for sure.”","1385856719"

The only link between, say, a Saturn IV rocket, and a Saturn V rocket, is the fact that they are built upon the same, albeit slightly changed, accumulated knowledge. There are no other links but arbitrarily defined ones.

Whereas biological evolution literally is genetic information that has multiplied itself, and subsequently been subject to mutation. That replicated genetic information is then subject to natural selection, the trial and error, which shapes the future evolution of that gene, but isn't actually a part of the biological process of replication.","1385856724"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","It does make some sense - I have read elsewhere on Reddit that the few retired ex-Soviet military generals who have spoken of nuclear attack planning were, of course, most scared of the US and concentrated their resources there. The aim with the UK was to destroy warfighting capabilities and roll in Soviet troops as fast as possible - not waste too many bombs turning the place into a sheet of glass.

Here's what I find scary about the ""population centres"" thing. Page 36 on Google Docs:

&gt;I would also say that estimates of weight to attack need to be rather more accurate than those given on page 5 if they are to be useful. As it is, we see that the weight of attack on a large city may be anything from 3 to 30 MT.

Those are both huge.

I'm saying that obviously the Nexus 10 hasn't sold anywhere near the numbers that the iPad has. Since it has low sales and is probably losing Google money their is nothing that is keeping Google from making another 10.

There's just small things missing. 

 DLNA , mp3 and external media support are one thing. 

There's no way to import images or view media from a source. 

There's no way to organize the content you do have on the system.

The notification system is redundant and often confusing. It says games are ready to install while downloading but it hangs when you try. The pop up keeps coming up.

You can't directly access ps3 psn avatars but you can set it on ps3 and it will show on ps4.

The front organization is a mess right now. If I went and bought all the games it would just be a vertical list in chronological order with TV services mixed in there.

No folder support.

I could probably find other things. I don't play it much. Mostly because I don't have the time though. I'd play KZ multiplayer but I want to beat the campaign first. If I start MP I won't go back to it lol.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Yes. I blame my mom for my GC sister's death.

My sister had many medical problems. She was not stable enough to be independent. She had brain tumors which caused her to have seizures. A lot of conversations we had didn't make sense. She would change topics halfway through conversations and repeat them ten minutes later. She had tumors wrapped around her windpipe so if she lay flat on her back, she'd be unable to breathe.

My nmom was in the works to get her her own apartment. She was to get disability and etc. Mom filled out the paperwork. Sister couldn't do it, but nmom never noticed because they've always done everything for her. 
I told my mom my concern that it wasn't a good idea for her to live on her own, and gave her examples. My mom yelled at me. ""why can't you be happy for her?"" She accused me of having it out for her. Accused me of being jealous. Which didn't make sense considering I lived on my own at this point.

A month after my sister moved in, she had a seizure while getting ready for a shower.
My dad found her naked body.

That was seven years ago.

My friends and I played it when we started looking for something deeper than Risk and found the game manageable, but definitely a step up from Risk in every way. Other versions of Axis &amp; Allies offer far more depth and complexity, but become much longer games because of this.

Also +1 for Memoir 44 if you just want 1 on 1 combat, but admittedly it is light when compared to A&amp;A. But is still extremely fun.

Hes clearly an amazing box to box midfielder with a lot of energy and who is very good at making interceptions, tackling, and playing defense in general and its extremely unfortunate he has gone down with such a long term injury.

I would *love* to have Khedira on Chelsea, which is my team.  I just happen to browse these boards frequently because I enjoy watching Ronaldo play.  Also, I hate Barcelona so I guess that makes me a Madrid fan in some way.","1385856729"

I can count on my left hand the teachers I've actually enjoyed that seem to care about the subject in a way that's more than a power trip.

A good example are those teachers that always use the quote: I had 1-3 hours of home work a night in school, so that's what I'm going to assign. That's not good teaching, that's a power trip. They are finally in charge of someone and that makes them the leader, and they completely disregard the fact that there are other teachers with other work and other tests, not to mention extra curricular. Then there are the teachers that assign busy work and get really annoyed if they actually have to teach. The book is all well and good, but it's your job to teach, not have us memorize 7 paragraphs.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","The first medical dispensary I went to (circa early 2010) had a punch card type rewards program. Every time you would buy something you'd get a punch. Fill up the card (I think it was 8 punches to a card) and get some goodies, save up 2 cards and get a pipe hand blown by other members of the dispensary, etc. 

There were a few bongs on the table made by other patients as well and since I was a new smoker &amp;amp; would make time to sit and talk with the lady who ran the shop, volunteer to trim, etc. she said If I filled out 3 cards I would be able to take home a bong for free. 

So I filled out 3 cards and took home my first bong. I named it ""TV's Charlie Sheen"" mostly because the thought of telling people that I was hanging out at home, just me and TV's Charlie Sheen, made me giggle. 

The name was even funnier when the actor later went on his ""winning"" streak. 

It's not the fanciest of water pipes, but it's rips extremely well. The ice notches are great for getting girls that don't usually smoke to partake for a smoother hit.  Also, I can't recommend the lighter leash highly enough. It's a must own in my humble opinion.

I have just moved and don't have any friends and am not a particularly outgoing person so making new friends has been a challenge. Plus I live in Seattle now and it's not the friendliest of places. I always thought that I was doing fine and didn't need a relationship to feel whole. While that is true I do know now that I am missing out on a large part of the human existence. This realization has been weighing on me heavily since the breakup. I've been trying online dating recently but find it hard to connect with people, I guess it takes practice but it gets a little depressing sometimes. Thanks for listening reddit.","1385856735"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Your feelings don't make you a misogynist.  Feeling are neither right nor wrong - they simply are.  Much of your upset comes from a sense of jealousy towards your brother (in general) and betrayal from your girlfriend for not telling you.  You should own those feelings.

Your words are very disrespectful towards women and your girlfriend.  ""Super promiscuous"" because she had sex with your brother twice years before?  What on earth would a little bit promiscuous look like?  What about sexually active but not promiscuous?  Then you complain that she made you wait two months to have sex with her.  Make up your mind.  You can't complain about women who have sex too easily and then also complain that they aren't having sex easily with you.  ""Pumped and dumped"" is also incredibly disrespectful and slut-shaming.  That phrase is *never* used in reference to men who have sex with women.  It is only used as a weapon to shame the woman for daring to have sex.  It's intensely telling that you are angry with her for being ""pumped"" and then ""dumped"" (which she had no control over) and not angry with your brother for both ""pumping"" and ""dumping"" her (which he entirely had control over).

Your girlfriend did absolutely nothing wrong when she slept with your brother years before she even met you.  Her wrong was not telling you about it before the family dinner.  Any feelings you have about her actions years before you even met her are your problem, not hers.  You can certainly choose to not date her because of those feelings, but she didn't do anything wrong because some hypothetical future date chooses to judge her for them.

You are hearing what you want to hear that allows you to continue to feel justified in your own beliefs.  Your post this time will almost certainly be removed just as the original post was, probably for violating rule #2 on the sidebar.  If you are confused as to what language you used that was hateful and disrespectful I am more than willing to explain it to you.  I'm sure a mod would explain it to you also if you asked, but they tend to not have a ton of patience for arguing about the rules.

Second of all, I actually really like your beach setting, I'm horrible at landscapes and such, so I usually just stick to faces. When I first looked at your drawing, I thought you used something like cotton to make the 3D effect for wave that arrives on the beach. But then I realized it was pencil, so props on making it look realistic and 3D!


There is still so much to learn about coloured pencil for me, which makes it fun and exciting. I can't wait to start drawing with colours too instead of just graphite. Yay :D

So it's all about the same. 

I ran 3DMark 2013 on extreme and got:

3 monitor (2SLI and 1IGA) = 5154

2 monitor (1SLI and 1IGA) = 5178

2 monitor (2SLI) = 5175

The implications of the use of time travel is references in the 5th book in the department of mysteries, but wasn't touched on in the movies. Ultimately, of your arguments, it is the most valid inconsistency.

As far as Barty vs. Bellatrix being responsible for Alice and Frank Longbottom's death, it was both of them who had tortured them (very clear int he books). They were Voldermort's most devout followers, and did the deed together. Bellatrix had gotten caught for other things before Barty's involvement became clear at the trial.

Harry's perspective of the events with Voldermort when he was a baby are shady. Harry's only memory is of a green flash, and it can be argued that given his age he didn't necessarily ""see death"", as would be required to see Thestrals.

The rest of your points don't have much to do with inconsistencies in the story/books, more within the movies. I assure you, in the books, the school stays the same.","1385856759"

anyway i've also been checking out this subreddit this weekend and the amount of lolhate is pretty pathetic. now it's quite normal but usually it get's downvoted but here it seems to get upvoted. 

dunno if you guys have noticed but lcs is the best thing to happen to esports since cpl and twitch. you can fight it but if you want a bright future for cs and get it back on the scene, being negative isn't gonna help you. 

i'd like to see a csgo tournament that is focused on increasing the audience. for the new viewers it might be interesting to have the map explained to them. what are the important points on the map etc blah blah. i know dust and train but as a casual viewer i don't know the tactics on the map. also there is zero player content, for new viewers it helps a lot to create a connection between them and the players. at least have some side content for filler and help new players choose a team to cheer for.

i understand this tournament isn't for new viewers, and it shouldn't be since the community helped with the prize pool. but i've seen a lot of people saying this tournament is gonna blow up csgo, and i don't think it is since it does nothing to keep the eyeballs they got from it being the ""250k tournament"".

also i expected a little bit more of a show for the grand final. i just finished watching the sc2 final and that feels like a real show. this dh final seems the same as last years.

""Any modifier that affects the cost of creating new regiments also affects the maintenance of all units by the same proportion. Units ""remember"" the province they were built in, which means that buildings there affecting build cost affect maintenance, so it can be advantageous to recruit exclusively in provinces with at least a Barracks. This applies retroactively as well, so it may be a good idea to build army buildings in provinces where a lot of units were recruited.""

There are DO anesthesiologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, radiologists, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, you name it. DOs can do AOA or ACGME residencies. 

It is true that DO schools do admit lower-stat applicants than MD schools. You may interpret this to mean that some MD students are simply more competitive for high-profile residencies. However, there are MD students that eschew this mentality and go primary care too. And there are motivated DO students that do attain residencies in competitive specialties. 

Point to take home: think about what you are interested in, and take the path that you think will best get you there. Whatever you do, please don't be a DO basher, because that's just not necessary.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","Not sure what the point of the tests are. I'm talking our of my ass here just a bit, but I think it's definitely possible that Sony tuned the PS4 to make absolutely sure it'd be able to maintain a connection to a WAP, even under the worst of conditions, at the expense of throughput. From this total and on the spot thought up hypothesis, it makes sense because most WAPs are total shit, and Sony has a wide audience of gear they have to make sure their product plays well with. Provided it can hold up the connection and maintain semi-sane latency levels, I'd say you will have a good experience doing what the device was intended to do: Let you play games and have fun.

Regarding the speedtests, I would put a LOT more faith into the results from the http://speedof.me/ site instead of http://speedtest.net/. I can vouch for the source of the tests files that SpeedOfMe is using, and I can't for Speedtest.net, as they are using local ISPs and Hosting companies bandwidth, which greatly fluctuates (the CDN that SpeedOfMe doesn't have this issue.)

Knowing how to ride out the difficult times....


permalinkparentreportgive goldreply

[–]MrMostDefinitelyHumanist, Ex-Christian[S] 1 point 1 day ago

That's what I am confused about.

If you are a gnostic theist...when are there difficult times?

If you know, factually, that YHWY is the one true God, his covenant with Israel is real, 
you are the chosen people, you will survive death, etc.

How and when do times get tough?

----------------

Sorry I confused you.  You wrote that there were hard times.  I wanted to know why a gnostic, who **knows** YHWH to be the one true God and this life is not a our only existance...what is challenging.

And the paragraph at the bottom is an argument not about logic and evidence, but probability.  This person strikes me as someone who is not educated in the field of statistical thermodynamics.

“Thats mighty kind of you Doc, I’ll take both. The environment can be rough and this shotgun will help no doubt.” I took the shotgun and suit from him and put them in my backpack. He took his hand from the door and I turned the handle, it was like looking outside for the first time again. The sun seemed extra bright and the colors were unreal. The cracked pavement wound around the town. There was a funny looking blue robot driving around on a wheel, and lots of Brahmin grazing the fields. Ranchers walked around the town and watched over their Brahmin. There was an wore down red brick building to my right, and a general store in front of me. I walked down his porch and the white picket fence was already opened. I walked off his property and turned around, looking at his house from the outside. It was a faded green color and had a ugly look to it, but it fit his personality good. I kept walking towards the general store I had seen before. The destroyed road was difficult to walk on, and all of a sudden I had the urge to jump. I began jumping and I jumped all the way to the general store. The Brahmin ranchers looked at me like nothing was wrong. I jumped up on the porch of the general store and noticed a mail drop off box, I ignored it but kept it in the back of my mind for later. I turned towards the door and pushed on the door, it opened a little bit and then something strange happened, I blacked out for a second. I didn’t remember opening the door.. I passed it off as an after effect of being shot in the head just days earlier. Inside there were bookshelves on the left side of the wall. They were empty and looked decayed. On top of the shelves there was a shiny toaster and a baseball bat. I walked toward the shelved and wrapped my hand around the baseball bat grip. It wasn’t very comfortable and the wood hurt my hands. There was a globe on the shelve and I gave it a quick spin. There was a Nuka Cola banner hanging up on the wall, it sagged heavily in the middle. It made my mouth water, I would do anything for an ice cold Nuka Cola. I turned away from the shelves and turned towards the middle of the room, there were 2 broken refrigerator compartments full of broken glass and beer bottles. The sun shone in through the cracked windows next to the cash register. I approached the cash register and no one was there.. There was a bell on the counter but no one there. I leaned around the counter and noticed a silenced .22 pistol on the other side of the counter, I grabbed it and checked its magazine, the rusty magazine had 3 rounds left. I pocketed it and walked around the other side of the counter, there was a room with a refrigerator and a makeshift bed on the floor. There was a man sleeping on the bed, leaving the store vulnerable. I left the small room and walked towards the cash register, I popped it open and inside there were three rolls of twenty dollar old world cash and 30 bottle caps. I took both and slid the cash register door back in slowly, trying not to awaken the sleeping shop owner. I walked back around the counter too the baseball bat. I took it and put it under my arm, walking back towards the shop owner as he lay sleeping on the floor. I popped open the refrigerator and he stirred in the bed, but he didn’t wake up. Inside there were two ant meat steaks and a box of noodles. I took the steaks and left the yucky looking box of noodles. I put the steaks in my backpack and got the baseball bat out from under my arm, and positioned myself over the sleeping shop owner. I brought the splintered baseball bat up over my head and brought it down on his head, twice. The refrigerator went from a brilliant white to a dark murky red. I searched his pockets and took the bottle caps he had. I took his work hand uniform and dragged his body over towards the refrigerator. I gripped the handle and my hands slipped on the bloody handle. I pulled it out and the refrigerator opened, I hoisted his body into the refrigerator and let the door slowly close. He barely fit but it worked. I took the sleeve of his uniform and cleaned the refrigerator off quickly. You could faintly see red streaks on the white refrigerator but I figured it was good enough. I did a quick over of the shop looking for any useful items that I could use on my journey. I pulled on the door, and the same thing happened again. I blacked out, and didn't recall leaving the building. I just appeared outside. I let it go again as something being wrong from my head injury. I looked to my left and noticed a saloon with a old Army motorcycle sitting out front. I walked over towards it and slid my hand over the green metal. I looked up and noticed an old man sitting on the porch of the saloon with a stick of dynamite in his hands. I looked into his eyes and reached for my .22. I whipped it out and pointed it him, you couldn’t trust anyone in the wasteland. He stood up from his chair and dropped the stick of dynamite. He pulled a caravan shotgun off his back and all of a sudden I was looking down two barrels of a shotgun.
“Put yours away and I put mine away?” I kept my gun sights on his head, hoping he would put the gun down. We were in clear daylight, standing in front of a town full of people with firearms. Even if I managed to take him down I couldn’t clear the whole town out with 2 .22 rounds and a old baseball bat.
“What you doing here mister? Don't think I ever seen you round these parts.. Infact I know I haven't. Tell me what you doin here or you’ll be dinner tonight at the saloon”  
“Doc Mitchell was patchin me up.. I took a bullet to the head and he found my out in the desert. Please dont put me back in his house, I just got out. I was just coming down here to talk to the owner of this here saloon and then i’ll be leaving town. I aint got to trouble here.”
        He lowered the caravan shotgun barrels and sat back down in his chair. [m]

Alternatively, you can probably get away with a cheaper CPU/ $500 GB HD, etc...

Actually, yeah go for a different CPU, I only got it because it was a very solid IGPU for my initial budget build. I only recently added the 7950.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A chain of events that lead to my heart breaking:  I had, for the first time, fallen in love with a man who I thought loved me as much as I loved him.  We met online, spent 8 months planning our future and making plans to move to NYC together (he has a great job based in New York but has the option to work remotely).  He moved to Kentucky where I am from, we got an apartment, had what I thought was a great relationship until one day he told me he was leaving.  He gave me no reason and told me we would ""talk about it later"".   I was so deeply hurt I  lived through every cheesy breakup cliche.  I couldn't eat.  I couldn't sleep.  I couldn't go to work without breaking down and sobbing.

While in this relationship my best friend was addicted to heroin.  She had been caught robbing a STRING of apartments and before that had burned her house down and committed insurance fraud.  A few weeks after my boyfriend acted like a total bitch of a man, she had just been released from jail and in my delusional mind, I thought it was ok to spend time with her.  I needed her.  I can't explain why I would think it was ok but I figured I needed her help and she needed mine.  Slowly I started noticing things getting weirder,  her behavior was bizarre.  Every time I would confront her about it she would have some insane sob story. 

Finally one day she admitted to me she was pregnant.  A few weeks later she told me she had cancer.  

to make this already long story a little shorter: my friend had started shooting heroin again after about a year of sobriety and in order to cover up her noticeably deteriorating appearance and to gain sympathy (and cash) from everyone around her who cared, lied about having cancer.  

She was, however, pregnant...and after everyone caught on to what she was doing she ended up in jail again and had her baby (which was promptly handed over to foster care) about a month ago.

"Warmachine","t5_2s3ta","Trollbloods is probably the faction that is hit hardest by being restricted to 35 points, but all factions that have a large support staff and especially the ones that are designed with such support pieces in mind. 

I personally loathe to play my Circle at 35 points, because I don't feel I have *any* flexibility with my lists, and I either win or lose before the game start, not as a result of me playing the game. It isn't hard to include 13 points of support in a Circle list, which is too much at 35, but acceptable in some 50 point lists. 

The biggest problem 35 points have in a general sense is that you can't build a properly balanced list. You are going to go in a direction, which mean you essentially win or lose games based on the list before the game is played. At 50 points, the scale of the army is big enough that you can play more even games against a larger variation of lists. At 35 points you are almost forced to build lists that ""ask questions"" to your opponent, such as: Can you handle Iron Fleshed Kayazy? While you can build 50 point lists to answer several questions. The result is that people have the option to go for a big skew in one direction and gamble a little with what you are going up against, or you can build balanced lists that can deal with some of everything. In the end, you get more games that are evenly matched than at 35 points. ","1385856782"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I almost slept with a girl that told me she had a specific VD a couple of weeks prior.

To provide a backstory, I really liked this girl. In confidence she told me she contracted something and she was on anti-biotics for it. So a couple of weeks later feelings had escalated and I end up in her bed after a party. I could have gone all the way, but I realized I had no condom. I certainly wasn't going to go bareback into her, with the knowledge I acquired a couple of weeks prior. So it was more of a heavy petting session. I did finger her and at one point she went for my zipper, but I just kind of pretended not to notice, since I don't know if I would have had the self control not to fuck her if my dick came out, especially since I was pretty drunk. 
 
I'm just glad I had the self discipline to not go all the way. I really wanted to fuck her and she was practically throwing herself at me. Things kind of crashed and burned not too long after, never got a second chance. 

TL;DR, always have a condom on deck.","1385856784"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Sad to say, but it is just as bad where I live (Oregon,US).

My parents don't follow any faith, and don't believe in god, but they encouraged me to go to the local churches (there are more than 10 churches in a town that has 2500 people) and see if it was something I could be interested in. 

The other children were all very clique-ish, and treated me terribly. Their parents and their clergy were very rarely any better and neither seemed to see that there was a lesson to be taught (or learned for that matter). In fact, one of the priests/whatever intentionally brought my sister to tears by telling her that my mother was going to burn in hell forever because my mother wasn't baptized and didn't attend church. My mother has been a hospice nurse for 25 years and quite frankly has done more good in her career than 10 of him could accomplish in 10 lifetimes.

As an adult in the same town, I've noticed that although most people here SAY they are a practicing member of one religion or another, very few people act with what I would suppose they would call the spirit of their religion; generosity, kindness or even empathy. It's easy for them to go to church on Sunday, and say they believe in god, but when it comes to the hard things like treating their fellow man with compassion, they fail totally.","1385856789"

A week before my birthday she gets all these weird texts from him asking to suck his dick, and I lost it. Grilled her with questions until she finally gave an answer. She couldn't even tell me in person, she had to text me. 

The text read: ""We had sex. My parents know"".

Her parents had known for months, leading me on. We went to prom together and I planned the best Valentine's Day for her that year. My heart was ripped out. As soon as I read the text, I broke down into tears, as I had just soiled the image of the girl I had once given my heart to.","1385856789"

Allow us old men the small luxury of fawning over you. It's really... exciting when a (presumably) clever and friendly mind comes in such a pretty package. You are the girlfriend most of us would love to have.
It's not that we don't take you seriously as an atheist/scientist/whatever. It's that people who are knowledgeable about this stuff are a dime a dozen but people who are both knowledgeable and hot looking are much rarer.

If someone's stream gets upvoted then I want to see it because they are doing something that is *that* good and unique. 

The solution for people who are not interested in seeing stream content is for them to keep scrolling.

Quality goes down when an entire type of content is removed with disregard to context. The moderation is overkill when someone who streams has to be worried that their other, otherwise valid, contributions are going to get deleted if their stream link shows up.

The current loophole allowing streams to be posted if they have an event going is not sufficient enough because people who do so are low-lifes trying to buy my time with the chance of free stuff, and chances are fairly good that the free stuff doesn't exist anyway. 

Why busy yourselves deleting stream threads that get massively downvoted anyway? Why busy yourselves deleting stream threads that get massively upvoted, considering that it's apparent that people want to see that content here if it's getting upvoted? Honestly this kind of stuff should be below your concern.","1385856802"

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","I know I probably have cooler ones if I thought long and hard about it, such as when the Serbian faction (played by me) had had enough of Greek decadence in the Byzantine Empire and the Serbian patriarch seized the throne, stabilizing the empire and guaranteeing Byzantine independence for several more centuries. 

But the one that comes to mind most as I think about it is when I realize that in Paradox Games I'm not terribly fond of fighting my own battles.  It's expensive, it destroys my culture and infrastructure, and I end up in this black hole of military spending I just can't escape.  The most militant countries and kingdoms, it seems, are always the furthest behind, the least rich.

I want to build up a powerful, stable, rich kingdom.  This, however, tends to invite the powers that be around me to see my rich, fertile lands and come up with some bullshit excuse why God actually meant for it to be theirs.  I can rarely hold onto these on my own, I constantly struggle militarily, and truth be told it's becoming something of a crutch, but I digress.

I had opted to play the eldest son of William the Conqueror after he had been victorious in his Norman invasion.  Historically he had never taken the throne, but I played with history.  Twists, turns and gains saw him take the throne, albeit shortly before he died and his second son took over.  The second son died of illness shortly after taking the throne and left it to his infant brother, who was murdered on the orders of a courtier (who rotted to death in an oubliette for it), leaving the throne in the hands of a distant family member, far outside of what I had originally intended.

For all of this I was surprisingly devoid of civil strife.  The nobles were firmly in my pocket, even as I stripped away their traditional powers and took away gavelkind succession.  My eye was firmly set northward, where I married into the family of a pretender and placed him solidly on the throne of Scotland.  He had been desperate for allies and had even been willing to consent to a matrilineal marriage if it meant *someone* would press his claim for him.

England did, and England benefited from it as their offspring eventually became both king of England and Scotland.  Great Britain being firmly under the hold of an English monarch, only brief civil wars in Scotland threatened my stability.

This could be considered the First Act of the House of Normandie grand play.  Having established so firmly a kingdom that ruled both north and south meant that I could begin considering continental interests.  The House of Capet was in chaos, going through kings with reckless abandon as cousins, nephews, uncles, distant relations of every sort would constantly flock from the woodwork and argue that the Bretons ordained they should be king, to which another would answer ""Well I have the Burgundians"", but another would retort, ""but my Carolingian allies say this"", resulting in massive territorial loss at the hands of the Holy Roman Empire.  Finally I found my way in when one of these pretenders, a young 15 year old girl looked at the Breton, Carolingian, Burgundian forums and said, ""Would Normandie represent me?""

My king was at this time unmarried, after my first wife died of the Great Pox.  Fitting for the whore, really.  The king of England entered a union with a young Capet princess that had her claim shat on by her distant uncle, who was tentatively fighting a brutal war with the Holy Roman Empire, and he was clearly on the losing side.

Mustering the whole of England and recognizing the opportunity, I married the French princess and swept in, immediately crushing the Breton coalition so thoroughly that I don't think they ever really recovered.  Most of their leaders were locked in my dungeons without heirs and those that ended up taking their lands became firmly in my pockets.  Dispensation of their lands to loyalists sealed the deal.

The Capet King tried to make a hasty peace with the Germans and turn to face me, but having already taken Paris and Orleans the best he could do was harass me.  Eventually I forced the French host to meet me in battle where they were soundly beaten and my French princess took the throne.  The King of England and King of the Scots was now in a union with the Queen of France, and the former solidly crushed any rebellions formed in haste against the latter.

Any final challenge to the Normandie-Capet Union was finally smashed when the queen produced a son that would inherit all three kingdoms, bringing a curtain to a close on the second act.

I immediately shored up an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire, realizing that they were, without a doubt, the greatest danger threatening my kingdom.  The occasional Scottish noble would get too big for his britches and demand electoral inheritance or some sort of decline in monarchal power, but they were easily quashed.  My only true fear was the Kaiser and his criss crossing claims across my French territory.

I courted the Kaiser, I bribed him, I curried favor with his nobles, and ultimately I married my son to his third daughter.  With our incredible relationship, he was the muscle behind my crowns, as I continued to strengthen my kingdom, occasionally trading the odd political favor by putting down Savoy or Carolingian aspirations with him.

However, the English court was becoming notoriously non-English by this time.  With the massive amount of land I had inherited by the time I became the son of the Capet-Normandie Union, my court was as filled with Franks as it was with Normans and Anglo-Saxons, with the Franks certainly taking the simple majority.

Worst of all, be it complacency, laziness, or a simple stroke of fortune, the Franks proved to be the most competent at court, and my young king was raised as a Frank.  The outrage in the Anglo and Scottish courts cannot be understated.  Day after day after day new rebellions constantly rose and I emptied the treasury and more in assassinations, mercenaries, abductions, exiles...if it could be done to try to bring peace I bought it and sealed it in blood.

It did not matter, however, particularly as the Holy Roman Empire decided that their newest source of fun would be playing crusader in the Levant.  Eventually the throne of England fell in favor of a far distant relative who had only a tenuous relation to William the Conqueror.  In short order the Scots were the next to rebel, striking an Alliance with the new English king and the revolt was so successful that I did not even have a duchy left in Scotland.

I was now the sole king of France, isolated and alone, surrounded by nobles that noticed that the once proud king of three crowns was now fighting to hold onto one.  A cousin or a nephew of the Capet uncle that had been the rival of my mother arose and with English and Spanish support succeeded in taking my crown.  I was now a count of a small county in Bavaria that I had not even realized I owned.

At first I was disappointed and saddened.  Like Icharus I had flown so high on wings that could not lift me, and as I sat with my 20 retainers I envied being so close to the sun.

However, the Crusades came to an end, the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem had been established, the wars of Europe had, for now, gone quiet.  I turned to my father-in-law, who was now at the height of his prestige in power, and humbly pleaded with him for support.  At first it was simple, ""Would you rather I or this Capet who has constantly warred with you be your nearest neighbor?""  Being old time rivals, it was no surprise that the German armies crossed into France and handed me back my throne - a throne I daresay was bathed in blood as I rounded up the lot of the rebels and executed them in short order.  I brought the hammer down the hardest on France: it was the largest single landmass in my ancestral possessions, and full of the most turbulent lords.  If I nipped at them I could deal with the anger of their children.

Then on the back of German arms I crossed the English Channel and ousted my cousin, who I had exiled.  The man found his way in some court in Norway I believe.

Finally the Germans carried me all the way to Scotland, the sheer number of Teutons meant it was inconceivable for the rabble rousing Scots, who had fallen on hard times and were suffering under invasions by the Norwegians, to put up a serious defense.  In five simple years of war, through absolutely no military effort on my part, from the sheer bullying of my wife's father, I was given back all three thrones, and left a fountain of blood in my wake.","1385856805"

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","Holy shit, I am going exactly through the same. Since I started working after college, I keep asking myself ""now what?"". I've been having good and bad times with my anxiety.

But, just as your title states, I have to thank a little bit to my anxiety for letting me get my dream job. This obsession of trying to learn every detail, and be constantly worried that I don't know enough, helped me be prepared enough to do well in my interviews. This was confirmed by my psychiatrist, who stated that my slight obsession has given me more positive things than negative things.

But then, I keep asking myself the same: what should I do with my life? And I started thinking a lot about avoiding wasting my life, and what is the meaning of life, and things like that. Sooo, after suffering a lot of anxiety due to these questions, I reached a conclusion with which I am very happy and has helped me to relax a lot: I just want to be happy. My body needs endorphins, and I want to have them. So, I do things that I like, and just stop giving so much attention to questions that are too far ahead. If I do productive things, and couple them with fun things that make me happy, I KNOW that I will be ok the rest of my life.

Right now I am trying to figure out how to simply calm myself down when I am going to have a big change in my life, like this job for example, which will require me to move to another country, with a different language and different culture.

So yeah, maybe the reasons that give you anxiety are similar to mine. I can recommend you to go to therapy, preferably a psychiatrist, so he/she can prescribe medication. It helps a lot, and will allow you to try to figure out things on your own gradually, reducing the panic attacks. Also, it is very important to have a healthy life and keep yourself active mentally, physically and socially.","1385856808"

Then what reason is there for altruism in any form? If acting purely in self-interest is a sound way of living your life, the world would be a pretty awful place.

&gt;However, they are very far away from me, and in my lifetime I cannot justify that by providing them with more food, my life will be benefited greater than being able to eat meat. So I eat meat.

Can you really justify living your life by only empathizing with those who have something to offer you? If you were in a position that your helping someone would endanger your life, I think that your lack of empathy or helping would be relatively justified. But something like donating money to disaster relief in the Philippines, or eating less meat, these things may cause you to lose something, but the amount of good that you're doing is, objectively, outweighing the negative impact on your life. This is assuming that you think of all humans being of equal importance, or relatively so (if you can admit that you think that innocent Filipinos as being less important than you, I applaud your honesty, but will call you a jerk).

Basically, my point is: what kind of world would it be if people only ever helped those who could, in turn, help them back in a way that they'd prefer?","1385856813"

Or they are eventually bought at a much lower valuation than the first offer -- but nobody knows since the first attempt wasn't published. I know first hand of a few companies that had offers, turned them down, and later exited in a fire sale.

Also: Digg. Viddy. Hipstamatic. Path. Living social. Klout. Everpix. Groove shark. Form spring. Cuil. 

You can bet good money all of them had suitors at one point or another but either exited too late or not at all. Some of them are still around, but if you read up on them you can see they're in a death spiral, and they're definitely passed their peak.

Therefore, all the measurements would a) assume that each coil is identical, and b) assume that any readings from a multimeter or ohm reader are 100% accurate. Neither of these assumptions are realistic.  
I won't get into the math of how long batteries will last, the takeaway is that you should always assume that your measured resistance is only a ballpark estimate. The lower you go in resistance, the more the margin of error widens and more risk is involved.

Edit: The lower his battery voltage goes, the safer the setup becomes, but an overcharged battery could pose a safety risk.","1385856817"

The only other basic tools you will be missing are the slingshot (which MAY appear randomly in place of the shovel at Nookling Junction in later days in the game - just check back each day) and the axe (which will be sold at the gardening shop - it has the chance to be sold instead of the watering can every day so keep checking back with Leif to grab one of these).

The vanity tools (or tools that are nice to have but aren't really necessary in the game) are the megaphone, timer, and toy hammer. Some may consider other items like the bubble wand and tweeter as other vanity ""tools.""

The bubble wand and tweeter are items that are obtained via streetpass (if you have streetpass turned on for ACNL and you pass the same person 6 times, you will get a bubble wand - 10 times and you will get a tweeter). The rest of the tools I've outlined [here in question number 6 of my FAQ Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qq0ys/common_misconceptions_and_faq_part_2/) on how to obtain them. 

As a new player, I would highly recommend reading over this FAQ and checking out Part 1 (linked at the top of Part 2) as well  -  many of these questions are things you might wonder about once you start up the game :]

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Well, it was written primarily in Objective-C, and Xcode is the IDE, since it's for iPhone and iPad. Two common 2D libraries went into it: [Cocos2D](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) 1.0.1 for rendering graphics to screen, and [Box2d](http://box2d.org/) for the physics. Otherwise, it's just coding; there weren't any sort of 'game builders' used, though those seem like they can do a decent job if the kind of game you're envisioning fits within the mould of what they handle best (I typically see platformers or top-down/isometric tile-based games made with them).

**EDIT:** Sorry, answered before I saw your edits! So, I'm from Illinois, in Chicago for the last few years, and the few friends who've joined me in the last few months working on Hungry Henri were college transplants to Chicago, so they're also in the area. And just a few weeks ago I moved past my comfortable life position as a quarter-centenarian, into the murkier, deeper waters of the Oh God, I'm Getting Old And Life Is Catching Up To Me Sea.

I didn't go to school for game design (though that would've been cool), rather I studied ancient near eastern languages and civilizations. But coding's cool, and making games, so far, has been awesome. I just began learning to code with this project, about a year and a half ago. Which means, if you're reading this and have wanted to start learning but have been making excuses, you should totally go for it! Look at me, I studied something completely unrelated, and could still manage it! =)","1385856821"

I'm studying in Ontario. All of my searching is leading me to standard CCDC civil works documents, but that's about it. Those first 3 points are fairly straightforward. I can't really glean from my findings what sort of advantage or disadvantage CW might hold and I don't have any experience to speak of to understand their impact on cost/time/quality vs other contract types.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt; This caused SC to become undervalued for all the Planetside players.

Or its possible that people were buying it because it was 'rightly valued'. Right now you could easily spend $20 'pimping' out a vehicle with just cosmetics, maybe to a few people that's worth it, but if it only cost $10 or $5, its going to be worth it to a whole lot more people.

If they did away with station cash all together and just charged straight dollars it might not be so bad. Nintendo got rid of 'points' on their e-shops, valve charges straight cash for the MannCo store. You don't need pass-through funny money to shoehorn a few extra bucks out of a customer anymore.

There are so many other ridiculous reviews out there too; like people who review anti-aging products the night after using them and say they didn't see any results.

Some of the worst are the mascara reviews. A product clearly advertised as a volumizing mascara yields the following review: 

OMG this mascara sucks. It did not give me any length or curl. 

...and vice versa of course. 

Lastly, there is my favorite and it also applies to foundation; the 1-star rating because it ""didn't match my skin tone."" Seriously, go get matched then.

The whole point in having laws is everyone is treated the same. That means if you want to allow guilty people to be killed quickly, the innocents that are wrongly convicted will be killed quickly as well. And you can't use the overwhelming evidence excuse for killing people quickly since nobody is supposed to be convicted without overwhelming evidence in the first place. In addition, if you killed some people faster than others, that would essentially be admitting that you aren't really positive the ones you aren't killing quickly are really guilty, which would pose huge problems to the credibility of the entire system.","1385856826"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","After reading everyone's heart breaking stories, it makes mine a little lame but as it is quite recent I really want to share my heart break.

November has been the worst month of my life so far. It began when my partner of nearly 7 years decided to end the relationship. At first I was devastated and in a way I guess I still am. It came as a shock to me as I thought it was something we could get over, but like many long distance relationship we drifted apart and he wanted to move on. So I tried, I focused on my mediocre retail job and tried to get through each day.

Anyway, a week went by and then I was suspended at work. At that point, I fell apart. I was pulled into an investigation and suspended there and then. What makes it worse is that my manager knew I was going through a tough time and though he seemed genuinely concerned for me when I told him what had happened, he still did what he did. 

For a the rest of the second week I went in a downward spiral. I had to stay with family because I was afraid of being alone. I didn't know if I could get through another day and I didn't want to think like that. I stopped eating for a while and all I wanted to do was cry. I felt like I lost the 2 things in my life that was getting me through each day. I probably would have coped with losing one or the other but losing both at around the same time sucked.

Now it's the end of November and I'm still suspended. I still haven't heard back from work and I'm still suspended. I'm still being paid so it's not so bad but I've been employed in that place for over 4 years and well my colleagues have become my second family. I have a father figure who looks after me, brothers who stand up for me like I'm their little sister and the girls are like my sisters too. I can't talk to them and I can't go in to see them either. This hurts me more than anything.

I have learned one thing though, I have the best family around. They have supported me through the most difficult time of my life so far. Even my ex has supported me through my suspension. I know that I have probably lived through more clichès this month than the average human being has in a lifetime. I have to tell myself everyday that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger, that I have to take each day as it comes and that time heals all wounds.","1385856831"

The twin towers were the tallest towers of their type on the planet, and the only skyscrapers to be hit by 767-sized aircraft for a long while. They weren't just on fire, they had a large section of their structures gutted by the impact and then they were on fire for hours.

I don't want to sound rude, but are you genuinely having trouble believing that a jet plane could hit a building taking out several supports, catch fire to weaken the others, and cause it to collapse? If so, what do you think the twin towers would need?

&gt;and building 7

again, another building that didn't collapse due to fire. It took pretty severe structural damgage and then it was left to burn itself down. 

&gt;the only ones in the world that have collapsed due to fire?

they aren't, others have done so since from fire *alone*.

Speak to your landlord/lease holder and let them know what's up, they'll let you know what's required from their side.  If you're not happy with the answer you recieve from them, by all means do confirm what they tell you is in the lease.

In my book, helping young people with severe disabilities is worthwhile. Apparently not so in yours. 

I can live with that, we just clearly have very different perspectives on human value and worth. I was raised with very specific cultural and ethical values that I still live by, we obviously come from different worldviews.

&gt;By your logic, everyone who's ever not been hired for a job has been discriminated against in some way.

That is not at all what I've said. What lawsuits do is trigger a rebuttable presumption of liability on the part of the employer. It is *rebuttable*. They must present evidence of good cause, and often times it will suffice. Sometimes (and this is when plaintiffs win) they can't.","1385856838"

Her relationship with this guy is so important to her that she is willing to put your relationship with her at risk. You are definitely her second choice, or her fall back guy if you will.

I don't mean to be so blunt, but honestly she is stringing you along until the relationship with this guy comes to fruition. At that point you will be kicked to the curb. If they don't work out, you will have her back - again. The problem is what happens next time, or the time after that? Are you comfortable being her second choice?

I doubt you are. You seem like you got a good head on your shoulders. The problem is - as the saying goes - love is blind. You are hoping for the best while ignoring the worst. You see the signs, but you just don't want to listen to them like you should be. ","1385856839"

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","""My girlfriend asked me to strip for her, so I did.

First I took off my pride. I wore it like a shawl to protect all my insecurities. She loved it. 

I took off my shame. It hung around my legs, a thousand uncomfortable memories wound tight 
like twine to hide my ability to be free and open. She loved it.

I took off my fear. They gripped my feet like stone slippers, hoping to keep me from ever leaping
as far as I was capable, often succeeding. She loved it.

Finally I took off my doubt. The doubt that was there so long it had become me. I ripped it off 
revealing the flesh of my love for her and the bone-depth of my feelings for her and the blood
that rushed for only her, forever. 

She didn’t love that.

She left wearing my clothes.

With **MDK**, you can use Loki (Basically bypass bootloader checks, install a custom recovery, and install any ROM you wish)

With **ME7** and **MI1**, you can use Safestrap which allows you to run TW based ROMS (So no AOSP based ROMS like CM - as far as I know) 

With **MJ7**, you can't run custom ROMS (As far as I know, this may have changed recently)

That's my understanding of the current VZW Baseband vs ROM debacle.

Secondly, the bishop is one of those craptastic bishops, protocol would be to call his secretary to schedule a meeting, if she is still being ignored then contact the stake president.

Finally, whenever the meeting happens she should mentally prepare herself for one of two things church discipline(Excommunication maybe something less drastic like not taking the sacrament) or get asked to repent and listen to some hard truths. It will not be easy whatsoever.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","I don't think this is supposed to be a quick fix, but rather a lifestyle change.

As far as I know you're still supposed to be able to have sex.  As far as fapping, you shouldn't need to fap the rest of your life after a reboot.  I'm not saying you can't slip, I'm just saying there shouldn't be any ""consistent or regular fapping"" if you're trying NoFap.  That being said some people just try to see if they can do it, and then go back to the way they were, and if that's cool to you, then by all means.  However a majority of us are looking for a way we don't ever have to look at porn or fap again.  

It's also for some of us, because we want better sex lives.  Personally I don't have any experience with actual sexual intercourse, and don't expect I will any time soon (or even the rest of my life), so I can't really tell if you it will help in that department.  Plus I'm around the same day as you.  The way my badge is set up I've gone through 16 days and actually i'm on my 17th.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You probably have the most convincing argument so far, and honestly you've persuaded me the most but I still think with out religion our views would still be medieval. I would think our religious beliefs have shifted because of new discoveries in science that have made what was said in religion outdated. So we were forced to reconsider if what religion said was true and if it wasn't then what that said about our morals that we based off of that system. e.g. we use to sacrifice things to the old gods in order to bring a good harvest but then we figured out how to make a good harvest and realized we didn't need to sacrifice our pray for it we could make it. Once we stopped sacrificing for it we wondered why we did it then we reconsidered sacrificing virgins and realized ""hey maybe it's not so cool to kill a virgin"" so the view became morally wrong because it no longer pertained to the religion.","1385856846"

For lack of a better term, I guess I am an atheist. When I confessed that I just couldn't subscribe to her faith she gave up. She called me and told me I would never be enough for her without a belief in God. I realize now that she was manipulative and selfish, for the most part.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","No. That's why they're all dangerous. That's the point! 

You think that by removing the State that powerful companies will just sit by and let competition weed themselves out? You think that companies that can afford private security, when all public accountability is removed from that security forces, will just accept that this tiny upstart just has a better product or a better price? Or are they given incentive to utilize the violence available to them to weed out the less powerful competition?

You think ""bad reputation"" will hold them back? They have a monopoly over the market, people will buy their shit anyway. You think that when people find out that the company used violence to protect their product that the public will refuse to buy? 

How do you explain the drug trade? Almost everyone knows that there is blood being spilled over the drug trade, in the thousands. Yet they still buy the drugs. 

And it doesn't even take a ""true monopoly"" (100% market share) for that to happen. It just needs to have enough capital to afford private security.

Fantasize all you want... It's not realistic. People don't care if a business performs  actions that they themselves might personally  object to. If they did, Walmart, Apple, and Nike would all be out of business. There would be no drug trade.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","So a couple things

The most important is that you get to define your sexuality. You choose if you want to identify as straight, gay, bi, asexual, whatever. You could also choose not to buy into any of that! From my personal experience, being a woman with a penis, I have slept with straight men before, sort of prefer them actually. That doesnt make them gay. I've also slept with gay women. That doesn't make them straight. Its not about the configuration of genitals, balls touching, or any of that nonsense. Its how they as an individual choose to express themselves. Sure I can put my own definition on how I see them, just like everyone does to everyone, but when it comes down to it, its their right to define themselves.

If this experience has you questioning your sexuality, then my next point is... I personally think sexuality is more fluid then people realize. I mean there are exceptions to everything, but as you have seen in this thread a lot of straight identified men would have done the same thing. There are probably completely straight people out there, but I would bet money that the vast majority of people would be willing to experiment with someone of the same sex given a certain level of comfort, discretion, attraction, guidelines, etc.

So what happened was some experimentation. You are dealing with regret and such, but you shouldn't be, give it some time, evaluate how you feel. Maybe this is a one time thing that teaches you a little about yourself, maybe its the damn breaking open into a life of hot man on man romance.

The inebriation is certainly worth considering here. Pot can be a very sensual experience. Alcohol definitely lowers those inhibitions. Don't be so hard on yourself. We've all done things we regret while fucked up, be glad yours was just a hot guys dick down your throat and a load of his sweet... I mean it could be worse.

Lastly, there is a reason people like sucking cock. Its fun. If anything chalk it up to being a good experience.

For me, fallout has more interesting atmosphere and more, but that's just my opinion.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","Either two(of maybe half a dozen) possibilities may happen:

1. The Vulture steals Ben's youth, forcing back into an old man. Vulture becomes younger, Ben older. Ben will continue to reverse age from what ever age he biologically becomes. They could effectively become immortal if every half century they swap ages.

2. The Vulture steals Ben's age, but because of the way Ben's age is reversed the Vulture instead becomes *older* while Ben becomes younger. Ben's condition is so absolute it causes anyone to try and change it to feel the effects also. After stealing the age the Vulture will age as normal(probably not for long since he is suddenly an 80 year old man) and Ben is a dead fetus.

Those are the two most likely scenarios that could happen. Unlikely ones are:

1. Vulture steals age. In stealing age **HE** becomes cursed with reverse aging and becomes an 80 year old senior citizen. Ben is cured and will age normally if he somehow doesn't turn into a fetus. Vulture will eventually have to find a way to avoid de-ageing into fetus; maybe something similar to scenario 2.

2. Vulture steals age. Ben ages into a fetus, Vulture ages younger. Vulture is now cursed with the same affliction that Ben was born with. Now instead of making people older he makes them *younger* to stave off turning into a baby.

3. Nothing happens. Ben is completely immune to the effects of age tampering and will de-age ceaselessly until he dies. Vulture gains nothing.

Unfortunately with Mr. Button dead in his universe we have no way of studying how his condition came to be or works. Maybe it was the clock like the Universe Viewer showed, but probably not. Unless you have a time machine or an alternate universe version of Mr. Button that we could study all we can do is guess at how his aging works.

FWIW, I flew to the Willow Women's clinic in Vancouver CA to get a Gynefix Mini, which is a frameless copper IUD especially for women who haven't had children.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","That's a non-standard usage of the term ""subsidy"".  When $X of every member's health ""insurance"" bill is for birth control, and the insurer pays $2X to provide me with birth control, while paying $0 to cover the gay members, *that is a subsidy* ... and to the extent that the enterprise is like this, it's not classical insurance either, *even if you think it's still a good idea*, and wish to blur the distinction between the two points.

And before you ask, no, you don't get to use a new meaning for the term while retaining all the implications and connotations that the old meaning gave you.  That's not how it works.

Ninja edit: And in case you try to blur in the concept of true insurance by comparing this to ""non-cancer victims in a pool subsidizing cancer victims"": yes, true insurance can involve that, so long as the buyer committed to pay for it *before* they knew who would have cancer.  If you know *now* that you'll need birth control, while others know now that they won't, but everyone has to pay for it, that is not insurance, even and especially if you can come up with non-insurance reasons why it might be a hip idea.

His point was that feminism/mensrights have absolutely *nothing* to do with the topic at hand, because before anything it must be acknowledged this man was mentally ill.

The point is, feminism isn't perfect, and neither is the mensrights movement, and as thinking adults we should be critical of them both, but neither of them should be using this event to push *any* agenda.

Fundamentally, I think you and /u/ShitLordXurious agree that this event is a tragedy which should be divorced from agenda-pushing. I believe you simply misinterpreted him as being anti-feminism when in reality he was simply rejecting some feminists' misuse of this unfortunate shooting.

While you could be looking at nervous laughter, it seems a little excessive for someone to be nervous about the activity you mentioned, but it's definitely plausible: especially since you identify as trans which may result in some confusion for your partner with sex acts that they consider gender specific.


Did you build up to it? This could be stress relief laughter. If he spent some time worrying that you were going to suggest something he really wasn't into he might just be so glad you DIDN'T say something awful.


Your concern is that it's cruel laughter. But what misfortune is there to laugh at?  It's not like you tripped over your own feet and accidentally liked nipple play.  It's possible that there is some judgmental attitude beneath the laughter, but it seems unlikely given how mundane that kink actually happens to be.

Yes, we can draw a causal connection between the two movements, and take advantage of historical perspective to create a narrative that marries them together as part of some singular event, but were they really associated in any meaningful way?

It'd be easy to argue that so-called first wave feminists would disavow any connection to modern day feminism.  Modern feminists, and suffragettes have nearly nothing in common.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Actually we do have some ideas. First, they did not sound like they do in movies (e.g. Jurassic Park). Forget the roars and the rumbles. 

[Dinosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur), just so were on the same page, do not include crocodiles, flying reptiles ([pterosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur)) or aquatic reptiles ([plesiosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria)). We can try and surmise what extinct dinosaurs sounded like by examining living species:

1. The living dinosaurs are the birds. However, birds have a unique vocalization apparatus called a [syrinx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)) which is not present in the other extinct dinosaur groups. Thus it is not likely that extinct dinosaur groups could sing like living bird species. 

2. Crocodiles are the closest living reptile group to the dinosaurs. They communicate through a series of guteral roars, bellows, clicks, hisses. Non-vocal communication includes bites and tail snaps. [Examples](http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/croccomm.html). ""Crocodylians vocalize by using their larynx (same as humans!), a soft-tissue structure in the throat that does not fossilize. Since all the different types of living crocodylians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials) vocalize this way, it is probable that their common ancestor that lived during the Late Cretaceous did too, but whether their even earlier relatives could do so is unknown."" Crocodile communication is fairly complex and each call appears to have specific a meaning. This is the same with living bird calls. Thus any vocalizations that dinosaurs might have made was likely meaningful. 

3. Some dinosaurs like [Lambeosaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeosaurus_magnicristatus) seemed to have resonating chambers on the tops of their heads. Although the exact sounds they might have made is unknown it is pretty well established that dinosaurs in this group used these head appendages for vocal communications. But this is just one of dinosaurs among many. We don't know as much about how the other groups, without these resonating chambers, vocalized. ""Indeed, dinosaurs may not have vocalized the same way that crocodylians or birds do, and even if their soft-tissue vocalization organs were not preserved, scientists can still study their fossilized inner ears to try and understand what sounds they might have been able to hear. A dinosaur with sensitive ears, for example, might have been more communicative, but unfortunately there are no living non-avian dinosaurs to test this idea.""

Keep in mind you don't even have anything in your pockets at the moment (well aside from your hand, which should be avoided in the future for fit check purposes).

Maybe get a more tapered fit below the knee, but the thighs probably need to either stay the same width or even be a little bigger.","1385856884"

"Debate","t5_2qja8","Depends how they define the resolution. It's the affirmative's ground to define the terms within reason. You should be prepared for different definitions of 'this house', 'kill', and 'god.' 

I mean they could reasonably define it as ""That [the debate community] would [eliminate totally] [organized religion]."" Then you need to be able to answer why religion is beneficial and that the harms of rights violations and such aren't indicative of religion but instead speak to prejudice in humans. This is just an example to say that you don't necessarily know exactly what you are going to be defending yet. 

That being said, I would say that a *Cultural Imperialism* critique would be a powerful one to run here. Notice that this is a value debate because no one could actually make a policy, but valuing the elimination of someone's deity means that the affirmative team believes that **they know better** than others. They want to force this concept on others. This means that they are valuing a worldview were 'more enlightened thinkers' get to control others. Some examples of other people who value their minds over others: slave owners, Europeans conquering the inferior Native Americans, those who participate in female genital mutilation, etc. Then you tell your judge that no one should ever value a worldview that encourages Cultural Imperialism. Even if 'killing god' would be good for some people, it ultimately reinforces a global problem of Imperialism. So the Judge should vote in the negative to encourage more discussion and education about the evils of Cultural Imperialism. 

[Note that some of the harms that the Affirmative may be talking about (People use God as excuse to do bad things) are examples of Cultural Imperialism (I know better than others about God's will, so I'm going to force my views on them). That means that the Affirmative team is fighting Cultural Imperialism with **MORE** Cultural Imperialism. That doesn't fix anything.]","1385856886"

I don't believe that religion answers the question of how to improve spirituality, nor do I believe it's mystic. In fact, I agree that it comes naturally, but so do diseases and infections.

When the subconscious side of us is weak, corrupted, or broken, we try to solve the issue with logic, or out right leave it alone to fester, throwing up our hands and pretending it doesn't exist. You make the point that to work on your spirituality, you simply need to work on the things that sustain and interest you, (and I agree that's certain the bulk of it) but leaving it at ""this interests me"" can lead to self-justification for some pretty sick and inhumane things; Leaving it at that would be ignorant and detrimental, with no frame of reference should that routine derail.

The fact that I find something beautiful that you don't or that something moves you that is trivial to me proves that there is something to it other than empty words and chemical imbalances. Else it wouldn't be a thing! ""Can not un-see"" is a decent analogy for this: You see something that moved you, but when someone brings in a related coincidence, it could flip or otherwise alter your feelings and opinions.

By Baud I'm assuming you mean bits per second? If so, How do I know what the system settings are?

I am at the port settings and see the following options:

Bits per second (75-128000)9600 is the default. The number doubles starting from 75, 11, 134, 150, 300,....4800,7200,9600, etc
Data bits (4-8) with 8 as default,
Parity (even odd none mark space ) none as default
Stop bits (1, 1.5,2) with 1 as default
Flow control Xon/Xoff, hardware, none with none being the default



**Edit1:** It's good to know that serial requires no drivers. Are newer models are USB only?

I've been playing around with the bits per second and now the display actually response! ...but it just shows random numbers when I press the items. It'll show 1 then maybe 1 or nothing then 2 or 3 

**Edit2:** It shows the price of the product! But only for a fraction of a second. is that the software problem or do I need to keep fiddling? Do I need to restart anything at all?

**Edit3:** The pricing stays! Thank you very much but it does not show the change, just the total, is this because of the software?

We'd say the Amazons get traction because it's something we understand. Elves, sorcerers are sort of fantastic (as in pertaining to fantasy) where as Amazons are a little more directly relatable. Those aren't some magical creature we don't really know about because we're a good Christian. An Amazon is one of those warrior women who doesn't have room in her lifestyle for men.

We have a bit of gender bias here. We (the entertainment consumer) see this in games all the time primarily with the [Smurfette Principal](http://www.feministfrequency.com/2011/04/tropes-vs-women-3-the-smurfette-principle/). The rest of them are types of men for the most part. This one is a dude who is a sorcerer that one is a dude who is an elf. But suddenly now we get a woman and that's something we pay attention to because that one is real. Like Smurfette. Everyone has a job/trait be it intelligent, brawn, vanity. But Smurfette doesn't get distinguished because being a girl makes her distinguished. (We have the same problem with racial representation but that one is a bit more recognized). So we see these tiles not as Amazons which are a type of woman. But as women entirely who have become Amazons.

I just did this a few months ago. Hardest part is in between San Francisco and Monterey, because all the state parks in between  don't have hiker/biker sites. (It was a shock to me after Oregon and Norcal, all the campgrounds there have HB sites.)


There's a couple of lighthouses that are hostels in between the two, that you can stay at, but they are 25-30$. Assuming your alone, you might as well stay at a hostel instead of a campsite for the same price, and you'd have to book a non-H/B campsite anyways. Hostels were full when I stopped there and I ended up banging on a farmhouse door at 12pm cause none of the campgrounds had hiker biker sites. So I recommend making a reservation. www.norcalhostels.org


Monterey: Monterey Veteran's Memorial Park has a hiker/biker site.


Big Sur: Theres loads of campsites in big sur, afaik they all have hiker/biker sites. I did it in two days so I only needed food for one night, but if you plan on taking more time make sure you pack enough food. 


Morro bay: state park here has a hiker biker site. 


I went straight from Morro bay to Gaviota state park, it's like 95miles though. Its a pretty boring inland route from one to the other so it's not like your missing much though. I'm not sure if there's any hiker biker sites near pismo beach if you want to cut that distance into smaller chunks. 


From Gaviota to LA there are plenty of state parks with hiker biker sites, I think leo carrillo is the last one before LA?


LA: There's a hostel in San Pedro for like 25$. Keep in mind the that in LA, the ride is slow, the beach side bike path is jam packed with people the whole way. I stayed at that hostel for a night then went to a friends house near Irvine. You could use warm showers in LA fairly easily I think.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Agreed. I read this a while ago, and thought it was nicely relevant here (apologies for the wall of text):

""The central problems and questions of life and living haven't changes since the times of Plutarch, Pliny, or Plato; the same questions that we ask ourselves now were asked by Montaign, Seneca, and Epictetus, and examined by Confucius, Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius. People like Aristotle, Boethius, and Robert Burton wrote extensively on their reflections on life and its possible meaning and value and purpose. Their antiquity and supposed authority in these matters doesn't mean that they are right, or that they knew things about living of which we have become ignorant in our own times. They were just people, like ourselves, who dealt with the questions and uncertainties of existence that accompany the mere fact of living – regardless of when or where.
They might not be correct in their conclusions, and we might not agree with their arguments, but we ought still to read them, engage with them, and give them serious consideration.
Why? Two reasons spring to mind. First, these were people who had vastly fewer distractions in their lives, and were therefore more capable of giving sustained focus to the questions that being human entails. They had no internet, smart phones, televisions, electric lights – in short, very little to distract them from intense introspection between sunset and somnolence. They were therefore able to devote a large amount of time and mental energy to their considerations of these problems – time that we may not always have in our own lives.
Second, the mere fact that up to something like two hundred generations of humans have consistently considered the opinions of these writers to be worthy of serious consideration. Several dozen generations of people have found themselves asking the same ultimate questions about life because they were all experiencing the same essential considerations, and several dozen generations have found answers – or at least perspectives – worth knowing in these writings. This doesn't make them right; this makes them a reasonable source of perspectives into which we should then throw our own thoughts and beliefs and opinions, and through which we should find our own arguments and conclusions.""

TL;DR - Life stays pretty much the same in its essentials, and some opinions have stood the test of time, so we should read them - if not to accept, then at least to consider.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had to see my dad do that. My parents got divorced when I was 15 due to my dad cheating on my mum, but I had been good friends with my dad before that. I took my mum's side immediately and refused to speak with my dad for months after he moved out of the house. Eventually, I started keeping in touch with him again and we went on trips to other towns together and the like. He never spoke about the other woman or his problems with my mum, but the way he completely avoided talking about her felt odd... It was almost as if he was scared of letting me know anything.

It wasn't until a year later that things got really bad for him, when his eldest daughter died in a house fire (he was married before he met my mum). It completely broke him, and one day when I went to see him he was no longer the dad I'd known for 18 years. He had suddenly become super religious (he was not a religious person at all previously) and he was convinced that there was some kind of secret society out there to get him. I tried my hardest to try and convince him it wasn't true and asked him to get help, but he eventually started blaming that I was one of them as well. After a while, I just couldn't bear to listen to his mad ramblings and stopped visiting him. He accused me of some pretty horrible things and said really mean things about me.

It's been ten years since, and I haven't seen or heard anything of him. Until recently, I didn't even know if he was still alive until my mum said she saw him in town, looking good and happy... And that apparently he's been trying to locate me on Facebook to get in touch with me again.

Hearing that he's possibly doing better and trying to find me just makes me want to cry every time I think about it. I miss my dad, but I'm scared that it's just some twisted attempt to get him to feed his conspiracy nonsense to me again because it happened several times during the years after I severed ties with him. I moved out of the country several years ago so there's the distance as well... I just don't know if I will ever be able to find closure with him, and I worry the decision will be made for me when I'm called to his funeral.","1385856908"

The people who go to Washington with the idea of representing the best interests of the United States instead of the best interests of their party lose primaries.

Second, I don't understand why it's the responsibility of Republican governors to create state-wide exchanges on state money when the federal government basically offered to do it for free. If the Obama had wanted, I'm sure he could have made receiving some kind of federal funding contingent on creating state-wide exchanges.

That they're using the exact same argument of games influencing gamers views negatively, which they disregard in the violence sense, to push for more female role models. (as if it's implicit that game characters are and should be role models to begin with)

During the indie games and particularly the Last of Us the Guardian representative (Brooker is also from the Guardian) was talking about how games should/will become increasingly emotional, social and political.

Maybe it's more of an issue back east where everyone is sitting on top of each other? I rarely even see anyone on the trail when I'm hunting on public land.

Then, figure out what your goals are and measure out the distances your phases should be. Your first and last phases should be the same length or close to it, and your second phase just a wee bit shorter. For example, if you want to jump 40 feet, you first phase should be 14, then 12, then 14 feet. Put cones or tape at those marks along the runway, and then try to reach them while working each phase (1-2, 2-3). Trying to reach those marks will help you go out instead of up. ","1385856919"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; Not true based on Microsoft's previous consoles. They used standard drives that changed over time as the hardware was revised (drives were modified via firmware, sure) but your above ""fact"" is simply not true.

On the original Xbox they used optical drives that couldn't read CD-Rs. CDs use a different wavelength laser than DVDs and so you have to have two lasers or sacrifice the ability to read CD-Rs well.

&gt; The firmware modifications were for their game disc DRM, not DVD video stuff.

I'm not just talking about firmware modifications.

&gt; Also, your bit about model numbers is silly. They won't stamp model numbers on a drive unless it's THAT model. Sure it may have different firmware, but we can re-flash a retail drive.

That's why I say it won't. But it can, it's been done before. Changing the model number takes effort and they just might not bother. Some companies may just not change the model number because it's cheaper or because the customer doesn't want them to change the model number. It's just a number, in the end you can do anything you want with it.","1385856922"

&gt; And the summary doesn't include the actual food so who know what they ate.

That is very important.    I am currently taking care of type 2 diabetic, and following the recommendations in the [End of Diabetes](http://www.amazon.com/End-Diabetes-Live-Prevent-Reverse/dp/0062219979/) book by Dr.  Joel Fuhrman.  

His recommendations have worked extremely well, and when we keep her from beef and pork her blood sugar is easily controlled and ends up squarely in the 'non-diabetic' ranges.    

When she does get her hands on beef and pork, though, that's when the insulin resistance problems start, and last for a few weeks afterwards.

When we can keep the beef and pork away from her, even if she manages to elevate her blood sugar with something, her blood sugar will return to normal levels very quickly.  

That book has worked wonders in helping to manage her diabetes.  

Edit: clarification.   Also, this is for a much older sedentary woman who can't exercise much at all.    If you're 14 or 25 and thinking this can't be right because you can eat all you want, just remember that your body's ability to process things diminishes with age.  ","1385856922"

I don't think so, and I think that this is a fairly congruent, if simplified, version of what goes on in Twilight.

2. Edward feels that Bella should experience a human life, so he says she should go to college. Bella does not want to college, because if she does this, she can't be with Edward. Edward agrees to go to a college that Bella gets into so that she will go and experience human life. 

   Added to this, there is no implication, from Edward or otherwise, that Bella is stupid. It is explicitly stated that Bella can't get in anywhere good because she fell far behind during her depressive state (which was Edward's fault, but that is not the question at hand).

3. Edward never tells Bella to leave, and says that he will leave if it will make her happier. He actually does leave in the second book, but sees that it does not make her happier. He then stays, aware and pained that he is a bad influence in her life, but with the knowledge that the alternative is demonstrably worse for both parties.

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","Either way, A had a contract with C, and A was obligated to provide the goods to C under the terms of that contract. The only issue here is the breach of contract between A and B. You're overthinking it. Expectancy damages for B in cases where a seller breaches for sale of fungible goods are governed by either 2-712 or 2-713. 

If the buyer attempts to ""cover"" and mitigate his damages (in good faith and without unreasonable delay), it falls under 2-712. He gets the difference in contract price and the cost of cover, together with any incedental or consequential damages, less expenses saved from the breach. So damages = cost of cover - contract price + incidental or consequantial damages - expenses saved from breach. So if the goods were worth $75,000, and it cost him $80k to cover (because he had to find goods on such short notice), he gets the $5k, plus incidental or consequential damages, and minus any expenses he saved from the breach. But the buyer does not HAVE to mitigate under the UCC. In the common law, he may have to.

If the buyer does not mitigate, we switch over to UCC 2-713. Since the seller failed to deliver the goods, the buyer's damages would be equal to the difference in market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages (in 2-715), but minus expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.  So here, damages= Market value at time buyer learns of breach - contract price + incidental or consequential damages - expenses saved. So, if the buyer contracted for $75,000 worth of goods, and at the time the breach occurred, the market value of the goods went up in price to $80,000, He gets $80k -$75k+incidental or consequential damages -expenses saved = $5k plus whatever else.

The above examples assume the buyer has not yet paid for the goods. If he has already paid, thats factored into the contract price.

Now, if the market price is too speculative, he would get typically get reliance damages at the very least. He would get any reasonable paid expenses incurred between the time the contract was entered into and the time the contract was breached that were made in furtherance of the contract, and which would not have occurred had the contract not been agreed upon. So he would get his $75k back if paid, plus any other expenses during that period of time that were made in furtherance of this contract. ","1385856924"

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","&gt;So feminism is to be treated like a dogma or religion, where any hint of discord is construed as a personal attack?

Is that how people treat dogma or religion?

&gt;Has (1), (3), or (5) on that list ever been addressed to satisfaction?

They are included in the side bar as ""reoccurring topics"" if you didn't notice...

&gt;Feminism is supposed to be an academic pursuit

No... feminism is a movement. There are scientists within the feminist movement, however, who produce data that coincides with the core elements of the movement and its ideology.

&gt;It should be as open to criticism, and as academically rigorous as any other discipline.

Actually, it is, but the question of the discussion is ""why are [feminists] so hostile?"" and I am simply explaining what is one source of this hostility -- bringing up tired topics in an aggressive manner.

&gt;As Nietzsche says ""The surest way to corrupt is to instruct people to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently"".

I give no instruction to *not* ask questions. In fact, I only issue caution when bringing up these topics *in case you may not want to end up in a heated debate and prefer civil discourse*. Maybe you want to reread my statement?","1385856927"

However, last year I was in your exact position.  I ended up buying a Kala KA-C concert uke after doing research on a good beginner $100-$150 model.  I've never really focused on an instrument before and now I can play the thing pretty well if I do say so myself!  i.e. I stuck with it and maybe that had to do with the specific model I bought?... who knows.

It was really great to learn on and I still play it/love it. Didn't have too much action (strings' distance from frets) and the strings are nice and smooth.  Oh and I really like the sound (for a beginners ukulele... I may upgrade one day).  Concert size was perfect for learning as well.  Also, it's surely a nice color IMO.  

Lastly, I downloaded a tuning app on my iPhone to help me tune it (usually daily for the first few weeks while everything is still stretching into place) and I used two shoelaces tie together to create a half-strap which made learning easier (I don't need to use that as often now).  

Good luck and have fun!","1385856928"
"DnD","t5_2r9ei","taken from Order of The Stick forum:

I always liked this:
Step one: Genesis to create a small empty demiplane.
Step two: Put Phylactery and backup spell book in the demiplane.
Step three: Cast a Delayed (metamagic) Forbiddance (buy a scroll if you don't want to take the feat yourself).
Step four: Plane shift out.

End Result: Your phylactery is on a plane that is completely inaccessible via planar traveling spells. If your body is destroyed you reform on the demiplane (I'm pretty sure this doesn't count as interplanar travel). Cast dispel magic to break the forbiddance so you can leave then reapply steps three and four. As far as I know this is unbreakable without epic/divine stuff.

If it was the legit Java Updater, you should normally be able to stop the process, either through the Services.msc console (if it's installed as a service), or by using Task Manager. Since it keeps restarting on its own, it suggests it's malware. Also, since it's running from your \AppData\Roaming folder, this suggests it's malware. To be sure, upload it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) and see what it says.

If VirusTotal says it's malware, download and run [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653). Click on *jscheck.exe* in the process list and **suspend** it, not kill it. Chances are, since it restarts on its own, there is another process that is watching to see if the *jscheck.exe* process is getting stopped, and when it does, it restarts it. This is common with malware. If there is a buddy process, find it and suspend it as well. Once they are suspended, kill them.

Next, download and run [Autoruns](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902). Autoruns is *msconfig* on steroids - it knows of far more places where programs are autostarted. Find the *jscheck.exe* file in the listing and uncheck the checkbox next to it (recommnded), or just delete that line. Do the same to any buddy processes you find.

See why going for the ""punish card"" doesn't hold water? It's just flipped around because every party can feel ""victimized"" but it doesn't really mean they are.  As a society we need to change how we function, just because things ""worked in the past"" doesn't mean we should never change them for the present.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are a lot here about people dying- and to be completely honest, my most shattering moment was probably when my closest-in-age cousin died. He was autistic and so we were really close because we talked on the internet whenever one of us was having a frustrating time- we were both always on the internet, and it was easy for us to reach out to each other. 

But, surprisingly, a close second, was the day that my hamster Atilla died. It might be pathetic, but that little hamster meant so much to me. My girlfriend and I bought him together, and he was missing a toe, so he was extra special. We had him for several months, and we'd take him with us on our visits to see each other.

We were on a long road trip one summer, and we had stopped at a friends place. Everything just seemed so natural and good that day. We realized that our friend had a cat, so we couldn't put Atilla in his ball and let him run around like we normally do. So, we just naturally decided that it would be safer for him in the car. 

As everyone I tell this to can instantly guess- by the time we got back to the car, it was like 110 degrees, and Atilla had just *baked to death*. It breaks me up, because that was the day that I learned how easily you can lose something so close to you. One stupid act is all that stands in the way between a happy sunny day, and irreversible negligence.   

I've never been the same. I no longer want to have any job in which people are depending on me to save them, and I will not take having a family lightly, if I even have one at all. ","1385856930"

But is your complaint about the books or the movie adaptation? I was glad to see more than one directors take on how Hogwarts should look.

As for the time turners, a lot of them got stuck in a loop at the end of the fifth book which might have rendered them useless and I think Hermione handed hers back at some point before that? But I also find it unlikely that that cabinet held every time turner in the world. But on the other hand the group of friends actually go out of their way to avoid contacting anyone in the last book, so even if time turners where available somehow they would not know. I find it more strange that McGonagall would be irresponsible enough to get Hermione one just so she could burn herself out on extra lectures? Where does a teacher even get an item that belongs in the department of mysteries?

I think a lot of little things like that is caused by Rowlings development as a writer, the series seem to go from quirky childrens book to something more serious and well thought out as it progresses.","1385856938"

**What do you do?**

We’re MinoCloud, a database service that works just like a computer file system, simplifying the way you store your structured data. Your data is stored as Items, which can be organized into folders. Folder-specific permissions can be set, allowing other users to collaborate on or simply search through your data. This powerful database service is offered via a simple API, so whether you’re building the next big thing in social networking or a basic personal blog, MinoCloud can be used to drive your web services.

We also provide push notification support to web services, so you can either alert users or just update the front end of your web app. We handle the delivery, persistence and scaling of notifications, as well as offering some cool functionality such as scripted merging (1 notification that reads “100 comments” rather than 100 individual notifications) and conditional alerts (1 device can choose to suppress an alert for all other devices if the user is actively engaged - think messaging apps).

MinoCloud is great for both developers and businesses. We’re sure there are startups reading this that would benefit from using our development platform to jump start their web service. Use MinoCloud to avoid problems we have already solved and you can save yourself a load of time. 


**Are you looking for anything? (Feedback/Hiring/etc)**


We would really appreciate feedback from developers on our services, and general feedback on our [website](http://minocloud.com) and [video](http://vimeo.com/75916492).

The lower the light, the longer your shutter needs to remain open so any movement at all by either the object or the camera itself produces blur or softness to the image.  That's where tripods come in handy. They hold your camera still.

You can get a good low light image without a tripod if you brace your camera against something or if you set it on something. You can fill a sock with sand and use it as a camera stand for a quick alternative.  Just take care when pressing the shutter release button not to move the camera.  You can also use your camera's timer so you don't have to press the button.  Set it, point it and wait.

They also give official numbers for how many active, ""in-stream"" users there are; 300 million people are actively visiting their G+ stream at plus.google.com and actually post, comment, or reshare posts. These are the ""true"" G+ users, but unfortunately a lot of people use the higher number as a stat for active G+ users.

The real number of ""active users"" IMO is something between those two numbers, but even if you take the lowball 300-million count and compare it to Twitter's active user count ([not publicly reported anywhere, but calculated at ~140 million here](http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/) or ~[220 million here](http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-active-users-growth_b50145)) it seems to be doing quite well.","1385856940"

Mechanic automation and computerization are NOT the same thing. You are saying that to date computers not only eliminated but also created jobs. But computers are in their infancy. To date they largely been used in the same way a classic mechanical automation was used. Only now we are approaching the level of technology that allows automation of such inherently human activities as object recognition, navigation and even decision making in a dynamic and changing environment, like for example rerouting due traffic  changes. This is not something that EVER was done before.

And of course it will be good for humanity. But that does not change the fact that our current civilization is nearing the end of its lifetime.","1385856942"

The State institute of Eugenics (""Statens institut för rasbiologi"", commonly called ""Uppsala Rasbiologiska Institut"") was created in 1922 and was in business until the late fifties. Eugenic theories in Sweden led to the sterilization of thousands of mentally disadvantaged people to keep the ""nordic stock"" strong.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I live in Texas. I moved here from Wisconsin two years ago. My friends in Wisconsin have told me that people have gossiped that:

* I'm dead.
* My boyfriend down here beats me. (When the person was asked how they knew, he said he saw them. I haven't been home, or saw this person since six months before I moved down.)
* I have cancer.
* I have two kids.
* I'm homeless.
* I've become a prostitute. (People would pay me to keep my clothes on.)
* I suck my thumb.
* I have aspergers.
* I'm a lesbian.
* I'm a wigger.
* I deal/take/sell drugs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Why exactly do you lose respect for everyone who takes drugs? Because mray147 doesn't do drugs no fucking one in this whole world should do drugs? You say drugs change your life and they change who you are. Maybe you'll be surprised if I tell you a lot of things you do or experience change who you are, for example traveling around the world gives many people a whole new perspective on life and the world. I don't even dare to imagine a world where nobody ever changes, just think how boring that would be.

I personally have never understood how people can not be curious about mind altering substances. I mean I'm cool with it if someone doesn't want to do drugs, but my first beer, my first joint, my first trip I have done out of sheer curiosity. Imagine you could just look up at the sky and see all kinds of wonderful geometric patterns in the clouds, imagine you take your phone out of your pocket and you feel it slightly melting in your hands. Imagine you're looking at a field of grass and suddenly you realize how much life there is in it, with every single bug crawling on a leaf somewhere and you realize how infinitely complex and networked nature, yes even our whole reality is. It sounds like some kind of magic, but you can really have all of that in this otherwise so normal life here on earth. If you get a chance to experience magic, which you always thought didn't really exist since you've stopped believing in Santa Claus, then aren't you even a tiny bit curious what it is like?

Welp, I am sure you will in some way or another, be it through some fancy chemicals or traveling or what not, broaden your mind in the future, don't be afraid of change!

EDIT: Well, I just read your edit about your brother and I'm very sorry about that. But each drug is very unique and of course everyone reacts differently. I'm just saying drugs aren't necessarily bad. It's like saying ""I don't listen to music because I don't like Heavy Metal and Hardcore Rap"".","1385856950"

But it looks like this hybrid magnesium/plastic construction is what they're going to be using for most of their camera bodies now.  Perhaps a D400 will come down the line one day, which will probably be a repurposed D7100 with tougher construction and a larger buffer, but even then I'm sure the D7100 will be more than enough for my needs.

We didn't actually do anything beyond some handjobs, but I felt kind of crummy the whole time, and in hindsight using him as a rebound for another guy I had recently got uninvolved with. 

I haven't done anything with another guy since, and that was in August. Also, that encounter made me realize that gay apps weren't for me, and not long after that I deleted everything but Tinder, which I don't consider to be in the same league as apps like grindr.

"bisexual","t5_2qwnx","With the first guy, you had a good talk, you know each other well, you assessed what the risk was, and you made a decision. The only thing that bothers me with this scenario is the it's possible your friend's knowledge of what risks comes with what sex acts is not accurate. Maybe he did some sex acts he thought were safe in the past, but actually aren't. You need to keep that in mind.

For the second guy, what is that is done, but please don't make a habit of this. HIV is real, and I have HIV+ friends - it does happen to people. You deserve to be healthy and to live free of all the difficult stuff (and ultimately the shorter life) that comes with being poz.

As for lubes, they vary a lot in quality and texture. Go to a sex shop, and ask the staff to show you a few good brands. Most stores have sampler bottles that you can use to see the lube texture before you buy. And yeah, stick to water-based and silicone-based if you're using condoms.","1385856956"

Men of /r/theredpill or anyone else reading this from other subreddits listen up, and listen good:

With false rape claims and all the other bullshit that's going on in the world, fucking a chick is the most dangerous god damn game you can play. This subreddit preaches and preaches about looking out for yourself first, and mother fucker you better look out for yourself first. You better realize real fucking quick that it's you vs. the rest of the world. And the world doesn't care about you.

So the next time you think about banging that 9/10, remember that it could be your prison sentence if you're not careful. The next time you think about going LTR with that unicorn you've been seeing for a few months? Remember that **she may have impaled herself on your own brother's cock** and won't mention it.

I've played NC and VS and I have to say I prefer VS. No bullet drop! VS weapons tend to have a higher rate of fire which gives an advantage but sniping with Vanu weapons is very rewarding. I can't say much about TR but I tend to be biased towards Vanu. 

In regards to outfits - I'm in an Outfit called Derp Company. We are Vanu on Waterson (US East). We average one squad a day/night during the week and usually a platoon on the weekends. We have regular operations on Saturday and Wednesday nights. We offer training for the more noob players and are also working on training for a Spec Ops type of division. Also, I should mention we have a forum filled with Guides from some of our most experienced players. The guides cover anything from classes and weapons to gameplay tactics.

Anyways, feel free to join our TeamSpeak at any time to check us out and see if we're a good fit for you. Our TeamSpeak is Derpcompany.com, no password and our website the same. [Derpcompany.com](http://www.derpcompany.com)","1385856957"

In addition to these I have about 8-10 GB of textures. It is quite obvious why I crash, honestly, considering how dense a forest I have around there, with increased spawns and tons and tons of mods. Just annoys me that it has to be that EXACT place every time I reach the peak of my modding.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Alright, so considering your confusion and a bunch of other people posting (just as confused) let's try to clear some stuff up. 

Chances are that while most of you are ""knowing"" of your sexuality, you still bend slightly when it comes to a good looking..(not normally your type). On top of that, he sounds arrogant, hot, and self aware. 

It's ok to bend rules, experiment, and expose yourself to other types of people. That's always exciting and new. While OP might not have ever had these emotions/reactions before, they are something that can develop over time. You're a different person now then when you were in high school and definitely from when you're a kid. That amount of change continues on throughout your life.

Be willing to explore more of who you are and learn to be more comfortable with what you find. You might be pansexual, or it's only a thing when inebriated, or just a cookie jar you dip into now and then. It's variety, it's the spice of life. 

Also, I think you might be wrong about why he won't tell anybody. He seems like a guy that doesn't mind satisfying any type, knows he's sexy to more than just women. If you feel it would be permanently awkward, avoid him, otherwise bring it up again (especially if it's an avenue you want to explore more).

OP did fine, don't be afraid to learn more about who you are.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got my first girlfriend was I was 19. You could call me a late bloomer i guess. Anyway, right around the time we started dating she was going through a rough stage of suicidal tendencies that I didn't know how to deal with. A week later one of my best friends tried to kill himself making me the only person in our group of 5 to have not done it. My GF didn't stop with her problems and it caused me to get seriously depressed. So I ended it... i realized a week later after seeing her that I may have ended it too soon so I tried to give it another shot. A couple months later I ended things again for the same problems. A month after that I realized i loved her and tried to get her back... Well she didn't trust me and broke my heart accordingly. I cried for a bit and for the next few weeks fought to get over it. I guess I'm still fighting. I don't talk to her anymore but the sting of its end still hangs over me today. I can't seem to forgive myself for breaking her heart and won't let her back in my life after she broke mine. Every time I see a girl thats beautiful or funny I don't talk to her out of that fear...the fear that I may hurt her or that she may hurt me... I'm a shy and awkward person as it was before the whole debacle occurred and while I don't see  this stage of my life lasting forever, i don't see a clear end in sight.

TL;DR I broke me ex's heart, and she broke mine a while later. I can't seem to move on for fear of getting hurt again, yet can't keep living in this self created hell either. Idk what to do. ","1385856966"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I'm sorry, you need some lessons in basic macroeconomics.  Specifically, when prices go up in USD, aka inflation, that means that for other currencies the prices fall.  In other words, if a euro=1USD, and the US suffers inflation, then 1 euro &gt; 1USD.  So, for a european, it becomes cheaper to import something from the US than to buy the same thing in the EU.  

Whether inflation helps or hurts anyone is fully dependent on the circumstances.  If you have a fixed rate mortgage and inflation goes up, it is very good for you because you can get a higher rate of return in your savings/investments, as well as wages going up, while your mortgage payment stays exactly the same.  If you have a 401K or other investment account, inflation helps your portfolio value.  

Now, if you live off a fixed-income then inflation is bad for you because stuff costs more but you are getting the same amount of income.

On a macro level, if demand in the economy is weak, aka consumers don't want to or can't spend a lot, inflation is good because it encourages people to spend their money.  However, if supply in an economy is constrained, perhaps due to high tax rates, excessive regulations, high oil prices, then inflation is bad because industry will have a harder time borrowing along with high interest rates and supply won't be able to expand.

Look, rich people are going to find a way to make more money anytime there's a shift in the economy - rich folks can manage their portfolios, buy and sell assets and do other things to make sure they adjust to changing economic conditions.  Of course, poor people living paycheck-to-paycheck simply don't have the flexibility to protect themselves from changes in economic conditions.  For example, with the past five years of very low inflation and the weak economy in general, the wealthy have seen greater and greater profits.

I don't fully disagree that inflation benefits the wealthy, but basically, everything benefits the wealthy, whether it's inflation/deflation high-growth/low-growth or any other major change.","1385856967"

Alternatively, Zerg has less efficient armies and is forced to take more bases as a crutch (having to take more bases is a liability, as it leaves you with less army supply and makes you easier to harass).

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","There's all this talk about champion power and high level play but I see it differently. 

If you aren't playing competitively: the point of learning a high skill champion is the because you find that champion **fun**. It's a game. It's rewarding to learn high skill/ high option champions and that is fun to many people. On the other hand, some people have more fun when there is less skill involved and just want easy powerful effects and the low skill champions are there to appeal to them. It's the same as having difficulty levels in single player games: ask yourself, why play games on very hard when you can finish them on very easy?
From the article you posted:
&gt;""If winning is all you care about, don’t expect to keep up with the high skill caps. Learning how to enjoy the game beyond winning, however, is a skill that will unlock the true beauty of this game and have a direct influence on your performance.""

High skill champions will continue to be enjoyed by those who find them fun to play.

Furthermore win rates aren't a good measure for character balance. Of course there is a correlation between win-rate and champion power, but it isn't and shouldn't be the reason to buff or nerf champions. There's a lot of different factors that go into the decision process to balance champions that are considered including: professional play, gameplay (fun/ anti-fun and counterplay), low level play etc. It's too much for a single percentage win-rate to display. So when people complain about win rates, it's not really relevant. Statistical ""fact"" is only a very minor side effect in a much bigger picture.","1385856969"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Thom eased comfortably in his chair. He got the rest he lacked for the past few weeks. He had been spared from lootings, murderings, and outright madness. Why had he been spared and his family not? He couldn't bare to come to terms with the fact that he was alive amongst his relatives. Survivors guilt for sure. With all that hype with a moon-sized asteroid on a trajectory course towards Earth, that was all anyone could think about. Everyone went absolutely nuts and displayed chaos that no one believed to be remotely possible. It was so much so that the military was called in to suppress the revolution. That wasn't enough. The remaining few that still retained an acceptable level of sanity bounded together. Now, they were on a ship to steer away from an unsettling death from a rock.

The silence of the air-tight cabin was broken by the PA system, ""Attention passengers. The ship is beginning take off sequence. We will be off the ground in approximately T-minus 2 minutes. Find your seats and fasten your harnesses. ""

Thom sighed. He was about to leave his home. He took for granted for where he lived. And now it was reflecting to him. He had only graduated just 6 weeks ago. Oddly enough, the news of the asteroid had broken to the public at that time. He never knew the world would descend into a merciless wasteland in such short amount of time. But he had to accept that. And so did everyone else.

The ship's thrusters violently vibrated the ship. Shortly after that, the inertia hinted that he was ascending. He had ridden roller coasters numerous times during his childhood, but he still had the uneasiness that came with moving at absurdly fast speeds. He was scared, but he had no problem hiding that.

Moments later, the strain of gravity exited the room. Everything was free-floating now. They had successfully exited Earth's atmosphere. Everyone cheered shortly after which was interrupted again by the PA speaker, ""Everyone please remain in your harnesses. We are now entering SlipSpace.""

Everyone seemed puzzled. The thought had just entered everyone's minds: *Where the hell are we going?*

I'm not going to try and argue with you because I can see you aren't going to change your mind, but really, all of the unbiased peer reviewed studies say that although having some deficits to health, the benefits far outweigh them (also economically and socially beneficial).

The only reason pot was made illegal to begin with was for 2 reasons: To keep profits flowing into the cotton industry as hemp is far cheaper to grow with higher yields, and to create more of a class and race divide between the working class blacks and the business class whites. (you make something they do regularly illegal and then you can parade around saying how they are all criminal scum)

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I've heard this argument before that religion isn't relevant in our modern age, implying that we've changed and evolved from a thousand years ago.  I couldn't disagree more.  I find it quite interesting that the Quran's views on human nature, although written 1400 years ago, still hold true today.

Despite our advances as a species, we still kill and rape each other.  We  destroy the world we live in, we hate each other for differences in skin colour.  We still hoard our wealth and food while watching people die and starve.  I could go on and on.  It's plain arrogance to suggest that our era is so enlightened while our ancestors were backward. 

That being said, you say that ""objectively it seems to be the most restrictive and intolerant"".  That is your opinion and it's very subjective, I might add.  Forbidding alcohol and pre-marital sex may seem restrictive to you but it's actually liberating to many people.  Living in Native communities in Canada and working in the addictions field, I cannot stress how destructive alcohol is and how much benefit it would bring if prohibition were brought to these communities. 

In terms of misogyny. I think that has a lot to do with cultural beliefs rather than Islam itself.  If anything, when Islam was introduced in the middle east it was considered quite progressive from a women's rights perspective.  Furthermore, most of the converts of Islam are actually women, not men. I'm sure you've read the headlines about Saudi and have made your conclusions.  But if you bothered to do your research about Islam, there is nothing that really forbids women from driving.  

Here's a little advice: Before you go on a self-righteous rant about how smart you are and how stupid Muslims are for following a religion that has endured for close 1400 hundred years, maybe, just maybe you should educate yourself more about the religion instead of watching fox news or reading about it on the internet.  Your comments clearly show a lack of research, understanding and just plain ignorance. 

Also, your username is mildly racist.  I hope when you refer to yourself as happywop, it doesn't mean what I think it does. ","1385856976"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Also a small point to consider...  In these scenarios, they are really far behind.  They have died enough that they are worth no gold anymore.  So the jungler comes up there, plays from behind with you and (ignoring the scenario of now feeding a double kill to the fed opponent), you out play everyone and get your best case scenario: you kill the lane opponent.

Your lane opponent, still a few kills up on you and still more farmed than you, comes back to lane and crushes you the moment you jungler leaves.  And look at that?  You are now worth full gold again.  Your gank was the greatest gift wrapped present that lane opponent could have had.

The response to this tends to be ""Then the jungler should set up camp and get me out of this situation"".  Meanwhile, their jungler is then attacking objectives and other lanes while your jungler is camping your lane (and falling behind himself now) so that you can both be behind together to fight the might of the enemy top laner.  Its a snowball situation that you try to avoid, but if it isn't avoided, you mitigate the damage by making plays in exchange for it.","1385856983"

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","Hello, /u/HalfMob, it looks like you might be skirting on the line with submitting your videos, so consider this a friendly warning/guideline:

Reddit has [guidelines as to what constitutes spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).  To quote the page:

* It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.

* If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer. 

 *If your contribution to Reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to people's questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer.

* If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.

* If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. But we're serious about the ""not people you asked to go vote for you"" part.

* If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens.

For right now, this is just a friendly message, but here in /r/Minecraft, we take action against anyone that fits the above definition.

If you feel this was in error, feel free to [message the moderators](/message/compose/?to=/r/Minecraft&amp;subject=Video%20Spam&amp;message=http://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1rsz7b/).","1385856983"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I don't know the first thing about PBS but the BBC basically run a black hand extortion racket on every last UK household. So since most people still watch TV and have no reason not to pay up, that nets the BBC a few quid.

This next paragraph is slightly irrelevant to your question. If however, you decide not to be a customer of live TV broadcasts, you have to deal with ceaseless letters informing you of investigations against you, and threats of fines and court dates. Even if you let their enforcement officers into your home to prove that no TV watching is going on, they will resume harassing you after a while because they just don't trust you to still not be watching TV.

Why they can't just charge a subscription fee like a satellite or cable TV company is beyond me, but yeah, they're very serious about getting their money.","1385856983"

My first real intro to the non A-list DCU was Showcase Presents the Brave and the Bold Batman Team-Ups Volume 1. Through that, I discovered characters such as Metamorpho, the Metal Men, the Creeper, the Spectre, and my all-time favorite character, Deadman.  
  
If you see a character that interests you, feel free to try and learn about them. Batman served as the gateway for me towards all these other characters, and they in turn have turned me on to others. Wanting to learn about Spectre got me interested in Shadowpact. Shadowpact got me to read more stuff with Etrigan in it. Reading Demon Knights for Etrigan made me care about Vandal Savage more. If you just wanna check out Batman or Superman, that's fine, but keep yourself open to what else is there.","1385856983"

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","+3 to gems more than makes up for cast speed and a 20% increased modifier.  Adding to the base damage of the spell nets gains from all of your multipliers and cast speed.  Frozen enemies take 20% increased damage is the equivalent of an additional 0.2 on your additive multiplier.  Most players have well over 100% increased damage between their gear and passives, and probably closer to 200 or higher.  200% increased damage is like having a 3.0 multiplier for your damage...so running with that as an example

Damage * 3 vs Damage *3.2

Or you take 20% increase to base damage

(Damage * 1.2) * 3

The latter nets you an effective 'increased damage' of 30%.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","... Ok look.  If the daughter wrote the mother in the will as a residuary beneficiary, or if the daughter died intestate and your state's laws give the mother some percentage of the daughter's estate given her familiar circumstances, and the husband somehow managed to get all of the settlement from the malpractice suit, then I fail to see how the mother is an asshole for suing the husband for taking his late wife's money and essentially stealing it away from the late wife's wishes and/or state's presumed wishes.  The money is property of the late wife's estate and as such should have been included in the estate.  It is not the husband's except to the extent he had a loss of consortium claim.  I don''t know the specifics but you really have not given enough for us to condemn your aunt.

Unless you meant life-insurance disbursement (not a settlement) in which case it really depends on who were the named beneficiaries on the insurance contract.

You call it suing your daughter's grieving husband.  I can paint it another picture: suing to enforce her daughter's wishes who is unfortunately deceased.  The greedy husband should not be allowed to take everything against his wife's dying wishes.  Which it is depends upon facts which you have not given us.","1385856985"

Most days I avoid things that remind me of her necause I still feel myself sinking when I try to imagine a future without her. 

The heart breaking moment was standing to give a speech at her funeral (21 at the time) and being okay even smiling as I talked and then noticing the amount of young adults there who were crying there eyes out. My mother spent the better part of her life dedicated to helping those in need and even though she was sick she never turned a soul away from her doorstep.

Then you need the electronics to drive all that (4 heater connections, thermistor connections, and stepper drivers).  With the water cooling, you'd also need a reservoir and a radiator of some sort (although it wouldn't have to be very big, a bigger reservoir might be enough).   That said, it still looks cool as hell, but it would be a nightmare to setup.","1385856990"

"diyaudio","t5_2tizz","Ok, let me break things down, but only in the analog world.  

Most speakers contain passive crossovers that need to handle the full power sent through the speakers, or *speaker-level crossovers*.  These are always passive, since the power is coming from the amp.  There also exist powered bi-amplified speakers, but these take line-level in and just contain the amplifiers and (line-level) crossovers within the speaker boxes.  

If you do essentially the same thing as most speakers do, but put the crossovers before the amplifier, you end up with a *passive line-level crossover*.  The advantage of this is that the components get smaller and cheaper.  Generally, you can also get away without needing any inductors, just resistors and capacitors.  The disadvantage is that there is a limit to how many stages you can chain.  [Here is an example](http://www.parts-express.com/brand/harrison-labs/265) of a place to buy passive line-level crossovers.  

If you also add buffers and/or active filters to a line-level crossover, only then do you get *active line-level crossovers*.  There are improvements that can be made to analog line-level crossovers that improve the roll-off characteristics of the filters, or even just simplify the design.  You can theoretically chain an infinite number of active stages, since the filters can have gain, unlike passive ones.  Note that both passive and active components are used in these devices.  

And then there's the digital world, where the signal is digitized, filtered and converted back to analog.  I won't get into that.  ","1385856990"

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","It depends on the person and situation, obviously, but I've always viewed it more as an acknowledgement of you being the 'anchor' or the alpha. The friend who he knows and is comfortable being with. The person he hangs onto as security. This increases your social value in the eyes of others. 

Now, if he is trying to dominate you or show dominance to others, don't let it phase you. An alpha wouldn't let it mess with them, it's just their awesomeness and control personified that somebody would want to hang on to them in a social situation where the hanger-on is obviously uncomfortable or wanting to assert dominance. 



Solution-Wise, if it's bothering you, here's some detail. I would just let his arm sit there until whoever is speaking finishes (be it you or someone else), and do one of two things:
-------------------------------------------------

**1** (If you're on his left side)

* Rotate your body so his arm that's on you is forced to either drift off or be held in an awkward position. Essentially rotate inwards, towards his body. Extend your hand slightly and force him into a handshake as you're rotating, towards the beginning of your movement. As you shake hands, extend your left hand, palm up, pointing open-handed first towards the group as you say something like ""Hey guys, I want you to meet a friend of mine"" and then gesture towards him as you say his name. Problem solved, you've demonstrated you're in charge.

**2** (If you're on his right side)

* Simply rotate towards him (~90 degrees, again), extend your hand for a handshake (which requires him to move his hand off of you), and when he shakes hands turn towards the group and introduce him. Again, problem solved. You've forced him to change his position for you, you've introduced him, and you've proved you're man enough to have friends.

Best of luck!

Edit: If it's a total stranger, don't introduce him. He shouldn't be touching you. Do something wild and stupid to embarrass him and show you're a fun guy. Kiss him, hold his hand, stroke his face, something out of the ordinary that is awkward for him. It's all about demonstrating the fact that you don't care and are having fun.

Use: `\Aquatakat\abcode('some text');` or `\Aquatakat\abcode_line('some text');` to process the string without paragraphs.

It does markdownish text blocks with a stricter syntax. Begin each line with ""&gt; "" to do a blockquote, ""/ "" will do a pre, ""* "" does an unordered list, ""# "" does an ordered list.

Standard bbcode syntax is supported. The default is to use HTML style tag delimeters like &lt;link=http://zombo.com&gt;The internet is important.&lt;/link&gt; but you can change the `OD` and `CD` to [ and ] or whatever you want. Quotation marks in the attribute are allowed and optional (&lt;img=""http://www.skadate.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/elephpant-elephant-php-logo.png""&gt;).

There is a dumb array in there where you can define elements.
 
    $elments = array(array() [, array() ...]);

Those inside arrays should have the following values:

* name: tag name
* open: actual output open tag (use %attr if your thing has an attribute)
* close: actual output close tag
* attr: set to true if the tag has an attribute
* match: matches the attribute with preg_match
* stand: set to true if the element is self closing like an image

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well right now it's a little weird because my son who is special needs just graduated high school last spring as did my daughter. She got a scholarship to a college about an hour away, and she's going to study engineering. It didn't pay enough for her to live there though so she lives with us. She also didn't pass her last driver's test. So I get up at 6AM wake everyone up, my youngest is a senior in high school so she rides the bus. I make everyone's lunches including my husband's, then we all leave. My daughter, son, and I all head out to her campus which is an hour away. I drop her off and head home sometimes stopping at the store. I come home start laundry or anything else that needs to be done, then I start the animal chores. We have late chicks this year that are in a mobile run their water has to be dumped and filled and their feeders. Also we have 4 other feeders and 5 waterers that have to be dumped and filled several are heated some but some aren't so this time of year there's ice to break and dump. My son and I haul 5 gallon buckets from spigots on the back of the house since water hoses freeze this time of year. We fill and clean everything. Then we let the goats out, and we fill their waterers and put in hay. By the time that's all done it's almost time to get back in the car and go back to the college. That's another 2 hrs and I come home and hopefully whatever I put in the oven before I left isn't burned. My husband gathers the eggs at dusk and throws some scratch for the chickens. After that it's just dinner, dishes, homework, and normal household stuff. I usually fall into bed around midnight.

Of course this changes with the seasons in spring we usually have new kids and chicks and there's gardening, mowing and tree trimming all spring and summer and harvest in the fall. This fall I canned peaches, tomatoes, pickles, relish and froze broccoli, blueberries, strawberries, peppers and other veggies. Oh and my husband got a deer so we processed that. He also built a deer stand this year that looks like a massive treehouse, and we are still working on it when the weather is good. Also we put in a wood furnace that heats our home from the garage so there is wood to haul, cut, and split. There's always something to keep busy but admittedly I love to come on here and read so I probably waste too much time. I know I have quilts that need to be finished and projects that I started a month ago that aren't done but all my links are purple ;)

"technology","t5_2qh16","You should read Apples actual complaint. The judgement said that Apple had to pay 'reasonable and customary' fees for the Ebook monitor. These fees are in no way customary, so it's likely that there's no legal basis for Apple having to pay them. 

The court can only enforce the judgement that it issued. In this case, the judge went back and amended the original orders. This is questionable because Apple had already begun the appeal process, so generally a higher court would have jurisdiction at this point. 

There's also a few constitutional issues with what Bromwell is doing because:

1) he's materially financially motivated by the prosecution of Apple (violates due clause)

2) He's potentially investigating more than ebook compliance by interviewing Jony Ive (separation of powers violation)

3) The amended order allows him to talk to the judge 'ex parte' (meaning without Apple) and interview Apple employees 'ex parte'. This is a limitation of Apples right to counsel, and wasn't part of the original order.

4) The big one that Apple is using to try and get rid of Cote; she has empowered Bromwell to disclose information about Apple to her that could be privileged. She's overseeing several other Apple cases that can be prejudiced by the disclosure of these documents.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","I have a story.

So I was wandering throught the kitchenware aisle on a late-night trip to a 24-hour Tesco. And isn't that how all the best stories start? My mobile rang. I answered, to speak to a good friend who had been known to dabble in some bass guitarism - he sounded a little flustered this time. He tells me a story: he had been out at some bar the night before, gone outside for a cigarette and been approached by a lady asking for a light. He obliged, and the lady then asked (seemingly at random) if he was a drummer. Since she was a reasonably attractive lady, he said that yes, yes he was. She was a singer type looking to rebuild a band. The next day she calls him to arrange an audition and that's when he realises that he isn't a drummer at all, hence the call to me (I am an actual drummer). He wanted me to drive over ASAP to commence drum lessons so that he could give it his best shot. It's a two hour drive, but I didn't have anything better to do in the next few days.

To skip to the end, it was eventually agreed that it might be better to admit to his non drummer status. He came out as a bassist, and we both joined the band (despite the commute, for me) and a lovely time was had by all (until some regrettable things happened and the band failed spectacularly while 'touring' in France shortly after having replaced me (for 'image and commitment' reasons)). I won't name the singer because she's not very nice.

Almost all musical engagements since (whether it be actually joining a band or depping for tours or whatever) have been made through local ads, online contact (joinmyband, Gumtree) or word of mouth (Bob says you're a drummer and that). But that's not as interesting as the above tale, now is it.","1385857009"

"leafs","t5_2r8hf","It's absolutely a coaching style problem.

This team is based on skill and speed, and scores almost exclusively on the rush. When questioned what he thinks of this Maple Leafs squad being a rush team, Carlyle outright said he did not think they were one, and outright states
&gt; ""That's what people perceive us as,"" he said. ""[But] is that what we are? We don't want to be that.""

This team is absolutely awful at the style he wants them to play as. 

Furthermore, he has his forwards collapsing down low to ""help"" the defenders/goaltenders get the puck rather than covering their man/the points. The idea behind it is that this will help them get the puck, and if they don't get the puck the shots are going to be coming from the point and with the forwards down low, it's clear lanes of sight for the goalie to make an easy save.

The problem with this though, is as already mentioned: the Leafs are horrible along the boards. This leads to the ridiculous amount of shots against, as the Leafs are not gaining possession. And then they get tired down by the opposition and get hemmed into their own zone. So what next, when they do get possession? Chip it off the glass and scramble for a change. Because the forwards are too far down low to be good outlets for the defesemen. Or worse yet, we get penalized. 

The compound this problem, he's trying to limit the defesemen from carrying the puck and leading a counter-attack. The most notable person this has hindered is Jake Gardiner. Other notables include Phaneuf and Franson. How many times have we seen them try and carry the puck into the opposition zone now compared to last year? More often than not, it's straight up ""pass to the forwards who will dump and chase"".

The personnel decisions Carlyle makes are based on the style he wants this team to play. He's playing Fraser over Rielly or Liles because Fraser embodies what he wants from his dmen more than the other two. He played Grabovski on the third line because he liked Bozak and Kadri on the 1st and 2nd more, and rather than more evenly splitting time on ice, he stuck an offensive player into a strictly defensive role. He plays two fighters rather than good grinders because it's more his style.

Carlyle is a ""players' coach"". If he likes you, because you play the style he's so committed to (top-six/bottom-six, grinding dump-and-chase cycle game), you're in. Otherwise, you're not. It's horrendous, and has been a significant problem ever since he was brought in.

I'm firmly of the belief that the Leafs have been winning in-spite of Carlyle, not because of him. ","1385857012"

We'd been off and on since high school. She lived far away and we would talk on the phone making plans to be together in my state. When she arrived, suddenly and ""only for a visit"" to decide whether she'd stay, she arrived with everything she owned in three duffel bags and some purses. She dumped all her bags on my floor and said she was going out for a bit. She never came back.

I left a note on my door with payphone money for days but she never came. After about 5 days I learned she was with a boyfriend I didn't know about. After 8 days, I went through all her things and found her journal. I read it. She'd been in an institution for a while and had been making similar plans with some other guy in my town. I wasn't mentioned in the journal once except to say that someone else was ""under [her]thumb just like [spermface].""

So I put all her bags in the alley behind my apartment and posted on Craigslist to come and get it. It was all gone by morning. She heard about it elsewhere and came around, and I blamed this other guy who had access to my place and didn't like her. We forgave and continued on as friends, until I was supposed to be in her wedding and she cheated on her fiance with my partner.

If the opponent has a more superior setup, we avoid them at first by clearing our whole jungle and then returning to lane when it is already pushed to the tower. This way we can guarantee safe farming and they won't be able to counter-jungle as well after pushing the lane hard.

But the basics are as followed:

If you have a better lane, frequent the lane more often and force trades.

If not, try to farm it out safely by jungling more often and wait for an opportunity to strike, like your bot reaching level 6 and instantly coming for a gank, or catching them offguard clearing one of their or your camps.","1385857013"

"Stretched","t5_2tm3i","A lot of advice given on this subreddit and other body modification communities comes straight from the artists. I value their advice for how to stretch or modify in a healthy manner over anecdotal evidence in every case, and as such I see no problem with anything they post. In a similar vein, many people are much more experienced with modifying than I am, and I respect their opinions and advice over my own as well. I think it's good for people to know that using acrylic tapers is non-ideal and that stretching too fast isn't great.  
Now. I agree that it's wrong to gang up on users or bully them for being inexperienced or ""not in the know"" (especially on ""gauges"" which I don't really see a problem with), but the downvote button exists for a reason. It's not a sign of bullying or a big ""I DISAGREE"" button. It exists to move comments that don't contribute or are inaccurate or unhelpful down the page so people read more helpful comments first. If you're giving out anecdotal evidence, or trying to defend practices widely regarded as non-ideal (especially in a ""I'm new to stretching, what do?"" thread), then you should expect downvotes and not be offended. Try to start discussion instead of being offended. I'd love to hear the benefits of nontraditional practices, personal stories, or new techniques.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","From the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index#wiki_orgasm_troubles)

&gt;For those of you with a penis, the biggest culprit for not being able to orgasm with a partner is using a death grip when you masturbate or masturbating at a really fast/vigorous speed. If that’s your issue, the easiest fix is to buy a fleshlight and only let yourself masturbate with that. Or else you’re stuck with trying to avoid masturbation and making sure that when you do masturbate, you NEVER tighten up or speed up, especially at the end in order to let you cum. It can take a few weeks to a few months to get over a death grip. Medication can also mess with your ability to orgasm, so double check that any meds you’re on doesn’t have the side effect of affecting sexual function. Fixation on orgasm (ie. stressing out or worrying about whether or not you’ll cum too fast or cum at all with a partner) is also pretty much a guarantee that it won’t happen. It’s also important to note that many men can’t orgasm from handjobs or blowjobs, no matter how good they feel. Not everyone can cum from every single type of sexual stimulation.","1385857015"

Det er ikke mange som kan finansiere et liv på f.eks heroin på lovlig vis, og må finansiere dette på en eller annen måte, ofte med vinningskriminalitet. 
For meg går det en linje mellom narkotiske stoffer som f.eks cannabis, som jeg mener bør være lovlig, men solgt i utsalg som ala vinmonopolet, og tyngre narkotiske stoffer. En person kan røyke cannabis ofte og kombinere dette med jobb til å finansiere forbruket. Er man avhengig av heroin blir dette litt verre. ","1385857015"

"PHP","t5_2qh38","My experience and opinion is the same as most people here, I would think. Use MySQL to get as much as possible, its aggregate functions are great for returning a nice happy result with all the math done for you.

I've worked on some massive reporting systems that used a lot of post-processing to get results, and using mysql to get the records invariably was faster and made more manageable code. That said, speed shouldn't necessarily be a big factor. *Hundreds* of results should be more-or-less instant, and even thousands shouldn't be an issue.

&gt; if I store a field as datetime, would it be faster if I store the day,month,year,week_of_year, and quarter as 5 separate integer columns (if I went the mysql route) for my groupby clause, or is casting the datetime just as fast?

Store the time as the time. Datetime casting is very fast, and is the proper solution to the problem. If you don't know much about it, an important term is ""normalization"". There are a bunch of ""rules"" to normalisation of a database, but essentially it comes down to ways to make the data consistent and reliable. One of the ways thats done is by not making anything redundant. Storing the five separate columns breaks normalisation because it will cause redundancies. Ie, if a date is in the third week it must be in the first month, and also in the first quarter, etc. Also you risk errors - what if you screw up one of those numbers? Better to just store the date and calculate from it later.

You can happily *group by* cast dates. I've even grouped by substrings of dates in the past. 

    GROUP BY LEFT(o.order_time, 7)

That sort of thing. It's rough, but it works. There are better ways, I know, but it's what I used at the time.

There are good functions for MONTH(), QUARTER(), WEEKYEAR(), etc. They'll do exactly what they look like and will really help.","1385857019"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I understand that you should be considerate, and I would never queue up if I thought there was a high chance of me having to leave, but I just can relate to people with terrible internet, who want to play ranked. I used to play Halo 2 online with a really shitty internet connection, and I used to get shit for it every now and then, but there's really no alternative.

LoL is more frustrating of course, because every lost fight makes the subsequent fights harder to win, so letting someone freefarm a lane/jungle causes everyone to suffer, but I just can't get too mad at someone who plays ranked on a shitty connection. If they decided the risk of internet problems is low enough for them to queue, and then they dc, then I trust that it's not something that happens every game, and we were just unfortunate.

This subreddit has a tendency to treat ranked games like an exam or something, where you should be totally focused on winning and nothing else, but although it is indeed a team game, EVERY SINGLE PLAYER has a higher chance of being on the other team than your team. Cognitive bias leads people to believe that they always lose because of afk/troll/feeders, but they also win because of those players and just don't let it shake their delusion that they deserve to win their games. Whatever attitude someone has to a ranked game (playing a champ for the first time in ranked, for example) they have faced just as any of those 'casual' as they have been allied with (well, 5/9ths of the time they're on the other team) so just frickin' deal with it, don't hold other people to your own standards of what ranked solo queue 'should' be.

I'm getting way off topic...

tl;dr if you're in a ranked game with me, I don't expect you to have made sure nothing can prevent you from giving your all for our team. It's a computer game, if you decide you need to go answer the door/answer your phone/whatever, I don't mind because whatever happens can happen in my favor just as often (or slightly more often, if I consider myself out of the equation) and I trust that you're not just being an asshole on purpose","1385857021"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","There's a flip-side to this.

When I was younger (between 7 and 12 years old) me and my younger sibling had to go to the grocery store with our mom when she went as she was a single parent.

Believe it or not, we were both well-behaved enough to go amuse ourselves in the toy aisles.  We both knew not to talk to strangers and all that shit too, but we really minded ourselves and -- most importantly -- our parent trusted us.  If something fell on the floor, pick it up and put it back (to this day if I see something in the wrong spot, I *have* to find it's home).  Don't leave the two or three toy aisles unless you're coming to the front of the store by the check-outs.

It's a shame when people can't just accept responsibility for their actions.  Me and the sibling knew that if we screwed around, we'd have one hell of an uncomfortable ride home.  We also knew that if we broke something, it would affect our mom's checkbook balance as well.","1385857023"

She was on my mind every day and I would sometimes catch myself smiling just thinking of her. She was the most beautiful girl I ever laid my eyes on. It wasn't lust. I fell in love with her. And she fell in love with me. We shared the same characteristics, same ideas and goals, same taste in music, everything. It all seemed right and I loved that. She was the best friend I fell in love with. Someone I could talk to and confide to, and I'd always be there for her as well. Picking her up if she's stranded, rain or shine. I'd wake up in the middle of the night to her calling me to just talk, but I didn't mind because I enjoyed hearing her voice. To this day I still think of her. I always have and I'll probably never stop thinking of her. Only to have it all fall through my hands because she got drunk with a random and slept with him. I was broken, I felt broken. I could literally feel my body tighten as I laid in the hallway completely numb. I hated that feeling. To build something with someone that took a part of your life, you feel... Incomplete, like a huge piece is missing and there is nothing to fill that void. Friends, family, objects, nothing could fill it. I still think of her and wondered if she thinks of me. ","1385857024"

My crime? I had cut the wrong stack of papers, and not finished all the tasks she gave me. She had listed everything really quickly, not given me enough time to write it down, and then left for the rest of the period (I was a lab manager). I raced to finish it all, but it would have taken about 3 times as long to do it all, and I couldn't explain why I hadn't finished or what I'd done because she was nowhere to be found when I had to leave for my next class. I left everything neatly, and explained it to my AP Chem teacher (head of lab management) who said it wasn't a problem and she'd inform my teacher.

Let's not extrapolate conclusions that aren't supported by the evidence.  I think it's more likely that people were voting against Cuccinelli rather than for McAuliffe. That's not really the kind stance that's shows more support for scientific literacy so much as a rejection of corruption.

I'm also recording data (non-personal data only, eg browser window size, fps rate, how long it takes to complete missions), so even just playing it is helpful for balancing purposes.

The feedback I've gotten so far is (1) you should be able to move with the keyboard and (2) there's too much unskippable text. I agree with these, but I wanted your opinions of the original before I change it.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Yes, homosexuality is a sin, but it's no different than any other sins. It doesn't at all define who you are, it's just one aspect of your life that you should address and come to God and ask for help with. Being bi doesn't make you unforgivable. If you ask God to forgive you, He will! And I've been single most of my life as well. I'm single right now in fact, and I hate it too. But the fact is, it may not be a bad thing. The Bible says that God gives to some the gift of marriage, and others the gift of singleness. You hear that? Most people don't think of it this way, but singleness can actually be a *gift!* From my own experiences, when I'm in a relationship I'm enjoying it, but I quickly become very depressed. Even though I'm extremely happy in the relationship, I get more depressed than ever because I realize that I don't let God make as strong an impression in my life than before. Some people can juggle their faith and relationships at the same time, but I don't think I'm one of those people. When I'm in a relationship I tend to inadvertently put God on the backburner. And when the relationship falls apart, I come back to God and the depression goes away. Because of this, I'm almost convinced that I'm just one of those people that God has given the gift of singleness to. And it sucks at the moment, but maybe it's all for the best. Don't get yourself down. God has a plan for your life, and even though it doesn't fit our own plans, it doesn't mean it's not what's best for us. If I stayed in those relationships, maybe I would have let my relationship with God fade away so far that I wouldn't even be a Christian anymore. Even though I hate being single, it's probably best that I am. Just confess to God that you're not perfect, and you're struggling with some stuff, and you'd like His help. And then just put it all in His hands :)","1385857034"

Hundreds stacked on hundreds, stiff and clean as if they had just came out of the bank. His name was Ron Thomas, according to his ID. A background check had already been done and I knew already who he was, the CEO of Works Electric, a man with two dependents and a wife who was on her way. Inside the he dug out a piece of paper and threw the wallet to the side. ""I need you to throw this away"", he asked.

""What is it?"" I asked. 

He opened the letter and read the first few lines. ""Now I understand. I know why I'm here now.""

""You know? What happened? We still don't understand how you got that scar on your head."" What ever this letter had could explain why we found him dragging himself into the emergency room.

""This letter, you have to make sure no one reads this. I don't remember why I did what I had done, and I probably never will.""

""What did you do Mr. Thomas? We need to know.""

""This is my suicide note. This was for my family.""

""You know son. I don't know why I did it. But I'm glad I never will.""

His wife burst into the room in tears, fiercely hugging Mr. Thomas. He coldy stared me down. I knew what I had to do. I walked out of the room. Once outside I passed the trashcan. I handed the letter to the head nurse.   ","1385857035"

And I find this schedule a bit unrealistic. Most closed-beta tests last for months even for a whole year, and I really don't think Gaijin will test the groud units for only some weeks.

BC is awesome, beautiful snow, good nightlife in general, good terrain, and really nice people. If you are looking for a well rounded fun experience I would go there. If you want the best skiing absolutely possible come to Utah. Excellent snow quality and terrain. Depending on what you want you will go to different resorts. Research or pm me if you want. Also you can stay in SLC and take the ski bus up and save alot of money. However, nightlife is not all that great and you have to be 21+ for a drink.","1385857037"

I wanted to tell you that I taught swim lessons to young children for many, many years and the most important thing is to have an enthusiastic, supportive, and trusting parent. When your child is learning, her head WILL go underwater, she WILL inhale some water, she (probably) will freak out more than once. She will need to see that mom and dad think it's totally normal and fine and impressive even - or else she could develop a phobia based on any nerves you have about the situation, making it harder for her to learn. Pools can be very safe if they are maintained properly and swimming doesn't necessarily need to be taught by an instructor. Kids can learn young and as your daughter learns, it will be just another step in you protecting her :)","1385857040"

When I googled him soon after and found out he died that night,  something in me changed. I don't smile the same anymore. I cant even fake the smile that I see in old photographs.  I cried so hard for so long that I burst blood vessels all over my face and eyes. I passes out from crying. I vomited in my lap from crying.

&gt; How about all the accounts that were made at the same time that hers was? 

Well she tweeted about it so i would guess a lot of people that followed her made an account so they could ask her questions. Not everyone uses reddit you know...


&gt; You think these people just decided to create an account 7 days ago in anticipation? 

Apparently her AMA was originally scheduled last Saturday but was [changed](https://twitter.com/ChloeBennet4/status/404325623704719360) due to the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special, The Day of the Doctor


&gt;Cool, you found results for 6 of them. I mentioned 25 and I'd be willing to bet there are more, I simply got bored with looking for them.

Go check out the comment again, I googled the rest and posted my results. 


&gt;This post is swarming with accounts made specifically for this AMA and you have done nothing to disprove that.

Yeah, these AMAs usually do. If a celebrity like Chloe Bennet (has 50,000 followers) tweets shes doing an AMA on Reddit, fans who follow will set up accounts if they don't have one already. Then they will ask her questions because they're fans, sometimes they are very serious fans and may ask softball questions because that's what superfans do. ","1385857044"

We were leaving my aunts J house after a visit and we had played with these small Lego sets my aunt P brought with her for us to play with. We left the Lego set's in my aunt J's room, where we had played with them.(we were more interested in the pool than Legos) So when we go to leave My crazy aunt P follows us out to the van and opens the back hatch and starts going through our stuff till she see's my older sister's(11) purse. She takes it from her and dumps it out screaming that we weren't leaving until the thieves returned her stuff. My older sister is crying now, I get out of the van as my mom goes around the other side. My mom is asking her calmly what happened and whats going on, aunt P sees me and points at me and says ""THE THIEF HAS MY STUFF"", my mom was about to say something but I just blew up ""LEAVE MY DAUGHTER'S PURSE ALONE, THAT'S NOT YOURS AND WE DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID TOYS ANYWAY!""

"AnimeFigures","t5_2swee","&gt; I managed to get it down to 2 stores, but still not sure, maybe I should just not order the set of two smaller figures to drop the price but it'll still be 2 stores, 1 store with 2 figures and the other with just 1 figure. ..decisions decisions

This all comes down to whether or not you can justify buying something. Essentially: How much do I want this figurine? Is it worth the amount that they ask for it? Will my wallet hate me?

&gt; I've always gone with SAL when I order off AmiAmi, guess I'll stick to SAL then :)

SAL is a good, economical option for the patient ones. Sometimes EMS would be a better choice, as it might only be a couple hundred yen over SAL. Not to mention that EMS is also fully insured up to 20,000 yen, which is always nice.

&gt; That kind of damange doesn't bother me, no more worries about the damaged boxes then thanks

Stores like AmiAmi and Mandarake treat ""box damaged"" as ""minor dent"" or ""unnoticable scratch on the plastic"" most of the time; ranging from that description to the picture /u/pitman posted.

&gt; And same I've only ever had to pay customs once when ordering figures but that was because it was a big Gunpla xD

Here in Sweden they catch your order if it comes outside of the EU and is above a certain threshold in terms of value. I can't lay down the law when it comes to the UK but I can paint you a picture with an example:

Let's say that I order a figurine which would cost me £85, shipping included. Would this be shipped with SAL, the Swedish customs would catch it and have me pay 25% tax or more when I am to pick it up at my local office. Should I instead have it sent through EMS without giving Mandarake a note of how much I want it to be insured for, it *might* sneak through customs without getting the additional tax. This has so far been the case in 1/5 purchases - granted I don't usually select EMS either, because of financial reasons.

For some final words I want to encourage you to think before buying something, if possible. Don't put yourself in the red just because you found something which you think look nice. Try and search within and see if you have some form of connection with the figurine before you place an order. I hope this helped you in some way and I wish toy all the best in your search for figurines!","1385857048"

If your tires are like my co-workers (he has an Allez too) then they are rated for 120psi. I think you are safe at 10 over that, and possibly 20 if you are feeling confident. If you continually get flats at the higher pressure, you should consider moving up to a 28mm tire (assuming it will fit on the frame).

There is always an alternative and there is no single ""correct"" path through life. You will forge your own path.  So if you have to dropout of college to take some time to yourself, fine, you can always come back and finish up your year.

About not being able to seek help, I'm not sure about with teachers but definitely with therapists there is a level of confidentiality because of HIPA. You need to be one of two things for them to break confidentiality, a danger to yourself(suicide, etc.), or a danger to others.

In my opinion, Dany made some of the best choices she could've made in a nearly impossible situation.

**VAGUELY SPOILER-Y STUFF**

Ultimately why I still like Dany is because she sacrificed her personal desires for others. Even if she did make poor choices in one sense, she gave up a few pretty hugely important things to her *solely* because she believed that it would help others. And I really, really love that in a person. Of course, self-sacrifice is rarely rewarded in this world.

I do think she's headed in a darker direction though. Ironically, I think that may make people like her more.","1385857055"

I'm not terribly good at extreme challenges myself.  I'm not even totally sure how one would get through that first war.  My instinct is that you'd want to engineer it such that you surrender before total occupation and end up a vassal of either the Ivarings or Hvitserks.  As a vassal, you may even want to try to adopt the Norse faith so that you're less likely to get your titles revoked.

If by some miracle you could survive the war and remain independent in some form, the first move should be swearing fealty to the Byzantines or the strongest Karling.  Hopefully that dissuades the Vikings from using their doomstacks on you, and instead use them on Wessex.  From there, you could maybe expand via holy wars when the various Norsemen are having succession crises.

But I'm not very good at those sorts of challenges, so there's probably a better way.  I think it would be fiendishly hard in any case.","1385857057"

Make the minimum wage $10 per hour and unless you can produce more than $10 worth of whatever you do in an hour, you cannot work.

The fact that there are people who earn precisely the minimum wage is proof that the minimum wage has cut people out of the labor pool.

So what then, should corporations be able to pay people whatever they feel like?  What would happen to a fast food place that only wants to pay $1 per hour to employees?  They get no employees.  The labor market determines the cost of labor.","1385857061"

"infp","t5_2qn2o","Sorry for your scary dreams :( I feel just as lonely when I don't have anyone to unload my tumultuous dreams upon. And mine are just as weird- but they're also really graphically intense- sci-fi or fantasy looking worlds will form and it'll be so detailed and seamless that I just sit there perplexed when I wake up, as it's nothing I've ever seen before. My dreams are also usually horrific, plenty of surreal, demon-like beings going around torturing, raping, overthrowing the world. There's also a lot of intense romance and trying to get to it, and even obtaining it can make waking up to reality very depressing. I don't think there's too much point in analyzing it though, because if I spend all day playing a video game, then my dreams are about being in that game.. but it can't hurt to make sure that there's not some kind of situation in your life that could need resolving.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I think that SH are not really inba in anyway, but rather just dull. Like Blizzard always says they want SH to be used offensively, but even when they are being employed as seige units (and attacking) they just seem boring. There isn't really any skill that me as a watcher can observe. Like they don't seem to require a ton of great positioning or decision making to employ. They seem to either work greatly or just fail totally. And I think that SH play needs to be changed hugely to be interesting. BL are very similar, but more interesting to me because they are more mobile and have a reasonably elaborate tech path to reach. 

Of the other siege units, I think tanks are the best. They require a guard, positioning, interesting use of vision, and I feel they are the most versatile of all the siege units. 

Tempests are a bit boring, but I think could be tweaked to make them more interesting. Like in soS vs Scarlett (maybe) they kinda just owned the map, and someone here pointed out that they literally were just slow moving hard hitting units with no abilities, almost exclusively designed to deal with BL or other massive units. And that isn't very interesting. But I think that the unit has potential to have an interesting activated ability or something.

I'm not a game designer, and I don't really know what is best, I'm just bored of siege units in SC2 atm, but I think they have a lot of potential. What do you all think?","1385857062"

It was a very strong attraction and I believed that we were possibly falling in love. After one night at a bar when we got really drunk and almost ended up kissing, I just looked at him and drunkenly said:
""Next lifetime...sorry but we just can't"".

After stumbling home drunk and waking up the next morning I decided it wasn't worth losing my marriage and my best friend over (she would have killed me). So I emotionally cut him out of my life and moved on.

My and my husband still got divorced but I'm really proud of the fact that while I was tempted, I never went there and tried for the next two years on saving my marriage.

starting items: stout tango salve clarity iron branch.

midgame: Treads, Vanguard(if you can get it before 15 mins), Vlads

Late game: AC, Heart, Pipe, Radiance 

max quill spray first getting a level of bristleback at 2 and goo at 4. ult at 6 then max bristleback and finally max goo.

For the first few levels quill stacks dont do much damage so try to save your mana for later. when you do use quill spray try to get as many stacks as you can on your opponent it does a lot of damage in the early game.

Initiate with goo for the slow and armor reduction and then just right click as you chases remembering to use goo and quill spray whenever you can.

If you are being attacked try and take as much damage to your back as you can. When you have treads vanguard vlads you are pretty tanky dont be afraid to run into the middle of fights.

you can solo rosh when you have your vlads just remember to keep the goo on him for armor reduction. when you respawn with aegis the enemy wil still have the quill spray stacks so continue to spam it out","1385857066"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","First of all, I would dispute that ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" as compared with the alternative *is* a grand, social idea of collective betterment. 

But the history shows that we were also not founded so that we could be ""anything we damned well pleased', which my examples in this thread speak to. So whatever way you cut it what he said was inaccurate and designed to play to his base's perception of American mythology.

Moreover, what a nation is founded on doesn't extend forever into the future. So we certainly aren't prohibited from making everyones' lives better, even if the founding of the nation didn't account for it.

"litecoin","t5_2szgd","I dont totally agree with it.

Firstly, it is true that solely looking at the BTC/LTC ratio doesnt really make sense in my opinion either. However, using a workhorse model of assuming LTC is equally successful as BTC (same number of users, acceptability and so on, including all coins mined) it would make sense in my opinion to have an exachange rate of .25 due to the different number of generated coins. Now if we look at the exchange rate we could rate the level on how the market assumes LTCs are performing in the sense of how far behind it sees LTC (the higher the rate the closer the adoption rate is believed to be to BTCs). Therefore looking at this exchange rate seems neverhteless reasonable to me (i.e. I interpret an exchange rate of 0.05 as the market believing that LTC is where BTC was with about 20% of its current users, media attention and so on... very vague though i still hope you get what I mean)

Sometimes all you can do is just say whatever and move on from that particular insult, not take it personally.

When the microwave heats the milk or water, it heats it quickly and well past the normal boiling point. Normally when a liquid boils, air bubbles and steam form and escape.

In a smooth container or with a relatively uniform liquid, the surface tension combined with the fast heating method can prevent this from occurring. The water is well over boiling point and super still.

Until you shake it or stir it, which causes it to violently flash to steam and bubble. This makes it look like it's instantly boiling. You can prevent this by putting a toothpick or a plastic spoon in while it cooks.","1385857089"

That exact same content is then ""sold"" to BBC Worldwide and aired in other regions (with commercials), raising total revenue for British ""public television"" to over £5 billion. So one way to look at it is that commercial television was a very small part of total revenue. But a look at the whole situation shows it does have a strong effect.

Just because you don't see them in the UK, that money is a factor, especially in the bigger series like *Doctor Who*, *Ripper Street*, or *Copper*.

And what shows does the BBC make for the home market only, with very little intention to export? Relatively cheap comedy panel shows. They positively litter the schedule.

 Are you measuring resistance right?.   You should measure lead to ground lead to ground, not lead to lead. Unless each coil just loops over to the next and doesn't have one side going to ground.  Most have one side to ground, but it has been a while since I have messed with a multiple coil set up.

 Testing the stator without the reg/rec should give you a correct voltage reading because it relies on the winding..  Then the reg/rec voltage divides it down from their. But the before reg/rec voltage is what we are wanting anyways to figure power output.   EDIT  Don't automatically rule out a weak flywheel magnet. Because that would lower your total wattage and thus your voltage reading...And the voltage reading is one of the 2 known hard numbers you are relying on for the calculation.","1385857100"

**Name:** Motoori Kosuzu (本居 小鈴)

**Title:** Bibliophile with a Deciphering Eye

**Species:** Human (1 of only 8(?) full-fledged humans introduced in the entire franchise, though many more do exist in-world – they just aren't part of the story.)

**Ability to the extent of:** understanding books from a single touch.

**Occupation:** Librarian

**Appears in:** Forbidden Scrollery, a manga series. She has never appeared in a game.

**Character info:** Kosuzu works at Suzunaan, a library/book store in Gensokyo (the land where the series takes place). Despite being a recently introduced character, she's depicted as being very close friends with (series protagonist) Reimu. She's frequently [paired with Mamizou](http://i.imgur.com/nlMuWOL.jpg), a tanuki, due to a fascination with her early on in *Scrollery*. She is also easily in the top tier of [cutest characters in official art](http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:FS_Kosuzu_Motoori.jpg).

**Japanese vocab:** The *ko* (小) in Kosuzu is a prefix meaning *little*. We'll see it reused in at least 3 more characters' names. *Suzu* (鈴) means *bell*, specifically a globe-shaped bell like she wears in her hair. ""Motoori"" has the kanji for ""book"" in it (本), but you wouldn't pronounce it as ""moto"" on its own. It's a likely reference to [Motoori Norinaga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoori_Norinaga).","1385857101"

"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","&gt;The irony of those comments is that most of the time, these girls can't even tell who's TRP. If a man is successfully implementing TRP concepts, he'll be indistinguishable from an attractive alpha male or a charming man with game.

Lol no he wont. Y'all are so damn easy to see, it's a joke.

&gt;Trp is just accepting the biology we are governed by.

You know nothing of biology if you actually believe that.

&gt;Yeah, that surprised me the most, more than the rape accusations, that they think we hate women. We don't. Most men here adore women.

Calling women bitches, whores, sluts and walking fleshlights isn't hatred? That's news to me!

You don't like women. You just like fucking them. Big difference.

&gt;It isn't necessarily a bad thing. The more these TBP users over-hype our sub and use outlandish words to describe it, the more it'll peak the interest and curiosity of neutral users.
""OMG I totally gotta see what this infamous sub is all about! I'm sure I'll see nothing but misogyny and I'll laugh at those sexist losers!
Oh wait... this isn't at all what the bluepiller told me TRP was about. This stuff's actually decent and I can relate to many of those ideas. I think I'll lurk around a little longer until I find actual misogyny... Hypergamy? Alpha fucks/Beta Bucks? Me and my buddies have personally experienced that shit! Maybe I can find a way to not fall for it next time Hmm..""

No, more like-

""Females are bitches, sluts, whores and walking fleshlights that should have only 1 hour a week to tell me her complaints about my behavior. Questioning me in public is outrageous and I'll just next the bitch for it. While we're at it, she shouldn't eat more than two meals a day and I should have complete unreal expectations on her physical looks.""

&gt;Do they even check it out for themselves? No.

Yes. Just two pages should tell a person how terrible it is. But plenty look further and realize it's not just terrible, but unhealthy.

&gt;Do they have any inclination to? No. Their opinion is based on heresay and conjecture. The lack of critical thinking on reddit is really fucking ridiculous.

See that folks? Apparently none of us ever bothered to actually read TRP!

&gt;I think a lot of their opinion is also based on the loud minority we have on this sub that are angry at women after swallowing the red pill. They don't realize that this initial anger later turns into a more neutral or ""it is what it is"" mentality.

Well maybe if ya'll bothered to call out that ""loud minority"" your sub wouldn't have such a bad reputation. 

&gt;Women play the game instinctively. Fact that they are selective gender and the fact that even if they're average looking they'll have zero problem with finding a partner - leaves their brains free from need for strategic thinking. That's where feelinzz' take over the void.

Shit like that is why many think TRP is also filled with idiots. 

&gt;All the complaints come from women, they have the most to lose from guys becoming red pill.

Actually it's the other way around. When a dude is a Red Pillian, women flee from him like he's diseased.

&gt;Men and women aren't equal, they're complimentary. Like spoons and forks, one is not better than the other, but there are differences between the two.

.....That would make them equal. Hello, anyone home?

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Most sites that offer interest payments on BTC end up either being scams or scam-like operations like MCXNow. Two factor authentication is good but at the end of the day an offline or paper wallet is the best solution for now. Even with 2FA you're trusting the security or basic deployment of an exchange or other website. I would think the multiples, volatility and security issues of BTC would make it hard for any BTC bank to function taking losses for user screw ups, fraud and other security events.","1385857105"

The ugly duckling, who would never get a fucking; Howard the hog, who should be mauled by a dog; Alan the bluegay and so on. It wasn't long until Henry lead the flock. He would fly overhead, making up rhymes as he went along about all the animals below him. He mocked those that couldn't fly the most. For in his eyes you couldn't really be intelligent without having seen the world from above. He would mock them from the skies and, those that answered, would be attacked by his posse. One day he saw a weird looking animal. It looked like a small shaved bear. He quickly made a very scathing limerick to mock him with.

Different dates: if one tower was being worked on as part of network vision then the next one abd then the next one tickets will all display different dates. Sometimes there are 5-10 tickets for a single tower while various part s of NV is being done. This take time a bit of time.Different vendors and even the local Telco. Then sometimes the upgraded tower doesn't talk well with non upgraded tower and increases drops calls. It's annoying but when I talk to people on upgraded areas they are very happy. 

changing markets can sometimes make the device work better, but an agent can and likely did a refresh that had the same effect when you called. It isn't something that commonly resolves the issue but had been known to help. It more ao helped years ago back in the days when traceling across counties could result in roaming on the same network. 

Unfortunately there is not a set service level in the contract and if you left without the fees being offerdx to be waived (which requires the device returned) there is nothing that can really be done at this point.

There's *vast* difference semantically between those two things.  There's no expectation on my part to provide something that everyone is already clear on, including you, and that isn't an argument to begin with.

&gt; You also said this:

&gt;&gt; the new collaborative tools are very exciting to me

&gt; ...which implies that you haven't actually used any of the collaborative features

Uh, *no*, that's *not* what that means.  Unless English is not your first language, this is a pretty embarrassing reading comprehension fail.  There's nothing about stating the tools are exciting to me that suggests in any way that I haven't used them.  Derp.

&gt; even though you judge them to be better than Google Docs, which you also haven't used

I use Google Docs *all the time*.  Wrong again.  And again with the reading comprehension fail, too.  I never said they were ""better"" than Google Docs.  I've stated they have better desktop feature parity, which is unequivocally true.

&gt; Tell me: are you frequently considered an expert on topics that you have no expertise?

Not really a relevant question.  Regardless, I've demonstrated I know what I'm talking about, in addition to having experience with multiple platforms.  In opposition, you've demonstrated ignorance of subject matter.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I'm a bit confused. How long ago did you guys move to the new city? It seems like she's still adjusting.

This is easier said than done, but the *solution* to your problem is for her to get used to the new city. When you move, you have to make new friends. She must have known this going in, but now she's gotten discouraged about it so she needs your help. Encourage her to join a Meetup group (or several), pick up some new hobbies, etc. Keep meeting new people, both individually and as a couple. Make plans to visit her family every 2-3 months; a five hour drive is totally do-able for a 3-day weekend visit. I've moved cities with my partner before (right after college, like you) and it took us a while to make new friends but we each did it. You just have to man up &amp; introduce yourself to people you don't know even though it is a bit awkward.

If she's not willing to work on fixing the problem, then you're a bit screwed (and the poor cats &amp; dog are screwed as well). In that case, therapy for her and couples counseling for you both could be really helpful.","1385857113"

For a little example, have a look at the photography subreddits. ""potato"" = low quality.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","Honestly I can 100% relate to you. I just looked at my friend from AA and said you wrote all my thoughts over the past few months. You should totally share about it in meetings because I promise you're not the only one who feels this way. 

This is my first semester sober and it ends in two weeks. I only just started to honestly put effort into my work. Time takes time. You're in recovery. Don't expect yourself to be any where too fast because you'll just be disappointed. Trust me, I've been there. It's not a marathon, it's a journey. 

I did the same thing, when I first came into the rooms I jumped in with both feet. Hell, I still make it to a meeting every single day. We're obsessive people and thats okay. The balance will come the further you get into the program. 

I don't know how big you are on that higher power concept (I generally believe that everything happens for a reason due to energies rebounding off of each other) but I find the more i practice asking the universe for willingness (to do things that I'm not motivated to do) it takes me into a more open mindset.

I was taught that procrastination stems from fear, when I accepted this it was easier to figure out what I was afraid of and how to change that. 

These things happen over time though. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm where I'm supposed to be. It may not feel like it, but you sound good. 

Honestly, when it came to me romanticizing getting drunk, I combatted it with romanticizing getting sober. I figured that I was working with a bunch of bad asses to fight against our addiction. Life's hard on the streets, ""lyin' and cheatin' is all I know"", or some shit like that. In turn I found that trying to change every single aspect of myself is pretty freaking bad ass.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I always knew my online antics would come back to haunt me, in some way. Being the son of a intel officer for the Army and my own interest in the dark side of clandestine affairs led me to peruse the net for forums, discussions, and articles about national surveillance, intel gathering, and military recon; this was even my focus for a career, as I studied communications and intended to follow my father's footsteps as an intelligence agent. 

Oddly enough, it seemed that this wasn't the exact reason for my encounter.

Instead, it seemed the catalyst was the work I've been doing for an indie blog; the subject: abuse, corruption, and overreach of the surveillance community. Thanks to some disgruntled ex-contractors, on top of some dirt that took *quite* a bit of digging, I've lined up some great exposé pieces detailing the true extent of the permeation of surveillance corruption. On top of that, some details on black ops that are scarcely known outside of the architects that set them up; needless to say, if this was any other country, I would have been found dead in my office months ago. However, it went down a little...differently.

I was walking back to my studio apartment after doing some work on some graduate school projects, and it was late. I don't live in the best neighborhood, but certainly not the worst; still, I knew better than to stay on the street when I heard car tires screech behind me. It was...a van...of some sort, I think. I was tired, so I didn't realize what was happening. The screech did wake me up a bit, but only enough to turn around; all I saw were headlights and masked men coming after me. The *last* thing I saw was the darkness of a bag being pulled over my head, and I was smothered into unconsciousness. 

""Mr. Tyrell, wake up,"" a cold voice said. 

I barely had time to open my eyes and lift my head before I was hit with a right-cross. Laughter. But not humorous laughter; it was devoid of joy, filled with malice.

""Wha-what do you want? Where am I?"" I asked.

""Where you are is not important. Why you are here, is. My name is Tony, and this is my associate, Sean.""

""Pleased to meet you,"" Sean arrogantly grunted.

""What do you want?"" I asked again. 

""Snowden changed the game for us. We no longer have the shadows that we so enjoyed, and arguably took for granted. No, no! Now we have the spotlight thrust on us, and it's not a good one. Our work, Mr. Tyrell, is necessary for our security, and you're about to undermine it."" Tony's face was started with a grin, but now it was solid in a cold and unforgiving glare. Whatever I had done, I knew it affected him enough to really affect his work.

""What work would that be?"" 

Sean blasted out, ""DON'T ACT SO INNOCENT, **FRANK**!"" A fist slammed the cold metal table. ""You've been digging around where anyone with a brain would know to stop. You have names in your reports that most...intelligent...reporters would erase from the depths of their memories. The operations that you are about to expose on the *Global Status* blog...would bring a new hatred to our nation's doorstep.""

""What Sean is trying to say, Mr. Tyrell, is that whatever research you are doing, shouldn't have been done."" Tony seemed to truly believe this, and said it in a way that slightly convicted me, until I remembered the point of my research: to stop stuff like this from happening.

""My 'research' is necessary to continue having a world where we don't have to be afraid of people knocking down your door, or *grabbing you on the street*, simply because you are investigating an organization. This nation is the vanguard of such a dream world, and right now, it's not going well. In fact– "" 

""Fact is, *Frank*,"" Tony said with some disgust, ""what you've got on your computers needs to be gone, **tonight**. You may not respect my, Sean, our work, or, hell, even your country! But for the love of God, if you respect human life, if you *don't* want to be party to a criminal investigation, you will not publish your ""work.'"" 

""We still have people out there doing good, honest work. Everything you've written jeopardizes them."" Sean explained.

I had an epiphany: they had access to my computer, my files. Even though I had state-of-the-art firewalls and cybersecurity, they got through. ""How exactly do you know what I wro– ""

""Our counterintelligence units are *very* good at what they do. You could have stopped at interviewing our former directors, and still have ended up on our watchlist."" Sean was being matter-of-fact with me. They were really trying to sell me the ""patriot"" angle; I wasn't having it, but in order to get out of this alive, I knew I had to.

""I am a patriot. I'm just trying to do what I think is right. But I don't want anyone to get hurt.""

""Then *you* must delete your files, burn everything. We can drop you off at your apartment, so you can do what you need to do. We will be watching, and waiting for you. If you try to run, we may find you in a dumpster, shot after encountering a gang, or possibly the victim of a hit-and-run. We don't know what will happen, but it won't be good for you. We can set up payment for a new life for you.""

They had me. I either played ball or I'm another statistic in the urban crime reports next month. I had one choice: a secret fire safe set up in the floor of my apartment, specifically for a time such as this. My friend Lilly, a ""sleeper"" agent that would help me publish everything if I ended up imprisoned or dead, knows where it is and the combination; she is legally my insurance agent, so she would have reasonable access to my apartment in a disaster. It was the only play.

""Okay, take me back."" I requested, with a sense of failure that wasn't totally faked. 

""Good."" Tony said with a sly smile.

A whack from Sean, presumably, behind my head sent me into a dark sleep again. 

I awoke on the steps of my building, an old warehouse converted into stereo loft apartments. The cold water woke me up, stinging as I drifted out of sleep and breathed in the cold midnight air. One vehicle and several plainclothed agents that I didn't recognize were behind me as I struggled to stand up.

""You have 30 minutes. Here's a few cans of gas. Start in the kitchen."" The agent's voice colder than the night; he handed me two cans of gasoline, and proceeded to place his hands on his hip, conveniently resting on his holstered .45 sitting on his waist. This not-so-subtle reminder reinforced the kind of people and situation I was dealing with; one slip up and I was dead. As long as I got through the next 15 minutes or so, my impact would be felt. 

I went up into my building, and entered my apartment, leaving the agent at the door. As I got in, I started smashing nonessential things, y'know, making noise so they know I'm getting busy. I smash a few windows, and then get started on the files. I first unplug my computer from the internet, and smash my router; once I make sure that I cannot be plugged in to the internet, I boot up my computer and start printing my go-folder. This folder has everything I needed to keep in case I was found out and needed to get away quickly; I start an auto-print script and continue smashing stuff. I get a bag of clothes, some personal items such as my journal and family pictures, and important documents, and it all hits me; I start to cry, for my work, for my belongings, for the country. I set the bag by the door, and prep the safe; I set what physical resources I already had in there, and begin transferring the printed-out copies from my printer tray into the safe, acknowledging the sad irony in the situation. More destruction. Paintings from my travels in Europe and Asia, photo albums from my time in Latin America, family heirlooms, hard-earned appliances and furniture– all get caught in the line of fire as I attempt to save my own skin. I feel selfish, but I know there's nothing I can do about it. 

I finish up smashing my apartment, and start dowsing the room with gasoline. Once the printer finished printing, I stuffed it with the remaining papers, replaced the flooring, and finished dowsing the apartment. The agent that was at the door lit it up, and we continued outside. But! As we went outside, we saw all the other agents, dead, with the SUV in flames. As the agent behind be pulled out his service pistol, he was shot in the head. (I guess I have you to thank for that) 

So now, I'm free...for now. But the information that I put away, I have not received yet. So I suppose I must return to my cell? In due time, I hope to buy my freedom from you; until then I hope we can continue this...pleasurable...imprisonment.

*I am escorted back to my well-furnished cell, waiting for Lilly to furnish my redemptive files*","1385857122"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; However, I don't think that a minimum wage can come close to the optimal level. For one, it will adversely affect businesses that can't sustain a $10.10/hr wage (like the little stores around where I live) and it will probably induce businesses to switch to more productive and relatively less cheap capital (like computers that take orders instead of cashiers) which really makes people lose jobs when they otherwise wouldn't.

Maybe. The question of which effect dominates is, ultimately, an empirical question. The reasonable case for the MW (in my opinion) is that our empirical estimates of the negatives effects are somewhere between ""zero"" and ""negative small"". So it's a reasonable part of the package (which should also include EITC).

Of course, one could reasonably argue against any anti-poverty policy.

&gt; What happens when this doesn't happen? I can't necessarily choose my hours worked (I'm slotted for 8 hours) but I can choose my effort per hour.

Don't know. The FG paper is just interesting because it showed an example of a firm losing money because wages are too low. There are reasonable questions of external validity.","1385857126"

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","Issue: Is the contract valid?

Rule: A valid contract requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. An offer is a manifestation of an intent to be bound. An acceptance must mirror the offer and close the deal. Consideration means that all parties to the contract must undertake an obligation. (Maybe other stuff, depending on how your teacher wants things structured and how rusty I am.)

Analysis: Here, Bob told Jim that he would be willing to pay him $20 to rake Bob's lawn on Thursday. Because Bob used clear and definite language, and the circumstances showed he was serious, Bob's statements manifested an intent to be bound. Therefore, Bob made a valid offer. ... The parties each held obligations to the other. Jim had an obligation to rake Bob's lawn on Thursday. Bob had an obligation to pay Jim $20 once the lawn was raked. Because both parties held obligations to each other, the promises were supported by consideration.

Conclusion: The contract is valid.","1385857128"

Anyway in one of my lab classes we were assessing imaginary patients' BMIs and other shit. One of my classmates referred to a certain patient as ""bulging betty"". Her measurements happened to be identical to mine. I think i cried about it for days.

If i hadn't volunteered to facilitate sessions for the Body Project sometime after that I would never have recognized his statement as the bullshit it was.

It will give you a better initial hit for puncture, but those phys nodes won't scale up the bleed itself.  This is because ""attack"" scaling encompasses everything that refers to ""weapon"" damage and to any specific type of weapon.  This is the same reason neither point blank nor Chin Sol's bonuses scale Explosive Arrow--EA does fire, area, projectile damage, but none of that is based on the weapon itself.  (Same goes for Quill Rain's penalty.)  If the terminology is consistent, puncture should only get damage from those other things you mentioned like Rustic Sashes, Oak reward, etc.  ""Melee Physical Damage"" should also work.

The two posts you cited above, while perhaps not addressing specific circlejerks, at least attempted to analyze the behavior of reditors in other subreddits. The post we're talking about did nothing of the kind. It was pretty much focused on an individual, which violates /r/circlebroke's rules. The top comments, including op's own link to a meta-sub, were pretty witch-hunty, which is why I removed them, as well.

The /r/conservative mod being a white supremacist had absolutely nothing to do with my removing the post. However, you seem to be suggesting that the post was focused on white supremacy (although I don't necessarily think it was). If this were the case, then it belongs in /r/openbroke and not /r/circlebroke. But I would have removed it from /r/openbroke, also, for the same reasons.

Honestly, a post like that belongs in /r/ShitRedditSays if it belongs anywhere.

Hope this helps. I've done my best to explain my actions.

(Btw, that ""genocide apologia thanksgiving thread"" was a train wreck. It probably belonged in /r/openbroke, as well. Plus it was circlejerky as hell. Thanksgiving as celebrated in the US has nothing to do with the treatment of Native Americans at the hands of white Americans. And why shouldn't /u/Slutlord_Facist be upvoted? Because you don't like him? Because he's involved with /r/SRSSucks? He was participating in good faith and attempting to contribute his P.O.V. to the conversation. The fact that many /r/circlebroke subscribers don't personally like him should have *nothing to do* with voting. Or do you guys just want to downvote contrary opinions so you can continue the jerk amongst yourselves?)","1385857141"

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","Your description of the game experience is completely opposite of mine.

Yes, serration, hornet strike, redirection and vitality are extremely difficult to *max out*.  That's by design.  They're also *extremely* common mods.  A new player will aim for a serration with a few levels, maybe a good healthy +100% bonus.  Not the max level, which is one of the heaviest investments in the game if I'm not mistaken.  That's just ridiculous.

And the defense and mobile defense missions on Mercury are, frankly, terrible to farm.  The survival is ok, but it takes an inordinate amount of time compared to higher level defense missions because you have to ramp up from the single-digit levels (or is it still glitched?  I haven't played apollo in particular for a while).  There's also the massive difference in the number of credits you'll receive.  If you farm enough credits from mercury missions to buy even one of the blueprints you need to replace that god-awful starting weaponry, you're going to drown in all of the common mods that can drop there, most of which are *useless*, even in niche builds.  Are you really saying a new player should run the same mercury mission 10 more times for raw credits rather than sell his ridiculous amount of *Intruder* mods?

The ""guaranteed vs non-guaranteed"" argument is moot as well.  Maybe for rares or uncommons you have a point, but you can get a copy of any of the common mods from common enemies in a defense, mobile defense, survival or even extermination in just a few runs at most.  Regardless, while it's not guaranteed in a technical sense, it's incredibly rare to see a mission go by without *some* mod, and as long as you keep at least one copy of a mod you can fuse it up with cores, matching polarities, or even those 50 intruder mods gathering dust.

For fusion cores, give Eris, Xini a try.  That's been my main farming mission for quite a while and I always see a lot drop.  Then again they drop *everywhere* with regularity.  Just playing should see more than enough drop unless you're maxing out a bunch of mods all at once.  I've never actually bothered to fuse mods based on polarity because I've never ran out of fusion cores, though I haven't bothered to finish that last level on the mods like serration either.

If I, personally, were to start over.  The first thing I'd do is to sell *everything* that wasn't a few of the core mods, like serration, hornet strike, fast hands, the elemental mods, or the various ability-affecting mods.  Everything else gets dumped into credits.  The faster you can get the credits to build a half-decent weapon, the faster you can really farm alerts for decent credits, energy siphon and so on, high level missions for affinity, and varied missions for different mod types.  It's all about ROI, hanging on to your 20th *hush* mod is just holding your back, when later on it will be trivial to farm enough credits, mods and cores to level it up (and then you'll continue never using it).","1385857142"
