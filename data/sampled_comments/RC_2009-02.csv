I disagree with this assertion.

Crop rotation can be done by all farmers together, forming a farming co-operative. They do it out of self-preservation because they know that if they don't they're all gonna ruin their fields.

There is potential for government PENALTIES to be levied against farmers who don't participate in some kind of rotation. But that's as far as I would go. This is the same as dealing with any other free rider effect such as pollution. You tax pollution in one way or another. Failing to rotate your crops could easily be seen as a form of pollution.

&gt;So it's preferable that the word ""atheist"" refer to a full range of probabilities

No, and that is the essence of my point.  I think the atheist label should be reserved for people who think the probability is nil, or 1 in near infinity (which are functionally the same).  As soon as you start backing off of the nigh-impossible end of the spectrum, I think its fine to start using the agnostic label, but I don't think too many agnostics are too far from that extreme end anyway.

&gt;why people insist on making the term atheist so ambiguous

I don't think what I have described is ambiguous at all.  

&gt;I've always disagreed with Dawkins saying this; it is simply wrong. No theist would ever use the word ""atheist"" to apply to themselves even in regards to the gods of others.

But that does not make the argument logically invalid or Dawkins wrong.  It is an airtight argument (which is why Dawkins uses it) from a logical standpoint.  It has nothing to do with whether theists would acknowledge it or not.","1233446549"

&gt; That we might not fully understand something natural and mislabel it doesn't change the nature of that thing.

I don't think it's that simple.  You're begging the question by defining that a true god needs to be supernatural in a way that can't be explained naturally.  I disagree.

Our experience has shown repeatedly that what was once called supernatural can have natural explanations.  If an alien intelligence were actually responsible for interfering in human development on a regular basis along the lines that religions believe, then that could provide a ""natural"" referent for the concept ""god"".  Would such an understanding mean that that intelligence is *not* god?  If so, why?

It's likely to mean that it doesn't exactly match literal Judeo-Christian notions of god, but as I said I'm a strong atheist with respect to those.

Nevertheless, a sentient being which created our universe or even just prepared Earth for us, fostered the creation of life, and took an ongoing interest in
the development of that life, intervening in ways that are beyond our current understanding, would correspond closely enough to my understanding of the
meaning of ""god"" that I would consider it reasonable to say that ""god exists"" if evidence of such an entity were discovered.  At the very least, one would
have to say that theists were onto something, even if they had some of the details wrong.  I'd be extremely surprised if that were the case, but I'm saying it's conceivable.  In that situation, claiming that that's not really a god would seem to rather miss the point.

Note that extra-dimensional beings could have capabilities that would forever remain beyond our understanding, and appear supernatural to us.  Our brains have proved extremely weak at understanding what can happen in a universe with larger numbers of spatial dimensions, and a being with access to those
dimensions and an intelligence capable of exploiting them could be indistinguishable from a god, to us.

More generally, as I touched on in my previous comment, the notion of ""supernatural"" is philosophically problematic.  What seems supernatural to us would by definition be natural to the superentity performing those supernatural
operations.  Again, this implies that a superentity might occupy its own universe, with its own rules.  The idea of some physical universe ""outside"" our
physical universe fits perfectly with this conception.  The fact that this situation might conceivably be explained ""naturally"" in some sense involving extra-universal physics doesn't seem to undermine reasonable definitions of ""god"".

"politics","t5_2cneq","You can disagree with it, but I've presented an historical example (The Great Dust Bowl) where farmers did not work together to preserve the long term health of their soil, which lead to immense drought and large scale loss of food production.  What is different about the market now compared to then that makes you think this would not happen again?

Another example is the soil in most of the Southeast (Virginia/Georiga) where tobacco was grown.  It is absolutely horrible soil now - but at the time, it was great, and they grew it every year until they could get nothing more out of it.  Given that the time scales to destroy soil are often long compared to human lifespan / market demands (say, ~50-100 years), there is little incentive for a farmer to take too much concern with these.  While the free market is often good with short term things, it seems to fail miserably on long term goals.  For instance, oil (given that it is finite) should be insanely expensive, yet it is absurdly cheap to fill up a car.

Addtionally, you have not addressed my primary economic point of the boom bust cycle of farming.  Is it addressed in the book you've recommended?  Note that I feel farming is distinct from other businesses, and therefore would need to be specifically addressed - just saying they can do it like other businesses (when evidence suggests they are not like other businesses and they serve a vital role to civilization) is not sufficient to sway me.","1233446864"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;However, by being a ""certain"" atheist, are you really any better than a ""certain"" theist?

I'll answer this but in a re-phrased way so it doesn't sound ad hominem.  I would ask, ""do you think one flavor of atheism has any more logical support than any other?""

To which I would answer, yes.  As you said yourself, I prefer to draw conclusions from evidence.  Since there is no evidence of the existence of god, I cannot believe a god exists.  But since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, I cannot logically say that I believe god does not exist.  However, I can put a relative perceived probability on whether god exists, and as such, I'd say the odds are 1 in nearly infinity.  So for any functional purpose in terms of living my life, I am functionally a hard atheist I guess.

PS:  It is really bad to conflate beliefs with individuals.  Your original question about being better than this or that, was phrased in just such a conflating way.  I know what you meant, but too many people don't, and they end up thinking you are trying to criticize them personally rather than their beliefs.","1233446880"

I never saw much of a distinction between Python, Ruby, Squeak, and Perl; they're all suitable for quick-and-dirty scripts but I wouldn't want to develop a large application in any of them.

But you do feel that we should grant extra rights to individuals because of exceptions:

&gt;would we grant rights to all apes? No, just the one ape.

So why wouldn't we take the rights of individuals away because of exceptions?  It seems to me that, in the absence of a further argument, this would be the proportional and most obvious response.  Perhaps you feel that rights are species based rather than based on individuals, but the argument you gave does not actually suggest this.  Stumbles047 did not suggest that emphasizing capacity would strip all humans of ethical responsibilities, merely that emphasizing capacity would suggest that individual humans of differing capacities would be subject to different ethical responsibilities.

&gt;The question itself is an open one that I'm not claiming to know the answer to, but the fact that it is open tells me that capacity is not enough in itself to make a determination of how an entity should be treated.

&gt;&gt;This is not an argument, though. This is the absence of an argument. Accordingly, veganism is just as valid as omnivorism.

I think we are talking past each other, this argument was not concerning the validity of veganism.  The question of whether or not it would be ""right"" to withdraw care from a terminal patient does not need to be answered in this context, because it isn't relevant except in that it confirms that we can perceive a difference in the ethical or moral actions concerning an individual who lives in one society to that of the an individual of similar capacities in a different context.  In other words, it was confirming the suggestion that capability is not the sole means of determining ""rights"".

People aren't ignorant anymore. We have extremely good communications and information systems. Farming is a very different thing than it used to be.

Yes I did. Farmers can deal with boom/busts in the same way every other business does. Farmers are not the only people who have this issue.

Crop insurance is a pretty obvious way to deal with this, and co-ops can be set up where farmers insure each other for bargain-basement prices.

You don't need a centrally-planned economy to deal with boom/busts. EVERY business has this issue. Only farmers have the voting power to vote themselves taxpayer dollars though.

By the way, I'm from Saskatchewan, where we have two industries for hundreds of miles - farming, and potash. So I'm not a noob on farming.

If progressive download is good enough for the purpose, then Apache (or others) can deliver the video just fine. If you need streaming, there are projects like Red5 and haXeVideo.

Also, if you want to get a foot in the door against Flash, h.264 is the way to go /because/ Flash supports it -- you could embed it the same way you would with Ogg, but you'd have the Flashplayer as a fall-back if the user's browser doesn't support it.

No one is using them as cause/effect, so I'm not sure who you're arguing against.  Consent is simply a choice made in a voluntary context.  Absent the voluntary context, ""consent"" doesn't apply.

&gt;Right but going to a desert island here amounts to what Rothbard called a ""lifeboat scenario"" approach to ethics. 

Not at all.  I was simply addressing your implication that ""If you don't work, then you'll starve to death or freeze"" was sufficient to label the employment context as ""not voluntary"".

&gt;Point blank: consent != voluntary

Of course it does, otherwise you wouldn't call it consent in the first place.  Though it seems like the position you are arguing against is ""because you consented it is voluntary"".  I don't know of any libertarian who would argue there is a cause/effect relationship at all, much less that it runs in that direction.  

&gt;Employment is predicate on consent, not a voluntary choice.

One can only ""consent"" if the context is a voluntary one.

&gt;Since \[employment] is not ""voluntary"" in any reasonable sense...

Pardon?  Perhaps this is the source of contention, rather than the usage of the word ""consent"" (which by the way, you brought up).

&gt;you can't categorically say any and all employment is **justified.**

I thought we were talking about whether something is voluntary.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; If you do not know what is out there, why do you have to give it a name ""god"" ?

The issue is that some people believe they know what is out there.  They may not have much evidence for it, although their position overlaps with questions that aren't entirely unreasonable, such as whether our universe might have been created by a sentient entity, or whether the creation of life in our universe might have been facilitated by such an entity.

The whole notion of atheism is defined with respect to such beliefs.  A weak atheist is someone who acknowledges that it's possible that there could be some real correlate to such beliefs.  For a weak atheist, the question of what form such a correlate might take thus has relevance.

Personally, I'm more interested in it from the speculative fiction angle.  What ifs don't turn me off, they perk up my ears.  But I don't confuse speculation with reality.

After I dumped her(I was, honestly, sick of herself stuffing her face with food each time we went out)- she gave me space for about a week or so, then sent the odd e-mail or text message (not needy or excessively!).  Eventually, we went out for some coffee and talked about it.  

When I was cold to her, she gently shamed me, said 'You don't have to be cold, you can take my hand.'

She was sympathetic, and I was touched (still had strong emotions) but knew I definitely wanted to date others.

Then, about a month after the break-up, we went out for some light dinner, and took a walk by a river, to talk about it.  I was firm that I didn't want to date again, but friends was okay.  

Then she floored me with ""Would you still want to have sex, too?""  I did, because I wasn't getting any just yet.

Damn, we were 'dating' again (although the relationship was altered).  It was bitter-sweet, but continued until I finally left the country.

Of course, they should implement a backup plan also, so that users can temporarily solve problems until the next release. For example, the mail.live.com site should have an override options preference section where you can do stuff like ""I know better. Always give me code path X no matter what browser I have"" etc.

And, Hotmail, by default, should be allowing all browsers and versions (including future versions) except for *exact* browser versions that have been *tested* to not work. It shouldn't be ""Let's let these few browsers in and block everything else by default so that if a new browser enters the market, we have to wait for an in-band release to support it"".

Stockholders and bondholders both get wiped out in the process, so they take the losses from all the risk they put on; and taxpayers have direct oversight of how the money is used.

The threat of nationalization will force stockholders and bondholders to try everything they can to avoid being nationalized, consequently placing their incentives on getting better by themselves than purposely feigning weakness just to get some money from the public trough. 

Public losses could be partially offset by selling the assets once the economy is better.","1233448176"

Also, both New Yankee Stadium and CitiField will be paid for by the respective teams.  The city only agreed to borrow the money for them via municipal bonds (which thus are tax free to the investor and teams, making them more attractive) and money for infrastructure improvements (which one assumes would have to be made anyway if any stadium were to be built).

Now, it's a question whether it's a good use of municipal bonds to then turn and lend the money to a sports franchise, but at the end of the day the teams are paying the costs of the buildings themselves.","1233448576"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; suppose that the government introduces a new program that will cause it to spend $100 billion a year every year from now on. To pay for this, it will have to raise taxes by $100 billion a year, permanently — and if consumers take this into account, they might well cut their spending enough to offset the increase in government purchases.


*might well cut their spending*????  Consumers will **have** to cut their spending by that amount since they won't have the money by definition -- it will have been taken by the government and spent on things other than what the consumer wants.

If the consumer wants something, leave the money in his hands and he will buy it.  The government cannot spend money more efficiently than the consumer because the government has no idea what the consumer wants.

Idiots like Krugman can always work out some smoke and mirrors crap to make government theft look like some sort of good thing but it's not.  They are not Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  They are the Sheriff on Nottingham taking from everyone they don't like and giving it to their friends with just enough crumbs to the ignorant masses to keep them from rising up.

While the fingers are pretty, it's very unlikely that all that schema exists in the rest of the baby's body--it would be difficult to even test to see if much of the neuronal stuff was present at this point.

I'm not saying ""I don't like the book"".  I'm saying there are some irritating things about it.  It is... imperfect!  And in the comment you are replying to, I'm not talking about the book at all, but some of the people who promote it.

&gt; but I don't think you'd disagree with me that a computer scientist has to understand the ideas in the book.

But I do disagree with you.  Computer Science includes many subfields, such as image processing, image compression, robotics, numerical methods etc. that do not require all the ideas in the book.  Your statement is such a narrow view. There's more to the world.

I would, however, agree that if you define computer science as the content of this book, then a computer scientist has to understand the ideas in it.

But that was your statement; what about Norvig's statement?  I agree with your interpretation of his specific statement when taken in isolation, but he also says:

&gt; The people who hate SICP are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.

There are lots of reasons why someone might hate SICP (I personally don't hate it, but I am irritated by some aspects of it). In the above Norvig is saying that all those people are mere drivers...

&gt; The satisfaction you get from accomplishing something that's very difficult for you is so great, and you learn a lot too.

Oh, absolutely you can.  Personally, I find great joy in making something happen, or a new insight into something.  Accomplishing very difficult things has not always given me great satisfaction, if I felt it was disproportionate, or if it wasn't perfect.  Of course, this is very personal, and I don't claim that it applies universally.  People vary greatly.

FWIW, I did my masters in computer science under an ACM Fellow (doing PhD now).  He said that I focussed too much on theory, and I should ""look at the data"" (actually he was a little angry: ""Look at the data!"").  Now *that's* an empirical *scientist*.

Anyway, I think the real problem here with Norvig is that he is reacting against people who are putting down something he loves - so that his response is angry and denouncing, instead of simply saying what he loves about it.  It's understandable, but shows that SICP is not a transcendent text.

*The Taoist has no need to argue for the Tao.  He simply enjoys it.*

And here am I criticizing Norvig :-)  oh well, I guess I'm far from perfect myself.

You're assuming that referee mistakes are a necessary part of the game and I definitely disagree. If we have the technology and ability to get the game as right as we can, why shouldn't we? A lot, lot, lot of sports would not be where they are today if we accepted that things are ""part of the game.""

&gt;As we have all seen, instant replay creates more problems than it solves 

This is begging the question.

&gt;and it also slows the game down.

This whole article is about how slow football is anyway. I will disagree that instant replay dramatically slows the game down. Quick googling indicates that, in 1999, challenges were settled in an average of 57 seconds, with about one challenge used per game. Even if you say that more challenges are used today, it's hard to argue that challenges and instant replay make the game drastically longer.

&gt;They're trying to make replay an exact science. It's impossible, since camera angles differ at all of the stadiums. You are also at the mercy of the TV director, his AD and the competence of the camermen.

Maybe. But if you have the opportunity to see a play from different angles to determine what the correct call should have been, doesn't that increase the chance you get the call right in the end? Why is this a bad thing?

&gt;The whole premise of replay is weak.

What's your evidence here?

&gt;The refs have also lost control of the game because their authority has been partly usurped by the replay system.

"politics","t5_2cneq","People are not ignorant anymore.  Yet, for crops without subsidies, farmers continue to not allow their fields to fallow.  

Even for subsidized crops, large scale, industrial agriculture uses methods that are destroying the top soil (we are down to our last 3 feet in most of the bread basket of america, down from something like 12-17 when we first started.)  So clearly, even with information and technology, farmers are not concerned that what they are doing today will destroy the soil in a hundred years.  So I'm still not convinced on this point, and still feel long term health of the land has a strong enough value to society to warrant government intervention.  

You make a good point about the co-ops.  However, it seems these would have to be insanely large to work, and would essentially have to ""price-fix"" the market to work and protect themselves from underpayment, which you may or may not be against.  Further, it would seem that if the co-ops tried to agree not to flood the market to keep prices reasonable, another one could undercut them.  I'm not sure how this would be dealt with.  Right now, the government buys up the excess grain (at normal market levels) and largely stores it for use in an emergency, or sells/dumps it on other countries. 

Also, one problem in America is that most farms barely make a profit even in good years - insuring for an entire years capital and living expenses would be quite tough, but possibly manageable.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;There is no scripture suggesting the non-Jews (such as Christians) have a sabbath.

This is like saying that christian teachings don't apply to lutheranism. Christianity is inherently a continuation of the jewish faith. The very ideas of a christ and a messiah are both jewish concepts. While it is clear that christianity abrogates certain jewish laws and traditions, it is left open to interpretation which jewish teachings still apply and to what extent. You can't really say that none still apply because much of Jesus' teachings overlap with the jewish faith. Arghh. I feel the need to back up this claim so there's another freakin' essay at the bottom. Feel free to skip it unless you care.


&gt;Any claims of sabbath observation are arbitrarily imposed by various political committees and leaders such as the Catholics or Constantine dictating a sabbath observation as part of law.

I agree that choosing to impose sabbath observation is arbitrary, but not unwarranted. As I said above, which jewish ideas still apply is completely up to interpretation and there simply isn't enough information to even begin to decide. Therefore choosing to observe the sabbath but not other jewish laws and traditions is completely arbitrary.


&gt; The old testament tradition of sabbath most unambiguously extends to not causing anyone else to work.

I could be convinced that if you were to cause someone else to work on the sabbath that you would definitely be breaking the rule of the sabbath. However, it's somewhat of a moot point because the very idea of ""causing"" someone else to do anything is very ambiguous. It's also a very slippery slope. Can you really make someone do something? Does eating out cause the restaurant employees to work? Maybe causation extends to helping to create the reasons why that person works on the sabbath. Well then why doesn't it extend to the reasons for those reasons? Pretty soon you realize that by choosing not to work on sabbath yourself, you are limiting the supply of employees willing to work on the sabbath, yet you are not necessarily reducing the demand for services on the sabbath (not everything works like a restaurant where you can simply not eat out on the sabbath. I'm thinking car insurance, apartment complex maintenance crews, blah blah), then you are helping to raise the wages for the sabbath hours and therefore helping to create reasons for people to work on the sabbath. Uh-oh.

So while I agree that causing someone to work on the sabbath would be bad according to old testament law, I don't think that it's actually possible to *make* someone work on the sabbath. I probably wouldn't eat out anyway, but I would not claim that it was unlawful to do so.




**BORING STUFF BEGINS HERE**

Jesus and the jews did not get along. He blatantly disobeyed jewish laws and did not respect the 2nd temple jewish leadership. He considered the pharisaic and sadducaic movements as a plague of sorts.
&gt; ""Be careful,"" Jesus said to them. ""Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."" They discussed this among themselves and said, ""It is because we didn't bring any bread."" Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, ""You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."" Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. - [Matthew 16:6-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:6-12;&amp;version=31;)

However, it would be silly to think that Jesus thought that judaism was completely and categorically wrong. Jesus was a born a jew and taught his followers to worship the Abrahamic (jewish) God. He quoted jewish scriptures, regarded the jewish temples as holy places, and followed many jewish traditions (e.g. passover). Jesus and his disciples certainly did not consider themselves to be gentiles. The very idea of a messiah is a prophesy from the jewesh scripture of Isaiah. When Jesus went before Pontius Pilate he acknowledged that he was both a jew and the messiah in one short answer:
&gt;""Are you the king of the Jews?"" asked Pilate. ""Yes, it is as you say,"" Jesus replied. - [Mark 15:2 (NIV)](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=15&amp;verse=2&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse)

Jesus' disciples were also considered jews.
&gt;""He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness....These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: 'Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.'"" - [Matthew 10:1,5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:1-5;&amp;version=31;)

Jesus did not denounce all of judaism, but rather believed that 2nd temple judaism was a corruption of a true abrahamic faith. His teachings provide a ""correction"" of sorts. After all, the messaiah was to restore the jewish faith as well as Israel's rule. It wasn't until Jesus' death that Jesus' followers (christians) desired to be separated completely from the jews. This is mostly due to christian criticism of the conduct of the sanhedrin (jewish court) where Jesus was tried for blasphemy and, according to the gospels, eventually handed over to the Romans to be crucified.

Saying that christians are non-jews is like saying that supporters of Ron Paul are not Americans. Sure, his idea of what government should be is very different from what it is today. If he were to have his way then many American laws would be thrown out and much of our government would be dissolved. Brand new legislation would also be passed. But that doesn't mean that what's left would no longer be America. Ron Paul argues the opposite. As a constitutionalist libertarian he believes he would simply be returning America to what the founding fathers meant it to be in the first place. In that sense, christians are most certainly jews.


**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a christian and I do not personally believe that the jewish faith is corrupt or that christianity is better or more correct in any way. This is my understanding of the historical christian perspective. Also, I am not comparing Ron Paul to Jesus. That is simply an artifact of the analogy.

I think there are two issues at play, though.  One is rights and the other is suffering.

Furthermore, eating meat is not justified simply because other animals eat it.

I'm not sure that the whales you mention have the enough of a cognitive capacity, either, to qualify as recipients of these rights, so, again, they would be exempt.

As for me, it's not about rights, clearly.  I do feel that animals can experience suffering, and if I can, I should lessen the suffering of those animals, just as I should lessen any suffering I can.  If it comes down to my survival, I will eat meat.  But I have the luxury of being in a position to not do so and still be healthy.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; I actually think he meant ""charging for the process of developing the software"". To my knowledge the GPL only works in advantage of library/framework developers with dual-licensing. 

Dual-licensing is one approach, but so are services: look at Red Hat and IBM. Both are profitable, and Red Hat just had better than expected posted results (their market cap is about to/has/is very close to bypassing Sun's -- truly the end of an era).

&gt; My only quarrel is the apparent unwillingness to accept commercial (closed-source) software which is necessary for end-application commerce.

If you rewrite this to mean that mean there is apparent unwillingness to accept proprietary shrink-wrapped software, then yet, you'd be correct. But nobody would say that IBM and especially Red Hat are not commercial enterprises. They charge for as much as they can get away with, and that's okay -- especially by the FSF, who knows that some money is necessary to grow the cause of Free software.

&gt;Sec. 7. Military Commissions.  The Secretary of Defense shall immediately take steps sufficient to ensure that during the pendency of the Review described in section 4 of this order, no charges are sworn, or referred to a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the Rules for Military Commissions, and that all proceedings of such military commissions to which charges have been referred but in which no judgment has been rendered, and all proceedings pending in the United States Court of Military Commission Review, are halted.

So, the Secretary of Defense has orders.  He directed all the various military lawyers prosecuting these cases to request that they be adjourned for 120 days.  Generally if the PROSECUTION requests that things no longer go forward, the judge is apt to honor that request.  One piss-ant judge, trying to embarrass Obama, declined to play ball.  The judge isn't defying Obama because Obama hasn't asked him anything; rather the prosecution lawyers have asked him something.

Now, the Secretary of Defense is going to be annoyed.  He will likely put in a call to this guy's boss and fix his wagon.  (There's a slight pretense that military judges are somehow independent of the military chain of command, but only slight.)  My guess is the prosecution lawyers will go and ask AGAIN for a delay, and this time it will be granted.

"technology","t5_2qh16","you know, my dad has a saturn LS.  he gets 42 miles per gallon, no joke.  he does about 40/60 city/highway driving and logs a LOT of miles with his 1 hr / day commute.


this older car is amazing.  i think its the 2001 version.


1: its plastic paneling, so when he hit a deer there was no damage other than a smudge.  he hit the deer at 35 mph.


2: the undernethers of the car are almost all stainless steel, so he has never had to worry about rot.  he keeps his car in good condition and can perform not only routine matainence but also very large repairs (heads, etc).  


3: its a stickshift, so a little more efficency there.


4: he drives conservatively.  not like an old person, but he doesn't race the engine in accelerations etc.


hes amazed that he actually gets the milage he does.  he was so impressed with this car, he bought the exact same model for my sister, a grad student at SUNY geneseo.  she drives like him and gets 43 mpg (her car is slightly newer).


the only thing he's had to major repair wise was a total brake replacement, the pads were inexpensive and he did it himself.  new spark plug wires... oil changes, and thats it.  this car is amazing cheap to run.


he tells me that he can't understand why now, eight years later, we haven't built cars that can vastly outperform this 8 year old saturn LS.  its old and has an older computer.  sure its in great condition, looks brand new, but still not a newer car.  42mpg i kid you not.  i learned how to drive on this car and know it in and out.


with technology like this 8 years in the past, it seems like these days 42 should be STANDARD mpg, not exceptional.  we think there is some sort of conspiracy to keep miles per gallon low in cars so the oil companies make more money.  and when i say ""we"" i mean ""me"".


seriously tho, if you want an inexpensive car that is extremely reliable, take a look at the saturn LS.  you can grab one for about 9k now with low milage.  these cars are amazing.


[edit] sorry about the ramble.  i wish more people could get 42 mpg.  i get 38 in my kia sephia. we are a practical family.  i dont know, all my friends have pontiacs or camrys or stuff like that and they are happy when they get high 20s MPGs.  i dont understand... it seems like we would have much more effiecent vehicles.  the technology clearly exists, because these LSs are nice...

Nobody likes to complicate their life. It's even harder to do it if you don't even know that such change will be in the future.

It's my profession. The API, environment variables, etc are there. Have you ever set your PC up with non-standard folders, and had some app create the old ""C:\Documents and Settings\user\My Documents\"" folder anyway? That's a sign the app dev took the ""easy"" way instead of the right way.

At the very least following design docs means your application will behave like every other (standard) windows application.

Had folks followed them the prompting wouldn't be an issue.

&gt;As long as things that programmers used weren't marked as deprecated I wouldn't blame programmers.

It's an issue of there being multiple ways of doing something, and not choosing the right way.

e.g. Tables vs CSS for layouts would be a more popular comparison. Tables are easier and get the job done, but they are not the right way.

&gt;Those apps that would not work were most likely written before windows 2000 (no permissions). Especially in corporate environments users use restricted accounts so the programs never get the permissions, yet they work ok. Adding ""always deny"" to the dialog perhaps could force vendors to make sure the program can work in restricted environment.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The way I see it, if you were to summon a time traveller, it's have to go down one of a few ways.

Firstly, the note in the safe dry place.

This note must be, in your mind and the minds of others, the most important scrap of paper/parchment they've ever laid eyes on. It's going to sit in one spot for whatever number of centuries it'll take for human's to make time travel economically palpable for the average citizen of earth.

The note must contain GPS coordinates, the current universal time and the date in every freaking calendar you can find (preferably not Mayan).

The note has to be concise, well written and above all, convincing, so you're going to want to lie your ass off.

You're a brooding millionaire, your name is Rupert Trump, you have antiquities of all shapes and sizes, many womens and much plunder. Remember, time travelers are known to talk like pirates.

If the time travelers do not arrive immediately, do not lose heart, you are still in a paradox zone, and the travelers will understand this, without the immediate payoff, many, if all summoners will give up, often tearing up or throwing away their notes. Your time travelers should arrive in 2-3 days of having written the note.

The second method is a bit more simple, but far harder to pull off.

The theory is that if a great enough congregation of people takes place, it will be so memorable that time travelers will not be able to resist visiting.

Who knows how many people from the future were there for Hitler's inauguration, or how many were in that crowd watching Kennedy get shot, although it's far more likely they'd be back in pre-history, watching dinosaurs battle for mating rights.

All this aside, to amplify this time-traveler summoning effect, your congregation can be for that exact purpose, a time travelers day, concerts, benefit gigs, crazy costumes and free love. *If enough people get together with the aim of summoning a time traveler, one will come*.

But take my words with a grain of salt, these techniques make a few assumptions about the future of our race.

Firstly, we may blow ourselves up LONG before we invent time travel

Secondly, Time travel may just not be possible

Thirdly, these future people have to want to come back, who's to say that anyone from the future gives a rat's ass what a bunch of steel cave dwelling barbarians want.

Lastly, who's to say that what comes back will be friendly, or in any form we can recognize... ","1233450686"

We, as humans, get reproduction started, but God is the one who finishes it. He is like the engineer and draws the genetic blueprints. The way I see it, anyone who tries to clone people is stealing what belongs to God. Do you know what I mean?

To me cloning is scientists way of creating life and trying to imitate God in an attempt to prove there is no God. Cloning humans is stupid, and I highly doubt God would give a human clone a soul, because a human clone would be made by man and would not be a child of God.

If you were to clone a human, would he have a soul? That is my question and I think it valid. No matter what you call it, humans have a ""quality"" that other animals do not have. I call it a soul. Could a cloned human have that?
Creating beings is the work of God. Creating things to make life better is the work of man (as is, unfortunately, creating chaos to make life harder)


It is a hard question I know. I guess my thought is that we already have more people in the world that our resources can really handle (some people live in famine and extreme poverty). Why do we want to add more people to the mix? Why do we want to clone ourselves when we can ""breed"" and make more people naturally. I suppose I would think the question had more merit if all of a sudden no one could reproduce but we can so. China only allows one child per family they are so overwhelmed with people. Why is it necessary to want to clone people?


Besides, any thing that is designed for a good reason can be used for a bad one and I can see cloning being used in a very wrong way. I mean if we could clone, someone would decide to clone a little army of suicide bombers, humans that do not matter and are raised for slaughter, for example ( I know that is extreme but that came to mind).","1233450737"

To talk and to argue about god is meaningless, to have an active opinion as to its existence, then, is somewhat ridiculous.

Canada sprung up with people who had very different Christian perspectives, which in many places would've had them at eachother's throats.

In the case of Rush, the audience consists generally of anti-intellectuals, blatant racists, anti-science advocates, homophobic/xenophobic trash.  If not that, then the generally uneducated public.  These types generally **do not** approach things with skepticism, and take what Rush is saying to be quite literal.

To see if the other party has any intention of working towards peace.

&gt;Because people like you hate Jews and Israel and would use any excuse to hate them.

Israel has never needed an excuse to kill their neighbors. They have done so continuously for the last forty years.

On average they kill anywhere from 600 to 800 palestenians every year.  That's an average family every day.

On special occasions they go on a rampage and they commit massacres killing hundreds or a thousand in a few weeks.

Of course there is also the matter of stealing land every day. 

That's what israel does. It's what they have always done. It's what they will always do.

That's the kind of a country they are, that's their culture, that's their religion.

Oddly enough I'm watching the Baby Mammoth documentary RIGHT now so I'm going to pretend to be an expert :-P

Cloning an animal from DNA that has been frozen for more than 20k years is going to difficult and is still a significant milestone.


The Ibex being cloned, while AWESOME, is a long way away from cloning a full mammoth.

When frozen for long period of time the DNA basically fragments which means that you have to re-splice the DNA together with algorithms for finding intact sub-sequences.

Combine that bacterial DNA and it becomes an interesting challenge.

I actually personally believe that all these issues are totally surmountable and one day expect to see a mammoth in person.

It would be an amazingly accomplishment.

Right up there with man landing on the moon.  Bringing back an extinct Mammoth or Thylacine would be an amazing accomplishment.

Also, check out this video of a Thylacine from youtube:

Although this does cheat the theory of natural selection since the fittest did not survive and are being brought back by humans, the ability to bring back extinct species would be a pinnacle in our scientific achievements. The only way a human can get into the mix is if we can reproduce certain body parts that are identical to the one already possessed by the sick person, eliminating the need for such things as cyclosporin and giving people with a mortal disease another chance at life without the possibility of their body rejecting the donated organ (since it would technically be their own.)

All I'm saying is that I dont think they should have renamed it RfaT just because they used different instruments to play the song.

You should check out Jacques Ellul's Anarchy and Christianity (and/or the Subversion of Christianity). Ellul thinks that Christ's message is much more radical than it is generally received. He argues, that Christ not only rendered notions of hell obsolete (i.e. conquering death, etc.) but also rendered religion itself obsolete, which, oddly enough, makes sense in light of all his crazy anti-establishment statements.

Some scripts come with instructions like ""using your ftp client or shell access, chmod the script to make it world writable"".  I've had several clients upload something and not know how to make it executable or writable.  Some have FTP access only and aren't aware of the ftp client's ability to do these things.

Awesome question.  The war on drugs does not deny people access to harmful substances.  People have access to PCP, meth, and god knows what else at this very second through the black market.  So arguing that the war on drugs keeps us safe from PCP users is erroneous.   The only thing that the war on drugs does is prevents our society from regulating and controlling the PCP supply. 

Now let me twist your argument a little bit.  Right now we have a situation where we have violent criminal elements making massive profits off illegal substances and are killing people all across the country to protect their market.  We have addicts who resort to crime after wasting their life savings so that they can feed a habit and buy narcotics that should cost no more than a cup of coffee.  Medical patients are being deprived of their right to self medicate.  Children across the country in junior high schools and high schools find it easier to buy marijuana or meth than cigarettes or alcohol.  We have a militarized police forces trampling over individual civil liberties to protect us from “drugs.”  We have a justice system clogged with non-violent drug related offenses.  And that’s not even bringing up the horrible social costs this war has on south American countries.  So I don’t know, you tell me, does the war still make sense?   

Things won’t be perfect if we end this war.  But I personally feel the cure for these drugs is far worse than the disease.

In Brookhaven national lab, we have a little body of organized students, in which, once a week, we organize a little gathering of students. We attract them with a bit of food, so the graduate students can chat and share their experiences while munching on a little bit of something. The chinese, (all of them!) invariably go straight to the food, sometime stuffing Tupperware boxes (!), and leave all at once without interacting with other students. It's mind buggling.

One night, I organized a Thanksgiving diner there. We were expected about 100 students. We knew we had a lot of Chinese coming. So I have made pecking ducks adjacent to the more western Turkey in order to give these Chinese students, far away from home, a little taste of home. They arrived at once. Went on the ducks like a cloud of starving locusts.

First of all, this is a fucking podcast and therefore its not pre-composed, edited, etc. I've only read the transcript, but in there Joel clearly says ""I'm going to get such flame mail for this because I'm not expressing it that well"", which pretty much highlights the informality of this whole discussion. Taking potshots at these guys for things they're trying to ad lib is pretty fucking cheap IMO.

But besides that, there's a clear exaggeration of what they're saying in this follow up, and even this weird bipolar acknowledgement of that exaggeration.

"reddit.com","t5_6"," You are committing the classic [True Scottsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) fallacy.

 The problem is that we don't have the luxury of conducting a world scale thousand-trillion dollar experiment to verify your claims or the claims of the other side.

 However, I contend, in counter to your statement, that there is *nothing* a-priori which proves or guarantees that free-markets would work if only they were left entirely unfettered.

 And the moment free-market zealots recognize that free-markets are an ideology, just like communism, the better we will be as a humans on this planet because we will be able to re-enter a rational, sober and nuanced debate as to what the world market should be like.

 For some reason, free-marketists are convinced that an exorbitantly complex system, so complex that we can not possibly come near to understanding it properly, should have built in a mechanism, an energy phase diagram which just happens to settle in a stable equilibrium. Need I remind you that we are surrounded by systems which *do not* settle into equilibriums. 

 This also comes in with the [naturalistic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy#Appeal_to_nature)  which is to look around you, notice that most things (like atomic nuclei, weather paterns, life forms, pendulums etc.) *are* in equilibrium states, and then assert that this is the more probable outcome of any system, all the while completely missing the glaring fact that systems which do *not* come to an equilibrium rarely ever stick around to be recognized (like satellites which either smash into earth, or break free of its gravitational pull, in fact great care has to be taken to adjust satellite orbits so they stay in an equilibrium state).

 All in all, the bottom line is that, to many, free-markets were just as much a (failed) experiment as was communism - and the irony here is that there is no lack of people (e.g. the menscheviks among others) who would argue that *true* communism never happened. And the onus remains squarely on free-market apologists to prove their claims *somehow* (is it even possible?), and stop pretending that this is the way nature meant it, so they shouldn't have to prove themselves.","1233452757"

Yeah it was a serious question.  Why, because I thought FOX was just as guilty as all the left-wing media outlets in their coverage of this incident.  I figured I may have missed something in this whole incident where FOX called everyone out on their bullshit, I have seen FOX do honest reporting before.  That was why the question was posed.

I interpreted it as a total failure of the media, not a left vs right thing.  Additionally, this sort of failure isn't even specific to that case.  The modern media makes all sorts of failures to do even the slightest bit of real reporting, regardless of political leaning.

FYI, I don't give a shit about this whole left vs right argument, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something I missed during that whole incident that linked it specifically to a left leaning political ideology.

The first is a credit collapse taking the credit card companies with them.  If they cannot get cardholder's debt underwritten with bonds, they cannot offer it.  Personal checks would shortly follow, with either banks canceling checking accounts or retailers refusing them.  This leaves debit and cash.  Savings banks would quickly have ""paper runs"", which the government could not quickly resupply.

So with serious deflation or paper runs, the $1000 could buy a lot more than $1000 worth of merchandise and service.  And with inflation, and possibly still a paper run, you could spend it quickly, unlike if there is a ""bank holiday"".","1233452816"

You look at something which you think is bad like eating meat and what's your reaction to this? You don't do it. This is 1st order. A second order reaction would be if you advocated that meat be taxed at higher levels so that people would eat less of it. A third order reaction would take into account people's COUNTER-REACTION to your proposal. On what people would do to avoid or make up for the meat tax.

If someone thinks suburbs are bad, a first order reaction is to not move to the suburbs, or to tell people to not move to the suburbs. A second order reaction is to want to increase property taxes on suburbs to make them more expensive. A third order reaction is to increase GROUND taxes on DOWNTOWN so that slums and abandoned properties downtown get redeveloped into high-rises so that more housing is available AWAY from the suburbs.

First order only affects you and maybe close associates. Second order affects the margins of society. Only third order and higher can ever succeed in manipulating the world. The same for comprehending the world. You're not just a first-order actor, you're a first-order thinker too. Why did you ask these stupid questions about meat? Because you want to examine your BEHAVIOUR. Well, behaviour is first order.

If you were a second-order thinker you would be examining not your behaviour but your values and your presuppositions (does inflicting pain on animals matter? no it does not). If you were a third-order thinker you would be examining your principles and your theories (animals are not moral agents therefore no moral theory can say anything about animals. animals are not going to overthrow us, and butchering animals does not measurably corrupt human beings, therefore there can be no ethical reasons to stop butchering animals).

There's a party game that goes along the lines of ""pick a number in the range of 1 to 10 such that it's 1 less than the average of what everyone picks"". You are the kind of simpleton that would only try to think up of a number without ever accounting for anyone else's reactions, let alone their reaction to your own reaction. You would pick 4 or 5 since they're in the middle between 1 and 10.

My reasons for doing what I do on reddit are complex and numerous, but they are all, every single one, higher order than you're capable of comprehending. The chief among them is 4th order.

4. Reddit-man lives with his mommy, who also signs his name to the checks he gets due to the mental “issues” that keep him from doing anything useful.

5. He was born in a manger.  (Well, actually he just *thinks* he was.  He was born in Arkansas, and has never left the state.)

6. Reddit-man has 16 separate personalities.  Defying the odds, all of them turned out to be clueless, right-wing assholes.

7. Reddit-man has never actually voted... because he can’t read.  He has participated in demonstrations against adult literacy programs in which he could LEARN to read.

8. The truck stop bathroom where he “parties” is also his only source of income.

9. He invents new words.  Today’s words are “posperity” and “racits.”

10. Ten is too high a number for him to understand.  Instead, he says “three threes” and blames Democrats when he gets confused while counting his toes.

11. He believes that “reverse vampires” live inside his left ear.  No... HIS OTHER LEFT!

Any thing else is socialist tax and spending.

He still thinks that the economy is fine, quoting statistics about how the economy grew 1.8% over 2008.

In this case, the center figure is obviously not human, so I'm not sure this is really the uncanny valley.  There is absolutely no question that the middle boy is a robot.

All the same, it does have an eerie feeling to it -- perhaps because it makes us call into question what it really means to be a child.  We see this and it makes us call into question our own souls.  We do not like to think of ourselves as merely mechanisms, but this picture directly compares us to mechanisms, suggesting that a robot boy can be just as human as us.

My biology classes have sufficiently convinced me that we are made out of atoms, molecules, cells, and so forth.  I would describe a human as an organic machine.  You put a bunch of particles together in a configuration that creates a human, and you have just made something that can experience things.  If humanity makes something that can experience things at the same level as itself, could it really say the creation is any less real?

Imagine that the human parents were raised in an age prior to the creation of this robot, but their own children had grown up with it.  What kind of tensions would that create?  I imagine the two kids in the picture feel that the robot is ""one of them,"" and they treat it just as if he was another human friend.  However, I suspect the parents would feel very uncomfortable about the situation.  How would the two human boys feel if their parents treated the robot like a toy, or worse?

Easily one of the most interesting pictures I've seen in a long time.","1233453017"

3. It’s not 47 or 48 cats.  If you include the dead ones, reddit-man actually has 73 cats!  He blames the “Democraps” for not having the dead ones removed.

4. Reddit-man lives with his mommy, who also signs his name to the checks he gets due to the mental “issues” that keep him from doing anything useful.

5. He was born in a manger.  (Well, actually he just *thinks* he was.  He was born in Arkansas, and has never left the state.)

6. Reddit-man has 16 separate personalities.  Defying the odds, all of them turned out to be clueless, right-wing assholes.

7. Reddit-man has never actually voted... because he can’t read.  He has participated in demonstrations against adult literacy programs in which he could LEARN to read.

8. The truck stop bathroom where he “parties” is also his only source of income.

9. He invents new words.  Today’s words are “posperity” and “racits.”

10. Ten is too high a number for him to understand.  Instead, he says “three threes” and blames Democrats when he gets confused while counting his toes.

11. He believes that “reverse vampires” live inside his left ear.  No... HIS OTHER LEFT!

Paul at one point (I don't know where) cited to something like [this](http://pages.prodigy.net/krtq73aa/sock.htm) to explain why he votes agains that stuff.  He is a charitable man (free healthcare to people who can't afford it from his own pocket and effort, not through theft from taxpayer, same with congressional awards for good people, he votes against it and offers to chip in to buy it himself).

He wants to abolish federal control and funding of hospitals.  I think with the VA he is for paying for veterens' care in normal, private, hospitals (since they were employed by the state in such a way that would likely contribute greatly to medical problems, but I am not sure about that).  He doesn't want them to be replaced with church run hospitals, he knows that they will be replaced because people care about that stuff.  He also understands, for better or worse, that they will often be replaced by church run establishments.  Churches happen to be great ways for people to get together and voluntarily be charitable.  Non-churchy folk don't generally do that type of thing in a conspicuous collective manner.  They usually just give to secular-ish charities that may also be donated to by churchy types.  He isn't saying this is necessarily the case, but he does recognize that thats how it worked before.

It is my understanding that you are anti-paul, and more generally anti-liberty because you associate it with selfishness.  That's kind of strange.  Taking from people to have it go to somebody else is not good; it's not even not bad.

The money that is made when the product is sold however, goes primarily to the boss at the very top of the organization.  The workers are left with the minimal amount required for sustenance and do not take part in the fruits of their own labor.

The workers trade their labor for a wage, but the exchange is an unfair one.  Whenever a lopsided trade is made, it's because the side being short-changed has no option but to accept the other side's terms of agreement.  It's like a person stuck on top of his roof as the flood waters rise.  If another guy comes along with a boat and offers him a ride but in exchange for all his worldly possessions, the guy on the roof has no choice but to agree to it or drown.

&gt; It's essentially ""mob rule"".

No, it's not.  It's the mechanism by which this basic problem is corrected.

&gt; force people to pay them for a product they didn't voluntary buy

The tax you pay buys your citizenship in America.  Anyone who disagrees with what price they're charged is free to renounce their citizenship, and many very wealthy people have chosen this option.  Those who do however no longer get to take part in the benefits that citizenship to America has to offer.

I remember the beta for Windows Vista. It barely ran, was incredibly slow, and so annoying I erased it after 15 minutes and never went back.

When they released it MIT rushed us all through a Vista training course before Microsoft even had one out... So we'd all be ready for it.

Two years later we had deployed a total of two computers running Vista. That was because the manager of that department insisted. Our guy recommended skipping it... The people on the other end got so pissed that they complained and almost got our guy in trouble. Yes two years later it is that bad.

Windows 7 runs better than Vista ever did... But thats just because Vista never really came out of the beta phase. Windows 7 is Vista SP3. The whole medoria experiment or whatever.

They figured out what was wrong, fixed it... put a new label on it and released it.

It also helps that about 90% of the time I go to Taiwan for the winter and I also spent 2 months in the summer as well.  Also living the first year of my life in Taiwan probably helped my brain develop chinese (though that's a fun little story about my birth (kinda))

I'm not sure how much you can learn in just a year, if you plan on spending a lot of additional time on your own it could be worthwhile, but if you take it just to take it and don't apply much outside time working to improve it on your own, it might not really amount to much.

Reading/writing is really useful in the future though as all chinese writing is unified, it's just the spoken that differs.

My mom is also on the board for the state for chinese schools and was the principal as well as a teacher at chinese school, so that also helped with my learning.  Though at home we only speak in Mandarin which is also quite useful.  Being forced to speak the language vastly improves how well you learn the language.","1233453538"

From an egoist standpoint it should only matter if this will happen in my lifetime in the place where I live.  I think it's unlikely.  Also, since I'm an American the developing world isn't in a position to do anything to me except drive the price of meat up by increasing global demand.  But I can afford it better than they can, so there's really no problem, especially since meat is one of the few products this country can still produce itself.","1233453729"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The number of dead is not the only way to measure a storm.  However, as of 1/31/09, there are 11 dead in Kentucky from the ice storm.  Katrina left a total of ONE THOUSAND EIGHT-HUNDRED-THIRTY-SIX PEOPLE DEAD, you useless right-wing tool.  Additional thousands were made homeless and many still are homeless or forced to live with friend/relatives.

Also, you apparently have forgotten (or ignored) that:

   1. It took Bush about two days to wake up to the fact that there was ANY problem in New Orleans at all. (He was busy with photo-ops with McCain.)

   2. He had appointed Michael Brown (with no experience with emergencies, but rather, with running a horse association instead) to head up FEMA. This might help explain why FEMA sent shipments of ice through Maine on their way to Louisiana! (There's also the email message from Brown's staff indicating he needed extra time to tear himself away from lunch to work on hundreds of people DROWNING!)

   3. Five of FEMAs to eight administrators had no experience with emergencies.

   4. Under Bush, even three years after Katrina, there is a huge mess in and around New Orleans, proving a lack of commitment, and a lack of any leadership whatsoever on Bush's part.

   5. There was formaldehyde in the FEMA trailers, and Bush did nothing to speed up a solution to that problem, and never even addressed it or gave any kind of answer to thousands who were screaming for help.

   6. Hideous paperwork problems occurred for people seeking help after Katrina. Bush adopted a hands-off, ""you're on your own policy"" that left thousands unable to get help even if they were qualified under the law.

   7. Bush could have at least set a tone for the nation that said, we need to help out. Instead, he set the usual GOP tone: ""Every man for himself!""","1233453946"

Why would reading a text or chanting a mantra build any merit?  The Dalai Lama has suggested that having Buddhist texts on your hard drive could have some effect.  If you put the tripitika on a mirrored RAID with 9 15000 RPM drives, would this create instant mega-merit?  What if you copied a mantra, pasted it twice, then copied it and pasted the new text, then copied and pasted that over and over until you had millions of copies of the mantra entered? 

You can probably tell that while I think that prayer wheels can look neat, they don't really do anything.  I was wondering if there is someone who does think so, and if so what they accomplish and how.  Is there supposed to be some effect of thinking that there is a benefit derived like a placebo or something?  I've heard some people say that it's beneficial since you are supposed to be mindful while doing it, but then the act is irrelevant, you could be mindfully gardening or something and have the same effect.  If you are dedicating the merit to others, then it's sort of cultivating compassion, but it still seems like you'd be better off volunteering at a soup kitchen or a hospice or something and dedicating that merit.","1233453977"

That assumes it's even possible to interpret a  dictionary definition ""literally"" - such definitions require interpretation regardless, since words are defined in terms of other words, and most words have a range of meanings, not all of which are necessarily applicable in a given context.

&gt; They're still governed by the rules of their universe and so remain natural.

That's ridiculous.  They're not natural to us.

A third order reaction would be to evaluate what would be required to make eating meat a good thing, which is the development of vat meat technology.

Taxing meat at higher levels is a second order reaction towards OTHERS' eating meat. And figuring out something that takes into account the fact people won't stop eating meat just because it's more expensive is third order. The first order reaction is to just tell people to eat less meat or to tell them that it's bad. Come to think of it, this is what Sylvan does and it's why I hate him.

WM tethers my mobile's internet connection to my laptop over bluetooth or usb.   I use WMWIFIRouter so I can also turn my phone into the equivalent of a linksys router and share my connection with a room full of friends or strangers -- anywhere.

I can play divx movies, I have access to apps from a dev community that's just as vibrant as apple's dev community.   I can even get pandora and shoutcast streams.  There's even apps that let me stream sirius and XM if I'm already a subscriber.

When I go out for my jogs, I don't have a bright white cord flopping around waiting for a dog or mugger to grab it and make off with my gear, I'm wearing a Motorola SH-H9 wireless headset that's giving me GREAT audio in a unit that's practically invisible.

Harper through Flaherty was careful to put together a budget document that was at least arguably in the public interest and met the broad requirements of public opinion.  

Harper continues his scorched-earth operations to stave off his political death, first nuking his credibility in Quebec, now killing his conservative ideological credentials.  There are a lot of angry conservatives out there.

I think Ignatieff took the sure thing - guaranteed political damage to Harper, rather than take a risk on the GG supporting the coalition.  ","1233454839"

I think the ads should be more ""give up your beliefs"" than ""respect each other. you probably have a good friend who's an atheist, and you don't even know it"". (not that the second one isn't a good message, just not coming from us)

I'm sure we've all been scorned for our beliefs, I know I certainly have. However, if you think to each time you were scorned for being atheists  I'm sure you'll also recall the person scorning you was kind of an idiot and not someone you especially care to impress. 

Besides, compared to other minorities in the US we haven't had it that bad. We want the common people to stop accepting millennial old folklore as fact and adopt reason and logic, not convince them to think ""oh there atheists, but there's nothing wrong with that"". 

It'll just give them one more opportunity to mentally masturbate to the thought of them being a forgiving person ""just like our lord and savior"".

"politics","t5_2cneq","I agree completely, and personally I would like to see us and a few other firms broken up into smaller units.

That being said, until we are broken up, we ARE too big to fail  - the repercussions to the entire economy are simply too great.  And the truth is that you cannot break up the companies in the midst of a financial meltdown.

Allowing Lehman Brothers to fail proved that the really big guys (Citi, Morgan Stanley, Goldman, RBS, Credit Suisse, etc) really are too big to fail.  The economy simply cannot withstand another shock that big (and Lehman was actually pretty small).  The whole economy is so interwoven that if Goldman failed, Morgan and the rest would die immediately due to their losses from holdings in Goldman and the resulting redemptions that would occur (remember that the best banks are still leveraged 10x).  As US firms go bankrupt, foreign investors withdraw from the economy entirely causing runaway inflation (excess supply of dollars, no demand).  The poor begin to starve and riot due to their conditions, meanwhile municipal/state governments start going bankrupt from lost tax revenues (property/employment taxes).  Government can no longer fund social programs and the situation gets progressively worse.  The end result is an overthrown government, civil war, destruction of property, etc.  Many people die.

My feeling is that we're all in this together and we had better all work towards a solution.  As long as firms are too big to fail (which they are!), we need to keep them afloat while working towards reducing their size to a more sustainable one.","1233454919"

The film makers called him and scheduled an interview.  They lied to him about who they were and what they wanted to talk about.  Upon arriving, rather than talking to Collins about how he reconciles science and faith (something that makes sense to ask the head of the group that mapped the human genome) they asked him about a discredited theory about the historicity of Christ.  

Collins gave a layman's response that was fair but not thorough or particularly well researched.  And he came across confused and bumbling, but it had as much to do with his surprise at what was essentially an ambush as it had to do with his lack of knowledge on the issue.

Of course, if Maher had really wanted to explore that concern about Christ, he could have asked a more serious scholar from that arena of Christian scholarship - someone like N.T. Wright - but he didn't.  Even if he had, I suspect he would have asked Wright about evolution rather than the historicity of Christian Scripture.

This practice is basically the same thing that Dawkins pointed out about Expelled.  Stein used the same methods, and acheived the same thing.

There is no difference between the two.  Maher wasn't just ""poking fun"" and he wasn't trying to educate.  Neither was Stein.  They are both hacks.

Do you honestly think Israel has freedom of the press? Why were no reporters allowed in Gaza? Why are they restricted from even being in places outside Gaza that are not in a limited, and distant, location from Gaza?

You will recall that [Hamas was supported by the Israeli government](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-palestine) to split the Palestinian political force.

&gt;It continued to play the old game of divide and rule between rival Palestinian factions. In the late 1980s, Israel had supported the nascent Hamas in order to weaken Fatah, the secular nationalist movement led by Yasser Arafat.

This seems to be a theme that European Israelis introduced to the area - the notion that Europeans have the right to interfere in the affairs of others.

&gt;Israel likes to portray itself as an island of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism. Yet Israel has never in its entire history done anything to promote democracy on the Arab side and has done a great deal to undermine it.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; what Harper did, with the connivance of the former CBC reporter in Rideau Hall, was if not a coup, a total mockery of democracy

Hold on, now.  Prorogation as a political tool is not at all unheard of.  It's use as such in Canadian politics goes back at least to 1828.  Sir Peregrine Maitland prorogued the Upper Canadian assembly in order to free two of his officials from imprisonment by the legislature.  Perhaps not a comparison that would please Mr. Harper, but the point is that prorogation has long been prone to political use.

The Prime Minister's power to prorogue is well-established.  This instance is arguably abuse of the power, but I don't think you are correct to call it a mockery of democracy.  

The GG was asked to prorogue by the head of the Government and she complied as is conventional.  Her duty is to hold but not exercise the reserve powers of the Crown, barring extraordinary circumstances.  I think you can easily make the case that circumstances were not extraordinary enough to justify a denial.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Regardless of the file format no matter what image type you transfer between computers the colors will look different. A standardized RAW format will not change the effects of the color profile of the monitor which is being used to view the file. This includes the same monitor used on identical computers, the colors will look different based on color temperature and calibration differences.

Furthermore one must factor in ambient lighting. Is the monitor under tungsten or fluorescent lights? Is it near a window? If so, what time of day is it outside?

All of these factors affect color and when the file is printed, well that is a whole different array of variables.

If all that wasn't enough for you there is the fact that exposure, saturation, levels, etc are not applied directly to RAW files. These settings are often stored in separate xml files. RAW files are meant to be the raw output of the camera.

If someone is going through the extra steps to control the output of their images it is not very hard to export the RAW files as a TIFF or JPEG before it is sent to someone.

Export as TIFF. RAW issue solved.

My guess is that you're from the US, self-categorize as a liberal, and subscribe to the ideological assumption that bureaucrats work for the public good and are therefore more trustworthy than selfish businesspeople. I would further guess that you discount my first sentence as ""conservative"" ideology along with the assumption that bureaucracy is inefficient, ineffectual, and pernicious to democracy.

If my guesses are correct, my only angle of argument that might get through your ideological filters is this: Go take a look at how government funds are spent now. Look at how well ""big business"" does at getting them, even the funds that you would have expected to go to some ""good cause"".","1233456118"

You continue to argue that programs to pay farmers not to grow is related to soil improvement. This is not true at all. The Dust Bowl had nothing to do with leaving fields fallow. There was a severe drought following years of poor soil management practices, notably no crop rotation, and overplowing. This was due to a lack of knowledge among farmers who did not know what they were doing. Now, we have reliable irrigation in all major agricultural areas in the US, plus knowledge about scientific farming methods is widespread. The money spend on agricultural research into farming methods is well spent, as are USDA funds for regional educational programs. So is infrastructure projects for things which could not be built by farmers but which improve life for millions, such as mega-irrigation systems, and the interstate system. This is money spent for results.

&gt; No, it's not. It's the mechanism by which this basic problem is corrected.

Really? Because our democratic republic has existed for a couple hundred years, and every four years we all think the next government-loving candidate will solve all our problems. I'm still waiting for that to happen. I say we try freedom and liberty for once.

&gt; The tax you pay buys your citizenship in America. Anyone who disagrees with what price they're charged is free to renounce their citizenship

You are missing the point as well. Think about what you're saying. That's completely immoral. You are saying, ""If you don't like that the government forcibly takes your income, then leave the country!"" But wait a minute. Isn't man born free? Free from coercion, free to live where he pleases and free to keep all of the money he earns? What right does government have to forcibly take any amount of the income of /anybody/? The entire system is inherently wrong and goes against man's natural born right to be free.","1233456517"
"TextSalad","t5_2qsd5","&gt;All I can add is that the intention here is to spotlight original content which does not widely receive attention elsewhere...
 
Just to add to this. I think the focus of this reddit should be to judge and vote on content based on the quality and originality of the writing. The way I see it, in most reddits the content is judged based on the subject matter as opposed to the way in which that subject matter is presented. In this reddit the subject matter (ex. sports, music, food...) should be irrelevent. We should be judging written submissions not on what they are about but on what they have to say and how well they say it.
In terms of what content will and will not be appropriate I think we're going to run into some grey area. I think we mainly want submissions of writing by those of us here or there friends and so on. Articles from The Onion probably shouldn't be allowed but other pieces of writing from established writers or publications probably should be, provided that they aren't already all over reddit. We'll have to feel this one out as we go.

&gt;Contributors to TextSalad should be accepted based on a trial basis...

I think if we're going to only let contributors submit we should hand them out pretty freely and then ban people only if they submit the sort of links that we created this thing to avoid. I agree with the branding but I also don't want to be elitist. If someone submits a piece of writing that isn't exceptional but is original I think they should be allowed to have their writing voted and commented on. Most of these writers (including myself) are probably unpublished and I think this should be as much about providing feedback and allowing writers to showcase their work and perfect their craft as it should be about showcasing impeccable content.

&gt;A note on cross-submissions (articles from other reddits): this is fine, provided the submission meets our standards. We obviously prefer exclusivity, but we cannot reasonably expect it.

I think cross-submissions should be completely acceptable until this reddit grows to a few thousand subscribers. We don't want anyone to have to choose whether to submit their content to this small experimental reddit and another large established reddit.","1233456520"

The problem is bailing out failing companies to begin with, allowing them to continue their failed business model with their same old failed management and clogging up the economy in the process.

We're copying the failed strategy of Japan in the 90's instead of the successful strategy that Sweden used to get out of their bank crisis or the (likely to be equally successful) basic free market response. Japan created a whole bunch of zombie firms (that should have been dead, but shambled along on government money for years) and that screwed their economy for at least a decade.

We should either

- Let the banks fail, let bankruptcy laws do their job, and let other companies buy up the pieces.

 - OR -

- Nationalize them and then privatize the pieces that can survive on their own.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Sorry for the long delay in my response...my schedules been a little out of whack.  At any rate, here's my view on some of what you've said:

&gt;I have not read the Quran, so I base my perception of it on it's spokesmen, like the ayatollah from this post, and on it's critics. This is the same way I treat scientific propositions, and I find it to be sound. If it's proponents can't present convincing arguments, then there are probably better ideas to spend my time on.

I can see this working if the subject-matter is lost or hard to get, like say the Gospel according to Jesus and not Mark, Luke, etc. But for a subject that is easily accessible and available, it doesn't seem as the best method.  It likes never going to New York and forming an opinion of it based on what we hear from those who have went to New York have talked and written about it.  It gives us an idea from their perspectives but its not as good as going there.  If I ask: do you like New York? You say no, because I hear the people are rude.  Or someone says marriage is horrible and if asked have you ever been married, he says no but I know people who are married and I base my opinion on what they've said...who's to say that most of those people are not idiots?

Anyways, as for the Ayatullah, I'm going to assume you've only read one article of his (translated, and we know that things get lost in translation) about a very deep topic which requires more research into his views.  If you are interested I can forward you somethings.  In addition, everyone who claims to be a proponent of a cause does not necessarily represent that cause. But I would definitely recommend to anyone to read more of this author's works.

&gt;If someone says that the brightness of every area and locale in the world is an effect of light, and then asks where the brightness of light is from, we immediately say that the brightness of light is a part of its essence. The use of ""it's essence"" is what lead me to write my first post. What does it mean?

What I gather from it is that it is saying that whenever something gets a quality from itself and nothing else contributes to it, then we cannot ask the question who gave it that. For example, he says that light particles get their ability to give light from no one else, rather its a part of their essence. (the basic, real, and invariable nature of a thing or its significant individual feature or features: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/essence)
So when the question is asked who created God? or in other word's who gave Him existence? We say that no one, because His existence is a part of His essence, its His basic nature and a part of His individual features, no one or nothing gave that to him.  
Btw, essence is great word. Just because its ignored in everyday language doesn't take away from the fact that its a good word.

&gt;2:109 Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.
9:29 Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.

1st, the Quran is Arabic and therefore to get the best understanding of it, we'd have to go into its original language. As I stated before and assume that you may agree, things get lost in the translation and all languages are not equal. Some are more technical, some more emotional, etc, etc.  Classical Arabic is a precise language.  I don't want to get into its details, however, not doing so will leave many things ambiguous.  In any case, the translations are to give us an idea of the main points of what it talks about.  The translation of the first verse (2:109) is not bad.  AS for the second one (9:29) it can be translated better: ""Fight against those who disbelieve in God and the last day and do not forbid that which God and His messenger have forbidden and do not follow the religion of truth, from those who have been given the book (meaning people of the book, i.e. Jews, Christians...)until they pay the jizya willingly and are themselves subdued.""  This was a little more exact translation from myself.

At any rate, without going into too much detail, it can be seen from the verses that they are talking about two different groups of the people of the book at two different times and occasions.  The people of that time did not live simply in one large group but consisted of many different tribes.  Even the Jews and Christians had different tribes. Also,the first verse is talking about those ""people of the book"" who believe God and the last day, therefore they have this major belief in common with the Muslims and must be dealt with differently from the ""people of the book"" in the second verse, who are more like the pagans who do not believe in God and the last day.  And according to other verses of the Quran and history, a group of the ""people of the book"" joined forces with the pagans of Arabia to fight against the Muslims, wipe out Islam and kill its prophet.  Surely, such people cannot be forgiven when they are trying to wipe you out, they must be fought against and when they are defeated or if they stop their aggressions, they had to pay the jizya, which is a form of tax for them to pay to the Islamic government of their time.
Certainly, those of the ""people of the book"" who fought against the Muslims of that time and broke their treaties with them, must be treated in one way, and those of them who did not fight and only were a nuisance with their words or interactions with the Muslims must be forgiven.

In whole, Islam is a religion that encourages its followers to forgive ignorant behavior, but also doesn't want its followers to allow themselves to be subjected by others. So if people misbehave, the Muslims are directed to forgive them, but if people attack them, then they were told to fight and protect themselves.  This is a universal right for everyone.

As for the universe, I meant the living creatures, skies, mountains, stars, planets, etc, etc, but even still, that they are assembled with atoms, doesn't change anything.  We accept the big bang, in reality we have verse in the quran which talks about it 14 centuries ago before any scientist...but that's how it started, not who started it.

Laziness as a function of perceived expectations, one might say. The thought occurs that this only happens in the absence of pride taken in the task at hand, and that taking pride in something is contingent on a personal feeling of ownership or at least sufficient participation - it's little wonder that 'modern' company / school / organizational culture fails to ferment this attitude. One cannot expect people to function as machines and expect them to be creative at the same time.

I don't get much opportunity to exercise my brain as most day to day tasks don't require much thought so i've became quite scatterbrainish (if that makes sense) making me feel quite foolish at times. I feel foolish even writing this comment, i mean ok i might feel like im going through a rough spot, but there are thousands if not millions of people world wide who have far far far worse problems than me to deal with, but i often do consider the darkest of thoughts, but 3 things usually change them, firstly i have 2 ferrets and they always cheer me up, they are the maddest cutest i've ever seen (imagine a kitten and a puppy mixed together on caffeine and that's kinda like owning one) secondly playing guitar makes me feel better, i started playing when i was 16 to deal with stress and its pretty much stayed as a good outlet for stress ever since and thirdly I don't want to cause any more stress or be more of a burden to my family, they're already in enough stress financially and with other members of our family, I don't wish to add further unneeded stress to that.

From [Answers.com](http://www.answers.com/topic/jordan-river):

&gt; After the 1967 Arab - Israel War, new issues complicated an already complex situation, since Israel took and occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank of the Jordan. [...] This gave Israel effective control over the Jordan River, preventing water diversion downstream by either Jordanians or Palestinians.

Your say that we don't really have any clue *what* consciousness is, but you also express with certainty that it can only exist in something biological in origin.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Squeak is a language, as well as an implementation. You cannot separate the two.

I'm not disputing that large systems _have_ been written in Squeak and Smalltalk. What I question is the sanity of people doing so.

The language has no module system, and this can cause name clashes. For example, Seaside has to prefix every one of its class names with WA; if they simply defined a class named Component, it would clash with someone else. Libraries also frequently add selectors to existing classes, and this ""monkey patching"" can cause problems too. The language is also very dynamic, and too many errors can only be caught at run-time.

The implementation is not very robust either. There's no way to rebuild a Squeak image from source, people just hack on the current image. This makes it hard to make major changes to the system. Performance suffers from the bytecode interpreter and simplistic GC. The VM is written in ""Slang"", which is a really bizarre C-like language with Smalltalk syntax which doesn't even have _structs_. The Squeak VM is practically unmaintained.","1233457601"
"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","Well, it seems fairly common sense, from the right perspective.  From a pragmatic standpoint, consciousness is the ability to do the things we can do.  To love, hurt, feel pleasure.  Perhaps more importantly, to think, reason, wonder.  If we can make a machine that can do all those things, who are we to call it a liar?  

We ourselves are just machines.  Particularly complicated machines, sure, but machines.  Our brains don't contain any magic.  Just incredibly intricate interactions of molecules (or, on a higher level, cells; on an even higher level, neural patterns).  

If you built a human-equivalent neural pattern in a computer, it would be as much a sentient being as we are.  We ourselves are nothing more than a ""mathematical abstraction"" run on a squishy, damp computer.  Once you get above the messy level of cells and synapses (or transistors, as the case may be), the activity would look pretty much the same.  The same cascades of neurological activity, the same rushes of emotional chemicals, the same node behaviors.  There is a very easy way of telling whether those patterns exist, and that is either by observing the high level mechanics of the simulation, or by just asking it questions.  If it responds like a sentient person one hundred percent of the time, who are we to deny it that status?  

Basically, it comes down to this.  If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, even if it's all machinery underneath the feathers, it's still close enough to a duck for everyone but the philosophers.   

Alternatively, think of it this way""

As far as the tricks go, there is no way a real helicopter could do that because the forces required would tear it apart. It might be possible with a small model such as this though. The times when it instantly changes direction and speeds off amazingly fast would take an incredible amount of force that I don't think is possible with the small engine and blades used on the model.

This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. 

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.

&gt;A common form of subsidy is via a tax break. This is a reduction in the normal rate of a particular class of taxes targeted towards an individual or group of companies. Often this is described as ""corporate welfare"", although that term is also used as a blanket term for all other forms of subsidies. Larger companies who are planning to open a new factory, for example, shop around for a location which will provide them with the biggest tax breaks in a process called a race to the bottom. Locations provide these tax breaks because they often feel that the benefits of job creation will more than offset the decline in tax revenues. Governments of all levels may do this to encourage employment in under-developed areas. Subsidies are given as protection to smaller producers to help them compete with larger companies, to help correct international trade imbalances, to aid industry deemed critical to national security, and to help industry compete with other countries—due to subsidies being common practice throughout the world.","1233457677"

"programming","t5_2fwo","The reason why the Ruby’s core documentation is so lacking or in some cases simply nonexistent has nothing to do with Ruby’s culture and everything to do with the fact that AFAIK nobody from the Japanese Ruby core group speaks English very well. I would even go as far to as to say that their English is very bad. It is **not** their fault and there is very little that they can reasonably do about it.


Now I’d guess that the majority of developers have no idea how difficult and time consuming it is to write in one’s non native language (in case you wouldn’t have guessed: it is really, really hard). The Ruby core dev team has basically two options: write docs in Japanese or write almost nothing at all. Since writing documentation in Japanese would be of little use for the Ruby community as a whole (I’d also guess the core guys would consider this to be very rude/unfair to the rest of us), what logically follows is what we have now: no docs for Ruby.


Everybody knows that Ruby documentation sucks, the problems is that almost nobody seems to understand **why** it so. The problem is also amplified by the fact that the core devs can’t solve the problem by themselves are to shy/modest to ask for help from the western community.

"howto","t5_2qh69","I'm guessing that the flammable stuff vaporizes in the tire. This leaves a bunch of air and flammable vapor inside the tire. When that stuff is lit, there's basically an explosion inside the tire, which pushes the sidewalls outward and seats the tire on the rim.

You have to get the air hose on the tire fast. Right after the explosion, all the hot gasses start to cool down and contract, and the tire might suck itself back off the rim if you don't pressurize it quickly.

Seems to me it'd be hard to precisely control the force of the explosion. So I'd only do this if you had no other way to fix the tire. If the explosion is too strong, it could blow holes in the tire or even blow the tire entirely off the rim. Or just weaken the tire enough so that it'll fail unexpectedly, 50 miles down the road.","1233458147"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I've always thought that if we could start over, using base 12 would have huge advantages. You could have halves, thirds and quarters (as well as sixths, but they aren't as useful), written with a finite decimal expansion. The next best number after 12 for this regard would be 60, since with that you also get fifths. 

Note that I believe having lower roots is more useful than higher roots. Hence 14 (7 * 2) would be less useful than 10 (5 * 2). 

&gt; Also, in computer languages, the minimal rx value has a place in storage space and memory, but for real world applications, reducing numbers to three symbols doesn't save us effort, since it is easy to remember 5, 10, or 12 symbols.

For humans, the magic number seems to be 7 ""things"". Eg, quickly count how many a's are in the following lines:

a a a 

a a a a a a

a a a a a a a a

a a a a a a a 

a a a a a a a a a a

Most people are able to instantly count groups up to about 7. Same with memorization, we can memorize about 7 digits, but then it becomes much harder. For example, I can memorize 7933452 with just one look, however 144782990113 is a lot harder.

Also, it doesn't matter how many combinations the digits have, it always seems to be seven or so *digits*. Eg memorizing  101100111000000111000000 is more difficult than memorizing B381C0 even thought they are the same number.

The main problem of too many digits would probably come from having to learn the multiplication timestables. b12 has 144 combinations, while b60 would have 3600 combinations. ","1233458295"

I work in SJIS, EUC_JP, ISO-2022-JP, UTF-8 each day, and while I agree that Unicode/UTF-8 is the best way when you need to be able to switch between languages, the number of apps where that actually happens meaningfully and as anything more than a luxury for the users of the application is fairly low.

The majority of japanese companies I've done contract work for bitch when you suggest using unicode / UTF-8, because of:

* space requirements sometimes multiplying by as much as 5 times
* incompatibility with huge swathes of legacy software
* unsupported gai-moji (characters not in the unicode set)
* the fact that the number of people accessing the system in anything other than japanese is likely so insignificant that the benefits of multi-lingual support are outweighed by the cost

None of these things are important to a non-japanese speaker, but most of these represent reductions in usability and functionality for japanese users, so even if it is *a* solution, it's far from a good one from their perspective. 

EDIT: forgot to mention that mobile phones use Shift_JIS, which means everyone is addicted to gai-moji. Until unicode address that problem, it will never be more than just one of the alternatives.","1233458547"

I don't think the history is irrelevant generally, I'm just saying that you cannot justify modern aggression based on things that happened decades ago. 

The IDF has killed more civilians, but let's keep a few things in mind. First, Israel spends a great amount of money and time protecting its civilians. Hamas doesn't try in any way shape or form to protect its civilians and in fact encourages them to kill themselves. Militant Islam is essentially death worship. People who literally worship the idea of death are far less likely to take measures to protect themselves. Second, hamas and other palestinians groups have always tried PRIMARILY to kill jewish/israeli civilians, whereas israel has always tried PRIMARILY to kill members of the terrorist groups. Third, since many of the terrorists are not in any government, they are essentially civilians, therefore, Israel could kill serious terrorists and technically would still be killing civilians.

Guilliani, as one of his last acts in office, put forth a proposal to build two retractable roof stadiums for both teams at city expense.  Luckily it was backed out of by Bloomberg, but at a contractual expense.

And this is from a season ticket holding Yankees fan.

I can't stand the extortion on this level: NBA, NFL, and MLB teams all make a huge amount of money.  The primary instrument in making that money is their home stadium; in no other business on this scale does the government pay the whole price for such a basic capital instrument for a private company.  IMHO (and I actually like the idea), if a team wants to sell itself as a ""public good"" for a city, the city should receive a large percentage of ownership of the team in return.  Not only does it firmly root the team in said city, it means they get a share of profits as well.  Of course, the other owners in all leagues would never allow such a thing.","1233458730"

"technology","t5_2qh16","If you actually read how the SDK is supposed to work it's really innovative. Apple's original cop-out was literally little more than the ability to handle a half dozen iPhone specific meta tags for an otherwise ordinary web page. No local storage, no access to the phone's hardware, non-native execution. 

Palm's approach lets you write apps in HTML, Javascript, CSS that are downloaded to the device and can communicate with any of the hardware with JSON formatted HTTP requests. So you can request for accelerometer data, GPS location, a camera widget. It also lets apps play media.

It's really a completely different design from Apple's 'no SDK' strategy. This is what Microsoft feared from Netscape. An OS (i.e. windowed desktop) that is just a web browser. I would like to see this paradigm extended to desktops, laptops, and netbooks.

There aren't many apps that really need to use the bare metal anymore. For them there is always the option to just write a native plugin or extension just like we do today with web browsers. 

Now there is a problem with the Palm Pre in my opinion which has been echoed elsewhere. The Pre has some serious hardware horsepower. OMAP3 is no joke. The Open Pandora project uses it and their device can emulate Playstation games faster than real-time. But the Pre also has a user replaceable battery. Which means the battery does not fill the entire cavity of the device. Also the Pre's software is rushed, which probably means it's undergoing rapid development with stress testing kept to a minimum. Those all add up to one thing: The battery life is going to be poor. The software isn't stable so it isn't optimized for power consumption. The battery is smaller than it could be. The CPU is ultra powerful. And the nail in the coffin: We are talking about parsing Javascript, CSS, HTML and XML along with a practically free web service bridge. That means lots of processing overhead and lots of network activity == deader than dead battery.

That said, the Pre looks promising enough to be worth carrying around a spare battery. ","1233458865"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I would agree with you there. But it goes further than that. When Palestinians were in Jordan that were told, “Just stay put for a bit until we get rid of these Jews, then you can go back home."" And the Arab armies failed to get rid of the Jews, also these were the refugees who chose to leave in order to *facilitate* the de-Jewification of Palestine. So they're a self-selected group not unlike Arabs living in new Israel. Most Arabs who left the area refused to return so long as there are still Jews there. 

So they hang, in Jordan. Jordan, after the Six-Day War (that's what the Six-Day War was, this initial invasion of Israel by all its neighbors) and then Jordan decides to hunker down for a while. They still hate the new Jewish state, but they figure they'll put up with the refugees for a while. But really, the refugee camp conditions are udder shit, mostly because they were never meant to last more than a week or two.

The Palestinians  start screaming that the Jordanians are abusing them and treating them like dirt, while the Jordanians are like, ""Hey, we're giving you land, and we're buying you food and water without anything in return. So fuck you.""

Enter Arafat, Arafat rose to power and became the good cop to the King of Jordan, He asks for more political power and prestige in order to help integrate the Palestinians into Jordanian society. ""Because, you know, if you DON'T give me this power, then, well, my people will continue to be angry, and you don't like them when they're angry.""
So yaddah yaddah, King Abdullah of Jordan appoints Arafat to a super-high cabinet post. Arafat gets control over massive regional centralized economic matters. Water distribution, electricity, job allocation, sewer and garbage lines... like, all the things that it takes to keep a civilization running.  And, of course, his own official paramilitary force **(LOL)** 

This is all in *Jordan*, keep in mind. This is all what Arafat was doing BEFORE yours and my lifetime, when he was pulling shit in Israel. This is back when the Palis were living among fellow Arabs. So Arafat basically has his own quasi-independent government inside Jordan. King Abdullah doesn't like it, but he figures it's the price he has to pay for being dumb enough to set up those refugee camps in the first place and participate in that failed initial attack on Jerusalem

Well, long story short, Arafat's paramilitary tries to assassinate King Abdullah. If it had succeeded Arafat would of became the de facto leader of Jordan (To be fair, I don't remember if it flat-out failed, or if he succeeded in killing Abdullah but his son, Abdullah II, managed to take over in time. I don’t fuckin’ know.) The bottom line is Palestinians weren’t welcome there anymore and he kicked out every last one of them on pain of death. They're like, ""Where are we supposed to go!?"" He's like, ""Not my fucking problem anymore.""
Well, Israel had recently won a war with Jordan over the West Bank and with Egypt over the Gaza Strip.  Basically the pattern to both these wars was the same. The Arab govt was using the land in question to stage attacks against Israel. Israel seized the land to deprive the enemy of a continued staging-ground for further attacks.

So now you know why, of all their neighbors, Israel has the best relationship with Jordan, and second-best with Egypt. Jordan especially because they had to deal with the same bullshit Israel eventually had to deal with (Palestinian aggression), and Egypt because they were pushed to accept coexistence or risk total destruction.

I think maybe you're coming from the standpoint of wanting food-based fuels to be a good idea, not objectively asking yourself what the implications are.

And fuel efficiency? Per capita fuel consumption has increased steadily, with the exception of the last year and a half. The amount of fuel we consume doesn't decrease when we become more fuel efficient - the number of miles we drive increases. I know it's weird, but that's why sprawl happens.","1233458985"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ok, I ackowledge being a bit glib with the historical issues, my main point is that today the concept of farm subsidies (the ones where fields are paid to be kept fallow as opposed to the base rate guaranteed by the federal government) have support because it is recongnized that fields need to be fallow.  If I'm wrong about this, please let me know - as a fairly environmentaly active voter, this is how I've come to understand the issue, and why I support payments for no growth (even if the actual reason they pass is economic and not environmental.)


It would be nicer if the system were based entirely on good science and economics instead of lobbying.  There are two systems that I'm conflating into one in my posts, the New Deal programs of FDR and the modern programs started under (I think) Nixon with lobbying from big corn.  But both pay farmers for fallow their fields, and also help (to some extent) alleviate the issues with cyclic prices.

Modern (or more often, returning to old) knowledge does help.  Crop rotation helps (it is quite common among produce farmers in california), but it is not feasible in the current system that ADM/etc have lobbied to create, where we are so dependent on corn / wheat / soybeans monocultures over large fields.  It would be nice if we could change that (which is the heart of many of our problems), but in the short term, the provisions allowing the fallowing of fields is of crucial importance to helping the soil - or so I understand.  Again, please educate me if this is not the case.

It's possible i'm getting some terminology wrong.  The farm I work at occasionally uses crop rotation, and when a field gets planted over with clover for a season (which I think fixes the nitrogen), it is my understanding that it is called going fallow.  Now, if produce were treated the way corn is, the farm would not be taking a hit by doing that, and since it helps the long term soil value, paying them not to grow would benefit everyone.  Instead, they have to charge a little more than their competition, who does not fallow fields or follow best farming practices.

A quick question, since you seem to know a lot about it.  Despite all the knowledge we have about best-farming practices, most farms continue to produce food in manners that are environmentally devstating, and will lead to long term loss of soil.  So I sort of feel that this idea that modern science and kowledge will prevent us from preventing mistakes of the past is not borne out by observing current practices.

A friend of mine once had to get back from Europe to the US fast -- he was psychologically in trouble, and insisted on selling me his suitcase-o-guns for about $750.  It was worth about three times that; I gave him the cash, and told him that if he ever wants it back, I'd consider it a more-or-less permanent loan.

He returned to California and topped himself, RIP.  Ironically, with a handgun.  I was left with the weapons.

I've refused to sell them, as he made clear he'd wanted me to have them; when his (psychologically also broken) widow asked for them back, I gave her all but the guns that made up the value of the money I'd lent him; before leaving, he'd explained to me which guns she'd favored -- she got all of those.  I have been shooting his handguns out of a weird sense of memory ever since.

I've seen similar things with a set of antique Italian motorcycles and a ~$25k loan.  Always get collateral.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","I agree and would go further to say America isn't even really ready for that. The anti-Marxist propaganda we are working against in America is ingrained into the peoples ideology.

In many ways, its just an opposition to the word, without any consideration of methodology or ideology. In another way it is against socialism itself, but only in an ignorant dogmatic sort of way.

When I talk to people about social problems and their solutions, I get a lot of agreement. Of course, the observations I make are ones that I can only see because of the Marxist viewpoint I am looking from. The solutions I propose are Marxist. As long as I don't tell people outright they are Marxist, I don't get objection with few exceptions. If I tell them outright that my criticism is of a Marxist nature, as is my proposed solution, I don't usually get objection, but I do get cautious agreement.

It's weird. You aren't talking to people with an open mind when it comes to politics and that is true anywhere you go. You have to breach a barrier. I just don't think that barrier is ready to be collectively breached. At least not yet. Ask me again in five years.","1233459186"
"science","t5_mouw","Well, consider that ""natural selection"" is merely a theory.  Theories don't exist by themselves, but only in the minds of curious and conflicted humans... if we had no theory to model what we observe, I have to assume that reality and nature would still go on unaffected.

So it's easy to see that by simply having a theory named ""natural selection"" we have fallaciously implied that some form of ""unnatural selection"" must simultaneously exist.

But it seems to me that ""unnatural selection"" would have to be a like theory - and it would require supporting empirical evidence of the kind that gives ""natural selection"" its substance and its authority in science.  I know of no such theories.

So I think the dichotomy comes from religion (meaning that some religions arguably describe a form of ""unnatural"" selection).  It should be noted, though, that natural selection has been accepted as a well grounded and supported scientific theory by religions like Catholic Christianity among others.

It's also conceivable that humans could one day create their own species, or even a unique form of life that doesn't occur anywhere else in nature... while I wouldn't argue that this is necessarily ""unnatural"", I think in that case natural selection would become a less-important component of a different paradigm, one by which we as humans are the ""selectors"" instead of nature (I initially likened us to ""deciders"" like George Bush, but was chastened in protest).","1233459187"

&gt; A day after Obama appointed Richard Holbrooke as special US envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, two strikes by the US drones in South and North Waziristan agencies left 21 killed, many of them civilians, as claimed by Pakistan. The attacks were the latest in a series of more than 30 drone attacks since the middle of last year, which Pakistanis say are attacks on their sovereignty.
&gt;
&gt; A press release issued by the Pakistani foreign ministry soon after the recent attacks said: “With the advent of the new US administration, it is Pakistan’s sincere hope that the US will review its policy and adopt a more holistic and integrated approach toward dealing with the issue of terrorism and extremism. We maintain that these attacks are counterproductive and should be discontinued.”","1233459387"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Might be interesting to always have that ""leftover"" value of a trit sitting there mocking your worldview, begging you to expand your horizons a little.

That could be an interesting approach. The only possible problem with that could be if you had code like

    if (value) { 
      doSomething();
    } else {
      doSomethingElse();
    }

surprising things may occur if value now had the third indeterminate value (eg it would call doSomethingElse(), which may not be desired).

When I think about it though, in most languages, Bools are represented as ints (due to the way cpus handle numbers, its faster to use ints rather than bits). Only with bool containers (like std::vector&lt;bool&gt;), or when using an int as a series of bit flags, do bools only use one bit. It would be interesting to see the effect it would have on a language to have the default bool type have three (or more) possible values, since it normally wouldn't cost anything.

&gt; The concern is really more of one of ""wasted bits/trits"" than ""wasted values"".

I think the problem is never of us knows the cost of a ternary bit. I am calculating the cost as being 1.5 that of a binary bit, while you are counting it as roughly the same. Either could easily be true. If a ternary bit bit could be represented as either a negative, zero or positive voltage difference, then the cost could possibly be the same.

btw, this has been an interesting discussion. Its been too long since I've got the chance to play around with bits and different bases, you don't do that too often in HLL's :(","1233459633"

Souls are bestowed to humans at the moment of conception. (Ignore for a moment that nobody knows exactly which stage of conception it occurs -- because it cannot be tested and the Pope has yet to take a ""best guess"".) Our species came from a race which is not genetically compatible with homo sapiens sapiens. If souls are deemed to be an exclusively human trait then there had to have been a human ancestor who was a female enough to be almost human, and not have a soul, yet her offspring was human enough to have one.

What was it about the child that allowed it to have a soul, when its mother did not?

The suggestion that all living entities have a soul (as opposed to just humans) moves the problem from anthropogenesis to abiogenesis. Instead of a soulless near-human and its ensouled offspring, the issue becomes the difference between a soulless protein and a fully formed single-cell bacteria capable of replication. That is, when was a cell considered alive enough to have a soul? What was the distinguishing feature (or features)? (Since humans constitute many living cells, each with a soul, it follows that humans have trillions of souls, rather than a single, solitary soul.)

That link is utter bollocks, it is sourced from [this story](http://www.smarthouse.com.au/Home/D3Q7G8S2?page=1)

Smarthouse is a notorious traffic troll.  The article says:

&gt; www.current.com.au wrote recently According to an EB Games store manager, who wished to remain anonymous, failure rates for the Xbox 360 have dropped in recent times but still outweigh hardware failures for competing consoles. 

&gt; ""We are definitely getting faulty hardware returns of the Xbox 360, but no-where near as much as we used to when it first came out,"" he said.

&gt; ""On initial launch, it was close to 30 per cent of our [Xbox 360s] were coming back faulty...The failure rate must be well over 30%""

That number is from an *unsourced ""EB games manager""*. Current and Smarthouse are notorious plagarists and content theives.  They are not journalists, they are a traffic-trolling shithouse set-up to generate ad revenue.

current.com.uk is owned by Smarthouse. They create a story of fiction, then post various stories in a traffic-trolling circle to give them exposure.

Smarthouse (and their proxy current) is solely the source of the general internet urban myth of ""30% failure of xbox 360s"".  That very article is what started that number.

It was widely repeated.  It is not accurate.

What *is* accurate?  I dont know.  MS has never released any numbers themselves, but looking at the provinece of smarthouse/current and the very article itself, it's pretty clear that ""anonymous EB manager"" almost certainly doesnt exist.

The only reliable number was released by 3rd party warranty provider SquareTrade.

[They said in Feb08 that the number is half as much](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3166259)

A couple of things about what FairTrade *actually* said.

* A) They said that they've had a ""failure"" rate of 16%.  What do they mean by ""Failure""?  *any contact of ""failure"" is counted as a ""failure""*.  So, 16% doest mean ""people with a general hardware failure"", it includes people who've called for *any reason*.  ie: Customer: ""My xbox 360 wont turn on."" SquareTrade: ""What's wrong?"".  Cstmr: ""I dropped it in a mudpuddle"" is counted as a ""failure"" and included in the 16%.

* B) SquareTrade direclty profits from the impression that Xbox 360s *need* 3rd Party Warranties.

* C) The SquareTrade CEO said ""* ""would estimate most if not all were the original motherboard.*"" ie; a version long since gone from retail.

* D) This number was released in Feb 08, as the problem with heat was actually fixed in summer-2007, the number of ""non-rev1"" Motherboards (the one with the heat issue) has decreased dramatically as new-non-heat-issue MBs have entered the pool of Xbox 360s.  ie: the ""failure rate"" depends on the population total, as the heat-failure-prone MBs decreased as a percentage of the total, so will the overall ""Failure rate"".

* E) ""the general hardware failure accounted for about 60% of those hardware failures"".  So, 60% of 16% (or, 9.6%) are the the general hardware failure.


Bottom line?  The Xbox 360 heat problem is long since over.  The owners with problems get free repairs.  The ""30%"" failure number is utter bullshit. ","1233459847"

As a result, as I was pulling to the side of the road in front of my destination, I did not realize that the perfectly flat-looking snow at the sides of the road was not, in fact, additional road space...  it was a ditch...

In went my car.... tilted at about 45 degrees, the task of climbing out through the passenger side of the car was quite difficult...

After getting inside to my friend's place to borrow a phone, I walked back out to my car to assess the damage.. thankfully there was nothing serious...

As I was standing there, a guy in a tow truck was driving by and stopped... he offered help, got out some rope and tied it around my chassis, and yanked my car right out of the ditch...

I told him that the towing companies I had talked to had all asked for $150 or so, but I only had $40 cash in my wallet... and said I could go to an ATM to pay him...

He said that wouldn't be necessary, so I attempted to insist he take the $40 for helping me out...

He stopped me and said sincerely:  ""What would make me much happier than any of your money is if you helped the next person you see in need.""

Yeah, it may have taken the guy all of 5 minutes to help me out, but I was very uplifted by the gesture, and even moreso by his response...  I've taken his advice since.  

Because of how I felt when he did that, I now try to offer help whenever I see someone who might need it, whether it's a motorist with a disabled vehicle or someone in the city having trouble hauling their groceries... ","1233459912"

We're friends. Are you not getting in touch with me because you're ashamed that you can't pay me back? Man, fuck the $200. I'll be damned if $200 should end our friendship. I just want to hear from you so I know you're all right.

Okay, by doing that you'll likely get a reply that he's sorry about the money but having all sorts of money problems etc. and that he'll pay you back as soon as he can.

Maybe you'll get the money or maybe not. But, that money was worth the lesson you got imho.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think, from a philosphical point of view, Americans (especially liberals) are uncomfortable telling people what they can do with their land, unless it causes some harm to others.  Something that would only damage the farmers land (with no health effects - just lack of food 100 years down the line) seems to go against this general principle.

So the solution is, instead of penalizing farmers for not treating the soil right (which requires all sorts of enforcement, people trying to cheat the system, defining hard to define properties - we don't even know what soil really is, lawsuits, etc), why not just give them a bonus for doing the right thing?  You end up spending the money either way, the second method just respects their rights to their land, but gives them an incentive to do the right thing.","1233460053"

When I was in college at a SoCal university (this is ca. Reagan era), there was a fellow student, an avid biker, that got hit by a DUI (coincidently, in a pickup truck).  This biker also lost his leg and after recovering from the ""accident"" he kept up biking.


It was, of course, a dramatic and sensational incident that caught up our university.  Our Physics department machine shop (normally working on high precision experiment apparati) helped design and fabricate a custom made system for his mountain bike so he could thumb a switch and lock his cranks horizontal in order to clear obstacles.  


I remember a few things about this guy:

He would use his bike as others in his plight might use a wheel chair.  He'd ride it straight into the pub or classroom or wherever.  He didn't carry a crutch around for non rolling motion, it was just the bike and him.  At one point the uni tried to stop him saying it wasn't cool to ride bikes inside.  But, that lameness never got traction.

The other memory was talking with the machinists at the Physics department about him.  Many were mountain bikers (this was late 80s, early 90s so MTB was still kind of a grass roots thing).  They all volunteered their time and the dept's machines to design and fabricate this lock-out mech to help out a fallen comrade.  After it was finished and tried out, the number one response they got from the dude was bitching about every little problem with the lockout and no recognition of the efforts strangers made for him.  In short, he was kind of a dick. 

So, my lesson from this was: misfortune brings out one's real character.

If i challenge you to an intellectual discussion and you challenge me by calling me lazy, what does that show?  It's like you say the earth is flat and I say prove it, you say your too lazy...good proof.

Since you challenged me...I'll show you how one steps up to the challenge. 
&gt;War is ordained by Allah, and all Muslims must be willing to fight, whether they like it or not. 2:216

First you've misquoted the verse. If done so unknowingly, well we shouldn't speak about things we don't know about.  And if done intentionally, well that would be lying and deceit. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you didn't know.

Here's what this verse really says: Fighting is enjoined on you, and it is an object of dislike to you; and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it may be that you love a thing while it is evil for you, and Allah knows, while you do not know.

&gt;Have no unbelieving friends. Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them. 4:89

WHAT A SURPRISE another misquote...hmm I wonder why?  Here's what it actually says:
They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them,

Then verse 4:90 continues: Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or (those who) come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah allows you no way against them.

&gt;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them 9:5

let's see what this verse really says: Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

And now let's see its context: (9:1): Freedom from obligation (is proclaimed) from Allah and His messenger toward those of the idolaters with whom you made a treaty.
(9:2):  So go about in the land for four months and know that you cannot weaken Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to the unbelievers.
(9:3) And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Messenger are free from liability to the idolaters; therefore if you repent, it will be better for you, and if you turn back, then know that you will not weaken Allah; and announce painful punishment to those who reject faith.
(9:4):Except those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement, then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up any one against you, so fulfill their agreement to the end of their term; surely Allah loves those who are careful (of their duty).

O WOW, now the verses are in context and we see that they do not imply what you are talking about. HOW INTERESTING!

&gt;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil) 9:123

Actually its more like fight against those of the unbelievers who are closer to you...
This is one of the verses of the Quran that talks about war tactics.  Islam is a religion of peace, but it also knows that there will be war against Muslims (as history shows) and that Muslims must not be a bunch of pansies and say o we don't fight. Of course they are not supposed to fight unless they are attacked.  The Muslims of that time (when this verse was revealed) we being attacked by the unbelievers of Arabia, so the Quran is teaching them to first pay attention to and fight those enemies are are closer to you, then work your way outwards.  Logical war tactic by any account. Of course now that we see it in its contexts, it makes a lot of sense.

&gt;These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord; then (as to) those who disbelieve, for them are cut out garments of fire, boiling water shall be poured over their heads 22:19

Wow, this verse is about the punishments of hell. And hell is not exclusive to the religion of Islam.  Many religions believe in it. Anyways, what do you think the punishment of the people you saw on this video should be? I think they deserve such a punishment in the next world. Or what do you think the punishments of Hitler, Saddam, Bush, Bin Laden, torturers, etc should be? A pat on the wrist and to tell them don't do it again? Or should they go free and dwell in the gardens of paradise? How about those sick animals who rape small children, or drop atomic bombs on countless people?
Anyways, unbelievers are placed in different categories...if you were capable of teaching me, you'd know all of this.

You left out the all important factor. The 14th Amendment came with two others. Two important others. The 13th and the 15th, both of which deal with slavery and/or race intended to curb Dred Scott arguments and ban involuntary servitude and slavery. A few cases which affirm that those 3 amendments arose out of slavery and racial inequality were the [Slaughter-house Cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse_cases).

Another point to make is that the 3 amendments defined two types of citizenships, those of the country and those of the state. The 14th Amendment granted all citizens born or naturalized at the time of passing in the United States citizenship of both the country and the state.

"technology","t5_2qh16","No, no, no, my friend, you're simply reading it wrong.

It *was* human error, and Marissa Mayer, VP, Search Products &amp; User Experience chose to give only the most rudimentary of explanations of said error (""Very simply"").

If things were to have been expounded upon further and the complete story released, then it would have gone something more like this:

At 5:58 AM PST, Employee GR55-094, filed as R. Goldberg, tripped coming up the stairs, spilling a great quantity of papers.  Behind him, a second employee stopped going up the stairs for several minutes in order to help GR-55-094-Goldberg pick up his things and put them back in order, being the kind person that they were.

This other employee, reportedly ""Kathy, from Accounts Payable,"" HAD been on her way to the third floor employee break room, where she had a very fresh pot of coffee--her favorite blend from Dunkin Donuts--brewing in the machine.

In the interval between 5:58AM and 6:04AM, during which Kathy, from Accounts Payable helped Goldberg pick up his paperwork, several other employees, who testified only under the promise of anonymity to a Washington Post reporter this morning, drank the entire pot of French Vanilla Arabica with Cinnamon highlights.  They also finished off Sam Wilson's bottle of Hazelnut-Vanilla coffee creamer, but this is unrelated to the story at hand.

Upon discovering her favored coffee drunk, Kathy, from Accounts Payable, stormed into the nearest area of cubicles and began berating several male employees who had made quick motions to cover the cinnamony-vanilla scent of their steaming mugs of purloined joe.  Her jeremiad against these office-thieves lasted until 6:08AM.

As she was finishing off, one of the male employees, described by Kathy, from Accounts Payable, as ""slime not EVEN worth my time"" noticed that his boss had come up behind him and made a stabbing motion toward his Alt and Tab keys, forgetting temporarily forgetting that he was holding the coffee with both hands.  The hot goods splashed all over his well-worn keyboard in a scintillating display of fluid dynamics and electrical conduction, leaving his input device refreshingly scented yet entirely inoperable.

This, of course, left his NSFW Reddit window at the fore of his 24"" Dell monitor, but thankfully for him, his boss was a management type and therefore had no idea what NSFW stood for or what reddit was.  Indeed, he took the swathes of white space and blue text to be some sort of highly important, if perhaps oddly spaced, code and made his way on to his own desk, muttering about clumsy coders and his wife's recent insistence that he buy her a second set of breast implants because the first set ""just don't catch enough eyes, Larry!  That's what I got 'em for, goddammit.""  This, however, is beside the point.

Deprived of the use of his terminal, the ""Slime"" not EVEN worth Kathy's, from Accounts Payable"" ""Time"" dejectedly made his way over to Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire, the single biggest nerd in the Research and Development office they both worked in.  Cartwright was also the most likely to possess a spare keyboard or five (once he dug through the snakepit-like pile of CAT-5 and IDE cables that surrounded his flabby British frame in heaps that were becoming increasingly unbelievable).

Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire was situated just past the complementary breakfast bar that the employees in Research and Development Unit 5--codename Raptors on Jet-Powered Skateboards--had each given up 2% of their net pay to keep when the company began a series of cutbacks last year.  His stomach left unsated by the coffee-keyboard disaster, the ""Slime"" not EVEN worth Kathy's, from Accounts Payable"" ""Time"" first stopped by to pour himself a bowl of Trix and chocolate milk, which he munched merrily as he ambled over to the Jabba-like Lord of Spare Parts and Grating, Liverpudlian Accents, Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire.

The fat man indeed possessed a spare keyboard--an exact replica of somesuch ancient IBM model that produced clicking sounds sufficiently loud to drown out Kathy's, from Accounts Payable, shrill protestations the next time that the ""Slime"" not worth her ""Time"" helped himself to some Dunkin Donuts-brewed wakefulness.  Keyboard in hand, the ""Slime"" left Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire's disheveled desk area at 6:24AM.

However, the sight of fruit-shaped globs of puffed-rice spheres floating in the chocolate milk like a shattered rainbow sinking into a lake of very old pennies had set off the memory of several incredibly entertaining commercials in the fat man's well-radiated (by his intimidating 4-monitor array that somehow managed to encircle even his considerable bulk) brain.

Unable to concentrate on the unimportant series of checks on a random document relating to malware sites that he'd done a thousand times before, Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire quickly Ctrl-O'ed to write-out, then exited his text editor and loaded Chrome to surf to Youtube to watch an increasingly desperate white rabbit slowly starve to death whilst being taunted by a rabble of cruel children.

Gordon Reginald Cartwright III, Esquire's fateful save came at 6:25AM, two minutes before the next scheduled staggered update rollout.  This save contained the fatal '/' URL checked off, its tickbox nudged by the shaking cursor guided by the fat man's trembling, sweaty paws as he attempted to shove his creaking rolling chair back through a mass of 20-year-old computer magazines to access his hidden supply of input/output peripherals.

It is the same as creating a book from a few tattered fragments of Shakespeare, and calling the new book that we made ""A book by Shakespeare"".

Take a picture of your face, then blank out all of it except your left nostril.  Then send the picture to somebody who has never seen you and ask them to fill in the details so that the picture looks like you again.

Now the prevention of this assumes others stop also, you by yourself only makes minimal impact.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Squeak is a language, as well as an implementation. You cannot separate the two.

You may be confused about that but the Squeak homepage is clear - 

[""Squeak is a modern, open source, full-featured **implementation of the powerful Smalltalk programming language** and environment.""](http://www.squeak.org/)


&gt; The language has no module system...

Just like Java?


&gt; There's no way to rebuild a Squeak image from source...

Is that a fact! 

So there's no way to rebuild from a base image and source from `fileIn` files or the `change log` in the same way that's been done with Smalltalk implementations for 30 years? 

So there's no way to rebuild from a base image and source from [a distributed code repository](http://www.wiresong.ca/Monticello)?


&gt; Performance suffers from the bytecode interpreter and simplistic GC.

And [how does Squeak performance compare to Ruby 1.8.6?](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=squeak&amp;lang2=ruby)

I fear the cycle of borrowing from China for stimulus to buy Chinese goods is a formula for disaster.

There is no solution though without giving up our values. Chinas advantage is no pollution controls, no minimum wage laws, no unions. Something that puts us at a disadvantage but I think we'd be better off losing the economic war. We put our self at military risk though. China's military spending is catching up with ours. What is life without safety, one of our basic human needs.

Let’s assume I am a crawler robot, painfully surfing the web, craving to rank as many web pages as I can. I concede top search engine placement to those sites that conform some postulates. 

Ok, here's your website. I just followed someone else’s hyperlink that pointed to a page in the site. Well done! Your site is a bit sought-after! 

Tip: The more the hyperlinks directing to your web pages, the sooner I can find them and the bigger your odds of achieving top search engine placement. 

Ok, now what's next? Oh, yeah! I'll go read robots.txt. There... You ask me to skip your ""delicate matters"". That's ok.

Now, I download the html of the page. Wait! Sending your page to my index... Ready! 

Next, I need to make one more decision: Where to go from here? Are you getting it? That is all a web bot like me does, choosing which hyperlink to follow, visiting the site and downloading copies of pages. The indexing and analysis tasks are left to my brothers, Ranking and Indexing. 

Yet, in order for you to grasp how to get to top search engine placement, I will try a page analysis (ok?). I noticed small coding errors. Probably, you didn’t validate your page. That’s ok; nobody is perfect, although... Don’t be amazed if my brother, Indexing Bot, ignored the section with your impressive copy after an invalid tag! A bot can’t care less if, while trying to get to top search engine placement, you inserted a 2.1% key word density. Your erroneously coded html has gone. Got it? A trivial mistake and your keywords evaporate! 

Tip: you'll have more chances to gain top search engine placement if you get rid of those small errors. Validate your markup.

I noticed there were a few hyperlinks in your page. Good. I will verify if I already visited the first hyperlink; if i didn't, I will follow it. 

Tip: Include links. That is the very essentia of the Internet. We bots crave hyperlinks. The way to top search engine placement is in the links, inbound and outbound hyperlinks.

I didn't see any key words in your hyperlinks, though. What a crime. How can you expect to accomplish top search engine placement if you neglect opportunities?

The title does not include important key words. I did not find a H1 tag, either. That is wrong. Top search engine placement heavily relies on such tags. They are extremely important for us spider robots, especially for Indexing and Ranking robots.

Tip: You can get affordable SEO and reach top search engine placement for some key words by including them in the title tag as well as in the headings.

Well, that’ll be all. I have work. There are so many hyperlinks waiting for a crawler to acknowledge them... Hope you learned some inside know-how to top search engine placement. Happy rankings.

&gt; What **seems to have happened** at the end of the recent ice ages is that **some factor** - **most probably** orbital changes - caused a rise in temperature... **Models suggest** that rising greenhouse gases, **including** CO2, explains **about 40%** of the warming as the ice ages ended. The **figure is uncertain** because it depends on how the extent of ice coverage changed over time, and there is **no way to pin this down precisely.**

So - New Scientist's label of a ""myth"" is not based on scientific evidence, but on the _subjective opinion_ of the writer (not a climate scientist, but an ""environmental"" _journalist_, a former _neurobiologist_) _editorialising_ on the basis of a _declaredly speculative model_ of an _admittedly poorly-understood_ climate mechanism.

It's pathetic that some people find this sort of obviously weak argument so convincing. The writer of the OP has described his interpretation of the data, for all to see, in an attempt to refute contrary claims: if you can challenge the method or the data, go right ahead - because that's how real science is done.

But that would require trying to understand the report, which is intellectually hard work. So instead you just google up few paragraphs of unsubstantiated warmist dogma, and pretend you know all about it. ","1233461253"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think what most people nowadays fail to realise is how war was waged then. Bombs were incredibly inaccurate compared to today's offerings. It was an age of total war, when the entire country's assets were involved in the war. Civilian casualties did not matter to the planners - they were largely unavoidable, and killing enemy civilians did help the war effort. In hindsight it is possible that the calculations were incorrect, and the effect on the war of destroying cities was less than imagined.

The only thing uniquely terrible about the nuclear weapons used was that they accomplished with one bomb what would otherwise take thousands. If they had not been used, conventional weapons would have been used instead. They were symbolic more than anything else, and it worked.

&gt;Interesting argument that does not distinguish between civilian and military casualties

The planning will have put different values on civilian and military casualties. But I'm afraid to say that civilians would not have had a negative value. Killing them helped bring the end of the war closer.

&gt;(So how many ""Nips"" does it take to equal a US Soldier, eh?)

This was a war that Japan started. A military planner's primary consideration is to minimise their side's casualties.

&gt;Killing a hundred thousand or a quarter-million civilians is a fucking war crime, by any reasonable standards.

By today's standards, perhaps. But it is harder to criticise the US for following the generally accepted ways of waging war at the time. I would be prepared to bet that 90% of those people would have died anyway, as well as countless others.","1233461428"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Anyone who took Macroeconomics 101 knows that government spending is a slightly more effective form of stimulating spending than tax cuts. There's a simple explanation for this: if you let people keep some of their money, they'll use some of it in terrible non-stimulating ways, like (gasp) *saving* it or perhaps even (shudder) *paying off some debt*! The government spending $X results in $X of consumption, while the government giving a tax cut of $X results in only $(1-s)X of consumption, where s is the savings rate. So if the savings rate is 5%, then government spending $1 trillion gives $1 trillion in stimulative spending, while a tax cut of $1 trillion gives only $950 billion in stimulative spending. Of course, right now in the U.S. the savings rate is probably close to zero.

I think we need to look a bit beyond just wanting to maximize short-term spending, and think long-term about how to get our country out of the debt-cycle that we're currently in.

2. He has only had one “job” in his life, and that was sniff-testing the leaded gasoline at the station down the street.  When the owner discovered this “job” in progress at 2 am, he of course called the cops.

3. It’s not 47 or 48 cats.  If you include the dead ones, reddit-man actually has 73 cats!  He blames the “Democraps” for not having the dead ones removed.

4. Reddit-man lives with his mommy, who also signs his name to the checks he gets due to the mental “issues” that keep him from doing anything useful.

5. He was born in a manger.  (Well, actually he just *thinks* he was.  He was born in Arkansas, and has never left the state.)

6. Reddit-man has 16 separate personalities.  Defying the odds, all of them turned out to be clueless, right-wing assholes.

7. Reddit-man has never actually voted... because he can’t read.  He has participated in demonstrations against adult literacy programs in which he could LEARN to read.

8. The truck stop bathroom where he “parties” is also his only source of income.

9. He invents new words.  Today’s words are “posperity” and “racits.”

10. Ten is too high a number for him to understand.  Instead, he says “three threes” and blames Democrats when he gets confused while counting his toes.

11. He believes that “reverse vampires” live inside his left ear.  No... HIS OTHER LEFT!

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","You clearly don't understand the idea of government stimulus spending.

The problem with a recession is that, out of fear, consumers and businesses are under-spending, and this leads to sub-optimal demand.  This sub-optimal demand creates a vicious circle of further sub-optimal demand, leading to the increased contraction of the economy.

The reason that we have the *government* spend the money, rather than consumers, is to overcome what's known as the ""collective action"" problem.  

We would like consumers to start spending again, rather than hoarding their money out of fear. But, individually, consumers will not be able to band together and engage in optimal spending necessary to increase demand to break the cycle, because of the transactions costs involved and their individual fears.

Therefore, the goverment, as a single, representative entity, can overcome the collective action problem  and actually engage the spending necessary to break the economic contraction cycle -- whereas consumers, paralyzed by fear and uncertainty, will not.  Thus, if we simply give the money back to consumers through tax breaks, we will not break the recessionary cycle.","1233461803"

It shouldn't.   doSomethingElse() should deal with the fact that (value) was an unexpected and unusable input.

Certainly it might still _work_ if you only expect (value) to be two different things, but someone maintaining your code years from now will curse your name.   It may even be you after you've forgotten how you were so clever.

I think really the reason I like ternary is because people do seem to naturally think in black and white and it forces them to be explicit with both cases they've considered, because if they only explicitly test one they cannot implicitly specifying the other case by a process of elimination.

In YOUR opinion - I would ask you to compare an average Canadian to an average American in terms of 'blind' patriotism; Canadians are quite jaded and questioning of their government. There is very little 'state worship' here.

In terms of the anthem specifically, you are   acting as if O Canada is comparable to the 2 minutes of Hate from 1984. There's nothing to it. As I said before, our anthem promises nothing and asks only that we strive for freedom and to keep our freedoms as a sovereign state.

Unlike the Pledge of Allegiance, which demands a great deal from the person speaking it - O Canada does not. Even the American national anthem speaks to violence and warfare and the sacrifice of life in order to preserve it as a nation, O Canada does not.

I recommend you compare the text of the anthems before you try and say that it is a jingoist tool; there is nothing in there that doesn't speak to freedom and inclusion rather than blind obedience.

1. He once ate a bowl of **live crickets** because they were beaming “Democrap” messages in to his foil-and-oatmeal hat.

2. He has only had one “job” in his life, and that was **sniff-testing the leaded gasoline** at the station down the street.  When the owner discovered this “job” in progress at 2 am, he of course called the cops.

3. It’s not 47 or 48 cats.  If you include the dead ones, reddit-man actually has 73 cats!  He blames the “Democraps” **for not having the dead ones removed.**

4. Reddit-man lives with his mommy, who also signs his name to the checks he gets **due to the mental “issues”** that keep him from doing anything useful.

5. He was **born in a manger.**  (Well, actually he just *thinks* he was.  He was born in Arkansas, and has never left the state.)

6. Reddit-man has 16 separate personalities.  Defying the odds, all of them turned out to be **clueless, right-wing assholes.**

7. Reddit-man has never actually voted... because **he can’t read.**  (His “mumsie” types for him.)   He HAS, however, participated in demonstrations against adult literacy programs in which he could LEARN to read.

8. The **truck stop bathroom** where he “parties” is also his only source of income.

9. He invents new words.  **Today’s words are “li-berry” and “rackoonstew.”**

10. Ten is too high a number for him to understand.  **Instead, he says “three threes”** and blames Democrats when he gets confused while counting his toes.

11. He believes that **“reverse vampires”** live inside his left ear.  No... HIS OTHER LEFT!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Sorry to those that think 5 year olds are not cognizant yet. You are wrong. Tell your 5 year old that life is many things, and it all depends on how you look at it. Many people want to believe that there is some special reason that we are here and that is the meaning of life, but the truth is that what we do, how we act, who calls us friend... what we put into life gives meaning to our lives. No other person or thing can do that, only we can for our own personal life.

Life just is, there is no explanation of why we are here. Some people think it's an accident, some not. I don't think the family pets worry too much about it. They just try to live a good life as best they can, and that is what we humans have to do. If we want life to mean something, then we have to do something to make it meaningful. Some people help third world countries, some people do research and development on medical cures for terrible diseases, some people just work to pay their bills and make sure their kids know what love is. In any case, life has no meaning beyond what you personally give it. It's up to you... you can waste it, or do something with it. That is what life is... it's an opportunity for you to do something wonderful... or not.

Every day, you have to eat, sleep, and try to be healthy. Outside of that, what you do is how life will remember you and treat you. If you are industrious, life will see you that way and give you opportunities to be wonderful in that way. If you are artful, life will see it and give you chances to share your art. If you are sporty,..... and so on.

Life is what you make it, nothing more.","1233462206"

"technology","t5_2qh16","It's been pretty interesting watching this go from around 1100 hits before I submitted this today, up to 1300-1400 when I went to sleep a couple hours later, and then 5300 when I got up two hours ago, then 5900, now 6700 views.

The cool thing is, once it gets exposure in one place, then other people will also link to it, and then it gets write-ups on blogs and other places, many of them sound- and music- and technology-related. I really hope this will inspire her to press forward and find other talented people to collaborate with, and maybe we'll end up with a working copy we can use someday.

If you look at her blog, you can see she made a ton of progress on it from February 2008 to late October, when she posted her most recent video. It got picked up on Reddit in Mid-December, and went to other places from there. (That latest blog entry got 47 comments, mostly from Redditors, where previously she'd get 0-1 comments in her entries in 6 months prior.)

Even if this is based on some other MIT projects (such as ""soundsieve"" [bottom-right visualization] from The Echo Nest, as somebody else mentioned), she's done a ton of work in putting it all together and making it elegant and navigable. Then again, it's interesting to see criticisms, as they provide a different level of insight than the praise.

I have nothing to do with this, no connection or interest to the author, but I was messing around with YouTube HD at the time, and decided it would be a much more accessible format to view it rather than a stuttery QuickTime file directly from her blog, and also saving her some bandwidth.

I guess it has more-or-less approval from her, as she's now linked to the YouTube version from her blog, and it's been embedded in other related pages such as a [write-up on CNet](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-12519_7-10125595-49.html), a blog on [Califaudio](http://blog.califaudio.com/2008/12/musicbox-music-library-mapping.html), a small article on [Synthtopia](http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2009/01/01/musicbox-browser-visually-maps-your-music-collection/), and one on [ThisIsNotALabel.com](http://www.thisisnotalabel.com/talk.php?bp=645).

But I decided to work on subtitles two nights ago, in commemoration of it hitting 1000 hits (!), and seeing that people were viewing it from India, Singapore, Russia, Brazil, Ecuador, Switzerland, Belgium, etc. I thought about what it would be like viewing it with the voiceover in those respective languages, and how relatively less I could glean if I didn't know the language, or if I wasn't fluent in spoken-only form. (Some might be able to *read* English, but would have difficulty in speaking it or hearing it spoken in audio form.)

As an added bonus, YouTube has a beta translator to transform those captions into (and I quote): Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, Tagalog, and Vietnamese... And relatively passable versions of those languages!

(I'll accept manual translations if anyone bilingual/multilingual wants to attempt those. Get in contact with me, and I can send you the Subtitle file. Check out the Google Translator version and see if it makes sense to you. I've converted back-and-forth from French and Russian and Japanese, and they seem to do a pretty good job of getting the gist of it, at least.)

This is probably waaay too much information, but I really like what I've seen about this program, and want to do as much as possible to see a usable version come into fruition.

Hopefully she'll be able to work out IP rights and won't be too distracted by her new job (the Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto, CA). I hope all the interest will encourage her to keep pursuing it, rather than letting it just sit on a back-burner. Right now, I don't think a single program exists to do what her project is doing (and if there were, I would use it!). The fact that everybody wishes their music could do this shows how much potential this program could have.","1233462294"

The fact that there exists a relativistic ""speed limit"" comes from the invariance of causality: we demand that a physical theory should preserve the temporal order of two events, one of which is the cause of the other, under a Lorentz transformation (a transformation to a frame moving with respect to the original frame). Without a speed limit, effects could precede causes; for example, we can imagine sending a signal which reaches a relay and is sent back to us. If this signal moved faster than the speed of light, it could (under certain circumstances) arrive before it was sent -- a logical absurdity!

The fact that there is only *one* speed limit -- the speed of light -- is a property of the Lorentz transformations, which are fundamental to special relativity.","1233462450"

However, while your explanation is the standard one, it assumes that really the whole problem with the economy is just rampant pessimism. This leads to behavior like GWB telling everyone to just go out and spend money to get us out of the recession. Or the current bill to just print / borrow money and spend like crazy to get us out of the recession. I think there are a lot more serious problems, like our addiction to debt and our aversion to saving, that really need to be structurally resolved.

The self-regulating nature of capitalism has already been destroyed by government intervention, starting with the monetary policy promoted by Keynes. Wall street wouldn't require massive regulation if the fed hadn't pumped it full of cheap money backed by we the people, but since it did do exactly that, wall street does require regulation.

I would be willing to bet it is almost all the aforementioned infrastructure improvements, which again would have had (or at least should have had) to be done with a new stadium in any case.  And if it's counting lost tax revenue from said municipal bonds, I think that's even more silly- you're talking about a project that might well not have happened period without them, and even if it did might have happened on a much smaller scale.

Also, it may include the Metro North station, which is both being paid for by the state and should have been built decades ago- in this case the new stadium is simply an excuse.  As a government agency, the MTA's job is to provide transport for the region, and providing service to major sporting venues is a huge part of that.

As to the parkland, that I agree with you 100% on.  That's what has always disturbed me most about the New Yankee Stadium project- the government rolled over to give a huge chunk of parkland to the Yankees in a borough that needs every park it can get.  Let's assume they get it all back (not a given); they've still lost use of it for over 2 years now, and that has a value that has not been paid.

- Boolean logic
- Set theory (inclusion and exclusion from sets, in particular)
- Ease of fabricating binary components (the V-I curve of a transistor has two stable regions)
- Negative and imaginary numbers (although one could argue for quaternions possibly... especially if we're building a computer to do 3-space calculations but even then, we would probably compose them out of binary representations)
- Even-ness
- 2 is the most common factor (fully 1/2 of all integers are evenly divisible!)
- Signal processing and restorative logic are easier with fewer states
- The positive charge of the proton and the negative charge of the electron

etc etc

Some of these reasons are duplicates or otherwise related but provide a different perspective on the benefit. Perhaps it is not provable that base-2 is best to build computing devices in but it does have an enormous engineering benefit.

If someone is healthy and the pregnancy is normal, the chances are that even a hospital birth could be higher risk (if you include hospital acquired infections and the like) than a birth at home.  

I really can't understand why people would want to medicalise and increase the stress of something that is essentially a normal process.  

Of course there are quite a number of instances where medical intervention is not only warranted, but actually essential, but that does depend on clinical need, not what the doctors / midwives feel more comfortable with.  

I guess it depends on the healtcare system being used (I have no idea whether it is feasible for some in the US to opt for a home-birth, or even have that much direct impact on a hospital birth plan given the interwoven nature of medical care and insurance) and the general confidence and competence of the healtchare professionals involved, but I do think more people should be looking at the whole range of options.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","In that video it talked about MSG being bad for you. 

Bull!

A quick look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate#Health_concerns

""MSG as a food ingredient has been the subject of some health concerns. A report from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) compiled in 1995 on behalf of the FDA concluded that MSG was safe for most people when “eaten at customary levels.” However, it also said that, based on anecdotal reports, some people may have an MSG intolerance which causes “MSG symptom complex” — commonly referred to as Chinese restaurant syndrome — and/or a worsening of asthmatic symptoms.""

First point: ""MSG was safe"" when ""eaten at customary levels"" in a report reproduced. 

Second point: That same report contained anecdotal evidence about some possible symptoms - but you cannot realistically link MSG to anything described any better than you can link vaccines with autism - the evidence isn't there, and an anecdote is worthless on so many levels.

When MSG is dissolved in water, or your saliva, it disassociates forming glutamate and sodium ions. The sodium is harmless (unless told otherwise by your doctor) because it is the same thing you get with normal table salt. The glutamate will form the acid which is a common thing in your body already.

Given this, everything else he says is suspect.","1233463400"

"comics","t5_2qh0s","&gt; Here is the intuition: Imagine a farming community in which numerous families own and farm their own land. Each family produces just enough to feed itself; there is no surplus harvest or unfarmed land. Everyone in this town has enough to eat; on the other hand, no one lives particularly well. Every family spends large amounts of time doing domestic chores. They make their own clothes, teach their own children, make and repair their own farm implements, etc. Suppose a guy wanders into town looking for work. In scenario one, this guy has no skills. There is no extra land to farm, so the community tells him to get back on the train. Maybe they even buy him a one-way ticket out of town. This town has ""no jobs"".

&gt; Now consider scenario two: The guy who ambles into town has a Ph.D. in agronomy. He has designed a new kind of plow that improves corn yields. He trades his plow to farmers in exchange for a small share of their harvests. Everybody is better off. The agronomist can support himself; the farmers have more to eat, even after paying for their new plows (or else they wouldn't buy the plows). And this community has just created one new job: plow salesman. Soon thereafter, a carpenter arrives at the train station. He offers to do all the odd jobs that limit the amount of time farmers can spend tending to their crops. Yields go up again because farmers are able to spend more time doing what they do best: farming. And another new job is created.

There are many reasons why someone might not want their partner looking at porn. It could be religious reasons. Maybe the wife has severe depression and self-esteem issues and her husband looking at porn causes even more problems.

The point is, if you are going to get into a relationship with someone that has something against pornography then you have a couple options. Find someone else or stop looking at porn. If you don't, then don't be surprised when you get busted and in a messy divorce. 

The same is true with smoking, drinking, bowling or anything else. If your partner wants you to quit doing something you find someone else, quit because you love them, or keep doing it in secret. The last option is a mistake and is only going to end bad.","1233463769"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I think the general advice is that you can't go far wrong with a cannon or a nikon, if you already have lenses then it may be beneficial to get a camera body that lets you use them.  

Don't spend your whole budget on the body and get stuck with the kit lenses either, if you have the choice and the budget try and get a halfway decent lens too, basically see if you can balance your budget between a decent lens and body. 

I would also say buy used if you need to (I don't know what others experiences with this are, but I have generally found that getting second hand kit is a huge saver and you end up in better shape than buying new) you can often get a lot more out of your budget without compromising on quality.

Lastly, whatever you buy, make sure that you think about any accessories you will need. I would say that getting a spare battery at a minimum if you are going to be shooting a moderate number of pictures between recharge opportunities, plus a large memory card, or a number of medium sized ones.  There is nothing worse than coming across something you really want to shoot to find you have little or no battery left or you just maxed out your last memory card). Plus batteries and memory cards are cheap these days.

Let's see... what would the Republican government have done in the past few years... how many people were excused from service due to not wanting to serve for some reason 'X', e.g. ""conscientious objector""? What did uberalles2's son's marine buddies think about conscientious objectors in the past several years? What are their alternatives to (1) indefinite and illegal incarceration and (2) following a legal process which might result in some prisoners returning to Afghanistan and further that authorities in Afghanistan release these persons?

Anyway, I don't think any of that *should* have any bearing on the answer to the question. IMHO if you don't want to serve you should simply be released, have a nice day. Whether it should be a dishonorable or an honorable discharge I cannot offer an opinion upon, as I am not in the military and do not know enough to say. You might have to re-pay up-front recruitment benefits and potentially forfeit future benefits such as G.I. Bill (but I would think that you would *not* have to forfeit future benefits based upon your active duty service such as Veterans Administration medical assistance, etc.) but it would to me be a case by case basis -- again, knowing nearly absolutely nothing about military discharges or the contracts involved.","1233464028"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Ars does give a good overview of the topic, but it obfuscates the right conclusion.

The purpose of the article was to show that *Microsoft didn't copy Apple*, and as such it describes a clear evolution from the original taskbar to the Windows 7 taskbar. That's not contested. The fact that the new taskbar is virtually identical to the dock isn't really hidden. The Windows 7 taskbar provides the same capabilities and information in virtually the same way. 

The history of the two solutions isn't that important to our discussion. As described, both solutions depict a row of applications, running or otherwise, represented [plainly] by icons. Clicking an icon makes the application active, launching it if necessary. Closing all of the windows doesn't necessarily terminate the application. Rick clicking on an active application in the OSX dock yields a list of windows (among other options). Hovering over an active application on the taskbar displays the windows.

There are far more similarities than differences, functionally and visually. Some of these properties are new to the taskbar but *none* of them are new to the dock.

The author goes through 3 pages explaining the difference the between document-based and application-based metaphors, then describes the OSX dock and Windows 7 taskbar in more or less the same and manages to give the impression that the two are completely different. They're not, as shown. But that's the power of a good writer.

Anyone who looks at the facts presented in this article objectively can see this for themselves. Lets stop the big pissing competition between Apple and Microsoft. The dock didn't originate in OSX. The taskbar didn't originate in Windows. What does it matter who came up with what. My point is that the dock (or Windows 7 taskbar if you prefer to call it that) seems to solve the problem very well, and I'm not surprised that there's interest in the Windows and Linux community.","1233464809"

First define ""patriotic"" in a meaningful way. Are they following the anti-state traditions of the Boston Tea Party? The traditions of the later statist framers of the Constitution? Lincoln or Jefferson Davis? Kennedy? Carter? Reagan? FDR? Obama? (Does he have traditions yet?)

To me ""patriotic"" is nearly a non-word, maybe an anti-word. I don't know these marines or their conduct or their beliefs or the actions or their history. They may be brave, they may be good, they may be honorable. They may be cowards, they may be fraggers, they may be dishonorable.

That makes them *human*. When does ""not wanting to serve"" become ""refusing to serve""? That might cross a line into something meaningfully unpatriotic, but I personally could see many patriotic reasons to refuse to serve depending on the situations.

For me, patriotism is the Declaration of Independence and the Boston Tea Party. Unashamedly anti-state and anti-dogma. It is the pledge of the Statue of Liberty to welcome anyone. ""Not wanting to serve because Obama wants to let Gitmo prisoners go back to Afghanistan"" ... that is so beyond any world where my concept of patriotism makes any sense that I cannot apply language or logic to find and answer. The world is completely screwed on backwards.

But anyway, to answer some questions I posed in the other reply: applying Republican talking head logic to this situation would force these marines to not just be labeled unpatriotic but, dare I say, in a red-faced Limbaugh voice: ""TRAITORS!""

But I couldn't care much less about what he (Limbaugh) or his ilk have to say. Patriotism is *not* mindless following the chain of command. To me it is very much an *active mindfulness* of one's purpose in the causes of global goodness through the beacon of liberty and peace that America should be by example. If you have the rhetorical skills to rationalize killing children in Pakistan via drone-fired missiles to that purpose, good on you, ""true patriot"". I certainly can't. I can't find any meaning in these wars and I would wholeheartedly support all the marines coming home tomorrow -- and giving none the option of staying, unless they want to stay behind while all the guns and tanks and bombs are brought back as well, in which case, free choice, free will, and good luck.","1233464879"

First off, Hamas are in Gaza, Hezbollah are in Lebanon. Reuters didn't doctor those photos. Adnan Hajj, a Lebanese freelance photographer did. He'd worked for them for a decade and they thought they could trust him. Unfortunately they were wrong and when it was revealed those images were doctored, they removed them and released a statement admitting as much. Eventualy they stopped using all of his photos and stopped taking anymore after some other manipulations emerged.

Let me repeat, Reuters did not doctor those images.

Reuters is one of the most reputable news sources in the world and is known for its objectivity. Their image was badly tarnished by this, hence why it was so embarrassing admitting they'd got it wrong and why they made sure future sources would be scrutinised properly.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Must make it easy to feel superior when you can just end an argument by being telling the person not to reply. You're discussing biblical terms without defining them with the bible. Kind of like how intelligent design supporters misuse the word theory.

But as long as you insist on using your version of the dictionary definition of love why don't you tell me how it applies to what you're saying? [I don't see what you suggest it means here](http://dictionary.die.net/love).

Evil is the absence of good as dark is the absence of light and cold is the absence of heat.

I'm not twisting anything; I'm using language in context of the Bible since you are trying to assault the Bible. There are several Greek words for love that mean slightly different things. They were all translated into English as the word love. Agape, philia and eros are all translated as love. If you can't understand this than you should probably hold off on trying to debate religion since you are woefully unprepared.

Free will means you can choose to do good or you can choose to do bad or for that matter you can choose to do nothing which might also be good or bad depending on the circumstance. The only way to eliminate evil is to do only good which is something that you have to choose to do or not to do. Free will without the capacity to commit evil is not free will nor does it imply that one should do evil things. If drugs were completely legalized not everyone would be high or even want to be around people who were high.

The Bible wasn't written in English so refusing to acknowledge the context of the words as they were written isn't me twisting anything. It's you avoiding something because it's the only way you can create such an argument. Ignoring how the Bible defines something is fine when you are discussing something that has no relationship to the Bible but since this is intrinsically related to the Bible it would be intellectually dishonest to ignore the context. You might want to brush up on your hermeneutics a bit.

"Green","t5_2qh6q","A comment about used cars:

If you can, buy from a private seller instead of a dealer.  You can save thousands of dollars.  Sure, you can get a Certified Pre-Owned Toyota or the like, but you should compare the cost of the car without the ""assurance"" and determine if you'll have to pay more for repairs on the privately-sold car.  I bought a car from someone and paid $3000-$4000 than a dealer would have charged.  I had to have the serpentine belt and the oxygen sensor replaced, which only cost about $200.

You can eliminate some of the guessing by getting a Carfax report (sign up for the monthly subscription and then you can check the VINs of dozens of cars you find online) and by having a mechanic look at the car before you buy.  That costs about $100 but would be well worth it.

There was an article on reddit about a year ago about how car salesmen operate.  I don't have the time to hunt it down, but if anyone else has it handy, please provide a link.  In the end, you'll see why avoiding a dealer is often the best option.","1233465329"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Its a common misconception that the garbage patch is an island of visible waste, like a garbage dump only floating.  But that isn't the case.  Unfortunately, if it was so it would be a hell of a lot easier to clean up.

The garbage patch located east of Japan and west of the United States in an area where four natural ocean currents occur.  The sum of these currents along with atmospheric pressure and winds result in a giant toilet bowl effect, only there is no flushing, instead it just pushes things into the center.  This is called the North Pacific Gyre (one of several gyres).  The garbage patch is nothing more than an above higher level of garbage in a certain patch.  

Now here is what it is.  Plastics account for the vast majority of waste in the oceans.  Of all the plastics created, a good 10% ends up in the ocean (sorry I can't remember where this figure came from so correct me if I am wrong).  70% of the plastic in the area originates from land.  Things get tossed in the ground the wind sweeps it into a small body of water, and from there some of it ends up in the ocean.  The rest comes from illegal dumping from boats, ships, platforms etc, because properly disposing waste in a harbor costs money.  Now back to the gyre picture.  All that stuff that ends up in the ocean, in that enormous region is swept up in the Gyre, it swirls to the middle, and well, stays there.  

Now, plastics on land takes quite a number of years to break down, plastics in the ocean takes longer.  In a process called photo degrading, plastics simply break down.  Down the the molecular level, they are still polymers.  

Now let’s think back to other crap thrown in the oceans.  Pesticides, DDT, and other hydrophobic chemicals.  In the water, they just sorta exist, but when you throw plastic into the equation, plastic absorbs these chemicals (along with other debris).  So these chemicals are now laced within the plastic, which breaks down into tiny bits.  These tiny bits resemble food, or shall I specify plankton.

Remember DDT in North America and the birds?  Well same idea in the ocean, bioaccumulation occurs.  Plastic pieces are eaten by fish, the chemicals end up in the fish' fat, fish is eaten by people/ other bigger fish.  Quantitatively, the concentration of toxins jumps exponentially as you move up the food chain.

Get the proper software to write it, make sure it's tight with no flaws, especially in the layouts(some studio guys won't even read them if even something is slightly wrong with them, like if the font is too big), and finally make sure it's a good story.

Then you need to get a agent, which in itself will be hell. And if all you have is one screenplay, chances are the agent will not take you. You need something like a screenplay(or two, depending on who the agency is), a pilot(or two, like before), and most of all...a spec script(of a hot show, for right now good specs would be; Mad Men, 30 Rock, etc. Not shows like The Office or 2 and a Half Men, there are so many of those agencys won't even read them).

"programming","t5_2fwo","I suppose we have to look at the issue on two levels- On one, the utility of binary seems very much tied into the widespread use of binary, boolean logic, and other duple systems, be they in nature or culture. On this level, it seems that binary is a shoe in by merit of its legacy status alone.

The second level I see is the one of intrinsic mathematical and physical properties, and I think it behooves us to keep these levels distinct here. You have raised some important points regarding the merits of binary on this level, but I think that the merits of ternary would be more apparent in a world that had proceeded along a more trifold path.

My main area of interest with all this is not so much the replacement of binary computers, but the augmentation of all our thinking systems. As scales increase, there may come a time when the most economical way to solve a certain problem is the actual construction of a ternary supercomputer, as opposed to its binary modeling.

"religion","t5_2qh39","&gt;In your variant of Christianity, do you need to believe that Jesus did this in order to be saved, ie, that jesus' ""sacrifice"" and your redemption was conditional?

It is conditional upon one single thing: a person's willingness to accept it.

One reason God created humanity is to give us something he never gave any creatures before us: choice. Adam and Eve were given a choice whether they would sin or not, everyone born since them have the choice to do right or wrong, and every person has the choice to accept the redemption Christ offers or not.

There are many theories as to how exactly this works. For example: Calvinists would say that God chooses which people get saved.

&gt;A Christian, even after accepting Jesus, is still a sinner, and upon death is still a sinner... so cannot enter heaven without Jesus' redemption, which he gives freely...

This is true, however for God it is not. The way I think of it is like a courtroom. God is th Judge, Christ the lawyer for the defendant, and Satan the lawyer for the prosecution. Satan accuses me of committing sins, and he's right, I have sinned. He presents evidence that I kicked a baby when I was twelve. However, Christ says that is immaterial because he already paid the price for my sins.

Does this excuse me to sin as much as I want? No. I should be less willing to sin because upon accepting Christ the Holy Spirit now dwells in me.

&gt;Does that apply to non-believers as well?

It only applies to people who chose to hire Christ as their council when they stand before God the judge.","1233466792"

The term has been used in a number of papers to refer to a generalized prototype-based approach, which isn't limited by the ideology, or the implied object construction mechanism. An object-based language may include classes and or prototypes, and or any other approach that you care to imagine.

The two terms (prototype-based and object-based) are somtimes assumed to be synonyms. This isn't actually the case if you study the literature carefully enough... but alas, this factoid isn't really documented elsewhere.

I don't see this as anti-paradigm/anti-idiology; I'm personally very fond of the prototype-based approach. I find it to be the most natural and beautiful way of modeling objects. That said, freeing languages from the constraints of ideology does have its benefits. In many cases we find that without ideology, approaches we thought were incompatible, can be combined quite readily (prototypes *and* classes for instance).

Year 9:

* American history - we briefly covered the early European settlers, and then more comprehensively covered from the late eighteenth century up to the twentieth century in various areas such as California, Texas, Utah, New England, etc. We also covered various customs and history of some Native American tribes, and some other topics such as the search for the Northwest Passage.
* British history - brief coverage of the Roman, Saxon, and Celtic civilisations, and then more indepth coverage from the Norman occupation up to the reign of Elizabeth I. 

Year 10:

* Australian history - a bit of time covering the aboriginal customs and history, but a more comprehensive look at everything from the First Fleet onwards. We looked at topics such as the Gold Rush, the 1890s, World War I, the Depression, World War II, and Vietnam. (mainly Australia's involvement and experience in the latter four, but also looking at the reasons and worldwide reactions to each)","1233467263"

You're comparing taxation to shoplifting now?  Mexicans stealing land?  Murder of children?  Gosh, who knew that Uncle Sam was a Mexican anti-Semitic shoplifting child-killer!

Taxation is not theft!  It is the price you pay to be a citizen of the United States, like rent is the price a person pays for living in an apartment.  It is the price as determined by the voters in this democracy, and they've determined that progressive taxation is fair and just.  You're free to renounce your citizenship, as many very wealthy people have done, if that's not good enough for you.  Be prepared however to lose the benefits that US has to offer to you as a citizen if that's what you choose.

Progressive taxation is fair and just because it first takes a functioning government for there to even be a society where individuals are able to prosper.  The ones who benefit the most from this society are the ones who should pay taxes in proportion to the rewards they get from it.

Study: Watching Fewer Than Four Hours Of TV A Day Impairs Ability To Ridicule Pop Culture
http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30863

You see, not owning a TV and riding a bike to work allows me to develop an abnormally large.... smugness over a large portion of the population.

At just the right hint of provocation, I can also point out that I haven't been in a hospital in over 8 years.  If I feel I haven't quite alienated the people around me enough, I can even discuss how by not taking cold pills (or any other kind of medicine), my immune system is now impervious to whatever happens to be affecting those around me.  Sometimes it goes and attacks squirrels in the backyard.

Just before everyone edges away in disgust, I might be able to work in that I bought my 5 bedroom house for $41,000, withdrew $18k in equity to pay off all other debts + remodel, and I will have my mortgage paid off in 4 years.

Usually by this point, everyone has found an excuse to stay away from me, so no one will see me cry.

It would appear that under this view it is the majority who really own things, and that they simply let me borrow them for a while. Thus, under this definition there really is no such thing as individual ownership.

The author confuses ownership (as a moral principle) with its enforcement. ""Ownership"" is a description of one's relationship to a physical thing, whether or not that's enforced is separate issue entirely. Murder is still wrong even if it somehow becomes unprosecutable. The solution isn't to invalidate a concept just because it's hard to enforce. First, you establish whether or not one _does_ have a moral claim then you address it accordingly.

Additionally, any stable property enforcement is going to be by convention+consensus at any rate. That essentially takes care of the MO of the essay.","1233467795"

I did not mean it is not wrong to murder an animal in order to eat it.  I believe there are degrees, however.  If you treat an animal with respect throughout its life, giving it shelter and food, allowing it to pass on its genes, it is natural enough to kill it for its flesh.

Same goes if you hunt down a wild animal using your own abilities and do not rely on any major technological advantages to locate, lure, or kill it.

But as I said, the ideal is a situation where we grow our flesh in vats, disconnected from any nervous system or brain, and undergo a period of (hundreds of years of) dedomestication for livestock so they may be returned to wild environments without becoming extinct.","1233467905"

I confirm this conclusion when you fail to list any concrete benefits of mashing classes and prototypes. Perhaps because you didn't understand that practical meant 'concrete'?

Let's forget any conceptual benefits of abstracting beyond 'classes + prototypes' because your loud silence on the issue leads me to think we both agree there are none.

Furthermore, to cut you off at the knees I'm going to say that you're not allowed to bring up anything GUI related as a justification for mashing classes and prototypes. And there's two reasons why.

First, WIMP is an obsolete paradigm that I am personally working on replacing. Second, everything even remotely related to GUI building is fucked.

If not for their gentile allies in the U.S., Israel would be financially unable to keep the high Jewish standard of living, and Israel would not have Uncle Sam to protect it from the UN resolutions and international diplomatic criticism. The Jewish state would collapse.

Here's some info for you: GENTILES ARE THE MOST POWERFUL ZIONISTS (Nixon, Bush, Clinton, etc.)--not Jews. The Jews merely serve in the army of the Zionist state to fight and die for Uncle Sam.

The U.S. supports Israel because Zionism binds the Jews in Israel to the U.S.--so there won't be an Iran-style revolution there. It is the most secure place in the Middle East for the U.S... The U.S. lawmakers don't need no Jewish lobby to tell them that. The U.S. gives lots of dough to Turkey, but Turkey's prime minister feels the pressure because the Turkish people hate U.S. meddling.

They are attempting, by using the same term, to make it sound as if ""Christian bashing"" is on the same level as gay bashing.  The word, when used in the context of ""[minority group] bashing"" evokes a visceral response.  Subbing out the group used makes an implicit connection between what both groups face.  Since the level of violence is nowhere near comparable, their use is deceptive.  They are essentially piggy backing on the work the gay community has done to raise awareness about the gravity of gay bashing simply by using the same word.

Second, by calling Jack Black's video ""bashing"", they dilute the impact of the word, and make actual gay bashing not seem so bad.  It's not so much the appropriation of the word that's upsetting, but the appropriation of the word *in this context*.

Your using the broad definition of the word state rather than it's specific meaning within the US government. My point was essentially that by calling it ""imperial violation"" of ""state sovereignty"" you are implying that the states are separate entities being imposed on by the federal government. When in reality they are a part of a singular government whole. By all means argue for states rights, I believe that certain things should be solely within the control of the states.

Blogspam often is in between the two where they copy and paste the entire article or content into their own blog but then usually link the original. At least the source is cited but they remove control over presentation and any updates/changes the creator may wish to make.

While I agree in giving up the naming rights, the problem is, most people don't read much into a company before deciding to do business with them.  If they have formed a positive association about the company in their mind, they are more inclined to use their product.  


Here's an example:  look at a sports team with a stadium named after a consumer product for which similar replacements exist, such as Gillette and the New England Patriots.  Ask fans of that team what they use for that product - I bet a majority use the brand.  Most Patriots fans I know use a Gillette razor - many didn't associate the use of the razor with the name of their stadium until I pointed it out to them.

The difference in wall street workers and between, say, a guy who sells TVs, is that the wall street guys had a helluva lot harder time getting the job and subsequently keeping the job, all the while taking huge (hopefully calculated) risks.  Ideally for wall street those risks pay off and you make big bucks, and because the risks were so much greater than the TV salesmen you get paid a lot more.

I have a D40. It's a great camera and you can't go wrong with it. However, unless money was critical, I would consider the D60. Although the D60 is slightly less sensitive to light, you get a newer generation of technology and slightly greater resolution to work with in post (which I do find is useful for cropping.)

With any currency that is a candidate for reserve status you need certain things, such as lots of it in circulation (as in a major economy behind it), an open market for the currency and a fairly responsible central bank running it. It is on the first that Sterling fails and on the last that the USD is failing.

The Euro is already being used as an alternate even though most basic commodities remain priced in USD.

It was cut down to *$1800* during the fall financial collapse, ostensibly because I shopped where deadbeats shopped.  But of course they don't tell you where that is!  The $1800 limit is insane... it is the lowest limit card I have, with a total of $25,000 in unused credit lines.

I run household spending through that card (whenever it is Amex capable, anyway), and pay it off in full each month.  With the new lower limit I was coming close every month, much closer than I'd like.  So I applied for a Discover ""Open Road"" card, which gives 5% cash back on gas always, and 1% on everything else.  The rewards are better than the Amex, and they gave me an $8000 credit line.

Amex better watch out.  They've long held the brand goodwill of the most elite, most highly regarded cards.  They have a reputation of superior customer service and rewards.  They'll lose all of this in a heartbeat if they keep treating their customers like shit.","1233469471"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; I mean they let their fanatical rabbi's tell their troops it's ok to kill civilians, so this isn't far from previous behaviour.

The IDF did respond to the incident you're talking about. I suspect many here might have missed that fact, since stories that reflect positively on the IDF tend to get downvoted among this crowd.

&gt; The Israeli military said on Wednesday it had reprimanded an officer behind the distribution of a booklet during the Gaza war that advised soldiers against showing any mercy to enemies.

&gt; An Israeli rights group, Yesh Din, called on Monday for the dismissal of the chief military rabbi, Brigadier-General Avichai Rontzki, saying he had authorised the booklet, written by a civilian rabbi who advocates Jewish settlement in the West Bank.

&gt; But the military, in a statement, said Rontzki had not seen the booklet before its distribution and had not approved it.

&gt; The booklet told soldiers to show no mercy because they were fighting a ""cruel enemey"" and ""murderers"" ...

&gt; **In its statement, the military said the officer responsible for distributing the booklet was ""severely reprimanded""**, but gave no further details.

&gt; The statement described the publication's distribution as an isolated incident stemming from the intense pressure of working around the clock during combat operations.

&gt; ...

&gt; ""Rontzki views these deviations as being very serious, in particular due to the fact that they may cause divisions within the IDF (Israel Defence Forces),"" the military statement said.

http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLS160060

It's up to you whether you believe the Israeli explanation exonerating the Chief Rabbi, but the fact is that the army responded to this incident and condemned the views expressed in the booklet. 

You can find extreme fundamentalist rabbis, priests, imams, and other clergy all over the world. The problem is when their views become official policy. Fortunately, that was not the case here. ","1233469477"

People in a democracy are often wrong.  Witness the election of bush.  In regards to progressive taxation, the people have also been wrong in that they got suckered into passing tax cuts for the rich.

I'm glad you formatted your comment, it makes it easier to cover topics of discussion.  First though, I'm going to admit to broad siding you for the typical Christian-tactic of ""well I'll turn this back on you"" bologna.  Please read what I have to say though, as I read your comment and considered it before commenting...

&gt;misogyny: there is this thing called male-dominated culture. Things only got a little better around the last century. First country to allow women to vote is New Zealand in 1893; the US relatively later in the 1920s. By the way. Check on reddit and you will see old vintage advertisements (i.e. tobacco) that degrade women. Well, about the Bible now. Lot wanted to give his women to the mobs, was that the right thing to do? No. He did give them his daughters but the mobs DID NOT want her. They tried to force into his home to have sex with the men. The angels blinded them that they couldn't enter. So you are blaming God for the fact that Lot wanted to offer His daughters? Lot was ungodly at the time because he was influenced by his culture to honor his guests. But it was still wrong. So what's your take on here? During that culture men treat women as a property-don't tell me you don't know that. Men commit mistakes, and they pay for mistakes.

What part of that culture requested that you allow people to rape your children?  I'd like to see historical fact for this statement, and preferably a Bible statement.  Also, a moral man following the then-known desires of this supposed God fellow would obviously not blatantly disobey the God of such strong morals on his first test of faith, now would he?  The angels accomplished many feats throughout the Bible, including slaying entire armies over nite [I'll quote you the scripture if you desire].  The angels could have stopped and told Lot *not* to do such a thing, because they obviously can handle anything.  How so?  We're talking about messengers of God, why would his powers be limited, considering the scriptures describe his powers as ""dynamic""?  It seems crude of you to turn the point of the Christian back onto me when that's not the problem of the debate here.  God later in the scriptures had the land of Canaan destroyed if I remember correctly, for child sacrifice.  Yet when Lot offered his OWN CHILDREN up for gang rape, it was ok and no need of punishment or discipline was required? He broke the supposed ideals of God being ""moral"", and let's also not mention the double standard that his wife was destroyed by being turned into a pillar of salt for disobeying God's orders.  So Lot gets away with it, his wife does not?  So yes, it's a double standard.  Period.

In terms of your consideration of misogyny, why are you defining the scenario of what ""misogyny"" is?  I didn't say Lot's actions were misogynistic, now did I?  The problem with the Bible is women being treated like a piece of property.  If you want a brief overview of the misogyny in the bible, I highly recommend (this article)[http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/womenbible.htm].  Get back to me on that if you wish...

&gt;A) He has the concept of eternity in mind, whereas we don’t. We think this life is all that is. Although our lives are a picosecond long compared to eternity, to God, this picosecond has eternal consequences. It is analogous to a bootcamp, so to speak. Our body is mortal, but our soul is not. Your soul is what matters more to God. We believe that God will pay back according to what we had done--to the soul. It’s not that God doesn’t care about our bodies. He just cares more about the soul because that is what really lasts.

Citation requested regarding the soul bit at the end there.  I never remember reading that in my Bible, and it sounds more like garbage from the pulpit.  Also, ask yourself the great question: If God has the power to fix everything right now, and right every wrong, and give a perfect life to human kind and end all problems...  why won't he just do it now?  And don't give me the ""appointed time"" speech, because that's an excuse for delay, not a logical answer to why a supposed omnipotent, all-knowing, all-powerful, dynamic powered, eternal, and perfect/moral God would have some reason to delay solving humanity's problems right now.  Also consider the oddity that God once had everything perfect, and out of ""love"" he is ""testing"" us with human imperfection, war, sickness, death, manipulation, and so on.  Honestly consider that.

&gt;B) A lot of the worldly sufferings are man-made. You don’t know how corrupted some top government officials are? Dig deeper and you will find briberies and genocides.

That's blanketing the issue and not legitimately answering it.  According to the Bible in Romans, everyone is accountable for themselves.  It's not just the politicians fault we have corruption.  Why, it was good ol' Christianity that lead to the war, rape, pillaging, and plundering of the Crusades [feel free to enlighten yourself on the subject].  Your own religion has on countless occasions contributed if not directly lead-to war between people.  Why would a God of love let his own religion be tainted and bastardized in such a way?  

&gt;C) Imagine God appears to EVERYONE, cures ALL diseases and defects, and prevents ALL deaths. By that time, EVERYONE will have to believe. This leaves no room to believe out of faith, out of awe. This kills free will. Ok…I won’t go any longer than this.

Hey, have you ever read the prophecies of the book of Daniel or Revelation, about how God intends to come down and do those very things?  I'm sorry, but you running your mouth there just backfired in your faith, because the Bible you know, actually *teaches* that God will do that.  Also, consider the fact that if God wanted to be known, why require faith until a point of personal revealing when it could have just all been avoided in the first place?  That is not logical at all.  Feel free to fire off another assbackwards comment about your own religion.  And if you wish, I'll spend some time assembling all the scriptures quoting that the Bible teaches that God will supposedly one day solve all those issues.","1233470039"

Okay let's fast-forward to a future where you can actually store that much info... to bring it back you also need the environment to be perfectly re-created. Oy vay!

&gt;Wars: Why are they recorded in the Bible? God uses Israelites to destroy the Canaanites instead of Him doing it. If you really read into what’s going on with these peoples’ lives, you wouldn’t have defended for them. Do you know that Canaanites practice child sacrifice? Do you know how bad Sodom really is? Read this, believe it or diss it: http://www.susancanthony.com/Resources/Dennis/canaan.html

This is where I again repeat my above statement regarding Canaan being destroyed by God because of child sacrifice, yet it was completely OK for Lot to sacrifice his daughters for gang rape to protect messengers of God well capable of handling themselves.  Also, consider the hypocrisy of human imperfection and God's acceptance/nonacceptance of certain articles.  He disagrees with butt sex and men/women born homosexual, yet he will heal someone born with mental retardation.  Both ""issues"" are direct results of ""human imperfection"" that God himself placed humanity under in the book of Genesis after Adam and Eve were removed from the Garden of Eden.  So now, he's a hypocrite because he'll only accept certain elements of people that fall from human imperfection and error, and slaughter those he does not.  Does that sound ""loving"" to you?  How the bloody hell can you defend a God with such a double standard over something that was HIS decision?  I didn't ask to be fallible, imperfect, and commit sin.  Why should I be punished or healed for specific elements of human imperfection if human imperfection is the direct cause of all these ""issues""?  Try to logically wrestle that one, I have yet to have a Jehovah's Witness, Catholic, Born Again, or Christian Apologist explain that one.

&gt;Christian churches do not agree on certain things because they place different emphasis on Scriptures. But all of us agree on John 3:16, which is what really matters. There are myriad ways to interpret a verse, but the central message of the Bible is in there. If Christians are all fully united already, we wouldn’t have needed Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

Umm, what?  I'm sorry, the grand majority of that really didn't add up to much in a reasonable or logical sense.  There is obviously something wrong with the Bible if we all can't agree on it's intended message or all agree upon what exactly is ""God's Plan"".  

&gt;Again, men are not perfect. If they are, we don’t need Christ. These stories show us that even the most righteous heroes in the Bible make mistakes and commit crimes like all of us do.

No, that's not the issue.  The issue is, is that a *LOT* of these Bible stories have double standards applied.  Some holy rollers were punished, others were not.  Abram was not punished for lying on two separate occasions in the book of Genesis, yet Joseph damn well knew not to fuck around with Poterfer's wife because God wouldn't approve of it.  Also, consider that Abram had divine protection for life in Genesis 12-15, yet he lied to mortal men to still save his neck, and was never admonished for it.  Yet Pharoah was punished for not obeying Moses request to free the Isrealites from Egypt, so God threw down the ""10 Plagues"" on him.  Also consider that God *defended* Abram's lying in the book Genesis and threatened to kill Abimolech [sp?] for it.  So yes, I ask what lessons can be garnered from laws from the same source, God, being unevenly applied and upheld?  Have fun answering that one too...

&gt;Come on, browse the reddit headlines, or even Digg for that matter. A couple recent ones will be: couple faced trails for not taking their child for treatment because they think they can rely on prayers; woman accused a person for being a bad driver because he/she is atheist; Bush yearned for a holy war……people just upvote these news and bash Christians and call them idiots…Don’t tell me you haven’t seen these.

So you agree with the retardation of these Christians and their actions?  You think it's ok an innocent child due to neglectful parenting over a religion?  Whatever happened to Christians having a ""sanctity for life"" and viewing life as precious?  Were those actions logical?  What about all the innocent men, women, the children, the pregnant mothers, and the elderly slaughtered at the hands of Christian peoples for the last 2,000+ years?  You going to honestly sit here and tell me that news coverage and documentation of these events is just ""Christian bashing""?

Also consider that you're leaping into a community of atheists' posting, and you're upset by what they say?  Have you ever considered how offensive you are to them?  Use some logic man...

&gt;My view is: scrutinize everything..be it a Bible or a tabloid. You don’t think I had doubts about the Bible? But what I did do was scrutinizing before making conclusions. Look at all the anti-Israeli headlines and tell me if most redditors had really scrutinized everything, including the whole history of this conflict.

You have doubts about the Bible?  Why are you basing your entire life, argument, lifestyle, and manner of day-to-day routines to something you don't have 100% confidence in?  I'm glad you said to scrutinize the Bible, and tabloids, and so on.  It's good to consider all things, on all fronts.  That's probably the first intelligent thing you've said so far that I haven't been able to destroy/refute by using simple logic and reasoning.  Honestly, why are trying to convince everyone else your religion is true above all others if you have doubts?  Honestly, that deserves a ""fuck you"" for being that low.  If you can't fully believe in it, how dare you scrutinize atheists for not believing in at all.  Honestly, fuck you.

&gt;Call me any names you want. You don’t like my take on Christian humor? Did I really sound as bitter as you do when I typed up those concise lines? You prefer this long post? By the way, your response also supports my point No. 4.

Honestly, I enjoy long conversations and I don't mind considering all sides of an argument or debate, as I believe it's fair.  So me being bitter totally eliminates my argument and proves that your doubt-filled faith is better than mine?  You are a bigot, a hypocrite, and a moron.  That solidifies the statement right there.  In regard to your ""point No.4"" [it's cute when Christians try to get all official on trash they type up to try and prove their point over everyone else], I didn't really insult your intelligence hardcore until this here very post in which I quote you, and show you how you're wrong, and ask you critical questions regarding your religion... the religion you have doubts over, might I add [hey you said it, not me].

&gt;You don’t like my take on Christian humor?

You were the one offended and making a big stink about it.  QQ, want a tissue now?  Also, where did I state that your IQ was just double digits?  Also, are you stating that all people with double digit IQs are unintelligent?  Bigot.

&gt;Of course I anticipate that in the atheism subreddit section.

So you're intentionally being an ass in a category topic that doesn't apply to you?  If you're a Christian, with doubts about the very book your basing your life on, why are you going and intentionally involving yourself in the opposition to your religion to stir up debate and have the requirement to explain being downmodded?  Sounds a bit illogical to me.  Oh well.  Feel free to argue with me, it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  I'd prefer actual ""answers"" though, as God/preaching/religious statements/zeal don't actually serve to come up with logical answers to the serious issues regarding Christianity.

To start, howlingman is correct on everything. You'll need to know spec. If you're not using Final Draft, start now. Writing to spec is the equivalent of syntax for a programmer. You must follow it, or you'll get compiling errors (aka rejections).

You'll need to hone your pitching skills. In many ways, they're more important than your writing skills, especially for newcomers to the business. Then hunt furiously for places and events to pitch.

Finally, release your paranoia of someone stealing your script. Let it go. If you're good at what you do, your idea is but one of many facets of a successful career. Your connections are what count. If you hold back getting your ideas in front of people in fear of getting it ""stolen"" you're only preventing your own career from taking off. With that said, you do need to choose who you do business with wisely. 

Starting your own on youtube... for 99% of the population, this is not a good idea and even counterproductive. Unless you're connected enough to turn this into a quality production with solid marketing; but if you have all that, you wouldn't be a self-proclaimed ""nobody.""

"business","t5_2qgzg","Part of the problem is that each of these companies is typically a holding company or is simply very large, with multiple sub-companies, subsidiaries, etc, under it.  The reported number that everyone is talking about is $18bn in bonuses on ""Wall Street"" - whatever that means, exactly.  One article I was reading was actually numbers from the New York controller, who is getting that from tax receipts of employees employed in financial firms *in New York* so that actually doesn't include the main offices of several of the troubled large banks.

In any case, one of the biggest issues is that the multi-subunit nature of these companies means the greater financial trouble might be caused by just one subsidiary, and the rest are profitable.  This was true at AIG, which was brought down by a 300 person division called ""AIG Financial Products.""

How do you deal with this?  Most likely the people working in the retail banking division of, say, Citi Group have absolutely no connection to the bond traders that were connected to these losses.  They may not even share facilities.  The managers of the retail banking division are likely running a profitable business (and worse, are insulted by the fact that their colleagues screwed up and they're subsidizing it!).  Their employment terms probably state they'll receive a performance bonus - and their division HAS been profitable!

Furthermore, there are ""Wall Street"" companies that have been profitable.  Brokerages that don't trade themselves.  Financial planners.  Exchanges (such as NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ, BATS...).  Since the term ""Wall Street"" is so nonspecific, I'd really like to see a more detailed breakdown of where these bonuses are being paid out before dishing out judgement.","1233470444"

Karl Rove's history of underhanded tactics is long and sordid. At the tender age of 19, he broke into the campaign of Illinois Democrat Alan Dixon, stole a letterhead and printed fake campaign rally fliers that promised free food and beer and distributed them at rock concerts and homeless shelters.  Soon afterward, Rove dropped out of college and went to work as the Executive Director of the College Republican National Committee before becoming the national chairman, which is how he met the Bush family.

In 2003,  retired ambassador, Joseph Wilson published an opinion piece in the New York Times that suggested the Bush administration misrepresented intelligence findings to justify going to war with Iraq.  Shortly after the publication, the name of Wilson's wife was identified as a CIA operative.  The evidence points to Rove as the architect of the leak.

Karl Rove has until now enjoyed a long successful but shady career employing underhanded tricks to obfuscate the truth and win elections for Republicans.  He has been so successful at dirty tricks that the term ""Rovian"" has entered into the national vernacular to denote underhanded tactics that border on criminal.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","[This article](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/12/02/MNPQTIG6U.DTL) I found, while trying to get a straight answer about the accuracy of these tests, might be interesting for you to read.

I personally haven't done anything to this extent, but about 10 years ago (in high school) I did something in a week-long summer genetics program. IIRC, we took samples from ourselves and went through the whole process to sequence our mDNA, or at least a portion of it. We then had the sequence entered into an 
electronic database, and got to compare our sample to some random things they had, like animals, prehistoric humans from particular regions, etc. I have to say, I wasn't that impressed, as some people were matching fish better than anything else, though I believe this was before there was significant work done to sequence the genetic makeup of people by race and region (their ""reference populations"") for geneological/scientific purposes. Anyway, the digital comparison part was more for fun than anything.

Personally, I don't believe they're actually that accurate, or useful, and seem like a waste of money. I won't go as far as to call it a scam, but there is no real way for them to know for sure that their results are right; they're really just calculated estimates. Keep in mind that people have been migrating and mating for ages; the supposedly racially/ethnically ""pure"" reference populations that they use can and probably mostly have experienced miscegenation. Outside of that, there's still other things that can go wrong.

Anyway, my personal opinion on genealogy is that I'd rather know when exactly people moved, mated, etc., and why. Any races that I'm not aware of have little to do with who I am, because the effects of those cultures have blended in with everything else. That's what I think, though, according to my own personal experience and feelings about race, ethnicity and culture. I know that a lot of genealogical testing is done by African-Americans, for example, to try and establish a connection where there is no paper trail and ties were forcibly cut. Unfortunately for them, I don't think this kind of testing is really capable of helping to make up for that.","1233471109"

"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","&gt; Researchers expected women to have a leg up in judging romantic interest, because theoretically they have more to lose from a bad relationship, but no such edge was found.

The 317th good reason why stamping something with ""evolutionary explanation"" doesn't make it science.

For all the retards out there, there's a difference between real science and mythology made up by scientists. And that difference is *experimentation*. Or alternatively, intractable reams of math.

&gt; Evolutionary theory, said Place, predicts a certain level of coyness or even deceptiveness in women because if a relationship is abandoned they may face greater costs, including pregnancy and child rearing

Given the failure of what ""evolutionary theory"" predicted just two minutes ago, I'd say it doesn't fucking matter until it's verified by an experiment. An adequate experiment to verify THIS prediction would involve measuring the reproductive success of deceptive vs non-deceptive women over a couple generations and a thousand individuals. The experiment would involve assigning women and men to two random groups, one of whose members had a working lie detector implanted in each of their foreheads for all to see.","1233471160"

Now, why it matters is more of a social question, akin to asking why it mattered if a person was black in the '30s.

So-called ""dual use"" items have caused lots of problems for Israel in the past.

This is a real burden for the humanitarian agencies, who sometimes lose track of stuff like any other organization does. But when Israel isn't satisfied with an agency's auditing reports, it then restricts the agency from bringing in any more dual-use items to Gaza. 

The whole situation is very difficult for all parties concerned: for the Israelis, who get blamed for not letting in aid but face a genuine security threat; for the humanitarian agencies, who aren't allowed to bring in sorely needed aid; and most of all for the Palestinian civilians, who need these items for vital infrastructure like water purification.","1233471383"

Furthermore, don't get pissy just because you were wrong; you made the poor assumption.

Anyway.

It's well known that classes are good for modeling static, well defined sets related objects. It's also well known that prototypes are good for modeling dynamic, poorly defined sets of individual objects; taking advantage of existing knowledge. In fact Lieberman highlighted this as the primary motivation for prototype-based programming in the very first paper on the subject (in computer science anyway).

The benefits are clear; if you're working with static, well defined objects, use a class. This would be useful in production systems where people have always been dubious of prototypes. On the other hand, if you're working with more fuzzier concepts, perhaps doing some exploration, use prototypes. Obviously this would be useful for prototyping (not that it wouldn't be useful elsewhere!)

(All of this is well documented and really common sense; that's why I didn't feel the need to go into detail.)

Of course, whole books have been written on the two and to expect a detailed analysis of the either approach is unreasonable. What's important is that two mechanisms have clearly orthogonal uses, so the associated benefits of each can be applied without complication. The fact that they aren't doesn't bother me, but the potential is there, even if it's untapped. 

In my opinion the real benefit of object-based programming (as opposed to prototype-based or class-based programming) comes from the implication that the language abstracts the object construction mechanisms. As such, you're completely free to create your own. 

One practical benefit of this is that new inheritance mechanisms can introduced and layered (layered inheritance), enforcing encapsulation (object-based encapsulation is naturally stronger than class-based encapsulation anyway) and potentially defeating many of the common problems associated with inheritance (poor code reuse; difficulties ensuring sub-typing; complex hierarchies etc).

Real pick-a-mix programming. Take what you want, leave what you don't.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; How can an arbitrary limit on compensation, not result in a reduction in the possible candidates for employment?

Supposedly a company has some guiding vision that attracts talent to begin with.  So what's the point in defending a struggling brand if the brand has no value?  If the brand brings nothing to the table?

&gt; How can a reduction in possible candidates for employment be a ""good thing"" for a struggling company?

It's not a good thing.  The fact that ""a decade of profit and re-investment"" isn't actually capable of covering ""a single year of losses"" when it comes to solvency is pretty damning.  Slashed capital gains and ""bonus profit re-investment"" actually takes the form of legislating relaxation of 'regulations for mergers' to enable graft.  Plain and simple.  Why prevent companies from struggling if they bring no values to the table?

&gt; How is your local team supposed to rebuild the team if their hands are tied from acquiring the higher level players due to the limits on compensation? This isn't a recipe for success.

'Local' teams and 'pro' teams are different things.  If your 'local' team *needs* to pay a player a *bonus* that is larger than the salary of the president, they have a spending problem or a terrible salary.  When your team goes 'pro' and, again, your brand adds no value, it should be no surprise that your 'pro' players strike out on their own.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Censorship:
""The suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable, harmful or sensitive, as determined by a censor.""

You play the role of the censor by deciding that his show is objectionable. You then participate in the act of censorship by attempting to suppress his speech by working to undermine his access to the medium that delivers the speech. No funding means no access and a diminished voice for his viewpoint.  It is the very definition of censorship.

I don't like most of what he says, but I'm not going to spend the time or effort to try to censor him into stopping. Making his point of view irrelevant is more effective than taking out the man.  Killing the idea makes it less likely that someone else will step up once he's gone.  

In other words, don't focus on Rush personally, doing so makes him relevant. Debunk the arguments with facts and reason.","1233472643"

Others - including diplomats as well as officials of the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority - are just as infuriated by Israel's ban on moving cash in from outside.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","The only option isopropyl has is to leave his family and not look back.. and to this I would only recommend this suggestion once he is in a right state of mind to stand on his own two feet without too much guilt or too much self imposed negative thoughts. Only when he has come to that point in life where he realizes that it is HIS life to make or break and in realizing that freedom he also has to recognize the responsibility of that freedom. He seems very smart, he seems very aware of what is right and what is wrong and in touch with what is in agreement to his own path in life, it's more a matter of not doubting that belief which has arose within him and not succumbing to the pressures the family puts on him. To this end.. I share such a burden.

I myself had the same option, to be in the position where I could have left, but did not take it. In fact, had I taken it I would have had a better quality of life, I would have been something and someone... the person whom I had wanted to be. Instead I decided to stick with my family and now I am imprisoned by their ignorance. I can only move in my own life based upon the boxes which they have limited themselves and myself to. As an example, my cousin was not allowed to marry the love of her choice because her love was of a tailor class (based upon his last lame as given to him) and she was a farmer class. Forget the fact that he is an awesome guy and would not only make a great husband but a great father. Of what importance do these things have in North America? None - but these are the things that our parents grew up with and hence hold to be true. But that story is mine.. and a whole nother topic.

Most East Indian families are like mafia families..  if that makes any sense. The family is all you have. You do not share or discuss the family issues with anyone. It is your community, you do things for the community not for the self. If you shame the family, you shame the community and you can NEVER live that down. In fact, in certain circumstances you will encounter physical harm if not verbal abuse and torment.

The thinking that our peoples have are steeped in culture that has not evolved itself. Sikhism, as wonderful as a modern philosophy as it is, but it is not adopted as modern due to the deep cultural influences. If isopropyl were to shave his beard and cut his hair.. that would go against the fundamentalism which his family believes in. The very fact that his father is a devout Sikh man, yet practices plastic surgery as a living, dictates the hypocritical irony in how he makes his living yet chooses the faith he does to guide him in life. It is akin to having someone who is an Atheist working in Sunday school.. or someone who advocates for PETA yet sells fur coats. 

The trouble is, that his family believes one thing yet chooses to live another. They pick and choose their beliefs yet try to enforce what he should think as well. 

Again, if there is that trouble brewing in his heart, he needs to attend to it.. and I say again, that he has to cultivate courage to do so. And due to EI families being how they are... I argue that he must leave them to do so.

isopropyl, my brother, I hope you have read this.. and I ask you to share your thoughts. Please correct me if I am incorrect or misguided in anything I have written.

I sincerely wish you nothing but peace love and happiness.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Why can't a partner ask you to convert religions or stop masturbating? I know a few people who converted to a different religion for their spouse because the spouse said if you want to marry me you will convert. Their choice was convert or end the relationship. I think they are stupid but it was their choice to stay and convert. 

I know people who agree to share email and all passwords. They don't believe a couple should have separate private email accounts. I think it's batshit crazy but it's something they agreed to. If the husband is caught with some secret email account then it's his own fault for agreeing to it then going behind her back. He should have just told her it's a stupid idea and if that's a deal breaker then he should move on.

Your partner can ask you to beat off sheep if they want. If you don't agree then find someone else. Hopefully these things are dealt with up front and not 15 years down the road.

The whole point here is you shouldn't have to be going behind someone's back to do anything whether it is looking at porn or practicing whatever religion you want. The other person should accept you for who you are, and if they don't then stop wasting your time with the bitch and find someone who does. ","1233473521"

Also, on OSX it is handy to save:

As something shorter like `disas` so you can quickly see a disassembly of any mach-O binary, complete with human readable C++ function names.

I also had an elaborate script to get a hex dump of the __text section of a mach-o via `otool`, pass it through `sed` to format it as naked hexdump (minus addresses and formatting), convert it to raw binary via `xxd`, and then disassemble it via `ndisasm` – all to get an intel-syntax disassembly.

You'd only have a single (h.264 encoded) file/stream that could be played with or without Flash.

Generally, instead of trying to replace Flash with technology X, go with a subset of Flash features. Use Tamarin, which is the open-sourced Flashplayer VM, and add a renderer that supports a subset of the API. Developers could then stick to that subset, so users of the FOSS replacement could play it, and those that don't have it yet could still view it in the Flashplayer.

Yesterday news filtered out that an Israeli official admitted that the escalation in Gaza was being used as an argument for strikes against Iran.

Today Netanyahu comes out with this.

It all flies in the face that the IAEA still to date say they have not seen any evidence in Iran of an active nuclear weapons programme and that Ahmadinejad faces a presidential election in June later this year, when his coalition party last year could only secure 88seats out of 260 on the day of the government election, the rest going to anti-Ahmadinejad conservative opponents, reformists and independents.

They don't want to attack Iran because of a threat to security.  They want to attack Iran because it will readdress the Arab-Persian balance of power in the region, blocking Russia and China from becoming more active regional counterbalances to Israel's dominance through manipulation of the US.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The fact of the matter is that those roads span practically all of the West Bank. In the last 40+ years (since Israel's occupation of the West Bank in 1967), Israel has been building settlements in strategic locations in the West Bank. Those settlements are connected by Israeli-only-accessible roads, effectively cutting off Palestinian cities from each other. Besides stifling the Palestinian economy, these roads also limit the growth of Palestinian cities, creating a sense of being stuck in a large prison.

There are some roads accessible to Palestinians that connect major Palestinian cities. The caveat is that such roads make wide detours around Israeli roads and settlements. For example, traveling from Bethlehem to Ramallah takes about 20-30 minutes if you go through Jerusalem. But Palestinians from the West Bank aren't allowed to enter Jerusalem, making their trip at least 1.5 hours long, and often much longer due to Israeli checkpoints. With Ramallah being the major economic center of the West Bank, many Palestinians from Bethlehem make this trip daily. Most leave as early as 5am, just to make sure they arrive at their jobs on time, and get back home anytime from 5pm to 10pm, and sometimes even later than that.","1233474023"

This is being modded down because, while English is easy for a European or a Chinese person to learn, English is extremely difficult for a Japanese person to learn.  I'll spare this forum the list of differences between the languages, but it boils down to forgetting how to talk and relearning from the ground up.

The thing is, they could have learned English.  They were supposed to do so in junior high and high school, but most Japanese people don't.

&gt; Writing docs is really, really, hard. Writing a good JIT is really, really, hard. Writing a good GC is really, really, hard. Indeed, the MRI team doesn't attempt anything that's really, really, hard. The question is, then, are they trying to build a production-quality language with state of the art technology or are they just goofing around?

The more I try to disagree with this, the more I agree with it.  A lack of documentation wastes other people's time, so the developers are claiming that their time is more important than anybody else's.  Now, I have no interest in a dynamically-typed object-oriented language, so saying that they should share my priorities would be hypocritical, but I'm reasonably confident that asserting that the devs' time is more important than the users' is not a good way to grow a community.

From my point of view, the more people get riled up and seek out the truth, the better off the LGBT community is.  And I only found you guys after googling the video, trying to figure out where all the hits were coming from.

So a few points:
1.  No group or person ""owns"" a word.
2.  The religious right is making extensive use of the terms ""intolerance"" and ""hate speech"" and now ""bashing.""
3.  This practice is so widespread that it seems like this is a deliberate attempt to dilute the meaning of these words as used by the gay community.
4.  I believe that when gays talk about ""intolerance"" they're referring to an organized, well-financed effort by a minority of Christians to deprive them of legal rights, while when that subgroup of Christians talk of ""intolerance"" they're referring to people who are merely protesting being stripped of their rights.
4.  Anyone who seriously reviews the US gov't documents at http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/incidents.htm must recognize that ""Christian bashing"" is a laughable term in the US when compared to gay bashing.
5.  It is important that we not allow the religious right to trivialize terms like ""intolerance"" and ""hate speech"" and ""bashing"" by pretending their experience is the same as ours.

That's the intellectual foundation behind the video.  You may disagree with it, but as I said, the more open and honest the conversation, the more gays come out ahead.  To quote Thomas Jefferson, ""

Torture also ordered halted.

Obama has expressed very clear opposition to a lot of what's in Patriot II (aka DSEA), and has already stopped some of those practices even though he's only been in office a couple of weeks.  I'm sure he would support legislative reversal there too.

"business","t5_2qgzg","The Obama administration is gearing up for a “big bang” announcement within the next two weeks that will combine a bank clean-up with measures to reduce home foreclosures and probably steps to kick-start credit markets.

The plan will involve an overhaul of the troubled asset relief programme – the $700bn bail-out fund – including strict curbs on compensation at banks receiving public aid. The Tarp overhaul is intended to restore public confidence in what is a deeply unpopular programme and ensure that taxpayer money is not used to fund excessive pay, bonuses and dividends to shareholders.

“There will definitely be a cap of some sort on bonuses,” said a Wall Street executive who has taken part in talks with the authorities. “The political climate is such that there is a need to punish Wall Street.”

The announcement, which officials said was likely late this coming week or the week after, will follow Friday’s news that the US economy contracted at an annualised rate of 3.8 per cent in last year’s final quarter – less than analysts were expecting, but still the worst quarter since 1982. The fall was cushioned by ballooning inventories, which suggest the economy could shrink faster than expected in the first quarter.

The “big bang” approach reflects the belief of Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, and Lawrence Summers, National Economic Council director, that the Bush administration was wrong to dribble out policy initiatives. Mr Geithner intends to present a “comprehensive” plan that policymakers hope will command market confidence.

Details of the financial overhaul are being finalised and have yet to be approved by President Barack Obama, but it may include both the purchase of toxic assets by a “bad bank” and insurance-style guarantees for problem assets remaining on bank balance sheets.

Anti-foreclosure efforts are likely to focus on subsidising programmes that reduce unsustainable monthly mortgage payments, though there may also be support for schemes that subsidise the partial writedown of loans that exceed the value of the home. Treasury may also unveil new efforts to revitalise dysfunctional securitisation markets.","1233474812"
"reddit.com","t5_6","I count it the same way too, and our currency in Sweden is akin to the Canadian one: different colours and sizes for different denominations. The thing is I can tell without rifling through a stack if it's homogenous or not, and if it is I won't have to *check* any bills, I just quickly transfer them from one hand to the other while counting the total number of bills (pushing them from one stack to the other with my thumb, holding the two stacks pretty much parallell).

If it isn't homogenous, I tend to sort and count the stack at the same time, by sticking bills in between my fingers in the receiving hand.

Any of the methods shown in the video is fast for a stack of money which you *know* is homogenous, but you can't tell from looking at a stack of US currency whether it is homogenous or not. Which is probably what neilk meant.","1233474825"

I'm not a fan of the public school system, which is based off of Prussian experiments in training soldiers in unquestioning obedience and loyalty and was brought over to North America to train factory workers to have the same attitudes during the industrial revolution. I think it is fundamentally flawed because of it's starting points.

I am not a fan of nationalism or patriotism in any form, but I recognize and am very happy that Canadians are more British than American when it comes to the amount of questioning and outright scorn we show our leaders.

The use of the word ""pride"" for many of these things is something I find to be stupid. Why are people ""proud"" of their family name or of the country they were born into by genetic chance. Respect? yes. Happiness? yes. But pride should be reserved for things you did yourself. This is a little blurred by the fact that I don't mean the type of pride in a sentiment like ""My friend Bob just graduated with honors, I'm proud of him, he worked really hard"", but the other kind.

I'm not going to fight to ban the national anthem being sung in schools or anything, but I do support anyone who is uncomfortable with their children singing it at school.","1233474942"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Actually, that all made sense. You know, I've had long periods of unemployment too, and it can drag you down. Have you ever been to see a really good career counsellor? I'm saying this because I firmly believe that it's never too late to go back, study, and start off in a new direction. I started my first uni course aged 23, because I'd done so badly at school I had insufficient results and had to wait to be a mature age student. 15 years later, I did teaching, and only just recently, I did another degree! You may be a bit like me - a lot of my sense of direction in life didn't kick in until after my 20s. 

As for the eczema, I sympathise. I get psoriasis, but usually it's just nuisance value, but it gets worse when I'm stressed! How long is it since you looked into treatment? New things come up every so often. I know it can be hard to stick to a treatment routine - I tend to do it for a while then get all half-hearted.

I know this has been suggested many times before, but you may not have seen it. Have you ever considered doing voluntary work of some kind? You like animals, if your ferretty pals are any indication. Could you spare some time for unwanted dogs and cats, horses or donkeys? The shelters are usually crying out for more help. The benefits are many. One, you are really helping out where it is needed. Two, you get out, get busy, and meet other people. You never know what job leads, or simply new friends, may come out of that. Three, it looks good on your resume. Just a thought!","1233474956"

The crew did nothing to try to fix the problem, and the pilot wouldn't keep his mouth shut. These people paid through the nose for those seats and did everything in their power to be covered.  If you went to a restaurant and ordered the most expensive meal on the menu and were willing to pay for it, and they brought out a basket of bread that had mold all over it and then delivered the cheapest thing on the menu--don't tell me you wouldn't be upset and maybe say something less than complimentary to your waiter and the manager and the cook if you could them to come out where you COULD yell at them.

I don't we're disagreeing, I'm just saying that it's inherently an *unreasonable thing* to ask for in the first place. 

Furthermore, I'd be willing to bet that these deal breakers are pushed on people a long time after they've invested considerably in the relationship, at which point it's just easier to issue a white lie than to face up that particular piece of bullshit.

Since you always have to deal with *some* amount of bullshit in a relationship, issuing an unreasonable demand is effectively laying a guilt minefield you can exploit later at your own leisure.

Thus, it's unreasonable to divorce someone over hiding porn because it's an unreasonable request in the first place, and you were setting yourself up for failure.

On the one hand, you have all these top executives effectively giving each other huge raises and bonuses (consider that the board of directors for a given company often consists of top executives from other companies, so naturally, in order to secure a big raise for themselves, the give other CEOs big raises too).

On the other, this is the system.  It's capitalism.  You can't regulate it or control it, lest you end up with a state-controlled economy.  Plus, a guy with Iger's experience and skills would probably balk at a halving of his performance bonus - he could simply go elsewhere, and Disney loses a (presumably) talented CEO.  And yes - the value of a good CEO is probably worth the extra $10 million, since to the balance sheet of a company as large as Disney (~$35 billion in revenue), it could be worth hundreds of millions, if not more.","1233475681"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Human society is highly sensitive to, and aware of, sources of pleasure. Every source of pleasure is a potential game changer; able to disrupt the socio-economic machinery we depend on for life to function smoothly. Unless a source of pleasure can be integrated into the system in such a way that it contributes to the smooth functioning of society, channeling our urges toward productive ends, people will suppress it with all power available to them. To the extent sexual pleasure is integrated into our social machinery (one man marries one woman, produces stable family unit) it's celebrated. To the extent that it's not (fornication, strip clubs, porn) it's suppressed. Perhaps it's quietly tolerated if it diffuses even more disruptive behaviors, such as rape. The reason drugs were originally banned was that it wasn't seen as a productive source of pleasure, which is perhaps true, or at least understandable. But when crime emerged as a direct result of the illegality of drugs, it had the unfortunate effect of amplifying the perception that drugs were disruptive to society. Which in turn ratcheted up the pressure to illegalize drugs. Which lead to more crime. This negative feedback loop--this death spiral, if you will--has given us the resource-draining, soul-killing clusterfuck we know today as the war on drugs.","1233475846"

And it followed on from an exchange I was having with malcontent which went like this:

&gt;[glengyron] Which Arabs can't serve in the military?

&gt;[malcontent] The arabs in israel.

We've now shown numbers that indicate that people from all three Arab groups can serve in the Military.  Incidentally the numbers of Druze and Bedouin is closer to 400,000, but your argument about them being a minority within a minority is true.

You're wrong about the exclusion of most Arab people from service.  They choose not to serve because they don't respect the IDF.  The main problem for those that choose to serve is that like other Arab groups (particularly Bedouin) they're given fairly crap jobs, and certainly can't get into the elite units (for the most part).  If you can find me an example of an Arab being refused the opportunity to serve I'd love to see it.

I'm not denying the proportions that serve, in fact, I've brought your attention to the statistics through Haaretz.  But the initial argument, that Arabs are actually *all excluded* is clearly wrong.

I can forgive people for not realizing that you've been able to write and run real code in Perl 6 for three and a half years, but if you've missed fourteen releases of a software project, you're really not paying much attention.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I don't.

I'm Buddhist, but I don't believe in reincarnation. For me it's the weirdest part of Buddhism, the most like what you get from revealed religion--irrational, impossible to prove, and, as far as I know, impossible to experience in any meaningful sense of that word (explicitly excluding delusion and hallucination).

So it's always a shock when I watch an interesting dhamma talk and suddenly the topic turns to reincarnation.

That was the case with this otherwise lovely talk by the always interesting and entertaining Ajahn Brahm:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpeNJx7pctY

This would be a great talk to point someone to who was curious about the nature of Buddhism. 

Except for the part where he says he likes ""teaching people how to access their past selves."" I mean, come on. That's crazy talk. Do you teach them to levitate after that?

On the other hand, the rest of the talk is precisely about how you should accept nothing on the basis of someone else's authority. So, in this case, I certainly don't accept the claims of authority.

I used to feel the same way about Karma, but one day I had an understanding of what that is. It's not some sort of cosmic accounting system. It's simply the fact that you will live with the knowledge of what you've done. If you choose to do evil, you'll cause yourself to suffer. If choose not to, you'll not cause yourself to suffer.

So I think a few years back I would have thought that was a crazy idea, just as I do about reincarnation now. But I'm far, far more dubious about reincarnation.

I'm curious to know what others think.","1233476406"

If you're trying to day trade, you'll probably have to use some basic forms of technical analysis for timing purposes (this is very hard to do), but when looking at the market over the long term, technical analysis is complete garbage.

Fundamental analysis, however, is legitimate and recommended. P/E, P/B, Debt/Equity, and many more are all certain measurements someone can use on a company to find out whether or not it's overbought/oversold.

This article doesn't do any of that. Instead, it uses macroeconomic news (which has already been priced into the market, see [Efficient-Market Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis)).

The only reason Turkey is a fascist state is cause of Kemalism started by Ataturk. Read his true history. He was homo and was a Jew, and a British spy and he was also the cause of the fall of Turkey. If it werent for him, Turkey would be way different. They wouldnt stand by like pussies and just talk. THey'd show teeth with their muscle. Turks know one thing and that is war. One flexed muscle, and Israel wouldnt even have dared to fucking invade palestine. Turkey's population exceeds 270 million and is also the head of the eastern countries. If Turkey rises, so does many others and they might even join Turkey. That is why it is of utmost importance that Turkey be controlled extremely well and that is what America is currently doing. If Turkey was left alone, their new empire would even surpass the one before it which laid fear to every single nation in Europe, Asia, and Africa.
PS. You will not understand why Turkey's population is over 270 million unless you do some mad research and increase your understanding a million fold. Don't come to me with some fucking zionist Wikipedia article that says 70 or so million. I will call you an idiot.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; Nothing in history is better known or better documented than the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

9/11. Millions of Americans witnessed it firsthand and live on TV. There's physical evidence that planes crashed into the World Trade Center towers, causing them to collapse. There are actual survivors still alive today that escaped the towers or picked through the rubble. There are some conspiracy theorists which dispute some particulars of the attacks, or chime in with who they think *really* was responsible, but even they will agree that 9/11 actually happened.

The life and death of Jesus Christ is documented only in the Bible, which was written by anonymous authors over a period of centuries. First-century historian Josephus mentions Jesus, but only in the context that Christians are followers of Jesus, in the same way that Ancient Egyptians were followers of Ra. Major portions of the story of his life and death seem to be borrowed from other, older myths or strain credulity -- unless you believe in magic and miracles. And speaking of documentation, decades of Jesus' life are not written of anywhere, like from age 12-29. While it's possible there was an actual historical Jesus, you could make a compelling argument for Jesus being entirely fictional.","1233477146"

If what you meant was essentially that the US should stay out of other countries business you should have avoided using a term that has an entirely different meaning within the context of the US government, which our conversation was about, without clarification.

Additionally, given that there are many people within the US who believe that the federal government is the problem and that the states need more self determination, I think it is a fair and reasonable interpretation of your statement rather than a ""twisted application of language"".

In summary clearly there was a communications error due to the unintentional use of language that has a different meaning within the context of the US government, and I don't think I was the only one mislead.

Given this new definition of your statement I would largely agree, although I would argue that the ""Main"" issue for most US citizens is the economy right now.

However, a variety of opinions exist:

* In Thailand, the 20th century monk Buddhadasa rewrote karma and reincarnation to be a specific understanding of positivist reality.
* On the other hand, a Sri Lankan monk in Japan (the most prominent Theravada Buddhist in Japan, in case anyone cares) told me that karma is the one part of Buddhism that people are not meant to study, question, or confirm with their own experience. If it bothers you, he said, you should ignore it until you reach Buddhahood.
* Pure Land, True Pure Land, and Nichiren-shuu actually make reincarnation the center of their teachings to the point of ignoring all other practices, but they are the most socially active forms of Buddhism in Japan today.
* The Zen of Dougen ignores reincarnation altogether, but in Zen as practiced at Japanese monasteries, it is central to their ritual (thanks Keizan!!)

In terms of ""teaching people how to access their past selves"", all Theravada monks I have talked to would agree this is spirtualism and not Buddhism. One thing you probably should note is that Buddhism in practice throughout Southeast Asia incorporates astrology and superstition into its teachings on a daily basis.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Most Jews worldwide believe Israel should exist in some form, therefore it's OK to desecrate a synagogue? 

I didn't say it was OK. I said it was understandable.

It would be much better to boycott israeli companies, companies that have plants and design facilities in israel, and of course encouraging your govt, school, business etc to completely divest itself of all israeli investments.

Nothing would work better than a boycott, certainly not damaging a building.

&gt;? Oh, and way to fail to back up Jews worldwide (including those in Israel) who support a Palestinian state.

There is a vast gap between ""I support a palestenian state in theory"" and ""the palestenians should get all of the land stolen from them back"".

Anybody can be for a palestenian state as long as they get to draw the lines.

The fact of the matter is that you will have to search far and wide to find a jew who would support giving back jerusalem, going back into the borders of the original mandate or even giving back all the land taken in 1967.


&gt;Oh, and you agree that it's silly to fuss about a little mosque desecration as long as some Muslim, somewhere, has done something terrible?

Mosques have been desecrated, children in mosques have been gassed, muslims have been shot dead on the street, sikhs have been shot dead because some dork confused them with muslims. Muslims have been rounded up the FBI and expelled from the country. Muslims have been tortured by the US govt and then let go because they were innocent US citizens.

Think of the worst thing you can think of, it's happened. Not only has it happened but it has been vigorously defended and loudly cheered.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; These are not relevant to discussing other universes.

Flatland is relevant because it illustrates a situation in which beings in a 2D universe could be completely unaware of beings in the 3D universe that contains them, whereas those in the 3D universe could affect the 2D universe arbitrarily.  String theory is relevant because it involves greater numbers of dimensions, which could achieve this kind of scenario in various ways, depending on the exact string theory being used, ranging from Karch's dimensional pockets to branes connected by hidden dimensions, where to its inhabitants, each brane is a universe in its own right.

&gt; What's the problem with the dictionary definition of supernatural?

There's no problem with it.  The problem is with your interpretation of it.  ""Supernatural"" implies something beyond the nature we can perceive.  An example of this would be another universe or dimension.

Here's a relevant definition of [nature](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=nature) from Wordnet: ""a causal agent creating and controlling things in the universe"".

Note ""in the universe"".  There's a reason for that being included in the definition.  The philosophical situation changes once we're considering entities existing outside our universe.  Issues arise such as whether we're capable of observing it and whether we're capable of understanding it.

But talking about external *physical* universes is somewhat of a red herring here.  Consider the standard ""supernatural"" notion of the Judeo-Christian God.  It exists in some context - allegedly, that context includes a place known as heaven, among other things.  To us, that context is supernatural by definition.  It would not, however, be supernatural to this god.  The fact that this environment is natural to a god doesn't automatically make it natural to us.  If it were natural to us, in principle we could build a vehicle to take us there.

The exact same situation would apply to some physical universe that's inaccessible to ours.  You seem to want to use ""supernatural"" to mean some kind of secret sauce that distinguishes the universe of a god from ""ordinary"" external physical universes, but what's your basis for doing so?  The two could easily be indistinguishable.  There's nothing to stop a god from existing in a physical universe with the appropriate relationship to our universe.

&gt; Not existing in nature. Not subject to natural laws. Not physical or material. 

Yes, let's review that.  Someone from a god's universe would not exist in our physical universe in any detectable form, but would have access to our universe through a means we can neither detect nor understand, a la Flatland; thus is not subject to the physical laws of our universe, i.e. ""natural laws""; and is neither physical nor material in a detectable, understandable way in our universe.  3 for 3.

What's so difficult about this, really?  If you really insist on your notion that nothing can be supernatural because everything is natural in its own context, then all it means is that the definitions of gods needs to be changed to not use the word ""supernatural"", since of course a god is natural in its own context.  This has no effect whatsoever on the actual subject under discussion, you've just lost yourself in definitional confusion.  You need to stop reading the dictionary and start thinking.","1233477418"

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Please understand that the positions of the council are not always the positions of the packs and troops, the kids involved, or the kid's parents.

I got my son into cub scouts as a way to meet other kids and work in a structured environment. The pack we're in is administratively under one of the council's mentioned in this article. At $35/year it was cheaper than the $100/season sports programs in the area. Plus he wasn't interested in sports. I was a scout as a kid and had a positive experience. I am largely agnostic bordering on atheist. I don't mind gays.

To date the religious activities have been left for the parents to direct. Kids are not taught that any particular god is better than the others, but instead are encouraged to talk about what the parents believe and why. This may change as he gets older, but so far it is not the bastion of Christian fundamentalism that scouts is painted as being.

No one has said anything about gays at any pack meeting or function. No one has been turned away for any reason. With the people involved, I can't think of a way that it would matter enough to come up or be a problem.

As a pack we are always strapped for cash, and as such try to keep as much as possible in the pack and as little as possible from going to the council. We get almost nothing back from the council.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Is there a #haskell-newbies channel?

It's not that kind of language :)

In all seriousness, it isn't really. It's the kind of thing where you jump in head first, partly because some of the ideas are very heady and take a while to figure out, but also partly because that's how the community is set up. The sort of folks to jump in like that and gloss over what they don't get are the sort that've stuck around. There's certainly a large beginner portion of the community, but they mix it up with the founding fathers and gurus like everyone else does. There's been some movement towards having a more conventional beginners playground, but I don't know of anything concrete for that just yet (dons would probably know better than I).

If you're looking for reading more than interaction, the [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) book is more oriented towards beginners and people with non-functional background in programming. If you're brave enough to risk more of the same, some of the blogs on [Planet Haskell](http://planet.haskell.org/) also contain insightful beginner's lessons--- though there's as much or more which will be as wall-of-text as #haskell if not moreso. The authors are consistent, so a glance at each of them should make it clear whether they'll be helpful. Also [HWN](http://sequence.complete.org/hwn) provides nice listings of posts for easy scanning. [Mark Jason Dominus](http://blog.plover.com/) posts irregularly but he frequently presents concepts from a Perl perspective which can be a helpful counterpoint. [Neil Mitchell](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/) has a number of good concrete tutorials. [Sebastian Fischer](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sebf/) also has some nice posts. If you're willing to jump in, [Haskell Cafe](http://www.nabble.com/Haskell---Haskell-Cafe-f13132.html) has a fair number of beginners, though it has its share of theoreticians and engineers too.","1233477477"

I am not sure if you are calling Eve online because of the steep learning curve or because you found it boring.  The game isn't for everyone, but it has managed to exist since EQ 1 and has a player base that is still growing.



The developers have dome a remarkable job in designing a game that has a huge depth of play, an enormous game universe to play in and have manage to fit all the elements plus 30,000 players all on one server.  At the same time they have managed to do this with a relatively small development team and a somewhat minimal amount of resources when compared to companies like Sony and Blizzard.

When i first saw it in action in korea, i was amazed how fast it was, the guy was just flippin through the bills like 5 per second.

I think one of the reasons is that in US/CAN/UK one bill (100$ bill, 50 pound bill) is a lotta fucking cash compared to the higest denomination bill in Korea and China (10,000won in korea and 100RMB in China, both worth under $15 USD) 

So buying something that's $500 in the US would only need 5 bills (not too hard to count) but in korea thats almost 690,000won, which means you need 69 of the 10,000won bills.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yo! The ""stimulus"" bill is a spending / entitlement bill in disguise. Obama says the economy is in dire shape. But, Obama is NOT going to fix it. He is going to further it's demise.

There are 4 main reasons this country's economy will completely fail in the next decade.

1) Oil. But you knew that. We only produce 25% of what we use and Obamas politically infuenced ideas to fix it will NOT.

2) Debt. America now has $55 trillion worth of debt. Obama will worsen this debt more than any other president in the name of stimulus that ISN'T STIMULUS. We will enslave our children with this debt. 

3) Poor education. America's math and science scores are at the bottom compared to other countries. The teachers union will insure this continued trend.

4) The ratio between the goverment and private sector economy. Government now is 43% of the economy. Government spending growing 4 times faster than the economy. The government portion should be at most 25% of the economy. We work and average 5 months of the year to pay a year's taxes.

So, you can continue with this non-important banter while real problems take this country down. 

Was Obama properly vetted by the media to become president. I don't think so. He spoke of hope and he's right. Let's really hope Obama isn't the biggest mistake ever but I'll tell you,      HE IS.

The speed limit has nothing to do with causality, IMO. In fact, if you think about it long enough (as I have), you will realize that c is not just the maximum speed; it is the ONLY speed. That is to say, nothing moves faster or slower than c. Bodies that appear to move slower than c are actually at rest a lot more than they are moving. It just so happens, for reasons that are beyond the scope of this forum, that light does not rest in a vacuum.

&gt;Evolutionary theory, said Place, predicts a certain level of coyness or even deceptiveness in women because if a relationship is abandoned they may face greater costs, including pregnancy and child rearing. When choosing a mate, it is in a woman's best interest to get men to open up and talk honestly to give her a better idea of whether they would be good long-term partners.

I believe this is better explained by a woman ""keeping her options open"".  If she doesn't get her 1st or 2nd pick, maybe the 3rd will pony up.  ...but not if she didn't initially feign interest.

I've learned early on from Ralph Johnson to be very skeptical of generalizations that SOUND good but are completely useless in practice. I've since transmuted this skepticism into outright hostility.

The benefits of an object-based approach are that you can retain tools for the classes while avoiding creating singleton classes in certain rare cases. There is no data showing how useful this is in practice, especially after you take out the greatest use-case for singletons / prototypes which is GUIs. There is also no data on the costs of going hybrid (picking an option, switching options, keeping track of options, possible interaction between options). And that layered crap? There's no data showing this has any utility whatsoever.

Oh and for the past decade or so I've been working on a model for an object system that's both prototypical and class-based. But it's prototypical in the middle layer of abstraction and class based both above and below it. So it's not like the concepts are alien to me. Neither is the utility of generalization, when it's actually useful.","1233478584"

One of the alternatives that was proposed was to print different size bills for different denominations.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Words have meaning. You should learn those meanings before you make statements like that.

But Ok, lets look at the definition from the link I provided:
""Censorship is the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable, harmful or sensitive, as determined by a censor.""

In what way did I attempt to suppress your speech? Did I attempt to delete it? No. Did I attempt to get you banned or something for saying it? No. Did I try to get you fired from your job for saying it? No. Did I try to have your ISP drop you? No.  I've done nothing but offer an argument against the idea.  Hardly censorship according to the actual definition of the word.

So, does my using persuasion rise to the level of suppression? Lets take a look at that:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_dissent
""Suppression of dissent occurs when an individual or group which is more powerful than another tries to directly or indirectly censor, persecute or otherwise oppress the other party, rather than engage with and constructively respond to or accommodate the other party's arguments or viewpoint.""

I would say that I am just as powerful as you are, so I don't meet that requirement.  I have not tried to ""censor, persecute, or otherwise oppress"" anyone, as I've allowed you to say what you have to say, and as per a few lines ago we decided that it wasn't censorship. In fact, I've ""constructively responded"" to your point of view, by offering the advice that a boycott would do much to bolster Limbaugh's popularity while at the same time distracting us from gathering facts to refute his arguments.

So, when you actually know and understand what the words you are using mean, you can see that I am not censoring you, nor am I oppression you, nor violating your freedom to say whatever you want to say.  I understand that English may not be your first language, so I'm typing slowly so as not to go too fast for you. ;)

Does the same hold true for your attempts to get Limbaugh thrown off the air by boycotting his sponsors?  You would have more power than him if you could pull it off.  It would suppress his speech by cutting him off from his audience. And you would be doing this rather than constructively engaging him. 

Seems to meet the definition to me.  However, I think you're probably 12, so I expect the next thing I see from you will be some sort of childish ""nuh-uh, and you are stupid"" type of continuation of this thread.  ","1233478915"

* Acetic acid, found in vinegar, is used to remove lime scale from faucets.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","As a user, transitioning to 64-bit 8.10 Ubuntu has been almost as smooth as my older 32-bit installs. Unlike older 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, practically every 32-bit packages is also available as 64-bit.  Ubuntu can even automagically install the (32-bit only) flash for you.  The only issue specific to 64-bit I've ran into is random X crashes from my tablet drivers.  I don't use my tablet under Linux, so this isn't a huge issue for me.  I'm not sure how 32-bit third party software will fare, Ubuntu (as with other distros) benefits heavily from being able to compile a majority of their software.  There shouldn't be any issues beyond simply transferring your home folder and reinstalling any non-default packages you use.

As a developer, doing 32-bit C/C++ compiles on 64-bit Ubuntu can be... interesting.  The package ia32-libs (I think it's called that, I'm not on my 64-bit Ubuntu installation at the moment) will install a lot of 32-bit libraries in /lib32 and /usr/lib32, but doesn't install the appropriate symlinks for all of them (for example, it installs /usr/lib32/libogg.so.0.5.3, but not /usr/lib32/libogg.so.  The -logg flag directs to the linker to link against the library the symlink points to).  This creates a somewhat misleading linker error message about libraries that LD finds but aren't compatible (initially leading me to believe that it wasn't searching the /lib32 and /usr/lib32 directories). 

On top of that, installing 32-bit libraries that aren't provided by Ubuntu can be an adventure.  Running configure scripts with -m32 added to the compile and linking flags tends to bring out a lot of ugly hacks their authors have added, such as hard coded gcc commands.","1233479706"

It's *big-C* Communist, which really doesn't mean anything except that the country is run by an organisation that calls itself the Communist Party. Typically though these countries are authoritarian and have centrally planned socialist economies (although obv they've done away with the latter in China).

The flaw is in assuming that these Communist countries are 'built on the proletariat'. They aren't really, except in the sense that the proletariat are *used* by the state to grab and maintain power. You'll notice if you look through history that most Communist nations (North Korea, China, Russia, Cuba) skipped the 'capitalism' phase of society — they were mostly still feudal countries when they became Communist, which meant that comparatively large proportions of their populations were in poverty. It's not hard to see why a political revolution that claimed to raise those people to a higher position in society experienced so much support, and i'm sure this is something that Lenin, Castro, and Mao all counted on to get and maintain power. But as demonstrated by their actual *actions* they didn't really care that much about ideological communism.

Also Cuba is not communist either.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","For your extra $150 for the D60 over the D40, the main features you get are:

* Vibration reduction on the kit lens - counteracts camera shake in low light.
* Higher resolution sensor, 10 megapixels vs 6. Although the linear increase isn't actually that much - it goes to ~3800x2500 from ~3000x2000. Although having used a 10 mp camera, I think this does make a difference when post-processing.
* A sensor which turns off the back LCD when you put the viewfinder to your eye.
* The back screen display rotates as you tilt the camera into a portrait orientation.

Negatives with the D60 vs the D40:

* Base ISO sensitivity starts at ISO 100. The D40 has fewer pixels in the same area, so the base sensitivity starts at ISO 200. This means the D60 may have a bit more image noise at high sensitivity settings - but that's probably counteracted by the slightly higher resolution.
* Slower flash sync speed (1/200th vs the D40's 1/500th of a second). This is useful when using fill-flash in daylight.

The D60 has more features, but the D40 may be a better choice for low-light shooting in extreme conditions. But you really can't go wrong with either.

Also: the very best accessory I've ever used with my camera is decent photography software. I started with Google's Picasa (which is a free download), but then moved to Adobe Lightroom. iPhoto is okay if you have a Mac, but the tools are limited.

"business","t5_2qgzg","Clawback provisions are a very recent phenomenon among the major Wall Street banks. Some key players have been adding them to their compensation structures, but [only during the last few months after the boom had already ended.](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aey_haAMBL8M) 

&gt; Many firms instituted changes to their bonus systems and reduced average compensation as revenue fell...

&gt; Firms including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG also have added so-called clawback provisions that set aside portions of workers’ bonuses that can be recouped in later years if an employee leaves or is found to have behaved in ways that are harmful to the company.

&gt; “You’ve got as good an opportunity today as you’re ever going to have for this culture to change,” said Benson. “There needs to be a clearer risk-reward balance, rather than reward-reward.”

Until very recently, i-bankers at these firms were evaluated for bonuses based solely on short-term performance. There was nothing anyone could do about recouping the money if the trades went south after some extended period of time. This has resulted in some absolutely egregious examples of why clawback provisions are so necessary. 

Suppose you headed up AIG Financial Products selling credit-default swap protection during the boom years. You were paid hundreds of millions when the good times were rolling, but didn't have to pay anything back when you bankrupted the world's largest insurance company and saddled U.S. taxpayers with over $150 billion in liabilities. (See: [Joseph Cassano](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/business/28melt.html))

Or suppose you worked for Merrill Lynch heading up fixed-income trading. You scored a $35 million bonus in 2006 dealing mortgage-backed securities, but didn't have to give anything back when the profits you supposedly generated turned out to be tens of billions of dollars in losses. (See: [Dow Kim](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/18pay.html))

Edit:

I feel compelled to include the quote from Cassano that begins the NY Times article about him, which I linked to above. The sheer arrogance of this guy is breathtaking.

&gt; “It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions.”

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; How does the government spending money increase aggregate demand exactly?

Government spending money on goods and services -&gt; extra demand for goods and services -&gt; increased aggregate demand

The government builds new bridges and roads, new infrastructure is developed, businesses are contracted to do this, people are employed for this and can spend more money, which translates to even more demand for goods and services, etc.  

If you DON'T do this, then people end up saving this money out of fear instead of spending it, therefore contracting the economy, in precisely the reverse of the mechanism described above.

This situation is a little surreal for me.  I was around before the Reagan/Thatcher years, in the 60s-70s when Keynsian deficit spending was in vogue and was understood by everyone.  The 80s changed all that: it was a time when Keynes' name became mud.  Now, 30 years later, a new generation of people has grown up not knowing Keynes.  It's disconcerting how zombie Keynes has come back.

edit: BTW, contrary to popular belief, Reagan did indulge in Keynsian deficit spending - but he did so through defense spending, while at the same time claiming to be anti-Keynes (low taxing, low spending).  You just can't take politicians at face value.  ","1233481600"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Yeah, well, I have hardly any real idea what you're talking about.  I'm not a physicist, and neither are many in the audience of a TED talk or its wider audience.  However, scientists should continue to respect well done presentations, and remember such whenever they get the urge to complain there aren't enough scientists or kids aren't interested enough in science.  

That is, be impressed, *be very impressed* whenever you see a well done presentation.  And definitely learn from it.  Learn to present material in the most interesting ways.  You may not be the generation to benefit from seeing an advanced idea introduced well *and* meaningfully, but the next generation will benefit.  

So when this generation of scientists grows and wonders the perennial doltish thought, ""Why don't kids and our citizens learn the beauty and power of science?"" you can look to yourselves, the teachers, if you take the responsibility.  Every scientist I've learned of was inspired in their youth in part by either a good book or a good teacher.  We all know a well written book on elementary topics are rare, and moreover, rarely contain a real sense of advanced material.  I'm not talking about that advanced text you might have received because you were the brightest the teacher saw in 20 years.  Kids like that don't need a particularly well written book.  They'll learn no matter what.

Look at this TED talk from my perspective.  I've never seen more than a standard chart of the particles.  Where's the symmetry in that?  None to see, at least easily, that's certain.  Sure, if I studied physics in a university, I might learn how symmetry is used to predict the missing parts, but I didn't, nor do many people.  This video was a real eye opener.  It was also extremely simple to follow.  If I were young, talented, and already interested in physics but unsure what I wanted to major in, I just might be lured toward physics after watching something as beautiful as the symmetry in this video.  Even now I hope to at least see some more of the math behind it.","1233481625"

&gt; If the water purification system contains long pipes made of metal or PVC, militants can take it apart and use the pipes to make Qassam rockets.

&gt; So-called ""dual use"" items have caused lots of problems for Israel in the past. Over the last couple years, the IDF has responded to this threat by demanding that every time they let humanitarian agencies bring such items into Gaza, the agencies must be able to account for the whereabouts of every single pipe or whichever type of item they've been using. This is a real burden for the humanitarian agencies, who sometimes lose track of stuff like any other organization does. But when Israel isn't satisfied with an agency's auditing reports, it then restricts the agency from bringing in any more dual-use items to Gaza.

&gt; The whole situation is very difficult for all parties concerned: for the Israelis, who get blamed for not letting in aid but face a genuine security threat; for the humanitarian agencies, who aren't allowed to bring in sorely needed aid; and most of all for the Palestinian civilians, who need these items for vital infrastructure like water purification.","1233481887"

E8 was a phenomenon some time ago and despite browsing the popular press about it, I was bored.  I found nothing my ignorant mind could hold on to and appreciate.  Albeit, I didn't try very hard to learn about it, but why should I?  I wasn't sold on it being very interesting.  Translation:  Poor presentation!  Sure, if I didn't have other things more pressing to learn, I may have given it more proper attention.

Then this video presents in an extremely simple way how symmetry and further, the symmetry of E8, is and might be used in physics.  It is a well done presentation and is far more interesting than most of the bull that was in the popular media.

Even if the material isn't as advanced as you would expect or hope, understand that there are many readers here that are not mathematicians.  Also, next time you feel the urge to complain about the state of mathematics in education and wonder why kids and citizens aren't interested or appreciate mathematics, remember that a well done presentation nurtures appreciation.

When they say, ""we have to kill their children so they will take what we decide to give them instead of what they feel they are entitled to"" they weaken their standing with the international community.  They look belligerent and lose support.

&gt;yet people who support palestenians have to be extremely careful and say things exactly the right way in the least belligerent, most subservient way possible lest they lose ""support"".

The lesson to learn.  Be careful in what you say, be honest and the truth will out.  If you agree with me that the treatment of Palestinians is unconscionable then you have nothing to fear from being honest and only stand to lose if you are not careful or not thoughtful in your thinking.

Accordingly it makes it very easy for you to dis-spell the Israeli Government's angle.  They can't afford to be honest.  You can.  Use it to your advantage and don't let their dishonesty lull you into misrepresenting yourself.

You don't need to.

Hence Israel has attacked the free press but not in this instance.  By saying it that way I am not compromising myself or compromising that argument.  If I were to say this is an attack on the free press I could counter that allegation by saying it was a closed door event which it was - and people will consider everything else in raised in this incident, rightly or wrongly, compromised.  That is why I raised it myself, to prevent this from happening.


I don't allow them to do that by keeping it all above board and accurate.  Does that mean that I have to be careful what I say?  Yes.  Does it mean it is more difficult for them to erode the importance of what has been admitted?
DAMN YES!

**An Israeli official has conceded that behind a war on Hamas lies an agenda to attack Iran.**

That is what you stick with because nothing they can say can change that.  Nothing.  Whatever counter-argument they provide this stays stuck in their gullet.  An Israeli official has conceded that the Gaza situation is being used to escalate against Iran and that Israel broke the ceasefire can be corroborated if you wish to make the connection.  

When talking about the press being restricted in Gaza and Israel releasing propaganda packs to journalists, that's what you stick with there because there it can be proven, here it does not stick.

They love it when you mix recipes and convolute or weaken your argument...it makes it more difficult for the truth to come out.  You don't need to be afraid of that, they do.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","If this was all there was too it, then taxing everyone at 100% and spending it all would provide the greatest possible stimulus. Can you figure out what your mistake was?","1233482275"
"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Here is the way I see it...  Governments can only get money to spend by printing it or taxing people.  Either way takes money from the productive people of society and gives it to people who care less about how it is spent..for examples of this look at all the complaints about government waste.

  If they just print money to spend it has the further problem of diluting the money supply, making the money or 'capital' that responsible people have saved less valuable.  It gives people less incentive to save money because their money is slowly taken away by inflation.  So the guy who was going to save up his money and start a business someday never gets this opportunity. 

 Furthermore, when government spends money, it sometimes spends it on adding bureaucracy.  All of these rules and regulations do very little to help the average guy who wants to start a business.   For example, I have some land that I wanted to run a driveway into so I could clean it up and maybe plant part of it with crops..my local government wants a permit fee, a performance bond, and a possibly a traffic safety study.  This is kinda silly because this rural road has hundreds of driveways all along it but is typical of the kind of stuff government will want you to do.  My option was to hold off on running the driveway..thereby costing the contractor who wanted to do it a job and probably delaying any development I might do to the land which would increase the tax base for the city who wants me to do all of these silly things just to run a driveway.  It is my land, of course I am going to run a safe and solid driveway into it and follow the codes.  I am not going to put something in that would negatively affect it's value.   That is not good enough though, they want me to pay for them to make sure that I follow the codes.  We already do this via property taxes but that is not enough I guess.

The people that actually need to be regulated and held accountable are the government servants.  That was the whole point of the Constitution, to keep government accountable to the people it serves and keep it minimal.

You may have gotten it from Analects of Confucius: ""Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself"".  That was written somewhere around BCE 300.

Or perhaps you're thinking of Ancient Greeks such as Isocrates (""Do not do to others what would anger you if done to you by others""), circa BCE 400.

Of course, the same sentiments were appropriated by many people subsequently.  There was a shrewd Jewish PR guy in the middle east who did quite well with it.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","The first time I ever used Gnome was with Red Hat Linux 6.2 which now feels like ages ago. I didn't use that very much though. The next time I tried Linux, it was Suse 9.2 or something. It had KDE 3.1 or 3.2 on it I think and I really liked it. I ran that for awhile, then I heard about Ubuntu. I first used Ubuntu 5.04 with Gnome of course. I used Gnome for about three years with Ubuntu, before I switched to Arch with KDE 4.x. I told you all that to show you that I have at least a little experience with both Gnome and KDE. First I'm going to say that I do not hate Gnome at all (even though I post ton of KDE4 articles on reddit). Gnome is very customizable like KDE, but I feel like you have to work a little harder to customize Gnome versus KDE. Its difficult to explain, but I guess at least for me it's maybe faster and easier to customize KDE. Also KDE seems to have more built in features than Gnome. I'm not an eye candy guy, but KDE's kwin has all that stuff built in. In Gnome you have to install compiz separately. But like I said, that stuff doesn't really matter to me. What does matter to me is integration of apps. This is where KDE shines in my opinion. I FTP a lot, and I use a text editor a lot. Konqueror and Kate really do a nice job for my workflow. Now, I realize that Nautilus can FTP, but Nautilus feels noticeably slower than Konqueror to me. However, Gnome's Gedit is a great editor. I was used to using it's plugins. But KDE's Kate is comparable. In fact I think they're on par with each other. Next thing that I'd like to compare between the two DE's are their Personal Information Managers. Gnome has Evolution, and KDE has Kontact/KAddressbook. All I use in each of these are IMAP email and as an address book. They both do IMAP well. In my eyes, its a dead tie. But the KDE app did something better than the Gnome app. It asked me to add my instant messenger contacts (from Kopete's contact list) to KAddressbook. I thought that was kind of cool. If Evolution can do that with Pidgin, thats awesome but I didn't figure it out. Last thing I like about KDE: KRunner. It's the Alt+F2 app launcher. To be fair, Gnome also has a similar dialog but KRunner seems more powerful. It has a plugins for apps, bookmarks, calculator, shell commands, contacts, user switching, kate sessions, konqueror sessions, konsole sessions, locations, Nepomuk Desktop Search, power management, recent docs, spell check, unit conversion and browser history. For me, KRunner alone made me to switch. ","1233482908"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I tend to flip-flop a lot on my thoughts about Joel. I can't stand his astroturfing, that really irritates me. I think given the quality of his team, his product line should be much bolder. That said, his company makes money and his products are best in class within the markets they compete. Say what you want, but that's impressive.

What's interesting is people universally find Jeff to be less intelligent and less capable than Joel.

Yet Jeff actually got stuff done and has a very stable, very fast Q&amp;A site that makes money. Stackoverflow _is_ a success. He must be doing _something_ right.

I get the impression that a lot of Jeff's detractors would have led the same team right in to bankruptcy.

While Jeff's technical acumen is not great he is probably an excellent leader. He communicates himself clearly, he has a vision of what he wants to achieve. He understands what's required from a good software development team. He's got that bullheaded arrogance that I've seen in all the CEOs I've ever known. 

The same can probably said for Joel. I get the impression from the Podcast that Joel doesn't write much code any more. That really doesn't stop him being the right man to lead his company. 

I think the message to take away is that there is more to software than the code! You need a marriage of many talents to run a software company. Jeff and Joel have these qualities in spades. 



Yet, I'd probably have neither of them as my technical lead. That doesn't stop either of their opinions being useful.","1233482999"

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","IV and iii have no common notes, and that forces a completely different harmonic structure.  And not only do they not have common notes but the intervals between the notes in one chord and the notes in the other are mostly not the intervals we consider most consonant.  

Let's consider the iii chord and the IV chord in the key of E.

The iii chord is G#m, composed of the notes G#,B and D#.

The IV chord is A, composed of the notes A, C# and E.



From G# to:  A - half step; C# - 4th; E - minor 6th.

From B to:  A - minor seventh; C# - whole step; E - 5th.

From D# to A - dim 5; C# - minor seventh; E- half step.



And the other way around:

From A to: G# - major seventh; B - whole step; D# - dim 5.

From C# to: G# - 5th; B - minor 7th; D# - whole step.

From E to: G# - maj 3rd; B - 5th; D# - maj 7th.

So you see you don't get too many consonant intervals between the iii and the IV chord.  You get a 4th over the root and a 5th over the minor 3rd in the iii chord, as well as a minor 6th over the 5th.  You also get 5ths over the 3rd and 5th in the IV chord and a maj 3rd over the 5th in the IV chord.  That's not a lot to work with especially considering that most of the consonant intervals are themselves consonant with respect to the 3rd or 5th rather than the root of the chord, and the 4th over the root of iii is dissonant if you're writing counterpoint.

In other words, it's very difficult to compose a melody that would fit well over both I-V-vi-iii and I-V-vi-IV.  You could work something out if you wanted to, but it would probably be a fairly 'strange' sounding melody, at least to western ears.

It gained its popularity primarily in home release.

Given this, I find it hard to believe its theatrical take was better than Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon and The Grapes of Wrath, all successful films and all released within a year or so of Fantasia (and thus not subject to any great difference in inflation).

I suspect that the numbers we're seeing may include retail revenue. If so, this prompts the question of how it would be adjusted for inflation, as home video sales have continued throughout the years, and certainly recent sales of the film shouldn't face any great amount of inflation.

I always thought martyred meant killed for their faith. It turns out, according to the source for that quote, that it just means Christians who were killed.

Interestingly, the global homicide rate is about 7.6 homicides per 100,000 people ([for 2004](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homicide_rate)). Taking the total population of Christians from your source ([2,231,421,000](http://www.gordonconwell.edu/ockenga/globalchristianity/resources.php)), you would expect about 170,000 premature deaths per year for that population.

&gt;The support for israel by the EU, UK, and the US has never waned no matter who said what, no matter what israel does.

And yet look what has happened.  The US has elected somebody president who made a point of trying to open up avenues of diplomacy with Iran and the streets of capital cities across Europe have been filled by protests.  Israel is facing a MASSIVE PR crisis...look at Reddit...normal people not buying into the hype.  Look at the stories submitted, the world's press is coming round.  Calls for inquiries, international condemnation.

Things are changing and yet you seem to keep wanting to whine about what has happened in the past.  That's not going to help anyone; instead try empowering the growing movement to start holding Israel accountable.

&gt;I disagree. Being meek has never really accomplished much in this world.

Being honest and being thoughtful about how you present your argument does mean being 'meek'.

You just disagreed with being HONEST.  You're part of the problem.  If you can only argue or exact changes by being dishonest or reverting to that which you oppose then you're already losing.  If you can't be honest and intelligent you are not helping anyone, certainly not your cause.  In fact even I am starting to question whether you want to stop all attacks on Palestine or really you want to lever support for attacks on Israel.  Because for one of those you're onto a winner, the other and you're facing your own PR disaster.

&gt;I don't know what you mean by free press but my definition says this was an attack on the free press.

Free press does not mean a right to go wherever the press chooses.  They can't break into your home, they can't do anything illegal or force themselves into a private meeting.  That is not what free press means.  This wasn't a public meeting so the rights of the free press where not crossed here.  They had no right to be there other than by invite which is why he had a right to not be filmed and why he was allowed to make the request for cameras to be switched off.

With Israel banning reporters from going to Gaza however, they had no such right.  The reporters had a right to go there and they were denied.

As frustration mounted over the worthlessness of currency issued only weeks earlier, the Zimbabwe treasury introduced the $ℵ_1 bill Tuesday. Spokesman G.

However, I do something a bit different. I always keep my bills in 'bank straight order,' with all of them oriented the same way, larger bills at back, descending through smaller toward the front. When I count, I flip them over and count what would be the top-right corners of the backs, though to me it's the top-left, as I have them turned vertically as in the video. I riffle through quite quickly. If I had 3 $100s, 3 $50s, 4 $20s, 3 $5s, and 3 $1s, I count like this: ""**one**, **two**, **three**, fifty, **four**, fifty, seventy, ninety, **five**-ten, thirty, five, forty, five, six, seven, eight... five-forty-eight."" I slightly stress the bold ones to lock them into my mind as 100s. I can 'hear' the last bold one I've said when I reach another 100 border, and just say the next increment, like 'three.'

1. How does *artificial* (i.e., 100% government-driven) demand translate into *real* demand and long-term growth and private investment. Once the government closes the gravy valve, what keeps all of that shiny new demand from evaporating?

2. You say ""people are employed for this and can spend more money"", meaning that the reason people aren't spending money is that they do not have enough of it, so they cannot afford it. Then, by working for the government on some big infrastructure project, they earn money and can then afford to buy things. The only thing that has changed is the ability of consumers to afford things relative to the prices of the products they are buying. So the question is, **wouldn't deflation accomplish the exact same thing?** Isn't the whole premise behind Keynesian stimulus a tacit admission that the theory of the bottomless deflationary spiral that is used to justify it is nonsense?

My impression was that they were putting everything they had on the line for that game - getting back to basics with a Daggerfall type system but willing to cast it in an original setting. 

Morrowind breathed a whole new life into the company and I don't see the title as being their peak, but more of a getting back on the saddle. ES3 brought them away from the brink, and has given them the space to solidify their position with a few lower-risk bigger budget titles, Oblivion and Fallout3. I'm pretty sure they'll be ready to push out into more original waters in coming years.

I would recommend to start out with Albert Speer's memories. I found him to be one of the most credible of all contemporary living Germans. But don't take my word for it - make your own assumptions.


Other authors:

Guido Knopp

Joachim Fest

Traudl Junge's diary


Also German movie producers tend to create better WWII movies than Americans. They are thereby also less Hollywood.


Such movies include:


Speer und Er

Stauffenberg (The one Cruise just remade)

Der Untergang (Based upon Fest and Junge's)


But some American produced do come into consideration although their overall bias or history accuracy is disputed, such as:


Conspiracy


Nuremberg


Hitler: Rise of Evil


Else I recommend listening to British GSCE podcasts.

"politics","t5_2cneq","how to get cheap insureance. step 1 raise your existing coverage to maximum your provider will give you (example 250,000/person 500,000 total). step 2, take a letter-statement with proof of coverages and give it to another insurance company and ask them for a qoute on a new rate. step 3 switch carries and save HUGE. i used to pay gieco 1300 every 6 months for my average coverage, now i pay 750 every 6 months for a half million dollars in coverage from progressive. this method can be used with your current carrier no matter who it is, the new rate you shop for should be with one of the following three companies; gieco, progressive, e-sureance. as long as you're cool using one of those three (others may also work. i just KNOW these three ""take the bait"" from first hand accounts).

it should be noted that raising your coverage to maximum allowed doesn't cost as much as you might think. i paid 6 extra dollars for the month i had increased coverage at gieco, then switched to progessive and have been paying around 550 less, per 6 month policy, and i am on my 3rd 6 month policy with progressive at this new rate.

this is a little known trick which applies to auto, PWC, and other ""small time"" pollicies. for homeowners and PLI you simply pay a slightly higher rate. (i carry 5 million in liability on my house because it was less than one dollar a month more to do so.) Basically insurance companies think-know that people who carry the maximum coverage are the least likely group to ever use it. so get more, pay less. and for auto policies, you can save shitloads, and have 10 times the coverage you used to.

""There can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth.""

You can say, ""special creation of his soul"" but you might as well say, ""special creation of his Mogwai."" The anthropogenesis problem and the issue of identifying the fertilization stage in which the soul is bestowed remain unresolved. The provided link is low on details.

Here are my questions:

1. When are souls assigned to humans (if assigned at fertilization, state the stage and provide supporting argument)?
2. When during anthropogenesis was the first human assigned a soul?
3. What feature(s) differentiated the soulless mother from its ensouled offspring so as to warrant bestowing a soul to the offspring in the first place?

This makes me want to learn how to read people this well. Side story: I was in a relationship where I was being lied to time after time but could never prove it and seeing as I have a personal ""Innocent until proven guilty"" I went along with it, however this got to me. I collected concrete cheating proof by asking around and was given pictures from a friend. Basically, I found out how fascinating it is to see a person lie when you know they are lying. To be told an elaborate story when the whole time you know the truth. Though this person was so guiltless so as to then attack me verbally and then go on and try to ruin my reputation with others and so on and so forth. If I had been more confident with my lie detecting skills I probably would have dropped her a week into it.

It encouraged, against market equilibrium, an unnecessary amount of people to take out loans they otherwise wouldn't have.  The banks just played the middleman in this game, which is what banks do.

Of course there is a window, because the time period you reference is before the ceasefire even came into effect. Thus the irrelevance of your post in response to mine.

&gt; This is what Israel did to break the cease fire?

No, it was much more than that. Israel assassinated Hamas members and tightened the blockade during the ceasefire. During this time there was a drastic reduction in rocket fire, and Hamas was not responsible for the remaining attacks anyhow. Israel themselves admit to breaking the ceasefire. It's not even a point of dispute.

Totally. I consider myself to be a classical liberal or libertarian, but so many who advocate that position seem to think those policies will be a panacea for our problems. The reality is much harsher: that system will only truly work with a vigilant, responsible citizenry. Although I'm not convinced that the current system or Socialism will work any better without a vigilant, responsible citizenry, either.

I mean, we pretty much started with a near-ideal libertarian system, but it simply devolved into what we have today. It's kind of like arguing with anarchists who refuse to believe that some form of government is simply inevitable at anything but the most local scale of community.","1233485790"

Here it is behaving [normally.](http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/3581/wellbehavedov8.jpg)

Here it is [chaotically.](http://img110.imageshack.us/img110/2382/chaoosssze6.jpg)

These are the phase space plots of angle1 and angle2 of the pendulum.

Notice how in the chaotic plot it will spend alot of time traveling over a certain pattern of velocities (the bright white area) before jumping over to another pattern or just all over the place.

I've actually been studying economics on my own for over three years now, but I haven't been able to pursue a *formal* education in the field because I have been serving in the US military for the past five years. I've read extensively on a number of economic philosophies, including Keynesianism, and I believe that Keynesianism, in particular, is an exceptionally weak theory, based on exceptionally weak intellectual foundations.

I am now approaching the end of my enlistment and I am preparing to begin my college education when I get home. Economics being my primary interest, I have decided pursue that for my degree. Unfortunately, economics isn't like biology or chemistry, where the curriculum would be pretty much the same anywhere you go, it's been politicized to the point where departments are often more interested in teaching economics that promote their political agenda (and quashing dissenting opinions) instead of teaching sound and rational theory.

I have no problem whatsoever learning about theories that I disagree with. I have spent countless grimacing hours ingesting the theories of Keynes and Marx, and I plan on spending many more. It makes for a more effective counter-argument when you actually understand the thinking of those you are arguing against. Know thy enemy, as they say. What I am not interested in is sitting through a four years of Keynesian indoctrination school and having my grade dependent on my ability to regurgitate nonsensical Keynesian theory.","1233486702"

They said plenty of times that they will wipe Israel off the map.  They, like their minions Hizballah and Hamas, are not rational and they do what they preach irrespective of the consequences.

Btw, it is not fair for Israelis to be murdered in Millions like their other Jews were only 60 years ago in your neck of the woods.  Fairness does not apply in politics.  One thing is for sure, for Israel, a small country, there are no margins of error.  In Norway, if you A-bomb Oslo, you still have Bergen or the part beyond the Arctic circle to live in, if you are so lucky not to live in Oslo.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Gnome's strength is consistency and intuitiveness.  Nautilus, evince, eye of gnome, file-roller, rhythmbox, gedit and others are all really well-designed, easy to use and visually consistent (much better than the Mac and Windows equivalents).

That said, there are a few problems.  The menus on the panel aren't reachable from the top pixel of the screen, defeating the purpose of having them on the top.  Gnome-panel is sometimes very unresponsive---perhaps I have too many panel applets, but this really shouldn't happen.  The volume control is annoying in that it is hard to close once you're done adjusting it.  Nautilus is great, especially spatial mode (the only proper spatial mode in any modern file manager, unfortunately), but it is sometimes quite slow.  I briefly switched to xfce at one point and thunar, xfce-panel, xfce-terminal are all much snappier.  Totem is a bit sluggish on some videos, although this is probably a gstreamer problem.  I came back to Gnome for the consistency and power---xfce is a little limited unfortunately.

Big wins for Gnome: Evince (best pdf reader on any platform, hands down); gedit (even though I use emacs, I realise Gedit is an excellent editor ""for the common man""); nautilus spatial-mode; brasero (extremely easy-to-use and functional); abiword (not sure if it's part of gnome still, but it's extremely quick and functional, opening some weird word files better than openoffice).  I like Epiphany too but I'm too wedded to my Firefox extensions (noscript, firemacs, ...) to switch.  Evolution is not perfect and gets a little sluggish sometimes, but I've come to the conclusion that email programs are really hard to get right, and perhaps a more decoupled approach (offlineimap + local reader) is better.  That, and I can't live without Emacs as my external editor for mail...

Also, not Gnome specific, but the Gtk+ file dialog is **terrible**.  Wasteful of space and difficult to navigate by keyboard, and not good at remembering where you were.  The Gtk+ printing system is generally fine and perfectly functional, but the interface for ""print to file"" is atrocious for such a common and useful function.","1233487601"

It took some footwork on my part, but I did this and also met with some higher-ups that she had spammed me to and got the story straight. all of this yielded good result and is now forgotten. Her evil action found the light of day. I maintained my neutral profile and stood up for myself. No harm done. Therefore I recommend techniques of conflict resolution and to not allow yourself to react or to be spiteful but to try and fix things in a nice manner. You could address this religious solicitation and say it is not appropriate. One approach is to communicate to the sender that please do not send to you religious material in the workplace. If it happens a second time, then go to a lower manager and address it. But be nice and do not distract from the mission of the workplace. If that makes any sense.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","&gt; In other words, it's very difficult to compose a melody that would fit well over both I-V-vi-iii and I-V-vi-IV. You could work something out if you wanted to, but it would probably be a fairly 'strange' sounding melody, at least to western ears.

But this isn't counterpoint, it's rock and roll.  In the key of E if you add a G#, B and D# to an A chord you get a #11, as long as you play them in a higher octave, where the melody usually is.  In jazz, a #11 would be a common substitution for a IV chord, and I could see pop using those intervals in a melody, particularly at the end of a chord progression when the relative dissonance would sound interesting.

Your point is well taken that the iii and IV are very different structures harmonically speaking, especially if I'm substituting a #11 for the IV.  But I don't think the overall feeling of this piece is very different than what Pachelbel wrote, and how that chord progression turns up in pop music.","1233487892"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","- basically there's not a view that i like, each of them (2 actually, i only use tree view and column view) having some features that i'd like to see in both (ordering in multiple ways,  details of a file)

- i think the treeview (cmd+2) doesnt give the clear overview that it should, by putting everything into 1 view. if i want to look at the contents of 1 particular folder, i see the files together with i dont know how many folders. i know i can click a folder to see just its contents, but that's far from fast (having to click the backbutton after that). why cant i choose a 2 panes-view? a tree to the left, the contents to the right (yes, like the windows explorer)

- i have to resize the columns in column-view a lot, because they are always too small, and for some strange reason a lot of those times i end up dragging a bar to the left, and then the other one to the right when i want to see one single column in the right width.

- column-view should be the fast browsing one (i guess), but it's slow. if i scroll through there by holding the down-button it has too many hickups (due to reading of contents/files). doing the same in the pathfinder feels so much better, it does immediately respond.

- how can i go back to controlling the selection in the left 'pane' (the one that contains the places, devices etc). i mostly use my keyboard, and while i can browse with the arrowkeys though files and folders, i havent found out how i should select something from my places, rather than grabbing my mouse and selecting it.

- a minor one, but still: pressing cmd+down for opening a file and enter for renaming one. my god, what's the bright idea behind that one?

- this one wont be fixed by alternative software, but why do filedialogs (open or save a file) look exactly like the finder but dont offer any functionality? say i work on some pictures, save a file, and see that i mispelled the previous saved picture, or have saved it in the wrong folder. i have to manually alt+tab to the finder, open a window, go to that spot and rename or move something....that sucks when i already had the exact file in front of me (in the filedialog).

- more a osx thing, but it's something that i always notice when i use the finder: the fact that osx alt-tabs between programs, not between windows. if i need to browse some files and i alt-tab to finder, my screen get ususally packed with finderwindows because i get every finder window that i opened. i think that sucks.

- i wish there was an option that would not mix up my files and folders. i think it's much clearer when i first see the folders, and then the files.

i like my mac and the way apple thinks about interfaces and user-interaction, but i have the idea that they haven't thought about finder too much in a while.","1233488329"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Well I wasn't intending the defend the entire phenomenon, just the usage of ""pin number"". :)

That said, I don't think its all that bad to repeat a word from an abbreviation or acronym. For one thing, people tend to use the vocabulary they are taught, regardless of correctness. This shouldn't be held against each individual in my opinion.

Besides, once a form comes into common use, I think it basically gets adopted into the language proper (even when its etymology is questionable). At that point, there is no point continuing to complain about its usage.

I guess what I am saying is that while ""PC computer"" is completely indefensible on one hand, on the other hand it has basically been adopted as a valid form by the users of the English language.

I think the etymology of these forms is important though. I assume there was a time, circa 1970, when the average person talking about personal computers, for example, would have reason to doubt that another person could recognize the abbreviation ""PC"". It would therefore make sense to provide additional context to the term. I imagine this is where ""PC computer"" came from. Even in 1970, everybody had at least an idea of what a ""computer"" was, even if the abbreviation ""PC"" was not widely recognized. Effectively ""PC"" was not being used as an abbreviation, but rather as just a sort of adjective.

I would guess that the other terms on your list have similar explanations.

I cringe when I hear some of these, but I just pretend the author put the redundant word in parenthesis, as extra information: ""PC (computer)"", ""ATM (machine)"", ""IP (protocol)"", ""LCD (display)"".

I just wish people would quit whining about the way other people speak and/or write. Its completely counterproductive. English is not owned by merriam-webster, its owned by its users.

Its like an Englishman calling out an American for misspelling ""colour"" ""color"". Granted, at some point America's founders started misspelling it, but that was two hundred years ago. *I* didn't misspell it. I spell it just as correctly as everybody else in my country. At some point we can't all be wrong, even if the etymology is questionable. Right?","1233488549"

I understand that ears are an erogenous zone for women, but really? Pulling your ears means you want sex? Jesus.

So the girl sits there, thinking to herself ""I'm playing with my hair and showing him my neck, and now I'm rubbing my ear! Can't he tell that this means I want him to sidle up to me, pet me for a few minutes, heavily pet me for a few more, slowly remove my clothes, run a bath for me, put oil in the bath, tell me how beautiful I am while we wait for the tub to slowly fill, then we try and get in, but the water is too hot, so he has to do the manly thing and make it more lukewarm, but still warm enough that it makes my girly bits that bit more sensitive, and then we can make slow passionate love in the bath, which makes cleaning afterwards easier, and then we can cuddle afterwards in bed while we dry off and fall asleep in each others arms and I will be the happiest girl on earth. But he's ignoring me! Why? Am I fat? Am I unattractive? Is it that new girl at work? Is it the ex that messaged him on Facebook last month? Is he seeing her again? Oh my god, what will I tell my parents. They said this would happen.""

And I'm sitting there thinking ""What's wrong with her head? Does she have water in her ear? Is that why she's rubbing the side of her face? And why does she look cranky? I guess I'd be cranky too if I had itchy ears. I'll just stay away for a while till she gets over it.""

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I'm in Seattle and I worked for a luxury goods retailer/e-tailer for 10 years. I was one of two Senior Sales associates and my specialty was high end, rare collectibles. I loved my job and I was damn good at it. [toys for rich bankers](http://www.worldlux.com/cgi-bin/searchmodel.cgi?search=le&amp;dept=WATCH).  

Here's a quick rundown of my work history:
*I have been a waiter (food server)
*I did a stint in the lab at a sugar beet factory testing sugar content and tare from individual growers
*I managed a small restaurant.
*I have been a retail sales person   (jewelry,  men's accessories}
And the last ten years have been internal sales.

I started my job hunt indiscriminately and with great zest by applying to any and all listings where I was even remotely qualified. I would spend hours tailoring my resume for each company that I was applying to. I was soon all too familiar with the repetitious circus they call ""The Hiring Process"" 

I've decided that I need a break. Lately I've been applying to small companies that I think my be a little more straightforward in their hiring process. I'm putting my business card collection to good use and making some calls that might land me something and I have a new and improved resume for any establishment looking to hire a former desk jockey as a bartender.

My girlfriend contracts custom home painting.  She has a network of painting companies that call on her for high precision work, specialty jobs like varnishing antique banisters and woodwork, luxury home remodels, odd request jobs that are easy to fuck up, basically anything that they don't trust enough(or pay enough) for their own crew to do. she worked a total of three days in December and  3 days in January. 

Thank you for the suggestion of posting this.  Even if this post is buried, It felt therapeutic.  If only my resume could be so brief and honest.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Here's what I got from it.  You can see the equation, and it's actually fairly simple.  There are only three bits of the equation you need to know.

**I(Ex)** is the ""functional information"" part.  This is essentially the amount of information that a particular sequence of anything contains in order to perform a specific function (e.g. antibodies).  **I(Ex)** is dependent on two variables.
*Example: how much ""functional information"" is there in an antibody, which is a protein composed of amino acids?*

**N** is the number of all possible configurations that you can have.
*E.g. how many possible combinations of amino acids are there?*

**M(Ex)** represents the number of those possible configurations that actually do whatever specific function is being examined.
*E.g. how many of those configurations actually do the work of an antibody?*

The guy in the video tries to use the equation to come up with a hypothetical ""upper limit"" to the amount of information that could have been created through natural selection.  He comes up with 140 ""functional bits"", significantly less than the number calculated for proteins found everywhere.

PZ's blog post points out how the guy misuses the equation; specifically, how he misinterprets what the variable **N** is (he also suggests that **M(Ex)** is wrong, but it's trivial).

**N** should be defined as ""all possible configurations"" but the guy actually defines it as ""all configurations that have ever existed"".  He explains away this change in definition by saying that this is the ""evolutionary search limit"".  In other words, he's saying that in order for an antibody to come into existence, it must have, at least once, been randomly created out of a pool of all possible combinations of amino acids.  It is this assumption (that antibodies were created randomly) that is wrong.  The problem is that the sequence of amino acids in an the newly created antibody does not draw from the pool of all possible combinations of amino acids.  According to natural selection, it draws from a very small and specific subset of all possible combinations: those which resemble *already existing* proteins.

What that means is that the number he generates is meaningless, because it cannot account for the incremental approach of evolution.  It assumes the antibody was created randomly, thus PZ's analogy to the old 747 in a junkyard argument.

"reddit.com","t5_6","My opinion is hard to express, but I'll give it a try.

Half of me does not accept Israel as a ""democratic"" country because it implicitly gives full civil liberties and rights to only one set of people.

The other half of me knows through the proof of more then 3000 years of human history, for one reason or another, Jews have been persecuted, justified or not, this is a fact. We live in a time that has set historical records. With the exception of the United States, there has never been one place in the western world, where Jews were able to live in peace and allowed to assimilate into local culture, for more than a hundred years. 

Knowing this causes half of me to respect and understand Zionist sentiment. To even reluctantly give a pass to Israel's political shift to the right over the past 10 to 15 years or so.

I would prefer to see an Israel that fights as hard as it does to guarantee freedom and rights to *everyone* who wants to live there, Jewish or not. Much like the United States. 

But seeing the reaction to whenever Israel takes a hard stance against any type of aggression, seeing how quickly people, especially on the left, are so quick to find only fault in Israel and ignore so many other facts, enforces my feeling that antisemitism is alive and well through out the world, including the United States. 

We are often seen as being paranoid in finding antisemitism in so many instances. Yet it is enough to read so many comments here on Reddit and it is obvious that, not all, but many people harbor a deep hatred for me, only because I am Jewish. They don't know me, I don't know them. Yet for some reason I am an enemy to them. I am hated. This happens not only on Reddit. But many times throughout my life I have encountered this. I don't think the existence of Israel is enough to justify this hatred. It has been around for a much longer time then the modern Israel has. If some one tries to justify the hatred, that only enforces the feeling of antisemitism. Why should I be hated for the simple fact that I was born into a certain group of people?

When I see protesters with signs of the star of David equals the swastika, how can I avoid not feeling that only Israel is 100% dedicated to protecting me and my family? Only Israel puts my safety before anything else, including world opinion and approval?

"linux","t5_2qh1a","As a disclaimer, I still use Gnome.  So, no, it's not that bad.

Editing panels is a pain in the ass.  Why exactly do I have to unlock something to move it?  Also, the ordering of panel elements tend to get messed up when changing resolutions.  Unlocking, moving, and relocking a dozen app launchers gets old, really quick.

I'm not a particular fan of the default two panel layout.  That's more of a personal preference though.

GVFS is crap.  Well, maybe not as bad as GnomeFS.  At least the official gnome applications all seem to support it without any hitches (I still remember gedit complaining that it didn't support smbfs:// years ago... what?).  If you happen to like non-gnome apps, such my preference for audacious (which even uses GTK!), gvfs is worthless.

The gnome menu.  Not enough actions on each element, only stupid 'add launcher to X' actions that no one uses any way (why would I?  Drag'n'drop icons is well supported and is more natural anyway).  I should be able to drag'n'drop to re-arrange the order  and 'category' of icons, and at least access the properties via a right click menu.  

The categories method of organizing is better than the Windows (big blob under All Programs, God have mercy on your soul if you remember an apps function but not its name).  It needs some serious work though (Accessories in particular tends to be a mess with a bunch of unrelated apps).  While I sort of like the ability to hide launchers, it really isn't a sufficient solution to solving unused applications.  Menus start getting really big and messy simply by having both KDE and Gnome installed.

The Preferences/Administration control panel is a mess.  The distinction between the two is murky, but even then there are settings apps that seem to be in the wrong category.  The HPLIP toolkit is similar to the printing settings app but it's in preferences.  Why they are separate apps just raises more questions.  Why is network configuration in preferences and network tools in administration?  Why exactly is it important to divide settings apps into two categories in the first place?

The settings apps themselves, in particular their idea of scope.  Settings related to window behavior can be found in at least two different places, Appearance and Windows.  It would make sense to combine the two and screen resolution and screen saver all into one application.  A related Ubuntu/Debian complaint, there are four (!) different applications for managing packages (software sources, add/remove applications, synaptic, and update manager).  Why are network configuration and network proxy different applications?

No gui to install third-party fonts.

Network Manager.  Doesn't give much feed back (for example, a failed wireless network from a wrong key and from a crashing wpa-supplicant results in the same thing: a prompt for the network key).  The newish network manager seems really awful though.  I can add and remove network connections?  What happened to the good days when the program simply autodetected them?  How do these correspond to the actual network connections?  Since it appears I no longer need root access to modify them, how does this work on a multi-user system?  I think network manager is only part of gnome that gets consistently worse over time.

GTK Dialog boxes.  But that's pretty much covered elsewhere on this page.","1233490671"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I plan on posting this as a comment.  I kind of agree with some of the points, these kind of posts only make Linux better.  And I will not as a fan boy but as
a free thinking, common sense person.  And hopefully with a little non-cult dignity.


And I do disagree with this title, ""Stay the Heck Away"".  That is a dumb thing to say about one of the three operating systems out there.  Obviously a lot of people are very happy with Linux.  In 2009, I could easily recommend Linux to some of my young friends.  I wouldn't dare recommend Linux to my parents.  Why not?  I can just imagine telling my parents what a terminal application is.  That would take months just to describe that.

""1.  Linux is a religious cult.""

A. I agree.  This is the number one thing that is hurting linux.  Linux has a lot of fan-boyism that makes it difficult for some Linuxes to improve.
How could this be?  Where is the proof?  First, everything in the linux is good.  There is nothing wrong with linux according to the cult.  I say there is a lot
of things that are wrong with Linux, just like there are a lot of things wrong with Windows and there always will be.  Or maybe not wrong, but can be improved upon.
Ubuntu Linux was created in 2004.  People talk about Ubuntu as if it was Linux.  Certainly for Desktop Linux.  And I love how the die-hard Ubuntu users talk about 
Linux as the greatest thing ever.  That is fine, but you missed 10 years of Linux pain.  I started using linux in 97, I went through a lot of distros before Ubuntu and
there was some pain in there.  And normally the response in the community (the cult) was RTFM or don't worry about (buy another hardware device, like a NVIDIA card)
So it is safe to say, that from 1991 to 2004, a lot of people might have had some issues with Linux but really didn't want to disrupt the cult.

""2. The only people who swear by Linux are either broke (or just cheap), grew up in a religious cult, or tasted a really old and archaic version of Mac and Windows (like Mac OS 6 and NT 4.0), ran away, and never looked back. Typically all of the above.""

A. I disagree with this one.  I know a lot of well to do off tech people that don't mind purchasing another system.  I have a 1400 dollar mac and I put Ubuntu on it.  This is actually one of
the benefits of open source, it is free and you can distribute.  This is one of the things that will trump Windows and Mac for a long time.

""3. There really isn’t much available in Linux that you don’t get cross-compiled in either the latest version of Windows...""

A. That is true. And it gets you thinking sometimes.  If most of the software I use is already on Windows.  I can get windows for $50?  Why am I not using a more thouroughly tested system.
Security is one big sticking point with windows.  Also, the open source distribution of the software.  Those are killers for me, for not really getting two comfortable with Windows.  And
Mac's inability to purchase my own mac parts to build own Mac system makes me not really interested macs (Even though I do own one).


""4. Windows and, to an extent, Mac OS, takes the audacious effort to keep user-exposed details sane and organized, with the regretful exception of Microsoft’s abuse of the Windows registry. ""

Hehe, that is funny, I like this one.  For a desktop OS, Linux still has some ways to go, but Ubuntu does make this easier.  Since, using Ubuntu 9.04 (whatever it is I am using), I haven't touched one configuration file except for maybe a server or two.  When I was using early versions of redhat, I had painful experiences with configuration files.

""5. With Linux, there is no single entity who is accountable to you as a user for the successful evolution of major design characteristics of the operating system, of OS APIs, ""

True, where is the support??? is the question a lot of companies will ask.  This is where I take issue with the Linux community.  Somebody or some group should just take a big axe and start cutting 
off projects that are to a certain level usability or community size or whatever.  For example, Ubuntu probably shouldn't have a connection to alpha products or software that hasn't reached the 0.7 mark or 1.0 mark.
People love to talk about how Ubuntu has thousands of applications that are free. That isn't always a good thing.  Majority of them suck or/are completely useless.  I am still pissed that GIMP hasn't much improved their
UI.  Whatever.  Type in 'Gimp Sucks' into google and you will have reading material for months.

Also, pick a tool and stick with it. For example, I would chose KDE over Gnome for Ubuntu and let Gnome going find another popular distro.  I can't imagine what the people at Canonical have to do to support two complete windowing environments.

6. Linux is not an original OSS effort; it’s a freeware x86 port from a third party commercial OS that’s been “grown” and that has evolved with bubblegum and tape (as in like Windows 9x).

I think you are misinformed here.  And loosely based on Minix.  I have studied the Linux source religously and can I say that was all or mostly all of Linus' original code.  On drivers and all of that stuff, who knows where it came from, but Linux is pretty different so the developers had to really rework existing unix drivers even if they did ""port"" it.

Frankly, I don't see much wrong with the Linux kernel.  That seems to be a real nice piece of engineering.  The complete Linux operating system experience on the other hand can be a little questionable.

""7. Linux hasn’t ever enjoyed a serious architectural redesign and rework like the Mac has enjoyed once or twice (OS 1-8 to OS 9 to particularly OS X) ""

True, but that is that really bad.  With the linux kernel at the heart of the system, there is oppurtunity to architect a new system.  Some might consider Ubuntu a different flavor from Gentoo (for example).  I think
there was been some rearchitecting as you put it.  But nothing entirely major.

""8. The claims that the latest versions of Linux are more stable than the latest versions of Windows or of OSX are just plain ignorant. Windows has come a LONG way,""

I don't know how to measure this and probably a lot of people don't. I want to go on record as saying that the Linux kernel is great piece of work, has a lot of the top people in software pooring over the technology.  There are aspects in user land that is not as a stable as on Windows.  Up until recently have always had issues with Firefox on Linux.  Apparently because there is only one guy writing the Adobe Flash driver.  There are lot of technology in Linux guy where one person is doing both the development and testing of the software.  There is no way to say that software developed and tested by one person is going to have the same amount of quality as a system developed by a software company.  Every time I visit a new Linux distro, I have to relearn all of the software.  Normally because that piece of software sucked and a group decided to use something else.  I use
to use Xine on my old redhat system, it had a lot of UI/Bug issues.  Now I use Rhythmbox.  And you can notice major changes from earlier revisions.  Who knows what the software will look like a year from now.  

""9. You don’t get Direct3D on Linux.""

Direct3D is fine for game development and of course may see more game adoption if it were ported to Linux.  But not really a big issue.  I guess someone should call Microsoft, ask them to port it.  It actually seems like a good business decision to stick it to Linux by not porting some of their software.  It is not like developers at MS haven't heard about it.  I would like to see a MS sponsored port of .NET.

""10. You don’t get PowerShell on Linux. (Bash, Python, and the like, which are more broadly available but less powerful than PowerShell, are available on Windows, so Linux doesn’t have an exclusive counter-argument.)""

Once again see point 9.  Microsoft has some good software and Linux has some.  Does every piece of software need a linux port.  Hell, I wouldn't mind a Adobe Photoshop port.

""11. You don’t get IIS 7 on Linux. ""

Are you insane?  I wouldn't ever run a window server product.

12. Despite Mono, 

True.

""13. Comparatively speaking, unproductivity is almost guaranteed. ""

Not always the case.

""14. While Linux has evolved over time, it has not evolved at the same rate as Mac OS and Windows as of late. Evolution of solutions built on Linux do little to enhance or place demands upon Linux ""

This can be true and will be interesting to see if Linux can keep up 5 10 years from now.  Or vice-versa.  Will Microsoft be able to compete with open source.  Microsoft is at an advantage.  They can
leverage their resoures, using a lot of 'real' money. And they can't compete with open source, there is nothing stopping them from open sourcing windows and then only sell user software.

On the other side of coin, Canonical is not a big company and they seem to be doing a good job of supporting Ubuntu.  It is possible that a company like Sun or some other large company could create their
own Linux.  Sure, Sun has and some companies do, but it isn't on the top of their agenda.  Major companies seem to put Linux in the fine print.  I would love to see a company go for it or die trying with a
Linux solution. ""I am looking at you Sun Microsystems""

""15. Except to be cheap or to roll your own flavor (custom toppings), there’s really not much point to go Linux unless your systems are already built around it. Linux is great for nearly-free personal server hosting and for cheap and simple scaling out. But it’s quite a small wonder that, despite Red Hat, Ubuntu, SuSe, Mandriva, and other hopefuls, Linux has hardly made a splash in desktop space. ""

Isn't that enough.

NOTE: I have been using Linux since 1997 and continue to use it.

What about if you were doing this manually? Presumably you'd just set a piece of string to your route, then measure the straightened string without measuring altitudes and breaking things up into a huge series of triangles...

Iran threw a revolution in 79 throwing out the [Shah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).  If the Iranians don't like what they have then let Iranians change it.  As it the President before last was a Reformist, Khatami, and his best bud, moderate conservative Rafsanjani, now sits as chair of the Assembly of Experts.  If I were Iranian I'd have a problem with the current President/administration but not with the Republic itself.   

They've taken control themselves before.  They can do it again if the June elections aren't open, and/or if *they* want to.

&gt;**They are the policy setters, Ahmadinajad is their mouthpiece and he is spelling their goal very clear unlike his predecessor.**

Not true ([plus his predecessor Khatami was very outspoken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&amp;v=SC4WEcBDq2A)), Ahmadinejad has become unpopular with Iranians for exactly the opposite reason - [it is his policy of spend, spend, spend and inflation that has ruined the Iranian economy](http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=2508).  

&gt;**They purchased the A-Bomb know-how from Pakistan and are using centrifuges in the open.**

Evidence of that first bit?  Zero.  [AQ Khan retracted the statement saying that Pakistan's (CIA backed) General Musharraf put the confession into his hand.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/30/pakistan.nuclear)

Using centrifuges openly?  Y'up, as it their legal right, under Article IV, as signatories of the [NNPT](http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf).  Importantly all these centrifuges are monitored by IAEA inspectors and all enrichment is accounted for as being &lt;5%, appropriate enrichment for nuclear energy but  nothing near what is required for weaponisation (circa 95%)

&gt;**They are very clear about their goals and Mahmood Ahmadinajad is spelling them all the time.**

Ahmadinejad is a none argument when you consider inspectors are still in place and he faces a presidential election in June...which he is set to lose unless an external threat pushes Iranians to support the incumbent.

Clear on their goals?  The IAEA has no evidence of an active nuclear weapons programme and a fatwa by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei was announced in 2005 and circulated by the IAEA stating: 

&gt;[that the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never acquire these weapons.](http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/iran/nuke/mehr080905.html)

So if you think their goals are something else you have suspicion and nothing much else unfuelled by paranoia/conquest.

&gt;**BTW your definition of a fair deal is wiping off Israel off the map, isn't it?**

No. I denounce *ALL* strikes against Israel.  

It is just convenient for you to think that anybody who is not an advocate of your policies is an advocate of something much worse against Israel and thus the Israeli Government's crimes against humanity are some how justified.  This is not the case.  ","1233493135"

Then FDR came along after Hoover and, reneging on his more or less *free market* campaign promises, basically proceeded to extend and expand the failed tactics of the Hoover Administration. The New Deal was a complete failure, leading to a decade of complete economic misery.

The only reason that this recession lasted as long as it did, becoming the Great Depression, was that neither president would allow the badly needed market correction to occur.

"technology","t5_2qh16","It IS a piece of crap on Windows.  Here's why:

Non-standard window-drawing - You know how the iTunes interface is all silver?  Well, you also can't resize it from any edge, like you should be able to on any Windows program.  It also breaks other functionality, which I will not detail here.

It's really slow - I keep the bare-minimum files in iTunes; only what I sync with my iPhone.  Even so, I cannot scroll smoothly though my collection.  It slowly stutters, jumps around, and it barely responds to mouse clicks.  I have a very powerful system, and this shouldn't happen.  I suspect it has to do with the crappy interface (see previous item).  It happens with ATI and Nvidia graphics cards.  

It's a memory-hog - It installs several processes which run all the time for no reason.  It requires Quicktime, which also is a piece of crap on Windows.  The main program requires over 60MB of memory with a tiny music collection.  Even though it's using all that memory, it's still horrible slow.  

Big and bloated as it is, it's also really lacking in features.  It supports a limited number of music formats (and not WMA, which matters to me because I keep most of my library in WMA Lossless).  Also, you'd think that if it leaves 3 processes running all the time, that it could at least support folder-monitoring.  

If you think it's the only program that can manage your library, you've obviously not tried Winamp, MediaMonkey, or even Windows Media Player.  They all do a lot more, use a lot fewer resources, and run much more smoothly than iTunes.  ","1233493312"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I dated a girl with a history of clinical depression.  For 3 years.

She had her ups, she had her downs.  When she was up she was one of the most amazing people on the face of the earth.  When she was down, she was the most cruel to the one closest to her - yours truly.
But interestingly enough, this story isn't from one of her times down.

After a particularly bad stretch she went on some intense anti-depressants.  They helped a lot, they balanced her out.  Without exaggeration, they saved her life.  They also absolutely and mercilessly killed her sex drive.  We tried hard, we tried everything. Things weren't working.  Our intimacy plummeted.  I stopped even trying to initiate sex, sick from being constantly rejected.  Every other aspect of the relationship that was fine until that point started to suffer as the lack of intimacy began spreading into other parts of the relationship and we started resenting each other and fighting over absolutely meaningless and pointless things.

Finally, at one point, she tearfully confessed that she could no longer tell if the sexual problems were because of the medication or because of me (at that point I'd had a displaced disk in my spine, so I was sedentary for a few months and gained some weight).  We broke up weeks later.

Considering everything that I went through standing by her and offering unconditional support through thick and thin when she was at her darkest - hospitalized and suicidal - saying what she did was an absolutely brutal crushing blow.

Because she got me to wonder myself and doubt myself.  Having slept with a multitude of women since then, I have absolutely no more doubt and know that it wasn't me, and it was the medication.  But it still hurts to think that she was confused into thinking it was me, and given that she is now off meds and happy with a new boyfriend, possibly continues to think it was my fault even now.","1233493339"

Ok, so she has asked the heterosexual feminists among us to come bat for our team.  Is it really so offensive that we need to tell her to go to hell?

Good stories with strong opinions on either side make for great debate.  Although I shy away from the radical lesbian separatists (first girlfriend turned me off from it), I can see that there is some validity to it all.

I too believe that my sexuality was a choice.  Of course my biology has effected that choice - If I wasn't attracted to women, I wouldn't be a lesbian - but I decided that it would be easier for me to live as a lesbian than a straight woman and I feel that I had somewhat of a say in who I turned out to be.

Leaving choice out (my wife is adamant that she is gay because of her biology - for her this is her truth), we defer to being gay as being biology only.  To me this is a ""we couldn't help it so be nice to us"" approach.  For some, this works, for others, being gay is both a lifestyle choice and political decision.

Why can't we accept the fact that some of us believe being gay is a choice and others nature?","1233493370"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Specific NPT Violations

From the mid-1980s to 2003 Iran violated its safeguards agreement with the IAEA by failing to declare numerous activities required by Iran’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA, primarily involving experiments with nuclear material. Though several IAEA reports describe these violations, the November 2004 report provides an especially detailed summary of Iran’s overall nuclear program, including specific NPT violations.

According to the IAEA, Iran failed to declare the following major activities:

• Uranium Imports: Iran failed to report that it had purchased natural uranium (1,000 kg of
UF6, 400 kg of UF4, and 400 kg of UO2) from China in 1991, and its subsequent transfer for
further processing. Iran acknowledged the imports in February 2003.

• Uranium conversion: Iran did not inform the IAEA of its use of the imported uranium in
tests of its uranium conversion processes, including “uranium dissolution, purification using pulse columns, and the production of uranium metal, and the associated production and loss of nuclear material.” Iran acknowledged this failure in February 2003.

• Uranium enrichment: Iran failed to report that it had used 1.9 kg of the imported UF6 to
test P1 centrifuges at the Kalaye Electric Company centrifuge workshop in 1999 and 2002.
In its October 2003 declaration to the IAEA, Iran first admitted to introducing UF6 into a
centrifuge in 1999, and into as many as 19 centrifuges in 2002. Iran also failed to declare the associated production of enriched and depleted uranium.

• Hidden Sites: Iran did not declare to the IAEA the existence of a pilot enrichment facility at the Kalaye Electric Company Workshop, and laser enrichment plants at the Tehran  Nuclear Research center and at Lashkar Ab’ad. Because experiments at these sites involved the use of nuclear material in equipment, Iran was obligated to report them to the IAEA.

• Laser Isotope Enrichment Experiments: Iran failed to report that in 1993 it imported 50
kg of natural uranium metal, and that it used 8 kg of this for atomic vapor laser isotope
separation (AVLIS) experiments at Tehran Nuclear Research Center between 1999 to 2000,
and 22 kg of the metal for AVLIS experiments at Lashkar Ab’ad between 2002 to 2003.  These activities were ultimately acknowledged in an October 2003 declaration.

• Plutonium Experiments: Iran did not report to the IAEA that it had produced uranium
dioxide (UO2) targets, irradiated them in the Tehran Research Reactor, and then separated
the plutonium from the irradiated targets. Iran also failed to report the production and
transfer of waste associated with these activities and that it had stored unprocessed irradiated targets at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center. In later meetings with the IAEA, Iran said that it conducted the plutonium separation experiments between 1988 and 1993 using shielded glove boxes at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center.

Although Iran has been candid about much of its work since 2003, there continue to be areas in
which the IAEA has not received the cooperation it requires to understand fully Iran’s nuclear
program and thereby determine the extent of Iran’s compliance or lack thereof with the NPT.
Access to People and Places: Iran continues to deny the IAEA access to equipment and areas
of the Physics Research Center at Lavisan-Shian and elsewhere for environmental sampling, and
despite repeated requests, has not made available for interview one of the center’s former directors. IAEA entry to another site, Parchin, was granted only after repeated requests and under circumscribed conditions. Iran recently balked at a request by the IAEA to visit the underground halls at Natanz on grounds that the number of recent inspections was “excessive.”

As noted below, Iran has refused outright to discuss sensitive issues related to alleged high explosives testing, the design of a missile re-entry vehicle and apparent linkages between its nuclear program and Iran’s military.

P-1 Centrifuges and the Khan Network: Iran showed the IAEA a copy of a hand-written onepage document dating from contacts with the Khan network in 1987, discussing the supply of
2000 centrifuges, drawings and specifications for a “complete plant” including a workshop for
the manufacture of supporting equipment. Iran claims that it had no contact with the Khan
network again until 1993 and that this single document is all that remains of the 1987 offer. Iran has refused to provide the IAEA with a copy of the document and insists that no additional documentation exists regarding those earlier exchanges. IAEA officials have interviewed members of the Khan network and reported that “statements made by Iran and key members of the network…. are still at variance with one another.” 

P-2 Centrifuges: Iran told the IAEA that it received drawings for P-2 components via the Khan network in 1995 but claims that it conducted no work on the machines until 2002, when it contracted for the local manufacture of at least seven P-2 rotors. In a discussion with IAEA inspectors, the Iranian engineer responsible for the rotors said that because the P-2 design required maraging steel cylinders with bellows, which Iran could not manufacture indigenously, he modified the design for carbon composite rotors. Other officials explain the seven year gap in
conducting R&amp;D by pointing to staffing shortages and a decision to pursue the P-1 program.

The IAEA is struck, however, by the short time it took for engineers to make design
modifications to the P-2 rotors after reportedly seeing the drawings for the first time, stating that Iran’s reasons for the delay “do not give sufficient assurance that there were no related activities carried out during that period….","1233493460"

"lists","t5_2qhsg","You've never done an oil change and you're giving automotive advice?  I prefer to trust the people who know more about cars, such as the people who make them.  Your mechanic (not lube tech) might say to come back every 3k just so they get more money from you (like how my boss wants it).  If the car manual says to change the oil every 7500 miles, it's a waste of time and money to go earlier.  I'm *guessing* the 3000 mile changes are for older cars from the 70s or earlier.  Lots of old people cling onto their car maintenance habits from when they learned to drive many years ago.  Some people still won't rev the engine past 3k for fear of breaking something even though there is a safe redline at around 6k.  Even my 24 year old 4-banger beater can hit redline without shaking too much.
Also, anyplace that offers an oil change thats cheap enough to not think about will probably be under-trained.  I've loosened many oil filters and drain plugs that have been way overtightened. Hand tight on the filter and don't use much more than your wrist strength while tightening a drain plug please.  On occasion, they'll even leave the old oil filter gasket on your car just so they can buy you a nice new engine later that week.  I'm sure many of them do a fine job of changing your oil, but it's not like they have to know anything about cars to do that.    
Basic LOF (lube oil filter) is usually around $30 (Cleveland area).  Not cheap unless you're well off.  Some of the fancier cars (and diesels maybe, but I'm not familiar with them) can be as much as $100.     
And fuck you Ford.  Thanks for putting lots of crap beneath many of your oil filters.  I love having to clean oil off the exhaust so the customer doesn't come back wondering about the smoke.

If it's possible to make an ill-defined statement, then any statement incorporating an ill-defined statement tends to be ill-defined as well.

Since SQL allows for NULL, it must also allow for ill-defined statements, and needs three-valued logic: True, False, and Undefined or [Mu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu\_\(negative\)).

At any rate, I refer you to two examples in Friedman's book.  The first is the example of the four Robinson Crusoes trapped on four islands.  Friedman argues that no one man should be compelled to share resources with another and that no one man should be compelled to associate with another to receive resources.  This model only works if one presumes that the four characters value their property more than their own life.  The second example is a note he comment he makes about a farmer, who is free to do whatever he wishes with his crops.  He neglects again the role of survival in this situation, where the farmer is compelled by nothing but economic interest.

This draws a parallel to the former example, where the author treats the people in the model as purely economic entities, acting on the basis of nothing but economic benefit.  There is a bit more to division of labor than showing up and selling plows.  ","1233494700"

To my understanding the U.S. government struck a deal with OPEC to price oil in USD in exchange for military support and wealth. All industrial countries need oil and therefore must trade actual commodities to the U.S. for USDs which are then traded to OPEC for oil. Knowing that the federal reserve simply prints money in the form of debt is the kicker. Because the U.S government can borrow money from the fed and the fact that oil is priced in USD essentially means that the U.S. government gets FREE oil. Oil is the lifeblood for running a military. It powered the modern military from tanks to fighter planes to everything in between. For the U.S. economy, this translates to the growth in the Financial industry and military industrial complex. The growth in the service sector and reduction in production sector is the result of a combination of other things.  ","1233495148"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Last week, President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad of Iran wrote a letter to King Abdullah, explicitly recognising Saudi Arabia as the leader of the Arab and Muslim worlds and calling on him to take a more confrontational role over “this obvious atrocity and killing of your own children” in Gaza. The communiqué is significant because the de facto recognition of the kingdom’s primacy from one of its most ardent foes reveals the extent that the war has united an entire region, both Shia and Sunni. Further, Mr Ahmadi-Nejad’s call for Saudi Arabia to lead a jihad against Israel would, if pursued, create unprecedented chaos and bloodshed in the region.

&gt;So far, the kingdom has resisted these calls, but every day this restraint becomes more difficult to maintain. When Israel deliberately kills Palestinians, appropriates their lands, destroys their homes, uproots their farms and imposes an inhuman blockade on them; and as the world laments once again the suffering of the Palestinians, people of conscience from every corner of the world are clamouring for action. Eventually, the kingdom will not be able to prevent its citizens from joining the worldwide revolt against Israel. Today, every Saudi is a Gazan, and we remember well the words of our late King Faisal: “I hope you will forgive my outpouring of emotions, but when I think that our Holy Mosque in Jerusalem is being invaded and desecrated, I ask God that if I am unable to undertake Holy Jihad, then I should not live a moment more.”

&gt;Let us all pray that *Mr Obama possesses the foresight, fairness, and resolve to rein in the murderous Israeli regime and open a new chapter in this most intractable of conflicts.*

If everything checks out, pay blue book; if there are problems, negotiate the cost of resolving them into the price.

Unfortunately, when it came to writing The Satanic Bible, LaVey hypocritically fell short of following his own rules."" Smulo further claimed **LaVey's most well known written work, The Satanic Bible relied heavily on many writers of a philosophical nature, most notably Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Aleister Crowley. LaVey has stated that his religion was “just Ayn Rand’s philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added"",[9]** though many say that he should be given credit for his creative synthesis of the thought of others into what has become the most influential statement of modern Satanism.[citation needed] LaVey has denied claims of plagiarism in The Satanic Bible.[10]

It's a start. But let's now filter out things we are not interested in:



$ ncal 2000 | awk '/^Fr/ {print}'

Fr     7 14 21 28     4 11 18 25        3 10 17 24 31        7 14 21 28

Fr  5 12 19 26        2  9 16 23 30        7 14 21 28     4 11 18 25

Fr  1  8 15 22 29        6 13 20 27     3 10 17 24        1  8 15 22 29

$ 

That's much better, but we still would have to count the 13s manually. (NOTE that you could have used grep above instead of awk: ncal 2000 | grep ""^Fr""). But we don't want to do that since it is not practical:


$ ncal 2000 | awk 'BEGIN { count = 0 } /^Fr/ { for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++) { if ($i ~ /^13/) {count++}}} END { print count}'


This basically pipes the calendar to awk which initializes count to 0, filters the lines that don't begin with Friday, walks through all the dates and for the ones that match 13 it increases the counter. Finally it prints the count at the end.


By the way this prints 1.


Now we just need to iterate over all the years 

$ for year in {2000..2100}; do printf ""Number of friday 13th in $year: ""; ncal $year | awk 'BEGIN { count = 0 } /^Fr/ { for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i++) { if ($i ~ /^13/) {count++}}} END { print count}'; done

which outputs:

Number of friday 13th in 2000: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2001: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2002: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2003: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2004: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2005: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2006: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2007: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2008: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2009: 3

Number of friday 13th in 2010: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2011: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2012: 3

Number of friday 13th in 2013: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2014: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2015: 3

Number of friday 13th in 2016: 1

.

.

.

Number of friday 13th in 2095: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2096: 3

Number of friday 13th in 2097: 2

Number of friday 13th in 2098: 1

Number of friday 13th in 2099: 3

Number of friday 13th in 2100: 1


Of course one could have done this more gradually:

For example we look at output of ncal 2000
then we filter out all the lines that are not for Friday:

$ ncal 2000 | grep ""^Fr""

$ ncal 2000 | grep ""^Fr""
Fr     7 14 21 28     4 11 18 25        3 10 17 24 31        7 14 21 28

Fr  5 12 19 26        2  9 16 23 30        7 14 21 28     4 11 18 25

Fr  1  8 15 22 29        6 13 20 27     3 10 17 24        1  8 15 22 29


Now let's print out all the 13s in these lines

$ ncal 2000 | grep ""^Fr"" | perl -nae 'foreach (@F) { if (/^13/) { print ""$_\n"";}}'

13

$ 

Now we just need to count them. wc -l does exactly that (it counts how many lines are in the output):

$ ncal 2000 | grep ""^Fr"" | perl -nae 'foreach (@F) { if (/^13/) { print ""$_\n"";}}' | wc -l


       1

$ 

And finally put a loop around it:

$ for year in {2000..2100}; do printf ""Number of Friday 13th in $year: ""; ncal $year | grep ""^Fr"" | perl -nae 'foreach (@F) { if (/^13/) { print ""$_\n"";}}' | wc -l; done

which prints the same thing.

And if you are doing your development from the command line using Vim or Emacs then you can be up to 1000 times more productive than someone who can't touch type, doesn't know UNIX and lives in some IDE helping them find their way around.

You get to see what the average person is doing on Twitter. Sometimes you will be amazed at how complex and how insightful people can be. And yes there are a lot of really fucking shallow people out there too. 

It is a bit childish, this hatred for Twitter, Digg and so on. It's like two schools of internet geekdom saying 'I am so not 2.0' and the other says 'Yeah you are.' Then you all go to your respective link dump sites and moan about how this guy said this on this site and then he put up a link that was on our site first, etc...

Who knows what will be the next generation of communication devices and networks. People love their iPhones like they are their children. A whole city awaits outside my doorway and it is filled with people walking while interfacing with some sort of device and they are oblivious to the trams/bikes/people around them.

Kids with mobiles are playing music on the shit speakers that come with the phones and think that they are tough shit. Whatever happens next may be cool or annoying but you are going to have to live with it or change it.

At some point people will have to disconnect. I have a rule that I don't use the computer past 7pm. It's tough to obey..anyway: gotta get on the bike, to the store and restock...

So, hey, Reddit has spoken: don't do the intelligent thing and recognize that possession is 9/10ths of the law (it's just an aphorism, probably doesn't mean anything or describe any commonly encountered situation...) and instead you should shoot your landlord.  Because that always helps.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This sounds like the start of an interesting debate, if you are interested in discussing the issue with them and have time to do so. Be careful not to let them control it or take you into irrelevant directions. For example, at the very first point about death, you could have pointed out that it has nothing to do with theism: deities are not required for an afterlife, and vice versa. They often don't realize that. ""What's your explanation?"" is very general and vague, make them first narrow it down to the specifics that scares them before even trying to answer anything. The faithful thrive on vague unanswerable statements. Also, agnostics don't think any specific religion ""might be right"", they are perfectly able to dismiss them. If you believe that knowing about God is impossible then all religions based on ""what God wants"" are nonsensical, especially so when they contradict themselves.

When you don't want a discussion or have no time for it then non-answers are best. ""What do you believe?"" ""I believe I have to go now.""

I am with Mr. Mongrel in contempt for any fake programmers and unethical greedy people out there that suck off of and exploit that which is produced by the real, actual talent. --- But, that is one issue. And, Zed acting like he's bigger than the world just because of Mongrel, is sort of small. So, my point above was - if he wants to rant and lecture like he's the smartest programmer on the planet, then he should at least program something a bit more inspiring than servers for frameworks/languages which also probably shouldn't have been bothered with in the first place). Sort of like, yet not quite as pathetic, as all the fake programmers that keep making javascript libraries and think they are so slick - while they give a few functions grandiose names and spam up the internet with chatter about nothing and pride over the obvious. I don't care how people wish to waste their own time. But, the inneficiency just kills me: the effort to invent one's own stupid layer which must be learned by whoever is stupid enough to buy into the hype and probably already bothered to learn the less distorted layer. Now, of course this is pretty silly of those who learn somebody else's redundant function names - as silly I guess as one who thinks he is the shit, as he wraps a website and scam around a few functions. Zed is not one of these guys; however, if Zed, or the annoying library re-makers, are going to lecture the world on what's up with programming; and if they are going to devote 20+ pages to telling people how stupid they are.... that's way too big of truck to justify the carriage of a Mongrel. Make an app that exchanges bandwidth to where 0 percent is wasted; then, incorporate the method with a universal and instant discovery technique; Make all the information in constant flow so no fixed servers are necessary - since apps and widgets are quickly replacing localized service; program it so that applications can be be independent of one service - can embed functionality as a blanket or skin, across the flow of the net, while still defining an array of one application who's every distinct interface self serves; or something like that? - program something cool like that and then got lecture, bitch, and brag.","1233497715"

My life reads like a very bad soap opera composed by sadistic writers (from the outside- I'm actually pretty happy right now), and when it comes right down to it the only thing that I have is my refusal to give into it. 

My decision to end my life or not has sometimes seemed like the only thing that I can control, but it IS in my control. Since I don't have any religious beliefs I don't think that there is anything after death, and I guess when it comes down to it I'm just too stubborn to give in. 

That doesn't mean that I don't still have times of despair, because I do.  I have chronic cylical depression which usually manifests itself every 5 or 6 years, but fortunately over the years (I'm 44 now), I've also managed to make contact with 2 or 3 friends who I can call at any time, or join online communities (like this one), where someone can just listen.  

In my experience (when things have been very, very bad for me), I've found that if I wait even 24 hours, I'm already going to feel differently.  If I can talk to anyone when I'm in that kind of shape (which is difficult for me, as I've got an inflated sense of pride and don't like to admit that I'm fallible), I'm going to feel differently.

I won't even elaborate how retarded that comment was given that British universities only limit their places by the amount of money they have available.

Do not confront the person in public, private or via email.  (At least not anymore.)

I personally would not have confronted them but would have asked HR to send a notice to prevent people from further proselytizing.  An email forward to HR saying that this behavior is unacceptable in a workplace (without specifying your own beliefs-- why should they need to know?) would suffice.  You want to get his behavior documented.

Finally, resist ""revenge""-- countering his action with a reply all to atheist sites.  Imagine if everyone you worked with sent a link to their own religious sites.  That would be a ton of spam, and a ton of strained relations at work.

But they demonstrated it to a military guy.  You would watch it pathetically get blown up, and keep going, until it was on its last leg, and then kept going.

I haven't seen Rambo II for oh so long so I can't recall for that film, but in fact, most of the actors in Vietnamese war films aren't even Vietnamese.

I remember your nightshade well and Centeotl also sounds familiar, but the eldritch that sticks out in mind the most is Skitz. I think for a long time Skitz was top on RvR. Grouping with him meant massive realm points.

Were you there when Midgard was attacking a relic keep and a mana mentalist named Mellmo single handedly killed about 70 of them with AoE dots? We only had a handful of defenders and I managed to hold off the shadowblades attempting to kill her. This is what prompted me to start my own mentalist. 

Back before Lethia I had an Enchanter (gimpy, was before the pbaoe became the best spell) and I got one shotted at least 4 times by Dakkon. That fool would always travel high ground and I'd never see him each time. Upon levelling Lethia to 50, Dakkon left the game, so I was never able to exact my revenge.

One of the craziest things that happened to me was mutually allying with some Infiltrators (which worked great for me since they were designed to be buffer than Nightshades) in the low level battlegrounds, which lasted all the way to 50 in frontier RvR. Somehow, without any verbal communication at all (I think just emotes), I managed to get two really powerful Infiltrators that had full time buffbots named Elahir and Sephia (forgot spelling, might have been Sephira) to not attack me while I killed casters and scouts on their side. Later I eventually talked to them on IRC and they were both very nice people.

I have very fond memories of DAoC. Experiences like this don't come in any other games. The game was sometimes very frustrating with all the buff bots and radar groups running around. It was also the most rewarding when battles were in your favor.","1233498235"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","""but even it was 6 million or 400,000, they still put millions of people in concentration camps because of their religion. it was completely wrong and fucked up; the number of people dying doesn't matter.""

It does matter, it's human history. 

I do agree that wether or not the numbers are accurate, the crime remains the same. 

But I also find historical accuracy to be extremely important. 

And when you actually study the Holocaust, you have to come to the conclusion that the numbers don't add up, and what this man says about cyanide being too impractical for gas-chambers is also true. There are many other arguments too. For instance, there weren't 6,000,000 jews in the entirety of Europe at that time. 

The estimates are based on the most ridiculous math I've ever seen.

And the Nuremberg trials, which used only solid evidence, are another great source of information that doesn't correspond to the official story. 

Coming to logical conclusions based on the study of history doesn't make you an anti-semite just because your conclusions aren't the same as the ""official story"". 

I'll be the first to admit that Nazis were putting jews into concentration camps, denying them all rights and killed a great number of them in horrible ways. 

We're still finding mass graves in places like Poland and the Ukraine:

http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/persecution/pch0209.htm

But that doesn't mean I should say that I agree with something that doesn't make sense to me or that I should refrain from speaking about it.

This man said something about the holocaust in a certain context, and this is being used in a different context to make him look like an anti-semite. 

Maybe he is one, I have no idea. But truth does matter to many of us. Anti-semite or jewish, like I am.

A5.  The IAEA argument is mute??? So we should take your word for it instead that war is the default over the words of the inspectors in Iran?  Just because Israel cheated their way round it doesn't mean....: oh what the heck, stop projecting.

A6.  European Swiss standard of what, domestic electricity sockets?

It now hosts a litany of charges against it from illegal land grabs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You *can* use a liquid crystal display (LCD) as a spatial light modulator (read: an adjustable lens). In order to be able to do this you need to use the liquid crystal to change the *phase* of the incoming light. This is easy because that's what liquid crystals actually do anyway. In a display device, the liquid crystal cells are sandwiched between two polarizers to turn the phase change into an amplitude change -- aka the brightness of the pixel. So just take off the polarizers and you have a device that can dynamically alter the phase of incoming light. However you still need to change the amplitude because you'll want your display to be able to change the brightness of the pixels. What you really need is two liquid crystal displays, one in front of the other. In conjunction, they would be able to change both the amplitude and the phase of light passing through. However there are some problems.  
* There's some pretty complicated maths and measurements involved just to build a *basic* model of how the displays would respond -- the *retarder-rotator* model is probably the simplest so you might wanna use that. Your best bet is to use some kind of neural network or genetic optimization to calibrate the device.  
* It's gonna be a monochromatic display -- If you want colors, you're probably gonna have to chain together more displays (*if* it is even possible)  
* It's only going to work if you keep your head still -- if you want it to be able to focus on an area rather than a point, you're gonna have to chain together more displays, again, *if* it is even possible.

If you want to go about building such a device, here's an idea of what you need to do:
http://www.springerlink.com/content/n74l426v57858101/
These guys used a genetic algorithm for calibration. Personally I think this is the kind of job for a neural network but anyway, you'll need:  
* A monochromatic laser  
* Two identical liquid crystal displays (I'd recommend salvaging them from projectors)  
* For the calibration: A CCD (webcam) and some polarizers -- or you can take the expensive route and get a polarimeter (I'd recommend a [Thorlabs PAX series](http://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1564))  
* Some programming skills.  

Here's you basic setup:    
light source -&gt; linear polarizer -&gt; LCD 1 -&gt; LCD 2 -&gt; linear polarizer -&gt; CCD

* First thing you'll want to do is to see if you can get it to act like a lens. See if you can get a neural network that can control the LCDs in such a way that the spot seen by the CCD is as small and as bright as possible.  
* Next you'll want to make something that can focus a whole image. Say you use a grid pattern, you want the CCD to see the highest contrast possible. 
* If you get this far I'd stop for a break and write a paper on it. 
* The next step would be to do the same thing but somehow compensate for the eye-defect -- you'll probably need some expensive lenses to mimic the defect so you'll want to try and get a grant of some kind. 

Hope this is helps

Verifying that a nuclear program is really “for peaceful purposes” can be challenging, because the ingredients of a peaceful nuclear energy program can be nearly identical to those of a nuclear weapons program. For that reason, the NPT requires member states to abide by strict “safeguards,” which build confidence that a state's nuclear programs are peaceful by rendering them more transparent.

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. bureaucracy assigned to monitor NPT implementation, has identified “many breaches of Iran's obligations to comply” with the safeguards Iran agreed to under the NPT. Unlike with Iraq, this IAEA assessment that Iran has violated the safeguards is grounded not only in closely held intelligence information but also in public, un-contradicted evidence.

A tip to the West by an Iranian dissident group led to the discovery in 2003 that Iran had for the previous 18 years been hiding from the world, including the IAEA, entire facilities and major activities relating to its nuclear program. Iran's failure to disclose these nuclear facilities and activities to the IAEA over the course of those 18 years was a gross violation of Iran's safeguards obligations.

Why, if Iran's nuclear program was for purely peaceful purposes — which is allowed — would Iran conceal these major facilities and activities for 18 years, when such concealment is itself in violation of NPT safeguards?

Iran formally admitted the existence of the facilities and activities in an October 2003 submission to the IAEA that was supposed to be the correct, complete and final story of Iran's nuclear program. Only when confronted with irrefutable technical evidence from IAEA inspections did Iran confess that this purportedly correct, complete and final submission contained glaring omissions relating to the most weapons-friendly part of their program.

The types of nuclear facilities which Iran has chosen to construct, and the nuclear program development activities which Iran has chosen to undertake, are an additional source of concern, as they seem like poor choices for power generation but perfect choices for weapons development. 

If Iran hided NPT violations for 18 years, why not be less absolute that they stopped in 2003. My view, corroborated  by the CIA director in March 2008 is that they continued.  

As Demosthenes said around 2500 years ago:
""There is one safeguard known generally to the wise, which is an advantage and security to all, but especially to democracies as against despots - suspicion.”

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Cute. :) And it brings back memories of my clueless macroeconomics teachers in university.

The simplest analogy I can think of is that it's like if you kept your life savings in a safe, and every day your neighbour Bob broke into it, replaced a bunch of money with IOUs, and then bought you clothes and fancy dinners with it with the explanation that he was ""stimulating"" your personal finances. And in the short-term, you do seem to wealthier than if you were on your own — until one day you check your safe's contents and realize you're broke, and Bob's plan for paying back the IOUs was just to shift around the same money inside your safe, because it turns out he doesn't have a job and lives off your savings completely as well.

You = you

Bob = the government

If you want to hold on to the fantasy that communism does not have decentralizing authority as a central goal, then be my guest, but it **is** pure fantasy. Contrary to you I've provided a citation that actually backs up my assertion.

&gt; AR: All kinds of people today call themselves “libertarians,” especially something calling itself the New Right, which consists of hippies, except that they’re anarchists instead of collectivists. But of course, anarchists are collectivists. Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet they want to combine capitalism and anarchism. That is worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It’s a mockery of philosophy and ideology. They sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons. They want to be hippies, but don’t want to preach collectivism, because those jobs are already taken. But anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect. The anarchist is the scum of the intellectual world of the left, which has given them up. So the right picks up another leftist discard. That’s the Libertarian movement. ","1233499293"

"technology","t5_2qh16","The reasoning that I've heard (and believe) is that it's a deliberate decision to keep copy and paste out of the iPhone to encourage proper application development.  Basically - the reasoning goes - if you need to copy and paste, your application does not work as elegantly as possible.  There should be a menu option to move the information across rather than relying on the OS.

It's not *that* crazy - Apple is clearly very concerned about UI - they have [strict guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/userexperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/chapter_1_section_1.html) for interfaces, and all programs still need to work with one-button mice.  This is why with OS X you see drag-and-drop used so much - and although I would certainly say copy and paste is a good thing, Apple feels drag and drop is simply better (more intuitive certainly).  So they extended that concept to the iPhone. Which, of course, has very limited real estate and IIRC, cannot even mulittask, so there are more complaints now.","1233499331"

Three things come to mind: We think it's funny because that's different to how women are ""supposed"" to be, but at the same time it's funny because we recognize the fury of mad girlfriends and can relate to it, and we also laugh because it's happening to that guy not to us.

"reddit.com","t5_6","From Wikipedia, ""One notable rule is that no merchant accepting Visa, whether a mom-and-pop store or a government body like a university, may establish any minimum purchase, maximum purchase, or surcharge for any Visa (credit) transaction. They may establish surcharges for debit transactions (although lower fees on debit card transactions means that merchants typically encourage use of debit cards by surcharging more for credit cards, where allowed). However enforcement is by individual banks, who may not know the rules well; so a bank may initially uphold a surcharge or minimum, unless the consumer knows the association rules well. Other rules govern what creates an enforceable proof of authorization by the cardholder (starting from a signature or PIN), and continuing to lower levels of proof such as a shipment accepted or a statement by the consumer. Some countries have banned the no-surcharge rule, most notably the UK[17] and Australia[18] and retailers in those countries may apply surcharges to any credit-card transaction, Visa or otherwise."" 

Interestingly enough, while the UK bans the prevention of surcharges, many of the US states (pin number in an atm machine) have done just the opposite: making them illegal.","1233499501"

Let's begin with the story: the local tyrant contracts the ancient Greek polymath Archimedes to detect fraud in the manufacture of a golden crown. Said tyrant, name of Hiero, suspects his goldsmith of leaving out some measure of gold and replacing it with silver in a wreath dedicated to the gods. Archimedes accepts the challenge and, during a subsequent trip to the public baths, realizes that the more his body sinks into the water, the more water is displaced--making the displaced water an exact measure of his volume. Because gold weighs more than silver, he reasons that a crown mixed with silver would have to be bulkier to reach the same weight as one composed only of gold; therefore it would displace more water than its pure gold counterpart. Realizing he has hit upon a solution, the young Greek math whiz leaps out of the bath and rushes home naked crying ""Eureka! Eureka!"" Or, translated: ""I've found it! I've found it!"" ","1233499902"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;**Iran insists it needs nuclear energy as a source of electricity and that its nuclear program is “for peaceful purposes” and thus legal under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran's insistence that it needs to spend billions of dollars on a nuclear energy program when it has very little indigenous uranium but does have the world's second-largest oil reserves (after Saudi Arabia) and second-largest natural gas reserves (after Russia) is laughable. Iran's history of cheating on its nuclear nonproliferation commitments is a more serious matter.**

In fact it makes so much economical sense the US *BACKED* Iran having a nuclear programme in the 70s.  Saudi Arabia is developing its own programme too.  If your revenue comes from selling oil, at the prices you sell it at, it makes no sense to tie up your refinery capacity on oil you will use for electricity.  Better to keep that to sell on market, to get  your electricity another way and to make more profit.

&gt;**Verifying that a nuclear program is really “for peaceful purposes” can be challenging, because the ingredients of a peaceful nuclear energy program can be nearly identical to those of a nuclear weapons program. For that reason, the NPT requires member states to abide by strict “safeguards,” which build confidence that a state's nuclear programs are peaceful by rendering them more transparent.**

Y'up but the default setting is not war...oh are you going to bring up that Iran is a signatory of the NPT but nuke-packing (thanks [Vanunu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanunu) -brave man) ethnic cleansing Israel is not?

&gt;**The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. bureaucracy assigned to monitor NPT implementation, has identified “many breaches of Iran's obligations to comply” with the safeguards Iran agreed to under the NPT. Unlike with Iraq, this IAEA assessment that Iran has violated the safeguards is grounded not only in closely held intelligence information but also in public, un-contradicted evidence.**

And lo you are still stuck in pre-2003 and not since the work-plan when progress to clear things up, according to the IAEA, has been made.  Admittedly it is a process but it is ongoing.

&gt;**Why, if Iran's nuclear program was for purely peaceful purposes — which is allowed — would Iran conceal these major facilities and activities for 18 years, when such concealment is itself in violation of NPT safeguards?**

That's what the current workplan is establishing and making progress on...but we could always cheat and ask Israel why she didn't want to cooperate with the IAEA.

&gt;**""Iran formally admitted the existence of the facilities and activities in an October 2003 submission to the IAEA that was supposed to be the correct, complete and final story of Iran's nuclear program. Only when....**

Still stuck in 2003.  The current 'workplan' answer between Iran and the IAEA still applies.

&gt;**The types of nuclear facilities which Iran has chosen to construct, and the nuclear program development activities which Iran has chosen to undertake, are an additional source of concern, as they seem like poor choices for power generation but perfect choices for weapons development.**

Yet ElBaradei, head honcho of the IAEA,  doesn't have a problem with it and all enrichment is being observed.  Take it up with Russia.  They sold em.

&gt;**If Iran hided NPT violations for 18 years, why not be less absolute that they stopped in 2003. My view, corroborated by the CIA director in March 2008 is that they continued.**

The NIE report, the complete absence of evidence to say it continued, the IAEA inspectors - it is not a question of absolutes, it is a question of not assuming guilt when there is no evidence to assume it.  Oh and that CIA director[...doh!](http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=82558&amp;sectionid=351020104)  (didn't you just know that the Iranians would be all over *that* one)

&gt;**As Demosthenes said around 2500 years ago: ""There is one safeguard known generally to the wise, which is an advantage and security to all, but especially to democracies as against despots - suspicion.”**

Oh feel free to be suspicious.  Suspicion isn't a reason to go to war though.  You should really have evidence before you start thinking in those terms.  You have none.

Incidentally, in light of current of events, just so you know, a massive proportion is now looking on Israel with grave suspicion in exactly that context you just provided.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Dear Dr. Laura,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.

I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.

a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?

e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?

f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (Lev 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?

g) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they die?

i) I know from Lev 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.

Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

Your devoted disciple and adoring fan.

It's called being detached from reality.

**""He lowered taxes""** -- misleading at best. A lot of very rich people and corporations saw a nice tax cut, very few normal people benefitted from the tax policies.

**""He destroyed many of our enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan""** -- Who are these 'many enemies'?  Anyone with a couple working brain cells can see, very clearly, that (a) the war was based on lies and false pretenses (Iraq's connection to 9/11, WMDs, etc), (b) the war is for stealing natural resources - i.e. oil; and therefore, it has nothing to do with 'getting the bad guys' but instead furthering an neoconservative agenda and engaging in war-profiteering for Blackwater/Haliburton, nation-building, etc. See Project for the New American Century (PNAC).


**""He did a good job of holding the nation together immediately after 9/11""** -- as Neuropolis said, it was scare tactic after scare tactic.  Another misleading claim at best.

There's a reason many historians and other scholars call Bush the ""worst President of all time."" There's a reason he left office with a 22% approval rating.   There's a reason he's been called the ""most divisive President of all time."" It's not to ""promote the liberal agenda"" or to get upmods on Reddit, I can assure you.

now, if you access another server, they can provide tailor made ads as long as that server sends along your ip with its request for advertisement. (unless google does not directly provide the ad anyway).

i don't say that the current ads are that sofisticated. but besides a better algorithm, there is nothing that prevents google from profiling.

if you start bluring your interests by fake queries, it becomes much more difficult to extract your interests.

you are right that you can avoid ads. but this is a technical race. e.g. youtube ads are just another div on top of a video. but there is nothing that prevents google from serving the ad inside their video stream.

The things that Jesus did (esp on the cross) cancelled out alot of things from the old testament. He talked out against the pharisees and such who just held onto the law and didn't have love, they just held to ""such and such is a sin, you must be stoned"" and refused to see grace or compassion... sadly, there are many christians who are like minded... they see the laws and they get stuck on them, think that the bible and God's kingdom are all law based... and then they feel its their personal duty to point out everyone elses' shortcomings. This isn't how Jesus lived at all. IMO, if you only want Old Testament, you should be jewish, but if you believe that Jesus came, then start listening to what he taught... b/c most of what He tought was love. 
as far as Him not being an 'uber loving hippie jesus', i know he's not... He says alot of harsh things to alot of ppl (mostly the legalists of the age), and he kicks the people out of the temple who are desecrating it... but not once does He act against those who the pharisees see as 'below acknowledging""... again, just my $.02

"politics","t5_2cneq","""Chertoff blocked the indictment of his former client, Magdy Elamir. 

Chertoff has also blocked the indictment of other Israeli partisans like himself with ties to 911.

In a four part investigative report on the Brit Hume, Fox News program (http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7545.htm)in December of 2001 it was revealed a huge Israeli Mossad spy team of at least 100 members had been arrested by the FBI. The Fox News report revealed that the Israeli spy ring had penetrated FBI, CIA, DEA, U.S. Attorney’s Offices, Federal judges, even military bases. In addition, the Mossad, through an Israeli company was and is able to monitor all phone calls made in the United States, including those of law enforcement agencies. It is known that Israeli drug kingpins in the United States escaped prosecution because of this penetration. 

It also revealed that Mossad agents had closely shadowed the 911 hijackers for months before 911. They repeatedly failed lie detector tests. Considering their close monitoring of the hijackers for months, the FBI agents are quoted as saying, “How could they not have known” the details of the 911 attacks. The report suggests that the Israeli Mossad knew the details of the attacks in advance but did not provide the information to the United States. In one of its most revealing moments, the Fox News report quotes an unnamed FBI source saying that for an agent to expose Israeli spying is “career suicide.” 

Michael Chertoff freed the over 100 members of a huge Israeli spy ring apprehended in the wake of 911, including the Israeli agents who had tapped the telephones and shadowed 911 terrorist leader Mohammed Atta and many of his hijacker team for weeks before the attacks. 

Chertoff also freed five Mossad agents who had been arrested and detained for months by the FBI on the day of the 911 attacks. They had been caught in New Jersey filming and cheering the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center. Interestingly enough they were apprehended with large sums of cash, false passports, and boxcutters (the same devices used in the hijackings). The FBI also found self-taken photos of very happy Mossad agents grinning and flicking their lighters with the World Trade Center burning in the background. Chertoff also allowed all of the apprehended Israeli spies to return to Israel out of the reach of American investigators.

Israel and the Jewish supremacists could not afford these revelations of Israel’s spying and treachery. They had to put one of their own in position to protect their interests. They found him in Michael Chertoff.

Michael Chertoff is the son of a rabbi and a long-time radical Zionist and Jewish supremacist. After the first apprehensions of the massive Israeli spy ring occurred, this dedicated Zionist was quickly put into the position of head of the Justice Department Criminal Division. The United States State Department, Justice Department and Executive branch is honeycombed with Israeli loyalists. President Bush was and is surrounded by them. In the popular vernacular they are called Neocons, but they are simply Jewish supremacists who put the agenda and interests of Israel over that of the United States. Two of them, Wolfowitz and Perle, were the chief architects of the Iraq War, a war good for Israel but an unmitigated disaster for the people of the United States. The Zionist network has many avenues by which they can get almost any appointment in government they want. They put him in a position to quash this story of Israeli treachery, and he in fact did so.""

Going by the smartphone definition on Wikipedia (it's as good as any source on this particular matter), a smartphone is basically a miniaturized computer in a mobile formfactor that also can be used to make phone calls.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","A couple of examples:

&gt; Limited memory protection and memory management. This problem exists *primarily* in versions prior to Windows 2000.

And *secondarily* where? Looks like he's trying to pull a fast one here. Besides, even Windows 3.0 had a kind of memory protection.

&gt; The OS relies heavily upon the application to release allocated resources. If an application hogs resources or fails to release them for some reason, either while running or upon termination, the OS often cannot reclaim those resources.

Untrue. Windows manages memory, file handles and socket connections just fine.

&gt; An application may install DLLs or drivers. This introduces essentially uncertified, third-party code to the system, that may run at kernel-level, i.e. completely unprotected.

*If the user has the adequate permissions.* This is true for any operating system out there. What would he prefer, to forbid installation of kernel modules altogether? Or mandate certification of every bit of code in the system? So, not a design flaw.

&gt; Applications may also introduce modifications into the registry without any protection or verification whatsoever, which may cause other applications or even the OS to crash.

Again, *if the user running the app has the necessary permissions.* If the computer administrator wants to delete a registry key, should we disallow it?

&gt; A very rudimentary and weak security model.

Windows's ACL model is rudimentary as compared to what exactly? Unix's 9-bit permission flags?

&gt; Rudimentary multi-user support.

The kernel supports multiple simultaneous users just fine. The fact that Windows Server costs an arm and a leg, now, that's another thing.

&gt; Windows' API is only partially documented.

The public API is perfectly documented in the MSDN library (which trumps manpages any time). The private API is undocumented per the simple reason that you shouldn't use it, it can and will change. And when the developers do their thing, reverse-engineer the API and use it, the MS developers have to bend over backwards to stay backwards-compatible.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","1.  Nahh...the Iranians have it covered, plus they have massive anti-Ahmadinejad support and the infrastructure set up to make it happen.  I mentioned Ahmadinejad's party only got 88seats out of 260 on the day of the last government election didn't I.  Khatami's still around and Rafsanjani chairing the Assembly of Experts is appointing conservative moderates willy nilly as we speak.  

I see you're edging towards arguing regime change.  'Nice'...the Islamic revolution happened because a US president agreed to overthrow the Iranian democracy back in the 50s.  [Regime change doesn't work and you will get blowback.](http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iran/video.html)  How anybody could not have learned this lesson in the last few years is beyond me.

2.  And Khatami stopped it.  You need to rely on cursory searches less and read more.

3.  LOL.  Then stop listening to [MEMRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFd4dlHPnc) if you want to know what his words are.  Ahmadinejad is on his way out if you'll let him.  The only thing that'll keep him in is if there is a perceived outside threat - just like Bush's and Blair's approval ratings both went up immediately after 9/11 and 7/7.  Iran I might add being involved in neither.  Take a deep breath, and say to yourself, ""Iran isn't a problem.""  That or hide under a duvet; whichever works to get you passed thinking there's a bogeyman in the room.  

4. Didn't say they did.  I said they cheated their way round it.  But you were looking for a motive.  I said you could let the inspectors do their job or suggested asking Israel why they refused to go down the official route.  That could be your motive...but then I realised you were projecting.  Just because Israel secretly developed/stole nuclear weapons technology doesn't mean everyone's at it.  Does kinda raise the issue why Israel is allowed but nobody else is though in your eyes.
Prejudiced?

5.  Then it is doing a really sucky job of doing that then.  Israel broke the ceasefire.  Israel has targetted residential areas, schools, and UN compounds.  Israel is having a radicalising effect.

&gt;There will be no Israeli response if the Palestinians will make peace with Israel

And yet Hamas, Fatah, a 22 state Arab League, moderate and post Zionist Israelis have all said that they could agree to 1967 borders.

The argument I'm referring to is that the gas chambers weren't made to properly hold and evacuate cyanide gases. On top of that, the building was noy air tight. The windows are large and in plain sight. 

It's like a fireplace without a chimney. If it was really meant to kill people by gassing them, then it's the worst possible construction to achieve this. 

""Leuchter also asserted that the necessary ventilation systems and other pieces simply would not fit. Documents from the period show that the gas chambers in fact had powerful ventilators capable of clearing the gas chambers in minutes.[citation needed]""

I've heard this about 80 times now. Nobody was ever able to provide any evidence of this.

The process is:

1) Tax

2) Spend on infrastructure

3) Pay employees money (creates demand)

4) Investors build more factories to produce goods to make a profit due to (3).

**(4) can only occur if there is enough knowledge and resources available to make it possible.**  It may very well be that the capital goods already exist.  In which case (4) devolves to ""continue using existing factories instead of shutting them down.""  On the other hand, (2) probably makes (4) cheaper, so it's very likely that (4) will always be to build more stuff.

&gt; Cry me a river. Your current status is the aggregate of the decisions you have made and the environment you were in. As an adult, you have the power to move to a different environment, so only a child can take that excuse.

I still maintain that not knowing a foreign language well enough to be able to write a documentation that could compete in quality with docs written by native speakers of rivaling projects is not really a Matz's fault. That however doesn't mean that I think it isn't Matz's fault that Ruby docs are severely lacking. In the end it is his project and he is the one who should address the issue.

&gt; The more I try to disagree with this, the more I agree with it. A lack of documentation wastes other people's time, so the developers are claiming that their time is more important than anybody else's. Now, I have no interest in a dynamically-typed object-oriented language, so saying that they should share my priorities would be hypocritical, but I'm reasonably confident that asserting that the devs' time is more important than the users' is not a good way to grow a community.

I don't think Matz would claim that he's time is more important than anybody else's, on the contrary that would be really un-Matz like. I would assert that the Ruby docs are the *best* he could do with his knowledge of English.

As longs as the status quo (that is: Japanese Ruby core devs writing docs in English) doesn't change the documentation is not going to improve one bit.","1233502579"

"reddit.com","t5_6","(Let's make one thing clear.  I'm not condoning anti-Semitic vandalism.)

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht):

&gt;Kristallnacht (German pronunciation: [kʁɪsˈtalˌnaxt]; literally ""Crystal night"") or the Night of Broken Glass or ""night of shattered crystal"" was a pogrom in Nazi Germany on November 9–10, 1938. On a single night, 91 Jews were murdered and 25,000–30,000 were arrested and deported to concentration camps

The double standard is incredible.  The ADL is fine with using holocaust metaphors at the drop of a hat when it comes to vandalism of a synagogue, but somehow it's grossly offensive for critics of Israel to compare the plight of Palestinians in the Gaza strip to the Warsaw ghettos.  Furthermore, the ADL wholeheartedly supported Israel's killing of 1300 Palestinians in Gaza.

To be honest, I'm not enthusiastic about either side's use of  holocaust metaphors, but the ADL has done more than anyone to cheapen the memory of victims of the Shoah.

------------------
Edit:  Of course, let's not forget the vandalism of Palestinian homes with racist genocidal graffiti, such as this case [documented by the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/gaza-israel-samouni-family)

&gt;But most disturbing of all was the graffiti they daubed on the walls of the ground floor. Some was in Hebrew, but much was naively written in English: ""Arabs need 2 die"", ""Die you all"", ""Make war not peace"", ""1 is down, 999,999 to go"", and scrawled on an image of a gravestone the words: ""Arabs 1948-2009"".

- Haemochromatosis, a build-up of iron in the body, can be fatal without regular bloodletting. 
- In order to re-attach severed body parts, you need to keep draining blood from the area until the blood vessels heal together. If you don't the blood pools in the tissue and creates an ideal environment for gangrene. To add an extra medieval twist, the draining is done with leeches.
- Bloodletting has been shown to be an effective treatment against bacterial infections. Essentially bacteria need iron to function properly and bloodletting gets rid of iron. It won't kill the bacteria outright, but it does give white blood cells an advantage. This isn't done now since antibiotics are safer, but in medieval times they didn't have any, so bloodletting would be a valid treatment albeit a dangerous one.","1233502954"

"economy","t5_2qhpn","Before you get all worked up, consider the following. The higher efficiency of global markets leads to increased volatility in cash flow. While this has gradually taken place over the past 6-8 decades, the cost of debt has not adjusted correspondingly (it should be much more costly than it has been in recent history and is today to account for the increased cash flow volatility). For you finance geeks out there, another way of expressing this might be that the *[beta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_coefficient)* of debt cost benchmarked against cash flow stability has decreased over time. This has wildly mispriced debt to be much cheaper than retained earnings for many decades now. It is not surprising companies are going through these tax efficiency efforts; those who have low to no debt and undertaking these tax efficiency remedies are actually being responsible by doing so, as the the remedies are effectively just another means of avoiding unnecessary debt.

If that sounds like just so much jargon, let me illustrate by example. Let's say you run a successful business, and based upon careful analysis and solid market experience, you know that if you pay $1M for some expansion, you will get a $2M ROI within one year and expand sustainable year over year revenue by 25%. After all expenses are paid and you have profits left over at the end of the year, if you want to keep those profits into the next year, in the US and UK you have to declare those profits, pay the corporate tax of about 30%, and the leftover is called retained earnings.

If your company makes enough that the gross profits tally up to that $1M you need for the expansion, then you can spend it all in the same year, declare it an operating expense and no corporate income tax is involved. On the other hand, very few major business expansions can be funded with just one year's gross profits. The vast majority of businesses contemplating these types of expansions will typically need multiple years to save up for that kind of project.

In steps the government and people like Polly into these kinds of expansion plans that add more value to the economy, with their hands out demanding a corporate income tax for any business trying to save for an expansion project. Oops, they just retarded growth by the same amount they taxed, 30% in the best case (more in reality to account for opportunity costs).

Corporate debt for the riskier commercial banking clients that most small businesses are lumped in costs about 10-12% APR, typically taken as a line of credit. A lot of business people fall for the trap of debt without accurately projecting the necessary cash flow stability to service that constant debt repayment demand. That 10-12% is much cheaper than paying the corporate income tax, *if and only if* cash flow is assured through the period of the debt. Cash flow is anything but stable for multi-year spans. Ever complain about corporate planning being so short-term? Here's one reason, as one way to mitigate the risk associated with any debt-financed operations is to shorten the time-span.

So if you take on debt for that $1M expansion project you risk losing out if the cash flow is interrupted for even a fiscal quarter. If you try to save up that $1M you get taxed on the profit you set aside each year for that project. To make matters more complicated, you have competitors who are not so observant about cash flow stability risks and are gleefully taking on debt to gain a temporary edge over you. You know what they are doing is not sustainable over a multi-year span, but that's not helping you right now as they threaten to beat you up in sales.

So the logical progression of this train of thought is to use strategies to retain earnings to close the gap between the risks of debt, competitors using debt themselves for short-term unsustainable gain to your detriment, and corporate income taxes. The very strategies Polly decries. Through these strategies, a company can retain earnings at around the same cost of that debt (lots of legal and accounting fees make these far from friction-free corporate financial structures), but without the attendant risk exposure of unanticipated interrupted cash flows. Such companies can then implement defensive measures in their markets to hold off competitors and let their competitors bleed themselves dry with debt servicing demands, and then embark upon a sustainable expansion when they have the solid accumulated capital resources to do so. To be sure, there are bad actors using these strategies (taking on debt *and* avoiding taxes, effecting an asset stripping operation), but I'm not trying to say everyone using these strategies are responsible corporate citizens; I'm just trying to point out that this is simply a tool, which can be put to legitimate uses by responsible actors.

Because all system controls are locked and remote, I can't change the options.  I cannot understand how this decision makes sense for the company.  Is there some security issue with tabbed browsing I don't understand?  Wouldn't there be a performance cost for the users opening a new instance of IE every time an employee needed to view multiple web pages?  They've made it marginally harder to have multiple web pages open at work, but they haven't prevented it completely.  I really can't understand why this makes sense from an IT perspective.

I have met one of the guys a few times. He did not strike me as a crazed terrorist or anything. His mother had passed away a few years before this incident and as a result he had turned to religion for comfort. He was not an extremist, nor was his family from such a background. His sister did not cover her hair or anything. I met him at a party at a friend's place. He and the other guys had gone to play soccer in a nearby field, when a couple of drunks showed up. To avoid any altercations, he rounded up all the younger kids and brought everyone home. He struck me as a responsible kid.

This 'terrorist camp' was just a weekend camping,  playing paintball. This case actually affects me and others around me.  For instance, now my parents have forbidden that I go play paintball or laser tag unless it is an event organized by a well known non-muslim organization. They have also forbidden to take part in any protests. Parents began fearing for their kids safety after those arrests. I have heard of muslim parents telling their kids to make only non-muslim friends. All these fears are not based on the possibility of there being actual terrorists.

The automat is used in the Concerto for Horn and Hardart, a play on the name of proprietors Horn &amp; Hardart, who pioneered the North American use of the Automat. 


&gt;Schickele also invented the ""dill piccolo"" for playing sour notes, the ""left-handed sewer flute"", the ""tromboon"", the ""lasso d'amore"", the double-reed slide music stand, the ""tuba mirum"", a flexible tube filled with wine, and the ""pastaphone"", an uncooked tube of manicotti pasta played as a horn.

&gt;Post the link to your website rather than the original source

But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings, reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. … Its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area, which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 million sq km to just 4 million from the start of 2007 to October, also shows it now almost back to 13 million sq km.”(26) To reinforce this point, he helpfully republished the graph, showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January. The Sunday Telegraph continues to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter.
But for the Wikipedia Professor of Gibberish, this patron saint of charlatans, even the seasons are negotiable. Booker remains right, whatever the evidence says.

"politics","t5_2cneq","While you're correct that it probably won't provide a great immediate short term response, if it was a huge part of how we got into this mess, we have an obligation to rid of it and go back to sound money backed by gold or some other commodity, before we start making the same mistakes all over again.

Also, the Federal Reserve funds the government's spending; our government is running a huge deficit, and it would be much, much harder for it to do so if there were no Federal Reserve and our dollar was backed by 100% gold.

&gt; Remorpho proposed the outline of a solution to the problem, a solution that has been shown to work in Sweden.

I think the nationalization idea is bad for two reasons:

1) Government either miserably fails or is mediocre in anything that it does. Why should we trust it to have absolute ownership over all of our banks? That's extremely dangerous and goes against what our country was based upon: true free market principles. Honestly, our economy has been far from ""free"" for a long, long time. I say we try going back to those principles that made our country great in such a short amount of time.

2) It's been ""working"" (says who?) in Sweden since the mid-90s. That's not a very long time at all. A year ago most people probably would've said that our current system was ""working"" but it clearly has not been working.

We've tried excessive regulation and restriction and inflation and printing. It doesn't work. Centrally-planned economies cannot and have not worked.","1233504179"

Surgery essentially means purposely cutting a person open, removing bits inside, and breaking bones (until recently open heart surgery meant badly breaking open the patient's ribcage; how else can you reach the heart?). People die from treatment all the time.

From the sounds of it they disagree with her being a single woman bringing up kids by herself who isn't married.  I wouldn't be surprised if she was a perfectly sane health and sensible woman who has a healthy level of interest in her kids, I mean, not everyone who wants lots of children is obsessive or compulsive at all.  From the sounds of it she felt a sense of guilt over the frozen embryos left over from IVF, so has the remaining embryos implanted. As doctors say, the reason that she has octoplets was a side effect of all the fertilizatiaon treatment she has received - NOT intentional!  Also, does anyone else feel angry that so many people are accusing this woman of being unethical - whats unethical with wanting a family - its human nature!  So far, this woman has acted in the correct manner, by trying to remain unknown to the press, which was the right thing for her children.  None of us know her financial circumstances, and it is entirely incorrect to assume that she was acting wrecklessley in the face of the current economic crisis - as nine months ago - the length of time it takes for a pregnancy to occur - they were still saying that financially there was going to be no recession and that everything was great and soon to improve.

I am sorry, but to me this entire thing seems to have been inflated by the press purely because they are trying to scare people into not having children - labeling it ""unethical"" in current circumstances.  The only action that the woman has taken is to try to keep her identity from the public...which as far as I am concerned was the correct action to take, as it is in the best interest of her children.  To me, it is the doctors at the hospital, the womans own family both egged on by the press that have acted badly in these circumstances.

Well, that's Joel and Jeff's choice. They are not entitled to any slack whatsoever for choosing to publish their words without preparation beforehand or editing after wards.

I personally have trouble with the point in their podcast when they went from criticizing the ideas to speculating about Mr. Martin's competence and experience based on their extremely narrow interpretation of SOLID.

It's one thing to say, ""I think SOLID is rubbish."" It's quite another to contineu on to say, ""and anyone who invents this stuff has no experience writing code.""

It is remarkably mean, and smacks of an incredibly narrow ""Software should be developed my way or you are doing it wrong"" mentality.

To make my own position perfectly clear, I am not an advocate of incredibly tiny classes. I have shipped software built with other principles and witnessed software shipped with other principles.

However, I do not think this is the only way to ship software, nor do I presume that everyone who thinks SOLID works is an idealist who has no experience shipping software.","1233504671"

that's why to me philosophy is the difference between someone who wants to know and someone who simply doesn't care, a scientist can live his whole life following the social patterns that are acceptable in his medium and he can make amazing discoveries and yet it can be an automaton where nothing came from his own will or curiosity.

Anyway, I appreciate the translation. I do see the distinction between people who sort-of believe in some version of Allah and those who don't. I don't see any indication of those people attacking Muslims in the verse.

I agree that reading the Quran myself would give me a better chance of understanding it. Unfortunately, there are thousands of competing ideas, and I can only study the details of so many. Popularity is not particularly good way of picking those few, so I am left with their proponents and critics to supply the relevant arguments.

If those persuaded me to examine Islam in great detail, I would not know which of the ever growing number of branches to subscribe to, each with their own interpretation of it. For starters - Shia or Sunni? And then, which one of the branches of those? It seems to me there is an ever growing number.

And I know very few 15-year-olds who are so accustomed to being shot that a single bullet in the extremities will fail to slow them down.

Police aren't trained to shoot for limbs. They are trained to 1. aim for the center of the available target and 2. shoot twice. 

&gt;If you are going to put a bullet in someone, perhaps a shot in the air (to let them know your gun does not fire water or foam projectiles) may even be sufficient to snap them out of whatever fit they're in long enough for them to rethink their strategy and consider setting the cutting implements on the ground.

Shoot in air???? And do you know what the bullet will hit? No you don't and neither does the shooter. Incredibly unsafe suggestion

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; It's not possible to have a functioning society otherwise.

It most certainly is. I'm not talking about a lawless society here. Of course there should be laws -- laws that infringe upon one's natural/property rights. Things like murder, robbery, assault: those are common sense laws.

Laws that force one to pay taxes are immoral because man is born free, free from coercion. It doesn't matter what country one is born in. Did I sign a legally binding contract that forces me to pay for the rest of my life? No, and neither did you.

You cannot say ""well then, move"" because, as I said before: all men are born free on this earth. No man has any right to tell another man what he can and cannot do, /unless/ what that man does will directly infringe upon one's natural or property rights. Therefore, the entire concept of government is immoral, because man is telling another man what he cannot do; the only safeguard is a majority that doesn't support candidates that take away freedoms and liberties. That safeguard has failed.

And, interestingly enough, if you look back in history, you'll see that it has been /government/ that has been the major agressor against natural rights. How many drafts have we had? Not only does the 13th Amendment forbid ""involuntary servitude"", man's natural right to be free forbids it. That's just one small example -- the list can go on and on.

&gt; The government is not forcibly taking anyone's income.

They sure are, because if you don't pay taxes, you'll go to jail.

Anyway, do some research: the income tax was not needed before 1913; The income tax only accounts for 45% of the government's income; our government's 2000 budget was 58% smaller than 2007's budget. Factor in that we've got troops in 150 countries and are fighting an unnecessary war and we're 'fighting' a failed War on Drugs and are bailing out companies that should be naturally failing, and all of the other crazy expenditures, and you'll see that the income tax is completely unnecessary.","1233504780"

+1. And I mean that as a compliment to J&amp;J.

Imagine two guys pitching with the exact same idea. Guy #1 is a star coder, he pitches a Q&amp;A site, says he has already built it.

VC asks: ""Marketing plan?"" Guy #1 says ""Advertise, that's why I need your money!"" VC asks: ""What do you know about marketing to programmers? What do you know about advertising?"" Guy #1 says, ""Hire a VP of marketing, that's why I need your money!"" VC asks: ""Revenue model?"" Guy#1 says, ""Hire a VP of Sales who will sell ads on the site, that's why I need your money!"" VC thanks him.

Guy #2 has 100K subscribers to his blog, sells enough advertising he was able to quit his job. It will take him a month to write the site, not a week-end. Guy #2 doesn't need to advertise the site, he has 100,000 users lined up just by mentioning it on his blog. Guy #2 doesn't need a Vp of Sales, he already has advertisers. And Guy #2 doesn't care if he does it in a week-end in Python or a month in Visual Basic.

So when you start doing outer join of person and his car and someone does not own a car. You get a row with NULL in the car field, at that point NULL is overloaded with the meaning of ""not known"" and ""doesn't have one"".

Other case is when you have non-identifying one-to-one relationship, having one table contains a nullable foreign key to another table is not a bad design. But NULL in that case really means ""entity A does not have relation to entity B"", not ""we don't know which B A is related"". And then the meaning of NULL is overloaded. ","1233505388"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ehh. You're wrong and you're right. You're right in the respect that there is no well established scientifically valid way of determining whether or not someone is lying. It depends extensively on how that person behaves under normal circumstances.

But studies have found that there are certain, fairly rare individuals with an unusually good lie detector instinct (they are slightly overrepresented in law enforcement, but as we know correlation != causation).

Assuming you are not one of those gifted individuals, there is still a lot you can learn. People put out a huge amount of body language that most people don't pick up on (at least consciously). 

Remember what I said about lying being prone to individual differences? If you know the person well anyway, you can account for those individual differences (which is why you can often pick up when something is sus with an old friend). If you are trained to look for interested cues and body language,  you have much better odds to notice something. Just like doctors pick up on signs that you do not.

So to sum up, if someone says that they can teach you to read body language, they are full of it. But if someone says that they can teach you interesting cues that will make you more AWARE of body language in general, well that could just well help you.

tldr:
No human lie detectors, but knowing the person AND knowing what to look for improves your odds.   ","1233505553"

*The desk is littered with drug paraphernalia. A bottle of adenochrome lies upended just out of reach of his questing hand.* 

Peter [VO]: The days were dark. No words, just miles of empty breasts, leering at me with salacious pink aureoles. They were talking to me, or maybe it was the drugs. No words, just a dull pressuring reminder that *they* were in charge. I debated leaving, but I knew I'd have to stick it out. There was money involved, and, besides, I'd never been one to refuse tits. Even talking ones with vampire teeth.

*Brian enters the room. He says nothing, as he is a dog. He sits on his haunches and whines plaintively.*

Peter [VO]: The dog came, and the dog went. So it goes. I think, if I had the determination, I would hate it. That black and white mutt - bilaterally divided, night and day - is the one thing that ties me to the past. To the life I had.

*Cut to Peter, vacant eyed, behind the wheel of a red sports coupe.*

Peter [VO]: A real life, with a wife and kids and a dog and a house in the suburbs. Normality. Ha. Normality says that should come after the fugue, and maybe it does. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Maybe I'm remembering what's meant to come. No matter. It's not what it is now, and now is emptiness. No words.

*The car cuts across a desert landscape, past a sign that reads 'Bat country'*

Peter [VO]: I can still feel the gun in my hand. It's here now, it was there then. It will be with me forever - no mescaline hit will consign it to the memory hole. No acid trip will kill the horror of that moment. It's become my life, and my living death.

*A shot, Peter and Lois in a dingy motel room, Lois with an apple balanced on her head, Peter - sweating profusely - clutching a loaded six-shot revolver. The barrel traces a lazy arc.*

Peter [VO]: William Tell. William Tell. But he never did tell me it was going to be like that.
Bam! One shot. A neat little hole in the head, red and inviting like a lipstick mouth. A little crimson kiss on her pale skin. Skewered to the door-frame. I watched her fall, and then it was gone. Where were the children? I wasn't sure that they even existed, and after she left, there was no way to recall. Gone. Future. Past. Present. Gone.

*Cut to a dingy Cantina in Mexico.*

Peter: No words. Nothing but the terror of the long now. Nothing but blankness.

*He calmly reaches for the gun at his hip and blows his brains out.*

*Cut to live action shot of college students, slouched before a wide-screen TV.*

College Student 1: Wha? How do I put all of *that* on T-shirt?

College Student 2: Totally jumped the shark, Brah. Totally.

"wikipedia","t5_2qh3b","Indeed, Scots could said to be the native language of one of the largest immigrant groups to the American colonies - [the Scots-Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American): Scots and other northern Britons who had immigrated to northern Ireland in the 1600s as part of the crown's attempts to use them in pacifying the Cathoic Irish.

There are likely some indirect influences on American English - there has definitely been a disproportionate influence on phonology, especially in the hill country that stretches from the Pennsylvania interior, down the Appalachian mountains, on into the southern highlands of western North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

Early English settlers to the coastal colonies dropped their *r*'s, as evidenced by traditional Boston and Charleston accents, in conjunction with the largely southern English origins of these groups.

However, the Scots-Irish have always kept *r*'s and this has shaped multiple dialects of American English - inland Southern Amerian English and Appalachian English perhaps most strongly - cities like Raleigh, NC, Columbia, SC, and Atlanta would perhaps sound much more like Charleston were it not for the massive influx of this formative group throughout the 1700's - though you do get *r*-droppers in these cities too, a relic of immigration from the coast to the piedmont as well, not just from the mountains.

Many anthropologists have also tried to ascribe many ""redneck"" traits to their influence - distrust of authority, propensity with firearms, etc., etc., though these seem to be more general characteristics of any frontier people.

Ok, sorry reddit :)  This is my area of expertise, and I just got a little excited when it became clear that redditors might even care what Scots is - a language that's influenced accents ranging from those of *Trainspotting* to those of *Deliverance* - this is what I love about history, you go back in time some, extrapolate some historial effects out over time and space, and have your breath taken away by the range of effects, most totally unexpected.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","They *should* become a meritocracy.

A lot of the reason there is so much bull shit in the Middle East over this Israel thing is the concept of it being a specifically *Jewish* state. The situation is similar to what happened in colonial Africa — the natives (blacks/Palestinians) were minding their own business on their own land, when all of a sudden these other people (whites/Jews) came along and declared it all theirs and set up laws that preferred them.

Ethnic relations in Israel may not be quite so bad as, say, Apartheid South Africa, but it is similar in many ways. Obviously the idea of a state specifically designed for and by Jews does not exactly show much deference for Muslims, and the two groups are treated differently by nearly every single Israeli institution. Just like blacks in 1950s America, Palestinians have learnt that separate is inherently inequal.

That isn't to say that the Muslim countries are any better. Obviously they should become meritocracies as well. But given the huge amount of moral and economic support that Israel receives from other nations i think it isn't unreasonable to expect more from them.","1233505999"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't think those things you mentioned are really the important parts of what communism is. The words communism, socialism, and marxism are terribly abused. Here's the briefest accurate distinction I can make:

Communism is an economic system where the *means of production* (farms, factories, etc) are operated/owned by the Government.

Socialism/Marxism is an economic system where the means of production are owned by the People.

Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production are owned by Individuals.

Now China under Mao was very very communist - he collectivized farms &amp; other stuff ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_commune ) and you could absolutely not sell anything extra you produced - even an extra chicken or something (you would be branded a 'rightist'). And as an aside, one of the few things Mao succeeded at was a kind of socialialized medicine:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_doctors

Since then, starting with Deng Xiaoping, China has been lessening the restrictions on free trade, and private businesses now account for most of their production, but the government still controls a substantial part of the economy, especially in industries such as energy production (i could be remembering this incorrectly though, so you might want to check up on that if you are interested).","1233506033"

I'm sure they don't even think twice about it, but we would. If you're going to argue that natural animal behavior is morally acceptable, then can we do that? 

But let's assume your ridiculous argument is right. That we can kill animals because they kill other animals. It's only fair. Let's pretend that your argument is right. Then why do you eat cows? They don't kill other animals. Using your definition of fairness, you should only kill lions, tigers, and other predators. Eating herbivores is like saying well some people murder, so we are allowed to arrest any person. 

 We have rational thought, and philosophy is all about using rational arguments. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy); ""Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as mysticism or mythology) by its **critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument**.""

""I don't care"" is not an argument. It's a punk ass way of saying, I want to keep doing what I'm doing but I have no valid reasons, other than arguments that completely fail to look at the entire situation.","1233506261"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I definitely agree. Linux is not about hating Microsoft, but due to the adverse effects the company's dominance has had on the personal computer world, it is hard not to hate them.

You can not entirely blame them as they have been running certain business strategy, but with side effects which would be completely intolerable within any other products that people understand. With this I would like to say that people don't understand software.

Cars and money, are something most people understand.

Imagine that certain roads were only open for certain brands of cars. Say to visit your bank and withdraw money you could only do that if you where driving a car branded Ford, and in most cases possibly if you were driving a car from G.M.

For those of you driving Chrysler, Ferrari, Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Toyota etc. the roads to the banks were closed and the only way for you to go to the bank were by owning an extra car branded Ford or go by a Ford cab or Ford bus.

This certainly sounds completely absurd for most people, but this is the situation within the computer industry regarding both hardware and software today. The reason people accept this is just because the adaptation has been slow, and most people don't simply understand that there is a problem.

Regarding cars we have developed standards, that allow any car manufacturer to fulfil the criteria required to drive along the roads.

Regarding computers such standards exist, but due to sloppiness, laziness, lack of understanding and possibly just due to evil conspiration (MS money talks...) we have reached a computational world which is a shame for anyone being aware about computer science. Imagine to be the IT-manager for the world, and you have caused this mess.

Let me take two simple examples.

1) In Sweden we have mainly had two types of E-legitimation, one braindead solution from a company named Nexus, spread through the company with the same name ""E-legitimation"". We also had, until July 2008, another nice solution from a company named BankID.

The braindead solution from Nexus could only run and create necessary certificates in basically only one environment (Windows...). The other, nice solution from BankID was completely platform independent, only using java as browser plugin and could work with any hardware and any operative system.

Now this last summer, a Swedish bank, SE-banken, which was the owner of the braindead solution, purchased the company BankID. The result from this business event is that BankID since then has been forced to throw away the nice java-solution and instead use the braindead platform dependent Nexus solution. This meant for instance that all Linux users that used BankID could no longer renew their certificates. I had a long chat with several people at my bank (Swedbank) and with several people at BankID. They promised to deliver a solution that works also on Linux, and after a very long time (after about 2 hours talk in telephone) they told me that I can renew the certificates on a Mac system... They have still not produced a completely working solution for Linux but they are getting closer.
The problem is of course, that with this braindead solution you have only allowed another car on the roads, but the solution is still braindead. With the car analogy it would be like we can now use Ford, G.M and say BMW but Chrysler (Solaris), Toyota(FreeBSD) and so on are locked out for bank businesses where you need these certificates. Here in Sweden you need them for instance to check your tax account.

2) Another example. Last spring I purchased a TomTom navigator, the most advanced edition. However, it seemed as it had some theeting problems, but it also had one very serious flaw, which I of course could not accept. To be able to update the software and maps on the device I would need to be running Windows. Where are IT people educated nowadays, in Redmond?

The device had both bluetooth as well as SD card so update through a specific cable through the USB using some specific Windows software indicates that the designer had had a serious LSD trip with severe hallucinations if something as weird as a completely unnecessary tie to a specific manufacturers operative system (and at the same time hardware as Windows is not running on many hardware).

So for my own I'm completely fine with people liking windows and even Microsoft, but I'm completely ashamed of all IT people that are involved in developments like the Swedish BankID catastrophy as well as the TomTom (and certainly many other navigators and gadgets) software and map update.

This is the reason I hate Microsoft, I think the problem with Microsoft decreases if they go below 60 % of the personal computer market, but that may still take a few years. I'm really longing for this. 

PS. I personally have to work with Vista part time where I'm part time teaching now, and I can assure you, I hate Vista. I do understand why people like XP better. I also have been teaching office techniques using MS Office 2007. For my own I consider the previous office packages to be good, even though I mostly work with OpenOffice, which is far away from perfect but certainly much easier and more consistent to use than Office 2007.","1233506646"

I found the idea that no one, even a child, is innocent, to be utterly repugnant. 

I don't _think_ that the Buddhist conception of karma, if it's well understood, entails such ""accounting"" across lives. I think it's about our behavior and consequences in this life, and the issue of reincarnation is a separate thing. But I'm still learning, maybe I'm totally wrong?

Anyways I think its very ironic that the people who posted here feel that they know the truth about our origin and our history and that everyone else is ignorant. In truth we are all ignorant, all any of us have is the belief that we know. The only thing one may know in this world is that those who claim to know, are the worst fools of all because the only truth contained in all of humanity is the knowledge that we simply know nothing at all.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I use a variant of this program called Reddit. It works like this - you spend all day at the Reddit home page, and every few seconds, it presents new links for you to click. The links can be on anything from computer programming to the war in Iraq. So when ISPs or government agencies try to search your browsing history, all they find is a flood of thousands of disconnected articles like ""Ron Paul -&gt; LOLCat-&gt; Atheism -&gt; Tasers"". It's impossible for them to discover your true interests are or to find any pattern to your surfing. Reddit's much smarter than TrackMeNot, since it automatically ensures that the decoy links will be spaced at normal human time intervals, will be about the sort of things you would normally be interested in, and will come from an infinite number of possibilities rather than from a pre-written dictionary.

The only flaws are that it takes a lot of bandwidth, a lot of your own time, and the link-generation algorithm sometimes gets stuck - for example, there was a whole month when it only brought up links about the war in Gaza. I'd recommend it, but only after these problems are fixed.","1233506985"

FBI 2006 - The FBI is confident that it has positively identified the nineteen hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Also, the 9/11 investigation was thoroughly reviewed by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States and the House and Senate Joint Inquiry. Neither of these reviews ever raised the issue of doubt about the identity of the nineteen hijackers.

FBI 2001 - FBI Director Robert Mueller acknowledged on Thursday that the identity of several of the suicide hijackers is in doubt.

Refunds are refunds of tax surpluses.

IF they attempt to borrow money to payout 'refunds' they make themselves liable to various criminal charges under gov civics and ethics laws.

"politics","t5_2cneq","When conservatism was taken to such an extreme by Bush and his gang, and the economy tanked so badly as a result (or so we were told, at least) that the government needed to give/lend over 7.3 trillion dollars, I'd say that's incompatible with ""free markets"".

The lie that says that such pure conservatism *is* compatible is such a big lie that people can't seem to even see it for what it is.

That's some real money:  $7,300,000,000,000  (or over $23,700 for every one of the approximately 305,727,000 people in the U.S.!)  And, just handed over with little or no oversight.

So, the end result of such extremism in letting the banks and other huge corporations do whatever the wanted, was to let them destroy and loot the greatest brokerage houses from within, and even let them raid the treasury to ""protect"" us all from even greater economic harm.

Wow.  No.  Actually, ""Wow"" times seven, times one million, times one million.

I can't see someone trying this very dangerous move without there being someone in sudan to receive these bibles. This is the type of thing that goes on a good bit when there's religious oppression. There were some serious operations to get bibles and the torah into communist russia for instance.

My second thought that this is very often the type of tactics the government takes when they want to throw someone out of the country. Who know's how many bibles there really were. We're getting this info from the Sudanese government, don't forget that.

So in any case, there's different ways to read this.","1233507397"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","So as to not misrepresent what Ajahn Brahm said, I have transcribed most of the relevant part of his speech here (this bit starts at 43:24):

&gt; I love teaching people how to find out who they were before, to see if reincarnation is true or not, and again, meditation is the key. Even just recently when I was teaching in Kalduk (?), one of the girls here went on that retreat with me, over in Thailand. 

&gt; The teaching at the very end, anybody who has a very deep meditation, just ask yourself at the very end, ""What is my earliest memory?"" and see what happens. That is the way you can access it, incredible memories from your past for yourself, not be told that reincarnation is true or told that it's not true. But find out for yourself, because that obviously is so important. 

&gt; I didn't know who to trust. How can you trust anybody because some priest says this, the imam says something else, monks say this, nuns say this, who the heck can you trust? You can trust yourself. Your own wisdom, what you realize yourself. And you can actually find out and access this things.

&gt; What a wonderful thing it is to know, at last, for sure, that you have have lived before. That you know what's going to happen when you die. Wow! At least that gives you a sense of certainty. And the nicest thing about that, it makes all this death and dying business much much easier. 

&gt; Sometimes we say that as long as there is death there will be religions. We try and explain what happens afterwards, and also help people through that time, and I don't think psychologists will ever be able to do that. But, religious people always have a reason once there is a death. But we will argue about what happens after death. It's important actually to find out, what actually is truth or not, and realize it for yourself.

&gt; But certainly the idea of reincarnation is a beautiful idea. It means you have another chance! If you stuff up in this life, don't worry, you can have another go next life. If you married the wrong guy, you can have another try next time. Do better. Learn to do better. Or if you don't want to be married next time, great, you can be a monk or a nun next time. Swap it around, try different things. 

Then he goes on to describe how reincarnation helps one cope with death. And that I find really kind of actively bad. The death of a child is a time to consider the first noble truth, not the idea of reincarnation, imho. ","1233507415"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","To say they have an active interest is to imply that they have any sort of brain at all. This does not line up with our modern understanding of biology. Yes, you could argue, ""but how do you know?"" And I  say, using the best availiable science, the most logical conclusion is that plants are organic machines with no brain. They evolved because they were fit for their environments, and they have no active direction much like bacteria evolve and live without any direction. Plants can be seen as the macro equivalent of bacteria. If we have to consider the morality of plants, we would also have to consider the morality of my table, and the dirt. Essentially, these things don't have an interest. I argue that plants don't have an interest, and therefore they don't matter. If there were a plant though that did have interest, I would be fully against eating it.

So, essentially, I think it is incorrect to say that they have an interest to propagate. They propagate simply because they do, much like bacteria go through mitosis without ever having an interest in doing so. But we see it often, because the cells that did randomly go through mitosis were able to continue their genes that went though mitosis. Or in other words, this is evolution. Plants simply continued the nonthinking reproduction, and animals evolved into sentient things because it was an evolutionary advantage.","1233507434"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Last time I checked, under South African Apartheid, the black people did not have the RIGHT to vote (The Indians and mixed race did); the Israeli Arabs HAVE that since Israel's inception.

Just as one doesn't have to see goose-stepping soldiers down the high street before a nation is considered fascist a right to vote is not the be-all and end-all decider to whether an association with apartheid is correct.  I'm sure you are aware that when citizenship is taken is Israel a Palestinian's nationality is noted as Arab and an Jewish Israeli is noted as Jew - that right there marks the beginning of what unravels into apartheid.

Israel's nationality laws prevents a Palestinian citizen of Israel married to someone from the OT from living together in Israel.  Apartheid South Africa's supreme court overturned that.  [Israel's high court upheld it in 2006 and again in 2008](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996697.html) - in case you missed it that was an Israeli newspaper using the 'A' word.  [Marriage laws](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-imposes-racist-marriage-law-588637.html), sure a Palestinian and an Israeli can marry but a 12y.o. child from such a marriage must emigrate.   Then there are the agricultural laws that denote certain land as Jewish and so can't be sold to non-Jews, and what is the nationality of a Palestinian come Israeli citizen known as again: Arab.  Then there are the ""Arab free"" industries, for those in the military and security.  

[Then there are the building permits and incentives...again nationality is seen to be a prerequisite, or rather a 'Jewish' nationality identity.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel)

[And unfortunately if one moves from focusing on the inequality in Israel to the West Bank it gets even worse...](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/this-is-like-apartheid-anc-veterans-visit-west-bank-865063.html)

It goes on.  Some measures get overturned, like the recent banning of Arab parties in next month's election, some don't.  It is important however to mention that that doesn't mean all Israelis should be tarred with the same brush.  [They shouldn't.  Just as in all walks in life there are differences and I believe in empowering Israeli moderates who know something is amiss.](http://www.acri.org.il/eng/Story.aspx?id=351)

&gt;You are very apt to dismiss what Hamas says. Go back and watch the video AGAIN.

No, I very appropriately provided you with an article that establishes what Hamas means between 'accept' and 'acknowledge'.  That and the [MEMRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFd4dlHPnc) source (dude I wouldn't go and post a stormfront article to argue how Israel was bad...hopefully we both acknowledge they can't be trusted.  [Memri translations, editing, cherry picking and context cannot be trusted](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/28/israel2)) Hamas leadership has even reiterated their willingness to accept Israel since the recent escalation to French and UK delegates on behalf of the EU.

&gt;I answered my view on 1967 border in separate thread.

Y'up well that's the direction you need to be headed because in all honesty Israel's PR skirt is slipping in light of recent events.  America itself is in trouble and radicalising serves no purpose.  Israel will be best served to locate itself peacefully into a post-American Israeli era.  It would be far easier than to not and to look for them in times of trouble and to find them not there.

What we're starting to learn is that it's an insufficient model.  There are several other factors to take into consideration.  For one, evolution happens to populations of species not to individuals within a group.  Darwin himself, mentioned this.  This brings a whole new systemic dynamic to the model.  A higher level of complexity( social ) in interplay with a lower level( DNA ).  Second, DNA is very complex system in itself.  It has self-organizing properties that we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of.  Third, the probabilistic understanding of evolution can't explain stages of evolutionary explosion.  Where speciation increases exponentially.  With all the data we have now evolution looks alot more like a stage sequence and alot less like complete randomness.

Neither side politically likes these developments.  To those that embrace evolution on a political level, don't like the ""Watchmaker"" argument that an orderly evolution could play to.  On the other end, fundamentalists also hate it because, it contradicts their literal interpretation of scripture.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","&gt;CEO's jobs are to make money for shareholders,

What pisses me off is that he's apparently not doing that very well. 

I think executive compensation should be limited (not necessarily by law - Boards should be doing this at every company):

- Any stock option or grant cannot be cashed out for five years. 
- If the stock declines from the beginning of the FY to the end, executive compensation is capped at $500k 
- Executive compensation is also capped if employee turnover goes above a certain amount, because training costs money, losing intellectual capital costs money, and it's indicative of significant problems internally
- No golden parachute if the stock price is below where it was when the exec started or below where it was at the start of the FY. 

Things like that. While I'm happy to reward executives that lead the company to success, I have no interest in making people rich just because they're willing to take the job. 

Let's say if the company performs well, the CEO stands to make tens of millions of dollars; but if it doesn't then he's getting $500k. Personally, I would see that job as a challenge and really enjoy it. If someone looks at that job and turns their nose up because they're not paid enough or whatever, fuck them. 

Corporate leadership keeps acting like there are a small handful of people that can do the job, and they have to pay big bucks to keep them. I do believe there are a small handful of people who can do it, but I dismiss the idea that they're all in the ranks of existing CEO's. I would take someone like a just starting out Michael Dell, or Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs over most of the drek that are running companies today. 

I believe there are hundreds of entrepreneurs with vision would could lead some of these large companies better than they're being run. 

Sadly, it's an incestuous community - if you're not in, you're not going to break in. 

And *that* is the part that I believe the federal government could play a part in, in some way.

If these people are as smart and as hard working as they claim to be, then let's put them to work finding a cure for cancer or developing new alternative energy sources. But as long as Wall St. compensates at a much higher rate than the sciences then this will never happen.

So, if we want to remove the suffering animals we must continue to eat some animal products in order sway the greatest amount of people to quit eating meat.

I wouldn't discount American football simply by virtue of its being American like some of the people here, but i *do* discount it by virtue of its being a team spectator sport. I simply do not understand how people get invested in stuff like this. How do you decide which team you like? They're constantly changing players, changing ownership, changing locations, changing stadiums. Most of the players (and sometimes the owners) aren't actually from the city the team is attached to. And even if geography *were* a good factor to go by, that doesn't apply to everybody. Obviously there are not as many teams as there are states/provinces/cities/whatever, so how do you decide which one you like when your home doesn't have a team? It's just so *arbitrary*.

I guess i could understand following single-player sports like tennis, where you can pick one person who you think is a good player and has a good personality or whatever (although i personally don't do that either), but team sports just baffle me.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Without new water entering the Aral, it began to shrink, becoming more and more salty every year, eventually fish stocks died, fish were washing ashore in mass numbers, unable to live in the salty conditions. The sea was also becoming a center for concentrated pollution. This Pollution came from several sources, one being weapons testing, but additionally there was fertilizer run off and pesticides.

&gt;Any time pollution increases in an area, so too do human health problems. This is particularly the case when the concern is water pollution. It is difficult to determine just how many health problems are due to the pollution in the water, of course such statistics are hard to prove, but it has been seen that mortality rates and rates of health problems have increased in the area since the late 1960's.

&gt;Not just fish and people suffered. Many of the flora and fauna died out. The Bukhara deer which once flourished in the area now number below 500. Certainly some species of wildlife were lost in the area if not altogether.

You don't think this has had serious consequences for local tourism, fishing, and human health? You don't think people living downstream should have as much right to water resources as those living upstream?

Environmentalism isn't about looking ""pretty"". It's about maintaining the habitability of the places we live. We only see them as ""pretty"" because people have a tendency to take aesthetic pleasure in the things they love and depend upon.

This means it's is well adapted for running about on the hillsides at high altitude, without going up or down. However, a haggis can be captured by making it run around the hill backwards/ anticlockwise"". (see wild haggis). Suprisingly this humourous myth is believed by many tourists and they are extremely disappointed to hear the truth.*

The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the noise floor, non-linearities, temperature coefficient, and parasitic effects within semiconductor devices, and the finite charge of an electron. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always figures of merit.

None of the Hominidae family are carnivorous (or omnivorous) in the slightest, except you contend humans (for the sake of simplicitity I will refer to as the Hominidae family excluding humans). The Hominidae family are able to tolerate small quantities of meat, but they lack a lot of the necessities to eat meat regularly. Taxonomy is a very interesting subject I suggest that reading into it if you have an interest in evolution, regardless if you agree with my claims. Anyway, here's a very simplified version of the argument [(source)](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/09/are-humans-carnivores-or-herbivores-2/):

""# Intestinal tract length. Carnivorous animals have intestinal tracts that are 3-6x their body length, while herbivores have intestinal tracts 10-12x their body length. Human beings have the same intestinal tract ratio as herbivores.
# Stomach acidity. Carnivores’ stomachs are 20x more acidic than the stomachs of herbivores. Human stomach acidity matches that of herbivores.
# Saliva. The saliva of carnivores is acidic. The saliva of herbivores is alkaline, which helps pre-digest plant foods. Human saliva is alkaline.
# Shape of intestines. Carnivore bowels are smooth, shaped like a pipe, so meat passes through quickly — they don’t have bumps or pockets. Herbivore bowels are bumpy and pouch-like with lots of pockets, like a windy mountain road, so plant foods pass through slowly for optimal nutrient absorption. Human bowels have the same characteristics as those of herbivores.
# Fiber. Carnivores don’t require fiber to help move food through their short and smooth digestive tracts. Herbivores require dietary fiber to move food through their long and bumpy digestive tracts, to prevent the bowels from becoming clogged with rotting food. Humans have the same requirement as herbivores.
# Cholesterol. Cholesterol is not a problem for a carnivore’s digestive system. A carnivore such as a cat can handle a high-cholesterol diet without negative health consequences. A human cannot. Humans have zero dietary need for cholesterol because our bodies manufacture all we need. Cholesterol is only found in animal foods, never in plant foods. A plant-based diet is by definition cholesterol-free.
# Claws and teeth. Carnivores have claws, sharp front teeth capable of subduing prey, and no flat molars for chewing. Herbivores have no claws or sharp front teeth capable of subduing prey, but they have flat molars for chewing. Humans have the same characteristics as herbivores""","1233508401"

These tools all provide incremental evidence to be considered in totality. Our problem is that we always look for absolutes - when law enforcement treats lie detector results as The Truth; or DNA evidence is assumed to be absolute - that's when we run into problems.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; I'm sure gays in Iran don't want to be executed, nor do dissenters in China accept persecution, so no, for their sake, I don't find anything respectable about it.

Suppose that, in spite of what gays themselves felt, execution of gays was supported by a majority of citizens in Iran (i'm not sure if it is, just pretend with me). Would that make it respectable?

I would say that you can apply a similar test to monarchy. Obviously the majority of people in the UK and Japan and several other countries support monarchy, but there are a minority (just like gays in Iran) who think it's wrong and do not accept their tax money being spent on supporting the royal family. Is agreeing with that minority any less legitimate than agreeing with the majority?

&gt; Therefore, I find it odd that you would be offended on their behalf.

I'm not offended on their behalf (and i'm not Japanese). The Japanese have the sovereign right to govern their country any way they wish, and if their society demands an emperor then obviously i won't stand in their way.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I have those tubes. They are a lot of fun. 

When I want to be really ridiculous, I use my 300mm lens, stacked on all three Kenko tubes, with my 50mm lens backwards on front of the 300mm. It's like having a digital microscope.

My 300mm lens isn't the best, so I lose some quality, but it's fun.

If you don't know what putting a 50mm lens backwards on the front of another lens does, it acts like a closeup lens. The ratio of the focal length of the backwards lens to the focal length of the main lens is the level of magnification. So a backwards 50mm on the front of a 300mm lens = 6x magnification. (300 / 50)

Just google this for some info. [50mm backwards macro](http://www.google.com/search?q=50mm+backwards+macro&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS277US277)

I have some ring adapters to allow me to screw the two lenses together using the filter threads. I have a 52-58mm step-up ring, and a 58-58mm male-male adapter. Or something like that! It's two separate rings I bought on eBay. You'd just need whatever sizes for your own lenses.

Hehe, I took [a pic of the setup](http://i243.photobucket.com/albums/ff293/0v5x51pt/20090201124452.jpg). I love gear ;)

I told you it was ridiculous!

And here's [a picture of George Washington's eye](http://i243.photobucket.com/albums/ff293/0v5x51pt/CRW_9397.jpg) taken with the setup. Due to the paper-thin depth of field, it's very hard to get proper focus.

The current G.O.P. acts as if it — and we — have all the time in the world. It kept hoping in vain that the fast-waning Blago sideshow would somehow impale Obama or Rahm Emanuel. It has come perilously close to wishing aloud that a terrorist attack will materialize to discredit Obama’s reversals of Bush policy on torture, military tribunals and Gitmo. The party’s sole consistent ambition is to play petty politics to gum up the works. 

If anything, the Republican Congressional leadership seems to be emulating John McCain’s September stunt of “suspending” his campaign to “fix” the Wall Street meltdown. For all his bluster, McCain in the end had no fixes to offer and sat like a pet rock at the White House meeting on the crisis before capitulating to the bailout. His imitators likewise posture in public about their determination to take action, then do nothing while more and more Americans cry for help.

http://www.reuk.co.uk/Jatropha-for-Biodiesel-Figures.htm

Then maybe not.


1 hectare =&gt; 2.2 - 2.7 ton of oil, or about 500 gallons.    

We'll just assume for a moment that all crude oil could be replaced 1 for 1 with bio oil ( not currently true).  

World oil production is around 80 million 40 gallon barrles / day, or around 3.2 Billion gallons / day, or around 1.2 Trillion gallons / year. 

http://www.eia.doe.gov/basics/quickoil.html

States that about 70% of that is for transportation.

This works out to about 16 million km^2.  

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html

Says that the world has about 

148 million km km of land, and about 10% is arable. 

So definitely not ""use it all, and not even come close""  Infact we would just barely use it all with current production methods.... accept one of the really neat things about Jatropha is that it does not need arable a land to grow.  That other 90% of the land useless to normal agriculture... yah, that is where it can go.


And we haven't even started on ocean or algae based processes.  Algae may give 2x as much oil as Jatropha, and there is a lot of 'unused' ocean out there...


That combined with some reasonable choices in efficient vehicles... well we might just be able to live in this world.

This can all be visualized as one of those cartoons where the Bugs Bunny (the government and Krugman) fools Elmer Fudd (the citizens) into running off a cliff.  Now that Elmer has realized he's off a cliff he wants to get back onto the ground (quite a rational desire).  However, Bugs (for reasons of his own) continues to trick Elmer into running back off the cliff by swinging the hollow log around.

People will not hoard money forever, that's *prima facie* obvious.  If allowed, they will pay down their debt to a level they feel is comfortable and then they will resume their normal behavior.  The best way to have them pay down their debt is to not take their money from them for pointless government projects.

People aren't stupid, when they hear that the government is borrowing trillions of dollars to 'save' the economy that scares the crap out of them which makes them 'hoard' more than they would have since everyone is yelling about what a disaster we are in.

If, instead, the government did what people believe is rational: cut spending and reduce taxes then people would believe that common sense steps are being taken to improve things and so they would return to their normal behavior sooner.

The people are not stupid.  They know that you cannot spend your way to prosperity.  They know that every penny the government spends today is a penny plus interest out of their pockets tomorrow and that they had better 'hoard' to cover that eventuality.

The fact that Krugman, the other Keynesians, and  neo-Keynesians are so out of touch with the thought processes of ordinary people is a damning indictment of their fundamental inability to solve these problems: they don't even understand the components they are working with.","1233509216"

&gt;Those of us who have been around for years...

Off I went at your behest to reread the reddiquette page where I was reminded of the following things not to be done.

&gt;# Write titles in ALL CAPS.
&gt;# Editorialize in the headlines.

&gt;DISCUSSION POINTS:

&gt;[tofocsend](http://www.reddit.com/user/tofocsend) : **what's wrong with editorializing in the headline? Certainly the voting patterns don't support the idea that redditors dislike editorializing.**

I still maintain that there is good editoralising and bad editoralising and that these issues should be judged on a case by case basis. I think that is what [tofocsend](http://www.reddit.com/user/tofocsend) is referring to.

I suspect that recent down voting patterns are unrelated to the kind of thoughtfulness it takes to arrive at a fair judgment about good or bad submission title editorialising. They appear to be separate issues. Thus they remain inexplicable.

The only time that abandoned content could possibly be deleted is after it falls off the reflog, which by default takes 30 days.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","While you seem to be vaguely aware of a few facts, you misuse expressions and seem generally confused about the matter as a whole, yet you write with the air of confidence of Ray Comfort holding up a banana.

Since there are plenty of resources on the matter available online and in your local library, instead of spelling everything out for you in pages of comments, I'm tempted to just say STFU NOOB, LURK MOAR

**Edit**: Since you got upmodded so much and asked me to explain my comment (in a PM), here's a short explanation:

&gt;The question is does ""random gradual change"" fully explain the mechanisms. What we're starting to learn is that it's an insufficient model.

""Random gradual change"" is genetic drift. Of course drift alone doesn't ""fully explain"" the mechanisms of evolution. The whole point of Darwin's theory is *natural selection*, which you don't even mention!

&gt;For one, evolution happens to populations of species not to individuals within a group. Darwin himself, mentioned this. This brings a whole new systemic dynamic to the model.

To the previous model of evolution happening just to individuals as opposed to populations? What do you mean, Lamarckism? A common creationist misconception.

&gt;This brings a whole new systemic dynamic to the model. A higher level of complexity( social ) in interplay with a lower level( DNA )

Social interactions affect the fitness of individuals just like physiology does. Nothing groundbreakingly new here, it's still *evolution by natural selection*, as genes can affect the way an organism interacts socially.

Of course you could have mentioned culture and memetics and language and language-like abilities in nonhuman animals and Fisherian runaway selection, but you didn't. See? You talk vaguely and sweepingly, muddying the waters, perhaps because you're confused (in which case you shouldn't pretend to understand anything about evolutionary biology) or because you're a creationist (in which case you actually don't understand anything about evolutionary biology).

&gt;Third, the probabilistic understanding of evolution can't explain stages of evolutionary explosion. Where speciation increases exponentially.

Really? *No* probabilistic understanding of evolution can explain sudden rapid speciation events? A bold, creationesque claim, with no reference to support it.

&gt;With all the data we have now evolution looks alot more like a stage sequence and alot less like complete randomness.

Of course it's not complete randomness, it never even looked like complete randomness, it's evolution by natural selection and genetic drift, of which natural selection is highly *nonrandom*, you creationist fool.","1233509808"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Sorry dude, they have only recently reiterated their willingness to accept Israel within its 1967 borders and working towards peace, trade and coexistence.  They can only keep saying it; they did after all keep the ceasefire - they didn't break it.

But if in theory you are willing to accept 1967 borders the only stumbling block you have is the 4th Geneva convention of 1950.  It states that if East Jerusalem were to be officially recognised as belonging to Israel, which the UN does not, that it would be a war crime.  If you want Jerusalem whole it has to be either an independent city like Singapore in its entirety.  That or you accept a West-East division.  You can't expect people to condone what clearly is a war crime from the perspective of both sides; theirs and the legal side.  It will only turn into cancer.

You don't get to decide who supervises another. That's why Israel's reputation has fallen so far as of late - if Palestinians want help then fair enough, but you can't acknowledge their sovereignty on the understanding somebody else gets to be their boss.  It's fallacy.

But if Fatah and Hamas and the Arab league all have said 1967 borders then the recent escalation, blockade and war following the breaking of a ceasefire is completely unjustified if in yourself you can settle for 1967 borders.

They consider that Israel did not have a right to establish itself where it did in 1947.  You contend that it did and it still does.  They are willing to compromise by agreeing to accept the state of play as of 1967 and to establish peace.  That *from their perspective* is a *huge* compromise.  Tel Aviv huge.  West Jerusalem huge. All the rest huge.  

You've just got to ask yourself if you are happy pushing for East Jerusalem if it means more war on both sides for what is a war crime and will forever tarnish the history books, or are you willing to make an East Jerusalem sized compromise.

Either way.  You have no right to blame another anymore.  No war crime, no Iranian threat, peace and an external Palestinian state.  Or what the Israeli hawks can keep pushing. 

I have a feeling that a 1966-7 Israeli would have chopped his hand off to have been in this position you now find yourself in.  Yet you just seem to be constantly wanting that little bit more.

&gt;That, BTW, will work towards your statement of stopping radicalization from our other thread, isn't it?

Yeah.  Stopping the bullets flying in both sides stops radicalisation on both sides. It just needs one side to break the cycle.  Otherwise it just gets worse.  I can't help think Israel's just killed 1,500 people and displaced 1000s whilst keeping them poor, cold and hungry.  You don't want to hang around much longer or for the next generation to reach maturity because you're only going in the wrong direction and they're only going to dig themselves in deeper.

Do you also understand that Smalltalk, standardized in *1980*, *three decades ago*, is still very much the state of the art in programming languages? Or that the state of the art in operating systems and GUIs has been obsolescent and behind the research by *four fucking decades*? I think there is plenty for me to do putting old research into design without wasting my time on new research. And I think I am about a billion times more valuable as a designer than any comp sci researcher out there.

As an advanced topic, read Rob Pike's essay [Software Systems Research Is Irrelevant](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~ejones/writing/systemsresearch.html) and realize that I am the only person on the face of the planet who's working to make relevant the general systems research of the last few decades. You see, every other systems designer has an unhealthy obsession with the functional paradigm and has tossed OO by the wayside. And as if that weren't bad enough, I'm the only person on the planet who knows how to market an OS successfully, which is why no OS designed in the last few decades (which excludes copycats and engineered refinements) has been successful commercially.

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","Ron can't win election with picking up some evangelicals.

We are in a bit of a transition where the GOP is likely going to split into faction which more closely represent their voting base.

So you have people like Obama or the DNC in general and people like Ron Paul who are trying to shore up their own voting base by picking up the religious vote.

For Ron it will only hurt his chances of election because he has no strong central party to hang on to for the ride as he has done with the GOP.

For the Dems, if they pull evangelicals they will likely be impossible to beat for at least a few election cycles.

The only great thing about Ron Paul I can find is that he is blunt. He avoids SOME of the circular talk of other politicians. But, at the same time he doesn't have enough friends in politics for him, at his age, to realistically push any major change through.

Sadly the only way to get things done is to rally either congress or the public and I think it's clear Ron Paul does not have such a capacity.

His view are fairly radical as well, which only hurts his chances. 

In politics you simply HAVE to say what gets you elected and then do what you want once in office. You cannot think you will enact mass change in the face of the old guard and they will stand by and do nothing. Ron never had nor could have the charisma to lead the public and he doesn't have friends in congress of any significance either.

On top of that he has no political or economic degrees to back up his rather wild claims and radical political views.

Ron is just a sign of how desperate the GOP is for someone who is even remotely qualified for office instead of some pandering monkey or witless actor stuffed into a suit and given the right lines to say.

Perhaps one could inhale smoke that's gone through nothing, room temperature water, ice water, and ice through a cigarette filter.

It has a budget of $300 million, making it one of the most expensive movies of all time. This is Cameron's first directing job since Titanic, so anticipation is very high, especially since he is trying to return to his sci-fi roots (Terminator, Abyss, Aliens). By most measures, this is one of the most anticipated movies of 2009 and comes out in December.

Not much is known about the film (which has been in development since 1995), other than that it takes place on an alien planet whose inhabitants are called ""Na'vi"", and there's some kind of a war between them and invading humans, one of whom joins forces with the aliens in their rebellion. The Na'vi are computer-generated creatures, and this is purportedly the first picture of what they'll look like.

In Oliver Sacks book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, he describes a patient named Christina who suffered from a selective neuritis—an infection in her spinal fluid that disconnected her entire body from the parietal cortices in her brain, causing a total loss of proprioception and therefore a sense of disembodiment.

Oh no, oh no no. When Abrams said he was going to make Star Trek more accessible, a new look at an old franchise with respect and admiration given to the source material, I didn't imagine this at all.

I thought he would capture the core essence of Star Trek while carving off all the bullshit that has held the series down lately, the traditions that fans need to let go of. But this is very mainstream looking, very...very traditional in an ironic way. It's funny because I thought they were going to break the norm of Star Trek without destroying the core feeling of the series, but it looks like this completely misses the point.

Of course it's just a trailer, but I have a bad first impression.

Yes, Wikipedia is not perfect, but it is a good starting point for but your resource seem to be a *demotivational poster*.  But since you want a much more legitimate source, here are is a good article from [**Dartmouth's Department of Philosophy**](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~phil/whatis/gert.html). Are you too good for Dartmouth, more of a [Standford guy?](http://plato.stanford.edu/). There is an entire Philosophy encyclopedia from an University.

Saying ""I don't care"" is not a valid philosophical argument. If you don't want to **discuss** philosophy, don't go to the philosophy subreddit.

""selectively choosing animals that kill, to eat...It's kind of interesting that's what you took away from my comment, but I'll chalk it up to you being a class A retard."" 

First of all, thanks for considering the best of the retards, but this is philosophy and ad hominem is considered a fallacy. So, I will be extremely explicit, and I will state how I derived my conclusion from your premise.

You say it is okay to kill animals because other animals kill each other. This seems to me to be saying that it is a matter of fairness. Why should some species be allowed privileges that our species is not? Then let's say that you're argument is correct, and that as a matter of fairness it is okay to kill an animal because it kills animals. But what of the animals that are unable to kill other animals? They do not kill other animals, so is it not unfair to say that animals that do not have the privilege of killing other animals have to be killed simply because they are animals? It is very much like saying, it is unfair for a human to be arrested for murder when he has never murdered, because humans murder. 

What I'm trying to say here is that even if it was okay to kill animals, because they do so. Then how is it fair to kill animals when they do not kill. It is very much like saying it is okay to lock up a human because they have murdered, but how is it fair to lock up a human when they have not murdered. 

Please, keep this civil. I know it may be hard, because you seem to disagree with me a lot, but this is philosophy.

As far as reincarnation goes, we don't have to assume that we have to die to be able to establish the likelihood of it being true.  We can use inferences based on observations--connect the dots, so to speak.

We'll never be *completely* sure, but once we get enough confidence in an answer, we can act on that.

The background to the hard-core racism of the North is interesting.  The South had lived shoulder to shoulder with blacks for hundreds of years (SC wasn't majority white until the 1920s!) and, while there were rigid social boundaries, people largely got along.

However, the North didn't experience a significant black population until the [Great Migration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_\(African_American\)) from 1916 to 1930.

When the sudden influx of blacks into a part of the country which was already highly bigoted (ask the Italians, Poles, Irish, and others how they were treated), blacks who were competing for jobs at the bottom (the uneducated) end of the spectrum is considered, the resulting racism and violence was entirely predictable.","1233511405"

Here - some wonderful information on the organization:


Though self-named a “Conservation Society,” Sea Shepherd is a violent organization. Its purpose is to ram and sink ships. Earth Warrior author David Morris details one such voyage in search of driftnetters. Even in this gushing account, Morris notes, “The gunfire that accompanied our attack on the Japanese ships was not defensive.” So it’s no surprise that Sea Shepherd’s expeditions have served as a fitting training ground for other animal-rights militants.

Rodney Coronado has long been involved with criminal groups such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), which the FBI has identified as the country’s most dangerous domestic terrorist threat, and the special-interest ALF subset known as SHAC. He was sentenced to 57 months in federal prison for the 1992 arson of a Michigan State University research laboratory. He admitted to at least six other arsons in a November 30, 2002 speech. In January 2003, he demonstrated to a group gathered at American University the “correct” way to build a firebomb out of household materials. And Paul Watson gave him his start.

Coronado joined SSCS immediately after graduating from high school in 1984. Two years later, he proposed a plan to covertly attack Iceland’s whaling industry. He and David Howitt, a British bicycle mechanic, destroyed a whale-processing facility there, and sank two of the Icelandic whaling fleet’s four ships. Watson supported the plan and SSCS took responsibility for the destruction.

In the mid-’90s, Coronado again wanted to join a SSCS expedition. But he was wanted for questioning by the FBI and Watson said no. Watson was regretful, however, calling him “an excellent crew member and the best damn activist I ever had.” These words give the lie to Watson’s claim that “we have absolutely no links with the so-called Animal Liberation Front.”

SHAC organizer and spokesman Joshua Harper has also served as a SSCS crewmember. Harper describes his goal as “the complete collapse of industrial civilization.” A young man with an impressive criminal record, Harper was jailed in 1997 for assaulting a police officer, and in 2001 for violating a summons to testify regarding ALF and its sister organization, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). He was also incarcerated in 1999 for attacking Native Americans on a whale hunt; Paul Watson’s ex-wife Lisa Distefano, and current wife, Allison Lance Watson, were also charged in that attack.

In April 2002, Allison Lance Watson was ordered to appear before a federal grand jury along with a number of other animal-rights activists. Former ELF spokesman Craig Rosebraugh issued a press release announcing her subpoena. Watson’s attorney was Stuart Sugarman, the same lawyer who represented Rosebraugh when he appeared before a U.S. House of Representatives committee in 2002 and refused to answer questions.

Alex Pacheco is another activist who started his career with SSCS, in the late 1970s. He now serves on one of its advisory boards. Pacheco is co-founder and former chairman of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an organization whose leaders openly advocate terrorist violence. “Arson, property destruction, burglary, and theft are ‘acceptable crimes’ when used for the animal cause,” he once said. Pacheco is rumored to be a “commander” of ALF and has been subpoenaed in connection to ALF activities.

Watson once held a fundraiser for the “Kentucky Fried Five,” a group of animal-rights activists who vandalized a fast-food outlet in Toronto in 1987, claiming they were “scapegoats.” An empty KFC chicken bucket was passed around for donations. The hooligans pleaded guilty to mischief resulting in willful damage, and possession of burglary tools and stolen property. Two of the five were also accused of possessing explosives, carrying weapons, and vandalizing the Toronto University dentistry school, but those charges were dropped as part of a plea-bargain. One of the latter two, David Barbarash, has served as an ALF spokesman, and The Oregonian said the group was an ALF cell. ","1233511481"

What I dislike about the Superbowl has very little to do with the actual game or sport (although I'm not a fan, I've watched more than my fair share of it)...it's what it's been turned into.  It's about advertising revenues more than anything else, and since my husband works in media research I actually get to hear about people who actually lose their jobs because of a football game.  

As an excuse for a good time with friends I certainly can't see a problem with it, but it's still only a football game.  This last week (even though I don't generally read most sports news), I've had Superbowl tie-ins shoved down my throat even on cooking and parenting websites, and I'm not even American. 

I'm not tremendously pissed off about it, and I'm not claiming to be doing anything intellectual today (I've spent part of this afternoon playing Dance Dance Revolution with my kids and later we're going to make a snow fort, which isn't exactly intellectual)...it just gets annoying, and it's kind of sad that a game should have so much importance placed on it by the media.

Since Obama's 04-Nov win, NoKor was never explicitly indicated in his numerous speeches (not even in his inaugural speech).

The subPrime, Middle-East, Afghan &amp; Guantanamo were prominent in Obama's press releases from 04-Nov till his inauguration, but nary an indication of NoKor until now.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Men have to be groomed and dress professionally, therefore women have to dress so they look young and attractive? Sorry, but I'm not following the logic on that one.

That said, I have to say that I can understand where BoE is coming from. The problem is that the standards are really clear for men: suit, tie, and groomed hair/beard. Women have been able to circumvent this due to the fact that it is possible for them to dress in a way that is considered professional without wearing a suit. The problem is that a lot of them don't actually know how to do it.

The dress code sounds fine to me other than the makeup and heels bit. Personally, I would be more on the side of encouraging less makeup to combat the gross clown makeup some women think makes them look sophisticated. As for heels, they are bad for your feet, knees, and back. They have no business forcing their employees to wear them every day. On the issue of matching the color, while it's true that matching the skirt to the shoes is really not necessary in order for a woman to look professional, what else can they do if they have employees coming in with leopard print shoes or making other inappropriate choices?

The real solution is plain and simple. Just require women to wear suits too. It's not like they don't exist.","1233511580"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; what we need is to settle on some communication protocols which allow such easy interaction.

As the saying goes, the wonderful thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.

We already have plenty of communication protocols. Everyone supports a C interface. Various VMs support higher-level concepts like classes and exceptions across code written in any language that runs on that VM: Java, .Net, assorted dynamic/scripting language offerings.

The problem seems to be that writing code that calls across such a boundary is almost invariably a royal PITA. If I want to link in a library, I should just have to add a one-liner to my code citing that library, and specify in some fast, clean way which part(s) I want to import. The fact that the compiler/VM/interpreter/whatever is juggling calling conventions and marshalling data types and all that jazz should be completely transparent.

And yet, for all our emphasis on abstraction in programming, we still haven't solved this problem, and linking to foreign language interfaces is often so much trouble that we just don't bother. We have to worry about physical files (and, these days, sometimes references to URIs as well). We have to worry about build options. We are exposed to marshalling baggage and calling conventions in our code. We wind up writing wrappers for anything useful enough to justify using them, or attempting to use some combination of usually awkward and underpowered tools to generate almost-correct wrappers for us that we then have to tweak manually.

Of course, many of these problems also apply to some degree even to bringing in libraries written in the same programming language or running on the same VM. We basically suck at writing programming language tools that connect up different parts of a system simply and effectively, and until we get that right in principle, it doesn't really matter how many different languages or VMs we have to match up.","1233511631"

Years ago, when I still had all my hair, I was hanging out at a friend's apartment after his band had played a very successful show at a local bar. Someone at the bar had hooked one of the band members' friends up with a bag of cocaine, enough to get everyone in the apartment high for a few hours.

There were a couple of groupies there, little hippie girls, my friend's housemate, some guys from the band, the band's promoter, a few other friends, and me.

I was the only one there not interested in snorting the coke, and it made everyone there nervous. They kept telling me how there was nothing wrong with it, it's okay, go ahead, do some coke, why aren't you doing any coke, and so on. They were really getting annoyed that I was sitting there not doing it.

I wasn't passing judgment on anyone over it. I wasn't saying that I was morally superior, I just said that I don't do coke, and it was just a personal decision. But they were still annoyed.

It dawned on me in that moment that they were getting annoyed because as long as everyone's doing it, there's no doubt that it's the right thing to do. Classic ""groupthink.""

Just one person abstaining throws a wrench in the groupthink, because there's that shred of doubt creeping in. He's not doing it... should I be doing it?

Same goes for religion. Atheists really bother religious people, because it points out the potential silliness of religious belief. That's why they have to congregate in churches and tell each other how horrible atheists are, like a group of children all ostracizing the one kid who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, or a group of people living in a trailer park shunning the one guy who doesn't consider pro wrestling a real sport.","1233511713"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Well I think the problem is that there's a misconception about what being a programmer actually entails.

It is NOT sitting at a workstation banging out code nonstop for days on end.

There's a whole lot of thinking going on in the job, and in multiple different capacities. 

First, there's usually plenty of time spent grokking a new system to understand how the code works and how to fix things. (Which is why it's really important to start attacking defects, however trivial, as soon as possible.)

Then when it comes to fixing or adding things, there's a lot of thinking that's necessary to attack tasks efficiently and intelligently. Probably one of the most important and useful skill is to actually figure out how to define a problem. In addition to training engineers how to use precise, clear language, this exercise will also teach them how to think programatically: how can problems be reproduced, might this problem exist elsewhere, what kind of lesson can I take to prevent it in the future?

There's also the planning stages of new components: how does this integrate with the existing systems, am I duplicating functionality, how can we make sure this is reusable, are there pre-existing libraries I can use or repurpose, is this an efficient and scalable solution to the problem?

Finally, only then can code be written or modified to solve the particular issue. This really de-emphasizes the act of typing out the code and places the focus where it belongs: on engineering solutions.

Of course, enough practice will make answering these questions second nature, but the process is still something that will be used time and time again, and it can be really gratifying to figure out a solution.

Unfortunately, this process is not well understood by non-engineers, and so the notion of typing endless lines of code for 12 hours a day still remains, but once you begin to do it for real, this notion is quickly dispelled.","1233512376"

If you give it a shot, I find the best bacon that is easy to find is Niman Ranch's applewood smoked bacon. They sell it at Trader Joe's and Niman Ranch is a family operation that raises their livestock traditionally and sustainably and they pride themselves in treating their animals humanely. 

Bake the bacon slices at 350 degrees on a baking sheet with a edge around it (quite a lot of fat will render out of the bacon as it cooks.) Turn the slices occasionally until the slices are firm and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. Eat while still warm.

There was a time in my life where I was vegetarian, then vegan. My health was very poor and I really don't think my lifestyle was doing very much to change the meat industry. Not only that, but I was eating a lot of soy products that were heavily, heavily processed. Not only that, but avoid genetically modified soy is next to impossible.

Now, as a meat eater, I'm able to support companies that are sustainable, humane, avoid using hormones and other nastiness, and it's food my great-grandparents would recognize as food. Win win win win win.

"reddit.com","t5_6","It's a habit of mine to delve into Fortean topics. I don't know why - maybe it's a form of mental inoculation, or a way of strengthening certain meme-antibodies. The long and the short of it is that I've seen some very silly theories out there - one the most baffling being a belief in the overt antiquity of human civilization. The ideas are multivalent, but mainly they revolve around ancient monuments, like the pyramids and the inca stonework and stone-henge, being evidence of technologically superior races (read, atlanteans), or even 'ancient astronauts.'
The idea is that these ancient civilizations worked in stone because it was enduring, and used their superior technology to move massive, 200 tonne megaliths and so forth. This begs the question of why a space-faring race, or a race that has master anti-gravity or whatever other arcane tech you desire, is faffing around carving monuments out of basalt or granite.
At the very least they could use their extensive nano-technology to construct temples out of diamond; which would last much longer than sandstone. At the most, they could shape entire continents into temples and monuments.

So, reddit, in the spirit of these stories, why do you imagine super-potent aliens, or advanced pre-civilization Atlanteans, or whatever you want them to be, ignored all of their complex technology and made things out of un-mortared stonework and roughly hewed menhirs?

and please do not interpret my words the way you want to read them.  You conveniently forget to mention that Fatah and Hamas are at each other throats and cannot only agree on ONE thing.  Who does represent the Palestinean people today?  

The Arab league?  Please....

The best solution is to give Gaza to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan which is anyway 75% Palestinean.  Having Hamastan and Fatahland is a recipe for trouble.

You conviniently forget that fact that Israel withdrew from all Gaza in 2005.

If Hamas would have not attack Israel for almost 3 years with Qassams and build a society with the billions from the EU and US, they would not been poor, cold and hungry.  But they choose to decapitate Fatah in Gaza, replace the PA there as the ruler and follow the path of Jihad with the support of many if not most of Gaza people.  

So please do not post propaganda about Israel's attrocities.  The reality is that nobody is blameless and in order for things to change Hamas MUST stop supporting and abetting attacks against Israel.    But doing so, it will finish its raison d'etre, isn't it? 

If they or any faction under their rule are tacitly encouraged to continue, they need to be kept responsible as the ruler in Gaza.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;You can't expect most people to use your platform based on dogma alone

I emphatically do not want people to base their actions on dogma alone on the contrary. I've used Linux for some years - after using windows since win3 and found it great. 

For  normal daily use I don't see Linux as vastly better than windows. It has some advantages that are not immediately apparent but that show over time. One of the most important things I found is knowledge you gain from use of opensource (rather than just linux). 

And I'm not thinking of forced fiddling to make things work but a lot using the apps will let you gain insight into things that can be used more generally. Actually when I started to use windows the first many years were filled with forced fiddling and anyone using windows got quite savvy. After win2k this trailed off as Windows began to 'just work' and even more so with XP. (ie. it took the better part of a decade before windows reach the 'just work' state).

I've had a similar experience with Linux in the first year: a lot of fiddling and gaining new (not always welcome) knowledge.

Anyway, and this is a major difference, the knowledge gained from Linux is of a more general type - it can be used in other situations. The major part of knowledge gained from windows has no value outside a very narrow context the specific problem.

Another difference is the _feeling_ that they want to make money off of you from you daily activities 'they' being Microsoft, and Microsoft's business partners. It's a feeling of a generally dishonest culture.","1233513208"

I'm just sayin', if this is something you feel like you really relate to, perhaps that means something.  Maybe it's time to step back, and reassess who you're with, what you're looking for in a relationship, whether the two match up or not, and if not whether or not you're ok with that for now.

Take my brother for example.  He's a really smart, independant thinker who is in a relationship with a real sweet girl.  However, because my brother doesn't dedicate 1/100 of the thought he uses for business matters towards relationship matters, he's not really sure what he wants and as a result breaks up and gets back together with his girlfriend every other month.  He's been on and off with her now for 3-4 years now if I'm not mistaken and it's caused them both a lot of drama and pain.  And why?  Because according to him he doesn't know what he wants.  Why not?  He doesn't know he says.  He doesn't think about it.

Plus, Ruby classes can be modified at runtime, so they're not implemented as Java classes.  So, for example, you can't create JUnit test cases in JRuby, since you need to create a .class file that extends JUnit's TestCase.

Cord blood transplantation as a treatment for children with hematological, immunological, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases has been highly successful. The advantage of cord blood transplants is the relatively low rate of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) compared with the rates of GVHD that occur as a result of bone marrow or peripheral blood transplants. Research related to the improved clinical use of cord blood is being conducted in four general areas: (1) enhancement of cord blood engraftment, (2) improvements in immune reconstitution, (3) reduction in the rates of treatment-related mortality, and (4) augmentation of immune recognition of infectious agents and tumors.","1233513356"

"dotnet","t5_2qh3h","This is a huge issue for me.  I teach basic computer programming and so much of my day is spent with students, leaving time for me to learn newer technologies limited.  In addition, I make the personal decision to have a work/life balance, and not all of the ""life"" part is computer related.

It also makes me worried for my students, and the next generation of software developers in general.  If those of us with experience and base knowledge have to run full speed to keep up, how does a new developer without that knowledge even get on the treadmill?

I want things to be easy, safe, and simple because I know that makes for better software.  The proliferation of models and frameworks doesn't seem to help that... And the lack of shared terminology and technique.  

For example, I spent some time learning WPF recently and I like it [although many things could be much improved]; Silverlight is based on the same XAML/.NET CLR, but certain things, like data binding, are done completely differently.  Why?  No good reason that I have seen, but now that's two different things to learn when it could have been one.","1233513414"

Another factor is control.  The US has the finest navy in the world.  It can sink any ship it wants, or put holes in any pipe line you have.  Geopoliticaly it makes a lot of sence to have the world by the energy balls.  I.e. If the US gets pissed off, no more oil for you. 


Oh right, and Money talks and everything else is shit in this world.  Drug dealers make a very hansom profit by arranging for there to be a high demand then selling to that demand.  Only the strong, wise and far sighted can avoid the trap.  Energy is a akin to steroids for an economy (or so the argument goes). 


Most of our current world is not based in a sustainable anything.  But only by getting to sustainability will our great great great grandchildren live in anything remotely like a reasonable place.

"reddit.com","t5_6","This essay is very important because it shows how even the most intelligent people on the planet can get it wrong when it comes to social economics.   

That is because, economics is not like other sciences.  Economics is the science of human action.  In economics you can't decide what's good for people because it is choice based, not logic based.  

I may love mud pies more than anything else in the world, I may worship them as a top priority in my life, they may make me feel so extremely secure and happy.  I may be willing to die for them.  But the very second I impose that priority on millions of people - will it bring happiness to the masses?  will it bring joy?  No, it will likely bring absolute horror and misery.  

Today we have bureaucrats imposing their top priorities in health, environment, education, infrastructure, and empire.  In theory it should make people happy, but in practice all it does it coerce people into putting their resources and money towards others priorities.  In the end, that coercive power grows out of control, nobody becomes happy, and there is death and misery everywhere.

After you've delved into this a bit you'll probably want to do some small projects on your own and then definitely look into books about specific languages; go for a good few languages spanning various paradigms. There are many bad books out there about specific languages that will contain outright falsehoods, not to mention bad advice. Some are very good though, and this is the kind of knowledge that's best found in communities dedicated to the specific language in question. Look for IRC channels (a large concentration can be found on FreeNode) and forums and such.

Once you've got a bit more experience, you'll want to go for [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262032937) (commonly abbreviated CLRS according to the initials of the authors) for a deeper understanding of, well, algorithms.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Israel (and everyone else) should accept that terrorism is a part of modern life that will **never** go away.  Fortunately, the number of people who die every year driving (a modern convenience) vastly exceeds the number of people who die each years from terror attacks.  We accept the huge numbers of deaths from driving as a part of modern life that won't go away.  We could greatly reduce these deaths if we forced everyone to ride trains and bikes to their destinations.  However, we feel that this huge number of deaths is acceptable, though tragic.  

Israel, and the U.S. also, should accept that a small number of deaths from terrorism is acceptable.  We shouldn't sensationalize the attacks in media, or even lead with a terrorism story for more than a day.  The more attention we give terrorists, the more they win.  Individual terrorists should be pursued, but not at the expense of large numbers of civilian deaths. 

Since WWII, there have been no civilians in war.  Deaths of non-military citizens are tragic.  But we need to accept these deaths as the cost of defending freedoms values.","1233513945"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yeah, this is bullshit.  ALL of this ranting and raving only refers to a single line in one of Obama's executive orders.

In the middle of the executive order in which he declares that A)the Geneva Conventions DO apply to terror prisoners, and that B)the CIA has to shut down all its secret prisons, there is one line that says the shutdown order ""[does] not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis.""

That's IT.  That is the only textual basis for all this blatant propagandizing.  And, also, notice the *only* in the sentence.  If the facility is being used for things like torture, then it's not *only* being used to hold people on a transitory basis, now is it?

This is typical right-wing grasping at straws.  They can't stand that Obama has gotten into office and is actually doing the things he promised to do, so they're going over his orders word-by-word looking for anything at all they can misinterpret and take out of context for the sake of smearing him.

Otherwise, if anyone can point me to a passage in any of Obama's orders that **actually** explicitly permits rendition or torture, I would really love to see it.

1. He once ate a bowl of **live crickets** because they were beaming “Democrap” messages in to his foil-and-oatmeal hat.

2. He has only had one “job” in his life, and that was **sniff-testing the leaded gasoline** at the station down the street.  When the owner discovered this “job” in progress at 2 am, he of course called the cops.

3. It’s not 47 or 48 cats.  If you include the dead ones, reddit-man actually has 73 cats!  He blames the “Democraps” **for not having the dead ones removed.**

4. Reddit-man lives with his mommy, who also signs his name to the checks he gets **due to the mental “issues”** that keep him from doing anything useful.

5. He was **born in a manger.**  (Well, actually he just *thinks* he was.  He was born in Arkansas, and has never left the state.)

6. Reddit-man has 16 separate personalities.  Defying the odds, all of them turned out to be **clueless, right-wing assholes.**

7. Reddit-man has never actually voted... because **he can’t read.**  (His “mumsie” types for him.)   He HAS, however, participated in demonstrations against adult literacy programs in which he could LEARN to read.

8. The **truck stop bathroom** where he “parties” is also his only source of income.

9. He invents new words.  **Today’s words are “li-berry” and “rackoonstew.”**

10. Ten is too high a number for him to understand.  **Instead, he says “three threes”** and blames Democrats when he gets confused while counting his toes.

11. He believes that **“reverse vampires”** live inside his left ear.  No... HIS OTHER LEFT!

"wikipedia","t5_2qh3b","The North Carolina Scots who supported the British were largely from the upper Cape Fear River Valley and were rather Gaelic-speaking Scottish highlanders who immigrated to this one area (in addition to one or two other groups who went to Georgia and New York) - I know this because I am from this area and this is historical ground zero for this group - I count numerous Gaelic names in my own family tree.  I even wrote a paper once on the usage of Scots Gaelic in the this region right up until 1900.  This is the stuff I love discovering - that a church out in the countryside, near where some friends and I used to camp and party, used to boast sermons in a language that is far more alien to most Americans than Spanish.  These highlanders, despite opposing the English Hanoverian crown in the Jacobite wars of the earlier 1700s, came to be the staunchest loyalists in the colonies, after experiencing repression and such for their defiance decades earlier back home.

The Scots-Irish tended to be Scots-/English-speaking lowlanders with much more culturally in common with the English than with their highland brothers.

Both groups integrated rather quickly, and by the mid 1800's, many of these formative communities had already been dispersing westward for a decade or two, dropping the community homogeneity that tends to preserve an ancestral language and other customs.  It is precisely because the Scots-Irish did not form ""ghettos"" that they went on to become just as ""white"" as the English and to hold many important posts on up to the presidency.

However, this being said, my grandmother *does* have a friend who vaguely recalls elders speaking Scots Gaelic when she was a little girl.

Another interesting relic of this is - combine a lack of geographical mobility among former slaves as compared to whites, and a Gaelic master with a Gaelic surname, and you have nearly every African American in my high school graduating class with a ""Mc"" at the beginning of their last name - far, far outnumbering the whites with one.  The most mundane patterns can reveal the most interesting historical facts.","1233514093"

The reason that it is not enabled by default in any distributions that I know is that, as I said, it is an *utterly pointless* measure in a system that someone has unrestricted physical access to.  Grub can be bypassed altogether with a bootable USB key.  

But you can stop the BIOS from booting from anything but the hard drive, and password-protect the BIOS; I hear you cry!  So short the CMOS battery.  Etc, etc.

This is an immutable law of computer security: unrestricted physical access renders discretionary access control moot.  You can't get round it, except with non-discretionary access control (e.g. encrypting the entire hard drive).  In the absence of that, physical access == root access.

That's the reason single user mode locking isn't enabled be default, and the ""S"" option exists: as I said before, In other words, the GRUB desigers are saying ""We know that physical access renders the permission system moot, so rather than try to hide this, by enabling single-user locking etc. by default, we will explicitely allow a user with physical access to easily boot into an administrative prompt by default, in order that users will not be under any misconception.""","1233514258"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Buddhist philosophies tend to be monistic, but their monism is not a materialist monism, so rejecting dualism doesn't mean the same thing as it would in western philosophy.  It's much more like the monism of Advaita Vedanta, Neoplatonism, Sufism, or other similar monistic traditions.  And not all Buddhists are monists.  Dharmakirti was a very famous and important Indian Buddhist philosopher who was a consciousness/matter dualist.

One important thing to keep in mind is that there's no monolithic ""Buddhism"" but a instead a number of sects with sometimes wildly divergent views.  So a modern Western Zennist's view of things is nothing like a Chinese Pure Lander, and both differ a lot from a Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhist.

I can give you an account from a Ch'an (Chinese Zen) perspective that might be helpful.  In general the point of Buddhism is to realize certain states of mind that help to transform oneself into something very remarkable, and the rest is secondary (this isn't universal, but it applies to most sects that people in the West are interested in).  The reason for analysis in Buddhism that would lead one to worry about monism or dualism (or rebirth, or karma, or whatever) is for the sake of introspective analysis in order to realize these states of mind.  Things like rebirth and karma can be understood metaphorically as part of the activity of the mind, and in that way they can be seen, tested, and verified or rejected.  Perhaps some of those things are literally true, or perhaps not, but it really doesn't matter, worrying about it is a distraction that takes you away from focusing on what does matter.  The various analyses are meant as tools to assist in examining yourself and seeing what there is to be found in introspection.  The ultimate goal is transformation through introspection, not being ""right.""  There is a lot of false self image tied into being ""right"" that it's important to get over.  Though at the same time, holding on to false views can block you, so there is some benefit from examining these things.  But if you look at what most of these analyses are up to, there's a lot more negating false views, that building some mental model or another.  Some schools of Zen even dispense with the analysis altogether since every opinion you hold about the way things are blocks you from really seeing the way things are - there are many Zen parables about this. 

Take everything I say with a grain of salt, as I am a student, not a teacher, YMMV.

Some examples which should not depend on personal religious views: A pharmacist should be aware they will be expected to dispense birth control, and now morning after pills. A civil engineer should not expect that his or her boss will force them to hurt the public by cutting corners on a bridge design. An electrical engineer for a defense contractor should be comfortable with the fact that they may design weapon systems that will be used to kill humans. A grocery bagger in the western world should know that they will be placing pork intended for human consumption in grocery bags for shoppers.

POLY-theist - multiple gods.


They are not words used to count how many gods you don't believe in.  They denote how many gods you do believe in.  


To call a person who believes in Jesus but not Ganesha an atheist is wrong and will only succeed in making you look the fool.

I brought up a similar question that you pose (did the Jews deserve the Holocaust?) and he said that karma is not meant to be understood that way. I would summarize that it's mapping our worldly ideas of justice onto a cosmic system that from our perspective is white noise. Because karma is not an observable thing, he said, our interpretations of it will inevitably fail.

I don't want Conservatism to disappear in Canada because I think that it's a good thing to have at least 2 healthy parties (and yes, you can argue whether the Liberal Party is healthy right now).  If there is no effective opposition to the Conservatives we have now, we'll end up in a semi-fascist state where the rich get richer, we lose freedoms, and fuck everyone who doesn't agree with them.  If we end up with a Liberal govt. with no effective opposition we're going to have even more bread and circuses and little to no business development (I am talking about the extremes here).

With no alternative, I prepared myself for a bloody and possibly deadly landing as I rode the waves toward the rocky shoreline. The whitewater shoved me forward, and as I looked for the least jagged landing spot an angel in baggies appeared before me.

I find this absurd.  Selective processes obviously are less influential on ""intelligent"" species on the basis that they can set out to deliberately manipulate their environment.  

We perceive examples of both altruism, collaboration and competition throughout the eukaryotic tree both between and within species.  Even within individual organisms if you want to get right down to it.  

The idea that we derive morality directly from naturalistic observation is just a play at Natural Right 2.0 since the previous incarnation doesn't hold up very well on its own.  Naturalists don't need a ghost in the machine.  We are perfectly capable of divorcing our ethics from our physical nature.  We may take inspiration and lessons from nature's experiments, but ultimately it seems that ethics can easily exist between thinking beings, and even moderate the effects of thinking on the non-sentient world.

Ultimately though, the net consequences of an opinion do not make it true or false.

&gt; Do a little research next time? This was an ongoing case. The police notified Ian that they had received a complaint about a couch out on his lawn. (A couch on his lawn, seriously?) He refused to do anything about it and instead went to court only to have a hearing date set, not for the hearing itself and tried to negotiate with the judge, interrupting him, making unreasonable requests of the judge, especially when he's only there to have the date set for a future hearing.

&gt; He was warned that the date was set and he had no further business and to stop talking and remove himself from the court room. He didn't leave though, he kept pestering the judge and was warned again that he was going to be arrested if he didn't leave. I'm really surprised he wasn't held in comptempt of court at that point.

&gt; I'd also like to see what was going on before the start of the video linked to in this post. Context is pretty important here and since the judge already seemed pretty steamed, you don't think something had already happened before the start of the video?

&gt; Your statement that he no doubt criticizes the government is putting it lightly. heh And how would you know what BS tricks they used if any to get him into court? You're only even making assumptions about whether or not he's critical of the government, but you know for a fact that they used a lot of BS tricks just to silence him?

&gt; You may also want to brush up on the first amendment as it does not give you a free pass to be in contempt of court and then be a smart ass about it to the judge.","1233514974"

Plus, Sonic got a *Bioware*-designed RPG.  I haven't played it yet, but I understand it's quite good.

So, the actual truth here is that Sonic is still starring in plenty of good games, but it's the HEADLINING games that suck.  Team Sonic needs to fire everyone working on the PS3\360 games and promote the guys working on the Wii and DS titles, and everything will be just fine.","1233515127"

""Finally, that taxpayer anger and falling tax receipts, plus the government continuing to hand money to people who demonstrably not only made bad bets but engaged in outrageous and perhaps even illegal and fraudulent conduct, yet have returned nothing of what they stole sets up a very real risk of a tax revolt by Americans.  It would be ruinous and nearly impossible to control if Americans decided en-masse to simply refuse to pay and to the extent possible went ""off grid"" through barter and underground transactions, or started modifying W4s to greatly limit withholding and then simply didn't file.  Anecdotes related to this occurring are already popping up.

A proper response to a rigid business model is to create your own business- if you're correct and everyone wants a change you'll beat them. Or... don't use their product.

But see, in the case of the banker, it's the money that's important, not the banker. 

And even the money isn't as important as he thinks. You see, while some investment is necessary fo a healthy economy, investments do not create wealth in the same way that profits do. An investment is a loan that must be repaid. Pump in as much investment as you like, you will make someone no richer, just deeper in debt. It is only when they can sell something that they become richer.

People often forget that money is not wealth. Goods and services are wealth. Money is just a token, and no amount of toying with it can produce anything useful without the labour of factory workers and design engineers. 

Because bankers and investors have been allowed too much access to the making of law, and too much access to the money they move around, they have esteemed themselves too highly, and imagined that because they are powerful, they are useful.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I think that slowly most are coming to realize that finite nature of the resources available. I respond mostly to because of the phrase ""self-sacrificial behavior"" in your comment. I can only ask a number of questions in response to that:

01. Is it ""self-sacrificial"" (here-after S.S.) to realize that finiteness in one's family planning, or more aptly to actually do some family planning as a result of being aware of it? 

02. Is it S.S. to limit one's breeding to a number of spawn who you can actually be a real parent to, as opposed to a baby production factory which by the nature of the young you are rearing demand that you ignore the previously born more and more as each bright new bundle of joy appears?

03. Is it S.S. to be aware that most social organizations (I am thinking specifically of religious organizations here) that demand the only ""joy of sex"" be procreation, are still mired down in medieval constructs, when a growing population was a desirable thing, as opposed to the current times when this construct is disastrous for one and all.

The film Idiocracy stages a reality in which those that are capable of understanding the problems with unlimited population growth control their breeding while those that do not continue to breed unchecked. It ignores the reality that environment apparently has a significant impact on the potential of each new being in favor of the argument that people of limited capability can only breed those of their own kind, that is more stupid people. It also ignores the reality that until population control becomes a part of the mores of this world, the more capable are not likely to accept such a more until it becomes universal anyway. What the film makes an argument for more than anything else is the licensing of ""birth-right"", having made the choice not to procreate, I am probably much more positive about such a concept than most, but I am definitely aware that such a procedure could not at this point or for that matter any point in the near future be implemented without massive abuses. 

||Now I do not mean to be prejudiced towards those of a lower quotient, but the 
||way I see it is that some intelligence preferences are inherited, others 
||nurtured. With all the clever people saying ""hey I'm not gonna have kids, its 
||better for the planet"" slowly we will be left with a less and less intelligent 
||population.

Mostly, I do not share your aversion to being ""prejudiced"" towards those who are less capable. I may yet find a religion I can respect and be part of when I find one that proclaims ""stupidity is an abomination"", instead of the typical ""question your rational processes: that they all seem to embrace. I think we are long past the time when we can solve the problems created when one who is of limited value in the gene pool produces eight spawn as compared with one who is an asset to that gene pool reproduces in moderation with a consideration both for both the quality of the planet and the quality of the life they can actually provide for their own progeny. Idiocrasy takes a very complex issue and tries to simplify it to the extent that I am forced to question the ""worthiness"" of those involved with the production, bad premise, compounded by bad science, compounded by a bad script and bad acting. An argument might be made that the story is ""dumbed down"" to make the values it proposes comprehend-able by the intended audience, but in reality, the result is to make each and every member of the audience believe that they are of the superior part of humanity that should be allowed to continue breeding as compared to ""them that should not"". If the authors intended to raise awareness a level, they accomplish the opposite as the movie was produced. 

||Besides, I'm a woman, and find myself very broody over this issue. I would one 
||day love to have lots of kids, and if I did, I would bring them up really well 
||to be very aware of the truth in all situations. I would hope that someday they 
||could help change the world for the best of the world and humanity. As it is, my 
||kids do not yet exist, and possibly might never will do.

How do I get there without sounding like I am attacking? While I am not female and thus not quite as hormonally driven to procreate, I am almost offended that you believe that the biological drive is limited on the part of the male gender. I will answer your assumption with one of my own, that you are still relatively young and that those you have sampled of the male gender have not come to any real fruition of the drive to procreate as yet. I make my assumption in part as a result of considering the rest of your paragraph preceding, and while I love what I would classify the ""youthful optimism"" of what you have written, I am also aware as the decades roll by, ones perspective come to a ""not so much"" appraisal of reality. 

""so I am kind of hoping to be a teacher instead"" is sort of a promising statement. Again, I would probably have to accuse you of ""youthful optimism"", but I will also include here that there is far more to the positive in that, than ""there is nothing wrong with that"". I personally find it encouraging that you pose a self-diminutive tone in the end of this paragraph. To me it says that perhaps you possess some of the qualities that Idiocrasy ignored, so whatever your I.Q. and that of you progeny, here is another scale of value to consider for the ""license"". If you want to teach, try to retain some of this optimism and humility, which will not be easy. Your optimism about making a better world as a result of pursuing this is applaud-able, I hope it goes with you when you face the many hurdles you find as you progress down that road, truly you will need to retain some of it to follow that course. 

||Maybe if you redditors out there found someone of a younger generation to 
||nurture on a one on one basis, out of the existing population, ...

The old commercial ""Suma do, Suma don't"" obviously applies. While you are simplifying again, there are many who use these forums to encourage what they perceive as good. My ex found her level of existence to be pretty much satisfied by a counselor's trite advice of ""you got to take care of yourself, first"". Such an ugly little truth when applied as she used it, but none the less it is a truth. There are quite a number of ways your suggestions are applied in our society, but I think you are not considering that as the availability of such altruistic resources grow, the need will apparently always propagate at some multiple of the availability. Choices that one is left with in response to this are anywhere in the range of the ex's selfish to some almost mythical altruism carried to an extreme that begins to be self-destructive. I hope for you that you find your own balance. I hope for society that it includes some of the optimism I have found in your response. I hope for me that in reading this, your interpretation of what I have said is not, ""What a pompous old ass!"". ","1233515518"

But if you believe a functioning banking system is important to the economy then this sequence of events is a valid potential explanation too:

(1) Everyone, not just banks, thinks the economy is great
(2) Economy goes to shit and all banks are screwed 
(3) We need a banking system so we bail them out

"pics","t5_2qh0u","This happened last night between myself and a girl.

I had taken this girl to a fraternity date function two nights ago. She decided not to share the fact that she had a boyfriend until an ENTIRE DAY after she replied that she would go on a date with me, yet she still wanted to go. Fine, I wasn't going to get laid but she's generally fun to be around so no big deal. The date went alright until we moved to the bar downstairs where she didn't drink (perfectly OK) or dance (not OK). I got really bored after a while and told her I was leaving with some friends. She stayed behind with her friends -- lucky that she wasn't drinking because they started tossing people out and confiscating IDs illegally (both real and fake) shortly after I ducked out.

So I'm working the door at my fraternity, drunk out of my mind, when I see her come in. I try to say hi to her but she pretty much ignores me. ""Whatever"" I think, ""she's probably just being a bitch since I've got puke on my shoes or something"". Well, I see her downstairs and when I start approaching her she turns around and bolts. Now I'm thinking ""WTF is going on."" That's when I send the first text. When she replies that I gave her the ""stalker vibes"" at the date function, my drunk self gets very pissed. I'm not really proud of myself for this, but it proved to me that the T-Mobile G1's interface is quite intuitive and easy to use even when your BAC is a 0.28.","1233515708"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","&gt;You assume wrong that I think ref mistakes are necessary. They are part of the game. You accept them and move on like most people in other civilized countries do.

If you say ""they are part of the game,"" that implies that they are necessary. Why accept them if you don't have to (or at least can increase your chance of success)?

&gt;Americans love to whine. Amercians love to strive at perfecting things that cannot be perfected. And the end result is a product that is always worse than just letting it be.

What is this? Are you just on an anti-American tirade? This is an invalid generalization, especially when you're trying to make an argument.

&gt;Now I see you're measuring the length of the challenges- like that makes a difference. It's the challenges themselves that are throwing cold water on all of the action.

Once again, I disagree. Football is a sport with frequent stoppages in play. All this does is slightly extend the stoppages. That's not cold water any more than the regular stoppages are. Moreover, you said replay ""drags the game on."" I gave evidence to show it doesn't, so you just redefined what you meant so it is impossible to prove one way or another. Nice.

&gt;Throwing all of thes extra elements into play calling makes it worse, not better. It's also made the refereeing worse because now they realize they'll always have replay to fall back on.

Once again, no evidence. I am going to say (without any facts, of course) that it makes referees better because it holds them accountable for their mistakes and they are no doubt evaluated (and compensated) for how well they do. Is my assertion any less valid than yours?

&gt;It is a fact that the referring has become embarrassingly horrible over the past 5 or 6 seasons.

This is called ""begging the question."" I mentioned it before, but it's quite the attractive fallacy I suppose. Check it out here: [http://begthequestion.info/](http://begthequestion.info/)

&gt;No challenges, no instant replays, less ads = a more cohesive product.

This is opinion, not fact. Fact is that most fans like instant replay, and that challenges add an extra element into the game that most fans like.

One can 'bash' any idea he does not like.  One can have a phobia follow just about anything they are afraid of.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","the email I just sent to this guy: 

Mr. Gleason, 

In your opinion column of Jan 31 you ask, ""which document is more important, the bible or the constitution?"" The constitution. Let's see why. 

1. The constitution was written during the Enlightenment, by our great intellectual forefathers who were well traveled, well-read, and who had studied at universities. The bible is a bronze-age anthology of the rantings of a barely literate set of feudal tribes in the Middle East. 

2. The constitution was written by men who believed in liberty.  The bible not only discourages liberty, it openly supports slavery. The Old Testament encourages slavery throughout, and the New Testament further condones it.

3. The constitution was adapted from the political philosophies of Locke and other great scholars--it's the culmination of hundreds, if not thousands of years of academic work concerning liberty and the role of the government. The bible consists mostly of revelation and hearsay. That's right, hearsay. Neither Saul nor the authors of the gospels had either seen or heard Jesus. 

4. The bible is misogynist. Women are considered nothing more than the property of their husbands. That's in both the Old and New testaments. To make matters worse, there are wacky laws like the one that says that a man cannot touch a woman if she has been menstruating in the past five days. The constitution, on the other hand, has amendments that guarantee the rights of women. Sure, we didn't get them until the 1920's but at least they're there. The most religious nations in the world point to their holy texts to justify the subjugation of women. In America I'd like to think we're a little better than that. 

5. The bible wants gay people dead. What's horrifying is how the bible often gets its way in this respect. Consider the case of Alan Turing, the father of modern computer science, who broke the Enigma codes that won WWII for the us. As a gay man, he was indicted for sodomy under an old theocratic law in the UK and ate an apple he had injected with cyanide rather rather than face certain rape, humiliation and death after such a conviction. What kind of a world do we live in where backwards religious laws make one of our best scientists think he has no other way out? The bible is a homophobic document and should have no place in our modern world if we at all value tolerance and education.  

6. Do you remember a time in human history when the bible was considered the most important text? That's right, the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages were the most backward, illiterate, disease-ridden, fear-driven, guilt-laden time in the history of our entire western civilization, as a direct result of religious (specifically Christian) zealotry. They dismissed the great scientific traditions of the Greeks and Romans in favor of the bible, and our civilization took the better part of a millennium to recover from it. There are those who would have this happen in the United States. Thankfully, we have our constitution to protect us from these religious fanatics. 

7. Do we have any contemporary societies where the government has chosen a holy book as its most important document? Well, let's see. Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan under the Taliban, just to name a few. How do you think it's working out for them? The person who said this best was perhaps our founding father Thomas Jefferson: in an 1813 letter to Alexander von Humboldt: ""History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes.""

8. The bible may, as you say, hate religious pluralism. It openly endorses the murder of apostates and the genocide of groups who belong to other religions. The crusades are but one set of actual historical instances in which these tenets were carried out. Take the Children's Crusade, for instance, where tens of thousands of children either died or were sold into slavery, believing themselves ""Christian soldiers."" This is even an apocryphal story compared with the numbers of people who died in the Crusades. I'd like to think that humanity is past this now. 

9. The bible has a geocentric cosmology. That means the people who wrote the bible thought the sun revolved around the earth. Galileo was imprisoned for saying otherwise, and it's only recently that the church was able to admit their defeat in this matter. The bible also implies that the world is flat and that all the world's great biodiversity could fit on one ship. If you want to say that this is all a metaphor, then you pose an even greater question: what do you choose interpret as metaphor and what do you choose to interpret as law?  

The bible is a disgusting, immoral, work of fiction and we should not let it anywhere near our government. Our government is meant to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. Suggesting that we base our legislature on some supernatural nonsense written 2,000 years ago is an insult to who we are and what we stand for. 

My suggestion to you is, before you go off writing opinion pieces that suggest putting America back into the Dark Ages, I suggest you actually read the bible cover-to-cover. While there are some poetic passages there that religious people are fond of quoting out-of-context, I think you'll find that overall it's violent, perverted, genocidal, xenophobic, and it reeks of its bronze-age origins. To any moral person it is an insult to moral behavior. If, as you suggest, legislators ""turned to the bible"" before making or approving bills, we would still have slavery, women wouldn't have the right to vote, and we'd stone to death anyone who lit a cigarette on a Sunday. But maybe I'm giving you too much credit here. Maybe this is what you want for America. ","1233515894"

So, subtract what you would have eaten instead from the beef you are eating, and that is a more realistic picture of what your actually costing the planet in gas emissions.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I agree it's absurd, cause as far as I'm concerned, genetics also plays a part in this. Scientists already discovered psychopaths and sociopaths have certain physical deficiencies in the brain causing them to lack empathy.

 This will affect what we perceive to be their morals. Although we don't know enough about processes in the brain, I suspect some human morality to be geneticly based in addition to what we learn by socializing.

If you're truly altruistic in the pure naturalistic sense I doubt you could be called very ruthless, cause what's good for you is also good for people around you and vice versa. If you cheat and steal from others, it's not going to be good for you once they return the favor.
