People tend to take fields of study a bit *too* seriously and it sort of makes them close off their mind to considering possibilities and theories, no matter how seemingly insane while at the cost of suffering mental strain from feeling 'attacked' whenever the topic they're studying is made fun of.

Studying quantum physics and theorycrafting can be fun. It engages the creative parts of our brains, which in addition to cooperation and trial and error, leads to a lot of breakthrough discoveries. Cooperation is humanity's best tool, defense, and weapon.

You see this over-defensiveness with any fanbase or cult. People **have** to distance themselves from their theories or beliefs or we get really unhealthy discourse, which I'm sure doesn't lead to proper progress.",1630454400

However, you might want to try ""light"" bdsm and see if you like it better. You said you were turned on by the idea, but the reality is too much. I am really into light bdsm and here's what my gf and I do:

I tend to be the dom, but I don't only humiliate/degrade her, I also care for her in a dominant way during sex (""you just don't know any better, don't worry, I can teach you"" or ""this is your first time, huh? I'll take care of you"") along with maybe a hair pull or a slap.

Instead of real choking, I just grab her by the neck without cutting off her airflow. 

For breath play, we don't push the limit of her air, I only cover her mouth and nose for about 20 seconds or less.

When I tie her up, I make sure she is comfortable so that she has the feeling of being unable to move but not the discomfort associated.

Things like that. The idea of bdsm without all of the harshness. Now I do things that are harsh, like slaps or spanks, but it's not everything we do, and I don't ever leave bruises or draw blood or anything.

Go ahead and take Johnston County off the table, seriously.

In 2012, Johnston County Schools performed academically in the top one-third of schools districts in North Carolina. As of 2019 we rank in the bottom third of the state.

Johnston County is bad: https://ncreports.ondemand.sas.com/src/district?district=510LEA&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;lng=en

‚ÄúJohnston County has 45 public schools, and over the two-year reporting period of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, 21 of those schools have borderline or failing scores of 56% or below, with 17 solidly in the failing category. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/best-way-out-about-16891210)

Why did they post anything in the first place? They wanted to be honest with the community what their concerns were and why the information isn't there this week.

Those concerns also *are* a lot more legitimate than people want to believe. There is a big new change now in that they can potentially figure out every new alt on a Special Heroes banner. That information is gonna spread. And some companies *do* respond harshly to leaks like that. Hell, Ensemble Stars fans weren't even leaking anything, just getting transparent images from internal data, but for some reason the producers didn't like that and started more heavily encrypting everything so it's harder to get any images.

And why did they make the new thread? Because literally everyone in the first thread was begging for information. They realised they had something they could share that wasn't based on that datamined information, and shared it.

I really don't think they've acted badly at all. If they seemed to be asking for opinions and now are ignoring them, well frankly a lot of people were extremely rude so I kinda don't blame them for not wanting to follow that advice.

I hate to say it but it sort of feels like a lot of people on this sub are taking them for granted, and feel entitled to this new information they've never even received before, and are taking it out on banpei-kun by assuming bad faith in an totally unwarranted way.",1630454402

I'm not a physicist, but I think they can. I recall reading that the physical laws break down very close to the plank time. 

&gt; If not, doesn't that assume order and not chaos? 

Good question. I don't know. I can imagine arguments on both sides of that. 

&gt; If so, that begs the question of who or what established that order?

Just because there's a perceived order doesn't automatically mean there was a ""who"" or ""what"" that established the order. For all we know, the order we see may actually be the only possible order of things.",1630454402

These are the same officials that threatened to resign when Trump was pressuring the FDA for EUA approval. Now they have over the booster plan which has little to no data to back it up beyond Israel's skyrocketing case count a month into their booster distribution.

&gt; On Tuesday, two top FDA vaccine regulators resigned ‚Äî a decision that one former official said was rooted in anger over the agency‚Äôs lack of autonomy in the booster planning so far. A current health official said the pair, Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, left over differences with FDA‚Äôs top vaccine official Peter Marks. Now the agency is facing a potential mutiny among its staff and outside vaccine advisers, several of whom feel cut out of key decisions and who view the plan to offer boosters to all adults as premature and unnecessary.

Hopefully more officials will resign over this vain attempt by the current administration to not follow the science.",1630454402

They're not the Brotherhood, they don't pick a strategic location and send forces out from it, they're all over the Commonwealth and have to be in a position to move around quickly. Even the Castle, as impressive as it is from a defensive standpoint, is more important due to the fact that it's the hub of communication for the Minutemen, and the main source of their radio signals.

&gt; At the very beginning, there is one about an American man who loses the ends of two of his fingers in an accident with an electric saw. He did not have insurance. The man must choose between having his middle finger reattached for $60,000, or his ring finger for $12,000. The man chooses his ring finger. How can a man be put into the position of making that choice?
&gt; 
&gt; JOANNE SILBERNER: [In the U.S.,] the hospital doesn't have to give him care unless it's lifesaving care, and his life wasn't threatened by the loss of two digits. So the hospital was within its rights to say, ""We can reattach your two digits, but it's going to cost you."" The irony is that if he had insurance, the insurance company would have paid far less than $12,000 or $60,000. The insurers can negotiate rates with hospitals that individuals can't.",1630454404

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","&gt;If you can‚Äôt see how important league MVP is, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

I am not saying season MVP is not important. Here is an example. Without googling it, who was the best objective player for the NFL for the 2020 season? Hint: It was not Tom Brady the Super Bowl MVP, which is the only accolade that most people remember from that season well also NVP for different reasons. Just incase you don't feel like googling, it was Lamar Jackson.

&gt;If you think $5,000 is a ‚Äúreward‚Äù for being league MVP, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

It doesn't matter what you or I think, it was the reward for season MVP. And Just to repeat what I have said the past two comments (maybe you didn't see it the first time because I edited it in before reddit showed you replied). I do think the prize should be higher, just not as high as champs MVP because it is not as prestigious.

&gt;If you think Activision doesn‚Äôt have the money to pay decently for high caliber awards, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you

I never said that. I just said that they have other responsibilities. I am sure they will reassess that in the next season. maybe.

&gt;Yes, CDL is bad in more than a few ways and it‚Äôs not unreasonable to reward season MVP just like Champs MVP. If that‚Äôs controversial, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

Its not controversial, its just not a very equivalent accolade IMO. It doesn't matter how good a player is unless they win champs, this is comp cod fan basics.  I agree with you that the CDL is not the greatest but they are only in y2. Im sure that the NFL, NBA, NHL, and so on and so forth were not perfect y2 of their franchised leagues but the point is that there is room to grow. When they do, prizes will increase.

The way the data is collected is assured to skew older though, to be honest. I‚Äôve seen, for example a drive by after hours be counted as a school shooting because a stray round broke a window at the school. Just trying to cull through some data to find something meaningful, it looks like it may be split about 50/50, but that‚Äôs literally five minutes of looking.

This topic is very important to me as I for about a year now have been ‚Äúsemi-vegan‚Äù. My thought process is that if I think hurting/killing animals is wrong, then I should conclude eating them is wrong. But what if there is meat to eat, of which I was not involved in the process of killing? In this case is should be ethically fine to eat. So if my neighbor doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a vegan and gives me a gift which is food dish with meat, I should have no ethical problems eating it, as long as I inform them for the future. But if I go out and buy meat, then I‚Äôm supporting the industry that‚Äôs doing the un-ethical thing, killing, so it is unethical of me to monetarily support them. 

But then it gets even more complicated. What if I buy an impossible whopper from Burger King? I‚Äôm not buying meat, but I am giving money to a company that does thrive off of unethical killing. So is it unethical to eat at Burger King at all? Further if I go to a store that offers meat, I am supporting the store that supports the meat industry, so should I shop at exclusively vegan markets to be ethical?

On the other hand a practical approach might say you SHOULD buy vegan options at non vegan markets to make it more financially attractive for companies to move away from meat and to substitutes, therefor decreasing overall harm to animals as markets move away from it.

Further more, what about products that have animal products, but they are a very small part. Let‚Äôs say a snack food company, that the basis of their food is vegan but maybe there is small bit of animal product for flavoring. If I buy their product, I am supporting them, and they are only a tiny bit supporting animal harm as it‚Äôs a very small part of their ingredients. At this point is there enough degrees of separation to make it ethical to eat even if you think harm to animals is unethical?

These are all things I have no solid answer on but need to read more about ethics to try and come to a conclusion. Do the people you linked go into this kind of ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù of separation from ‚Äúevil‚Äù and trade offs like my problem deals with?",1630454406

It also has the best handwriting recognition of any app bar none (Notability uses their engine too), so I've often been able to copy out entire handwritten pages and insert them into a Google Doc as formatted text (complete with bullets and heading styles) without having to correct most of the transcription.

There is no debating the fact that Nike and Adidas have a greater sway over the league and the refs than UA. And part of that sway extends to players getting superstar calls and getting more protection. And not getting ticky tacky bullshit being called on them on defence. That's not the case with Curry though

 I would say this for the headshot, they would have headshot you either way as hip fire is still effective either with 1 or 2 guns. I dont get killed by them all that often and usually it a 2 or 3 tap.

They do faster rof to throw at you but then you bought 2 and/or are using quatermaster which was a investment. 

Im on console so maybe its different on pc.

I would argue that maybe they should remove the extra zoom for duals or reduce it but also in general they should increase the base hipfire accuracy for all guns.

My point being the controls kinda suck on console and the hipfire for rifles and handguns are necessary for closer range engagements but the bullets usually dont hit even with a hunter dead in the box",1630454408

"chess","t5_2qhr7","But that's irrelevant to human and computer play when your opponent has a ~(1/n)**r chance of finding the best move where n is the average number of moves your opponent has per turn and r is the total number of turns till the perfect game is completed. 

And by that point you no longer have a ""better"" or worse ""worse"" position. You only have a winning or losing position (assuming in a best play scenario you avoid all lines that allow your opponent to make a draw, the alternative being that winning simply becomes the ability to draw with black against white, again making another assumption that the tempo actually matters)... And here we get to an ever bigger challenge than whether you are only ever playing the best move move... Are you even able to play a move that ends the game? That is, bar the 100 move rule or similar, are there ways to play till infinity.. or better yet, is chess solvable? I'm not that into game theory but I imagine someone has tried to prove chess is winnable. And if it is winnable, are you ever playing a game where you can make a worse move if already in a losing position. 


I think all of that is best summed up by saying: sure semantically you may be right, but you don't even know the logical outcomes of the game of chess, so how can you make statements that are so absolute yet make multiple assumptions about the local nature of chess and get annoyed when someone finds your comment quite unhelpful?

"Kaylemains","t5_39pk1","As someone who recently started playing Kayle a lot, I haven‚Äôt had much experience on pre-work version and barely remember what she was like.

She is really fun to play because of how rewarding late-game can be. And if you actually manage to sneak in some kill participation early/mid game and come online sooner than usual, it‚Äôs absolutely amazing.

That said, she is not in a good place and doesn‚Äôt fit well into the current meta where the popular champs have high damage, mobility and make it very difficult to keep the game going long enough to have a chance to scale.

If I had to make a change, they should give her a small buff to base stats so that her early game isn‚Äôt so ridiculously bad.  The argument for me here is that basically every champion in top lane has to respect big minion waves when the enemy builds up a slow push - except for Kayle. She is so weak that many opponents can fight you in your wave and just win, and this really shouldn‚Äôt be possible if you have ult and a full health bar. Managing waves is critical to success  on any champion and if the enemy zones you off of a big wave and freezes because she can‚Äôt even fight in her own big wave, that‚Äôs just sad.

Her late game is great but she still has vulnerability - she‚Äôs still squishy and can get focused down quickly. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt feel like her late game power is in balance with her pre-11 (and first item) power. She‚Äôs basically a cannon minion pre-6, and half a champion pre-11, and only feels good 16+. Games often end before you reach 16. And you aren‚Äôt strong enough to 1v5 if ur losing and if you‚Äôre winning, you don‚Äôt have much time to actually enjoy your late power spike before gg",1630454409

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","&gt; but your DM

Anytime we are discussing something RAW or theory-crafting, the DM is irrelevant. A DM can override ANY rule. A DM can decide that daggers are overloaded with traits and can't be thrown, a DM can decide that fireball is OP and halves the damage. At that point it's not worth discussing anything about DnD because a DM somewhere can object to any ruling, which isn't a great foundation for debate. The question is ""is this RAW?"" not ""Will my DM allow it?""

&gt;a) letting you enchant something as tiny as a grain of sand in the first place as an ""object"" (worth noting that the DMG specifically says terrain is not an object - and they could easily argue it has to be at least big enough for the ""mouth"" to appear),

A grain of sand is an object; I'm not trying to enchant a beach. There aren't any size limitations as to what an object is or isnt. We're talking visible to the naked eye, I think that's a fair assumption for an object. 

&gt;b) letting you make an earpiece of such fine and perfect construction they somehow never fall out (with medieval manufacturing methods),

It's a box you tie behind your ear, I'd be amazed if a medieval society that has steel hasn't figured out how to create a sealed hollow box and some twine. 

&gt;c) it has to be one circumstance (so you'd actually need 16 grains in your example, 8 for armed and 8 for invisible),

That's actually not true. As per the spell:

&gt; The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. 

As detailed means that logic operators like AND, OR, NOT, etc. all work AS LONG AS all the trigger has a singular output. I.e. it can't tell you if it's armed or if it's invisible, only that something is there. 

&gt;d) it has to be a ""visual or audible"" condition, so if their weapons are concealed or they're invisible and sneaking (which, why wouldn't you if you're not already in combat) the DM could easily say it isn't detected, etc.

In fairness, this is the cheesy part, and deals with how DND handles Invisibility and perception. As per the DMG:

&gt;Invisible - An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a Special sense. For the Purpose of Hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature‚Äôs Location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature‚Äôs Attack rolls have advantage.

As such, being invisible doesn't render you undetectable, and magic mouth effectively has unlimited perception. It doesn't ""attempt"" to perceive, it simply does. A better description of this ""build"":

&gt;The Earpiece

&gt;This is actually not an advanced system, but rather even more simple than all of the above, yet occupies this section since it ties into many of the advanced systems, and has a practical in-game use. We've talked about how the spell has ""unlimited perception"", since it is a magical enchantment, much like ""Detect Magic"" ( An effect ) or ""Symbol"" and so on. As long as something is an audible or visual condition that occurred within 30 feet, it can trigger the enchantment, all other factors aside. This means that in a 30 feet radius, the Magic Mouth enchantment has much higher sensitivity to audible and visual stimuli than you, or any other creature for that matter, does.

&gt;Therefore, it is worth to simply attach one, such as an earring or tiny ""Earpiece"" to your ear, which can be triggered by a circumstance as general or as detailed as you'd like, to give you some kind of whisper whenever a visual or audible phenomena that occurs within 30 feet ( And being on your ear, that means within 30 feet of you ) which either corresponds to some general disturbance, or to some acoustic change in the subtle sound waves of the air ( Almost like passive sonar ), and so on. Much like the spell's example ""When a silver bell rings"", since it can be as general or as detailed as you want, you could do something like ""Whenever a creature makes a sound"" or ""Whenever a non-humanoid's body is visibly moving"" and so forth, allowing you to know whenever so much as a tiny spider skitters nearby. You could of course, also make the earpiece a capsule, each microchip with a different trigger and whispered output depending on what it detects, if one was not enough for various easons.

&gt;In fact, setting circumstances based on sound waves or air frequency/movement differences would effectively grant it's wielder a vague ""Blindsight"" ( Knowing when even an invisible creature has entered the Mouth's 30 feet radius, yet not exactly where, although that can be changed ), as per the description of ""Blindsight"" about heightened senses, creatures such as bats ( Although the enchantment is passive rather than active ), and so forth, but some might deem this incredibly cheesy. If not, feel free to enchant 12 Microchips, corresponding to clockwise directions, with each one triggered only if the disruption came from a certain clockwise direction, and gives off a message corresponding to it's number. So for instance, ""6"" only triggers by an audible/visual circumstance to the direct south relative to it's visual position ( Which is inside the earpiece, same as all the others ), and then constantly repeats the message ""6"" in the ear of the person by it's trigger.

&gt;As soon as the hidden creature changes position, say to 8 clockwise, then ""6"" stops repeating because it's trigger is no longer occurring, while ""7"" instantly triggers followed immediately by ""8"". This is one example of how to utilize containers.

&gt;Actually on second look, I'm overcomplicating things, the spell description examples themselves say that the spell is ""smart"" enough to to do something like trigger whenever any creature moves within it's range, just as a fact.",1630454409

Even in your analogy of a willing participant. It would still be unethical to force them to remain. Circumstances can change. 

What if I'm initially willingly hooked up to you, but now my own son develops a similar condition. If I don't disconnect from you and connect to him, he will die.

Would I still be forced to remain connected? Fine, maybe you're not a serial killer, but what if you're just a bad person that I didn't learn until after I was already connected?

Most take just enough of them to test positive on their urines, but sell most of them to buy more heroin. So just pushing more out there isn't going to help a whole lot. It's not like a magical potion, but rather a tool that has to be used the correct way. There's already enough out there that the price around Mass and Cass has dropped to $5 or even lower.

"btd6","t5_3k11a","It really depends on a lot of factors. First, the level of the Glaive Dominus. For raw power, nothing even comes close (save for maybe the MAD) to the Glave Dominus (even at lower levels) + Sun Temple (even with little to no sacrifices) + Anti-Bloon combination, but since one or two shots from any one of these would kill me, power is superfluous for survival. The potency of the towers with abilties is also up for interpretation, since it isn't stated whether their abilties are active from the start or they need to charge. It also isn't stated whether they can move or not (The former being more realistic for their builds since legs grant movement and the latter being more accurate to the game.)

If this is based solely on in game game mechanics, then I would Special Poperations + Sun Temple + Anti Bloon.

The Special Poperations will help me flee very quickly, the Sun Temple to shield me from most projectiles (and the Pirate Lord's ability), and the Anti-Bloon to instantly defeat anybody who isn't the MAD (*maybe* Brickell, the Dominus, and the Carpet of Spikes would survive as well) Plus, the Temple and Anti-Bloon are insanely powerful.

If I can hide inside the temple, then swap the Special Poperations with the Glaive Dominus or MAD (the latter would be nigh unstoppable with the ability.)

At the end of the day, not having any one of the MAD, Anti-Bloon, Glaive Dominus, or Sun Temple makes this nigh impossible to win. 

Final answer: MAD, Sun Temple, and Anti-Bloon.",1630454413

If I were to take a stab at a ranking on broad strokes, Vader is 1st by some distance, Luke is probably 2nd, then the rest of the top 5 would be some combination of Anakin, Kylo, Grievous, Palpatine. Han and Iden would be right after them, and then from there it's a free for all.

At the end of the day, viability depends things like on playstyle, skill, teammates, opposition, map in addition to base stats, so these lists always tend to feel awkward as a result.

"therewasanattempt","t5_39ne7","It's ironic how they use what they consider ""liberal"" protest slogans, but on inane bullshit instead of something important. Like how they use ""I can't breathe"" because they don't like masks, when the original use for that slogan was to protest against police intentionally murdering unarmed civilians. It really goes to show how pointless right wing protests are. On one hand you have systematic murder and abuse of a group of people for centuries, and on the other hand you have a mask which can get a bit uncomfortable.",1630454413

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;Out of curiosity, were you using control panel for something that was literally unavailable in the Settings app? Or did you just prefer the control panel interface (either due to familiarity or genuinely superior design)?

I need to be able to check sample rates of audio devices on the input and output side of things under windows device settings, it's not something most people have to worry about.  I can't seem to find it in Settings if it is there.  In general almost every tab for sound settings in Settings has it's own control panel pop out window to the right, and in every case there are more options in the control panel settings.  

I guess that's all sort of the same problem, trying to translate control panel to Settings.  

Thanks for replying, really.  It's insightful and helps ease some of my frustrations.  

I'm pretty much done here, but I was kind of curious as to why MS hasn't decided to try and make a version of the OS for professional users such as myself.  In my line of work, things have to simply work without hiccups, no questions asked.  At the moment most of our windows machines are dedicated entirely to powerpoints and slide shows.... Because that's all we can trust them to due to windows.  Many of us long for the day when we won't have to deal with getting a hold of LTSC just to be confident that our machine is not going to cause interruptions.  I think it's a huge hole that MS has just completely missed.  If they did come out a version similar to LTSC but more easily accessible (Maybe still make it annoying to get but nothing like it is now), windows would start dominating my industry over night.",1630454413

And if you love carbs, you‚Äôre not gonna like this answer but hear me out :)

Veggies. 

Yes, ugh. I know. But listen, I promise you, you can adapt and actually fall in love with veggies you didn‚Äôt suspect would sweep you off your feet üòÇ

Start simple: salad ü•ó, and my go to: oven baked veggies. Just slap the veggies in a plate or tray with olive oil and seasoning and send that to the oven for 20min. Works with asparagus, cauliflower, Eggplant, Zucchinis. Doesn‚Äôt take long to prepare and you can go do something else while they cook (don‚Äôt forget the timer!).

And then, depending on what meat you eat or not, eat that with a steak, fish (simple white fish or salmon steaks you can also prepare in the oven), or just eggs (omelette, sunny side ups).

Some ideas to get you started, of recipes you can check out that are just chef kiss and easy to make:


- [Zucchini lasagna](https://youtu.be/WDQgTlEnZ2c) (I make this all the time, it‚Äôs delicious and so filling!)
- [Cauliflower Tots](https://youtu.be/pEIXcadXmzo) (this channel is bomb by the way)
- [Cauliflower Mac and Cheese](https://youtu.be/UF70LJNeLKU) - not pasta but just as delicious
- Stuffed pepper bells](https://youtu.be/P71Xb0yL60w)

And look, you don‚Äôt need to go cold turkey right away. Take it easy. Start by lowering how often you eat carbs. Or have a ‚Äúno carbs day‚Äù per week and work your way up to carbs being the extra of your week, rather than the main.",1630454414

I decided to start watching the show after getting [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P4_E3GhUv8&amp;ab_channel=Encryptedprinter) recommended on YouTube (Some spoilers for season 4 if you don't mind) and feeling like someone had plucked my thoughts out of my mind and put them on screen.

I was already in therapy when I started watching the show so I was open to honest introspection and working to change myself for the better and the show was very relatable and sometimes uncomfortable to watch (even though half the cast are cartoony talking animals) but it helped me to work through some stuff. It even helped me to forgive myself for the shitty things I've done in the past and helped me see a way to get out of the crushing guilt I felt about basically every meaningful relationship I had up to that point.

Not everyone will be able to relate for the show or like the humour and that's fine, but if you can get through season 1 and you like it, I really recommend it. The show really helped me a lot.",1630454414

For porn, don't believe the people who say that you're either nofap or a degenerate. Porn and masturbation have existed forever and they're healthy, both psychologically and to prevent prostate cancer. Watch porn while you're jerking off, but not outside of that context. To get yourself to that point, stop streaming porn and start downloading it. Download 2 videos per week, and don't jerk off to anything but those two videos for the whole week. Nutting more than once to the same porn will be a big step towards breaking your addiction, and you won't want to be watching these same 2 videos all the time while you're not jerking off.

You both have jobs: you‚Äôve got housework+studies and he‚Äôs got his job, but somehow you‚Äôre the one who also has to deal with something as distracting and routine-breaking as a child, and that child is his as much as it is yours. Unless the money he makes at his job is enough to hire a full-time nanny so you can focus on your house-work and studies, he should be helping out with the kid sometimes once he gets back from work so that you can catch up with your leisure plans as well.

To me this sounds like the guy isn‚Äôt seeing things from your perspective the way he should. I had an issue with seeing other people‚Äôs side of things once. It took one session with a therapist to set me straight. It wasn‚Äôt regular therapy though. I learned later that there is a term for that kind of therapy in English, but I can‚Äôt quite remember what it was. Something like ‚Äúresult oriented therapy?‚Äù. It basically means that the therapist focuses on what‚Äôs bothering you here and know, without going into the deep roots of your issues.

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","If a seller is referencing goodwill, they are trying to get you to buy something that feels like value.  Goodwill is an accounting remainder and is quantifiable.  It is an important amount to consider for accounting. 

Conceptually, goodwill is the value of the company over and above its recognizable assets.  In an acquisition, one would determine an enterprise value. ‚ÄúHow much will I pay for this?‚Äù  You could use comparable sales, discounted cash flow, or use your gut.  If you‚Äôre paying $1mm for a company, that is your purchase price. 

Now assign a value to all of the assets.  Accounts receivable, inventory, vehicles-equipment-buildings, trademarks, etc.  if the market value of the assets is less than the purchase price, you have goodwill.

Why do you have goodwill?  Because the company is worth more intact, making money as it stands at acquisition than it is to sell all of the assets.  How do we know this?  Because we used discounted cash flows as our valuation method.  If I am willing to pay more for the complete company than it‚Äôs assets are worth, there is goodwill.  

It is not true that you should pay more because of ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù.

Edit: in your case it appears they are referencing previously recorded goodwill. This should not be used as a basis of valuing current operations.  Generally, you should be looking at operating assets and excluding anything non operating.",1630454416

It's not only the time constraints and the relearning of the rules that makes it hit my table less and less nowadays, though, it's that I am tired of running the same scenario over and over. It's a similar complaint, in my view, as Gloomhaven's ""kill all monsters"" scenarios. Variety is nice. Yes, the game won't play the same, but that's not the variety that I'm looking for in this epic crawl.",1630454417

You will be defaulted into L2065 fund (or another age appropriate fund).  L2065 is the fancy name for the TSP‚Äôs target date funds. Make sure you set your contributions to 5% the first chance you get.  You wont get the full 5% matching for a couple of years, but better to have it set now and get used to that contribution than have to increase later on.    

There‚Äôs a lot of hate for the L (Lifecycle) funds because they have been pretty conservative historically, although that has changed in the past year.  Nonetheless, my recommendation would be to stay in the L2065 fund (99% stocks currently, so definitely not conservative) until you learn a bit more about investing and your own personal risk tolerances.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","I agree with everything you have written, and also believe that I've been misunderstood.  I was replying to fairly common concept that is trotted out on Reddit which basically states that we should be keeping antivax people out of the hospitals.  My response was probably poorly written, but I'll try to do better here the second time:

My desired outcome is more about convincing (forcing, scaring) people who are antivax into getting the vaccine.  As you point out with the 46% vaccination rate in Texas, this targeted group is huge.  Just to put some ballpark figures together, if TX pop is 30M, then our target is changing the behaviour of approximately 16M people.  

The 'small minority' of people I refer to in my post is people needing hospitalization, so directly affecting the immediate families of people who are 1) not vaccinated, 2) catch covid, 3) get severe enough symptoms to need hospitalization.  Even if we include affecting immediate families, this number is large, but a very small percentage of our targeted 16M people.  We probably count a number of directly affected people in the low six figures (~14k concurrent covid hospitalizations + their families)

So my point is that even if we could do something super convincing at the point of hospitalization, the numbers are tiny (~1%) in comparison to the 16M people we actually want to reconsider their decision to remain unvaccinated.

The idea of cancelling medical insurance policies for the unvaccinated really has little to do with who pays in the end, although I confusingly commented on that in my post.  What I was really trying to get at was that:

1)  This would target the majority of the 16 Million people in our targeted group of unvaccinated people.  The number of uninsured in TX is shockingly high at 20%, but that still leaves 80% of 16M people who would receive the influence of the 'argument' (around 12.8M people).  This would have roughly 100x the reach of anything done at the hospital and would also influence people before they get sick.  Some of these people are surely too far down the rabbit hole to change their minds, but if 10% of them took up the vaccination to preserve their current levels of medical insurance that could prevent tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths.

2)  The method should make some sort of convoluted sense to the sorts of people who have been championing the rights of businesses for the last decade.  Insurance is based on actuarial tables, hospitalization in the US is widely understood to be very expensive, and vaccinations are an excellent (mathematically as well as biologically) way to prevent those expensive treatments.  I have no idea how insurance companies are handling the pandemic, but I suspect that the actuarial tables would show that remaining unvaccinated during a delta covid pandemic is approximately as risky as being an alcoholic diabetic smoking lumberjack who skydives on the weekend and should probably be insured (and priced) accordingly.

Pull out the left then right one. Hold them close together. Watch the LEDs they should flash blue simultaneously. Then go solid for a short moment. Then there left bud should flash red/blue.  

If you put them in your ears to sync it seems to not work as they use a really low power signal to do so.

"JustNoTruth","t5_zx25p","I think once you have kids you have to be their guardian and protector and you're saying they don't respect your boundaries and that you can't often stop them doing things. 

I feel like you may try and put boundaries in place, no kisses, etc, but they'll just break through it anyway. 

I think you should tell them they can't come. At some stage you need to put that foot down, if they're coming from a place with cases, and you know they don't care about exposing themselves to it and they refuse to show proof of vaccination (which doesn't stop them being a carrier by the way and getting you guys sick), then you need to protect your household first and foremost. 

You've got vulnerable people there. 

And I'm sorry to hear about your depression, and obviously wishing for the respect and relationship with your parents they're not giving! That sucks ass. Perhaps you can try and think of something they would like. Promise weekly Facebook calls to catch up with the kids, they don't have to be long calls! (I only suggest this if you think they'll turn up anyway, if you can ""compromise"" to keep them away, that's still a good step for you in saying no to them if you don't feel you can!)

ETA: if it was just you and mimi (is that a grandparent?), And Mimi was happy to risk their health, then maybe it'd be different. But you got kids too, and they don't have a choice, and maybe kids are least likely to have issues but that's not always the case and long term side effects can still be an issue.",1630454420

"koreanrock","t5_35br3","I listened to Once and for All by Bursters, which was submitted by u/shadowva1905. Hmm, it was alright. The first I'd say 3 or so songs were absolute bangers. It started with a symphonic-sounding intro but then the symphonic stuff didn't return, which I would've liked personally, it could be integrated really well into rock music but eh it's fine. It was more metal than I first thought, but as a metal head I definitely welcomed that lol. My main disappointment with this album is that the lyrics are not in Korean. Correct me if I'm wrong in this but the only Korean I heard throughout the entire album was in the title track for a few lines. I think if you do K-Rock it should be in Korean or at least partially. I love listening to music from foreign languages so this was a huge missed opportunity for me. I also felt like the album had some kind of an identity crisis as though they didn't know whether to make it a rock or a metalcore album. After the first 3 songs the album's style changes drastically and it falls more in line with what I imagined rock would sound like. (That I personally preferred the more metal parts is a personal opinion :P) There is definitely a way to blend rock with metal, I mean it's not super hard since they're so close but here I felt like they were just a bit confused. It also sounded like the production of the album wasn't stellar. Maybe it was just me, or my headphones or Spotify, but it sounded screechy to me. I already said I liked the first 3 songs (overall my favourite one was Hero, it's just so heavy unfff). I also liked a few others after that but my enjoyment went down a little, those early songs were really strong, but there were a few good ones later on. They had some cool melodies. My least favourite was Dreamer II. I liked the first one, but on the second it seemed like the vocalist was struggling with the song so it didn't quite sound right. Well it kinda sounds like I had a lot of negative things to say but I want to emphasize that I didn't think it was a bad album, it just had flaws in my personal opinion, but I enjoyed some of it at least.

Songs I particularly liked: Smell the Rot, Barriers, Hero, Dreamer, Here I Am

Songs I wasn't crazy about: Dreamer II

I just want to quickly mention that I've created a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6UeVmURYhWyOVcT6yawRM3?si=664ec6d902dd4ac5) for this project, where I've added all of the albums I've so far listened to.

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 35 letters.**

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Also remember that when He refers to His little ones, or children, because it is the Eternal Word, it has a mysterious plasticity in its application to the reader. By this I mean that He's speaking across time and His warning will have relevance to all human hearts. 

For example, if Jesus is speaking as God, then we are all His children, and the context is not confined to actual human children, but rather to the broader reality of those who have heard Jesus's teaching, accepted it, and through Baptism become ""sons and daughters"" of the Father. 

So it would be appropriate to see that Jesus is speaking with a depth of affection towards all His followers when He refers to His ""children"" and anyone who leads His followers into sin - especially through hypocrisy, neglect, or scandal - are going to have a very harsh punishment awaiting them. I believe this could be any person, but especially, Jesus is warning His priests - who are His representatives - and who are entrusted with leading souls to heaven. History has shown His warning to be greatly applicable to this scenario.",1630454421

In reality no one actually cares if you're weird, I see weird people all the time and think nothing of them, I don't know them and probably won't ever see them again so who cares.

Tony seemed to be on good terms with all of the Lupertazzi higher ups other than Phil. And since Phil would've been in the can while Tony was still coming up, it wouldn't have hindered him too much.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","Men's brains are wired to be stimulated visually. That's why we like porn. Women are wired for auditory, I believe. It's been many a year since science class. I'm definite on the men part, because it's obvious to me, being male. Either way, women's imaginations are 'typically' more developed than a man's. Hence, why women tend to lean more towards written erotica, instead. 

I, however, like all of it because I'm a masturbation slut. I like porn, I like erotica, I'll imagine past girlfriends, or even my wife! And she comes from a long line of women that enjoy erotica, but she's recently found out that she enjoys watching porn with me! So, nothing is iron-clad 100%.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Sorry your argument for standing is way to [sic] arbitrary.

how?  legal standing is defined by ""In law, standing or *locus standi* is a condition that a party seeking a legal remedy must show they have, by demonstrating to the court, sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case.""

in other words, ""prove that you're being hurt by this law or GTFO.""  prior to 2010, i could not sue the state i lived in that their same sex marriage ban was unconstitutional.  why?  i wasn't being actively harmed by that law, as i am in a heterosexual marriage.  i also can't sue against the state speed limit laws, because i'm not being harmed by them.

but if my state passed a law that says ""women under 5'5"" are not allowed to buy alcohol without their husbands present"", i could sue because that harms me... a) it's discriminatory, b) it impedes my ability to engage in commerce.  

&gt;If babies of a certain age are protected. Standing could be argued for any citizen.

as things stand right now, a baby does not have rights of its own until it is born.  there is no ""pre-born citizen"" status, though many have been trying for YEARS to get personhood defined as starting at conception rather than live birth.  this is also why any murder charges do not apply to abortion *prior to* viability, which is still medically considered to be 24 weeks gestation.

&gt;The only reason it seems to me they wrote the law this way is to once again protect the woman.

fuck that shit.  the laws against abortion that *actually* protect women are centered around forcing a woman to have an abortion against her will.  they are certainly not in limiting her ability to get a legal and safe one if she chooses to do so.  

every person has the constitutionally-protected right to bodily autonomy.  it means you cannot be forced to go through any medical procedure or process without your consent.  it even applies after you're dead, in that a doctor cannot harvest your organs for transplant unless you have consented to be an organ donor.   so you cannot force a woman to go through a pregnancy without her consent, as that would remove her bodily autonomy.",1630454422

Like she'd take the car into the mechanic's and tell them what was wrong with it, and they'd start in with ""little lady"" then try to tell her what all needed fixing, and she'd give 'em an earful.  This was 60 odd YEARS ago when it was much more difficult to be an assertive woman.  I'd hate for all that she fought for, and my mother (and all the other women back then to current) to get driven back because of some silly old gender stereotype nonsense.  Women have to be equals on stuff, or women's rights ultimately will get shoved backwards.  So silly things like who proposes to who, is one of those things that needs to be a whatevs thing.   Like it being normal for people to ask ""so who proposed to whom?"" as a question vs what people do now and always asking the guy ""how'd you pop the question?"".

But yeah, I don't see any issue with me being the one proposed to.  I also never expected when got married for my wife to take my name either, in fact was against it.  It worked out much differently than expected because she did, but that was her decision and we talked through it.",1630454422

The mil knew EXACTLY what she was doing, she would have to be very stupid to not realize it. She just trained the wife to put up with her behaviour so she is used to getting away with it.
  
It's even worse if the wife voiced his concerns to her. She knowingly pushed him to a breaking point and then played the victim when he finally lost it. The fact that she continued laughing after being asked not to is a clear indication of her attitude. Anyone with a modicum of respect would have removed themselves from OPs presence if they couldn't stop laughing, as to not agravante them ...she continued to do it to their face.  
  
She deserved to be told to STFU and should have her bags packed and a cab called to take to the airport/train station.

If your son took you out for lunch for your birthday and your wife were upset about this, she'd be the AH.

However, your son brought food to HER house to cook and enjoy WITHOUT her. This may seem unimportant, but this is the key element to the story. By excluding her in her own home your son disrespected her big time. It matters not if she was at work in this case. 

This whole thing is either a power play or a blatant lack of manners on your son's part. You choose. 

But, honestly, it's pretty obvious to anyone with a smidgen of social intellect that it is not okay to not bring treats for every person in the household. Plain good manners, man. We are a social species, sharing a meal ‚Äî or being excluded from one ‚Äî is of utmost importance, it communicates so much more than just enjoying a ridiculously priced piece of meat.

T4 helm stats are significantly better than T5 helm, and the set bonus in T5 is pretty rubbish. T4 is filtered out in the above image but its weighted score is 181.3  vs 150.3 for T5. However that may change once crit is factored in, I suspect they would at best be roughly on par.

Title: **How tough are medical negligence cases to prove?**

Original Post: 

&gt; It‚Äôs something my family is thinking about and looking into.
&gt; 
&gt; Last week my dad went in to the hospital to get a procedure done. Everything went seemingly fine and he was sent home. For a few days he has to wear a catheter. Things are fine. He goes back to the hospital to finally have it removed. That same day, he starts to have trouble going to the restroom. Come nighttime, he can‚Äôt use the restroom at all. Nothing is coming out. He doesn‚Äôt sleep because he‚Äôs getting up all night to go and use the restroom, with no success. Finally, in the morning he wakes up in an excruciating amount of pain along with a pretty bad fever, so we have to rush him to the ER. He‚Äôs being treated with regards to his urinary tract problems. Takes about a day or two before he can start using the restroom normally again. But after some testing, they find he has something unusual in his blood.
&gt; 
&gt; It‚Äôs a fungal infection. Candida somehow managed to make its way into his bloodstream. So now they‚Äôre treating him for that because he keeps getting a fever. The doctors claim to not have any idea how a fungus could‚Äôve made it into his blood. Two of my siblings are nurses and say that candida in the blood almost always happens in hospitals due to negligence.
&gt; 
&gt; So right now we just have suspicions because my dad is still in the hospital. We don‚Äôt know if what he got is malpractice or negligence or if it‚Äôs even something worth looking into more thoroughly. But based off of circumstances, it really seems like something is not right here. We‚Äôre not sure if we should start looking into an attorney, or if it‚Äôs even worth doing so if this will get quickly dropped.

It's a good theme you've got because you should be able to come up with a few scenarios, each with a few sections of progression that ramp up tension/drama. Friends and connections are an aspect of life that has a lot of material to work with, seeing's how everyone needs to feel like they have a purpose, and the easiest way to know you have a purpose is someone proves it to you.

In this case, the antagonist is going to make the protagonist learn that ""no man is an island"" and ""we all need to reach out from time to time."" Can you imagine scenarios based on these two sentiments? How losing friends might make your protagonist appreciate how temporary relationships are?

It seems like the judgement you‚Äôre wanting here depends on us believing your hints that the man who told you off might have also let your dog go, which you have no proof of and honestly seems super unlikely. All you know for certain is he was walking his dog near where yours was tied up, he didn‚Äôt help you get your dog back (consider that he still had his dog to worry about and if it did spook your dog it‚Äôs presence might not help in the recovery efforts), and he told you off for leaving your dog outside alone in public, which he was kinda right about. People respond really differently to being yelled at in public so I wouldn‚Äôt put much stock in him getting defensive as ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","As far as the mechanic goes:  


Dannig and Tujen are the best. Their currency and reroll currency is actually fairly valuable. Gwennen's... Isn't bad, but significantly less valuable. Rog... Honestly I don't think anyone out there is really ""farming"" rog by buying currency. Personally I don't sell any of the currency, Tujen has blessed me with multiple exalts this league, Dannig has given me a ton of reroll currency and logbooks, overall I think I'm net positive from rolling stuff myself compared to selling the currency but haven't been keeping track. If you don't like gambling or just need some currency to start off tho, it's probably better to sell everything.  


So, what does this mean? Dannig and Tujen mechanics are *almost* always worth doing. Sometimes, on a specific map layout everything will be so far spread out it won't really be worth it, but most of the time they're worth doing. Gwennen I'd only do if it's a good layout where you can get a ton of monsters / nodes / chests grouped together. Rog I almost always skip.

There is one exception; if you see a logbook drop node and a bunch of runic monster markers. The logbooks are extremely valuable, 20-40 chaos if you sell them and honestly significantly more if you keep them and actually run 'em. I'd do the mechanic if you see one of these, no matter which expedition NPC it belongs to.

As far as the logbooks go - Don't forget you can use blessed orbs (to roll the implicit values) and alch/scours to get more loot.

Also remember that the nodes stack additively and in order - If you hit one node per explosion, the first explosion will have bonuses from the first node, the second will have bonuses from the first two, third first three, etc... So if you find a logbook drop rate node you probably want to hit it first so that way you get the improved drop rate for the entire encounter and not just the last few explosions. Also be *very careful* while doing logbooks. It's possible to make monsters almost immune to damage without actually giving them immunity - A few times I've had 90% chaos res + 90% chance to dodge spells + 100% immunity to curses that made clearing a logbook an absolute pain.",1630454428

We obtained a papered, German imported shepherd that had fantastic bloodlines and was a stellar match for our young female a few months ago. We had high hopes that they would be the start to a high quality GSD kennel, which has always been a dream of ours. One vet visit quashed those hopes for this male, as he has a grade 1 heart murmur that was not disclosed to us. Unfortunately this means that we will be unable to breed our female to him, as we will not propagate any genetic defect. As a responsible breeder, your focus should be health first.",1630454428

"predaddit","t5_2t9z7","Yay!!!! Congratulations! I'm the nervous lady so I'm hoping I can have some advice. Very similar story but we lost our first baby at 12 weeks, currently 27 weeks with our rainbow baby. Honestly, there isn't much to do in the first trimester other than ride the waves of good and positive feelings. For me, switching to an OB that would do frequent (within reason) ultrasounds was huge. If I was super concerned for some reason, they would check on the baby. Also they tested my HCG often in the early days to make sure it was still going up how they wanted but at a certain point it starts to plateau and the fact that it didn't exactly double made me really anxious so it's a double edged sword. 
Also the book ""expecting better"" by Emily Oster is amazing. She just breaks down different studies and uses very specific evidence to address topics like eating lunch meat, or having caffeine, and also topics like miscarriage fears in a way that made me way less stressed about every little thing I'm doing. I actually have two copies for some reason and I'd be happy to send you one of them if you want to private message me. 
Finally, I participated in a study by Stonybrook University called the Calm Mom study and it is still ongoing so she could sign up if interested. It consisted of 8 or 9 weekly Skype sessions in a small group of pregnant women that focused on activating your bodies relaxation responses, recognizing stress responses, and very approachable meditation. I could also just forward you some of the material if she doesn't feel like participating in the whole thing.
One of the tough things is that sometimes the worry is unwarranted but other times intuition is right so it's a fine line between brushing off silly thoughts and taking them seriously sometimes too. Oh, also I ordered a Doppler off of Amazon, the Sonoline B, and watched some videos on how to find the heartbeat. In the beginning it was really hard to use and only my husband could find the heartbeat and it would take like ten minutes. Which felt like an hour while I'm laying there. But once baby got bigger and it got easier and we got better at it it became less stressful. It's not for everyone but appointments are sooo far apart in the beginning so I'm glad I had it. There were a couple of times it made a lot of my worrying disappear. I was good at limiting my use and I would say if your partner would be prone to trying to use it every day then maybe it's not ideal. Good luck and feel free to ask any more specific questions if there is anything I can help with! You're already a great support just by caring enough to make this post!",1630454429

It strikes me as an absolutely no win situation. Yes, the world is watching, and we are the leader (or so we're told) of the 'free world', but we were not upholding our most basic tenets of involving ourselves only at the behest of the host nation.
 (Side note: yes, there's nuance with this)
The US trained and equipped the afghan army for so long, some men who would now be fighting the war weren't even born when it began. That infrastructure, training, and support lasted just over a month because there wasn't enough interest in it for the afghan army. There just wasn't going to be enough buy-in from the Afghans for their to be success in democracy. Maybe it's cultural? Maybe it's religious? Who knows? But the fact remains, we just were never going to have a solid exit plan that was great for all parties. We needed to pull the Band-Aid; we needed to honor our word to the Taliban and Afghan leaders we committed to in 2020, and we needed to stop putting our troops in harm's way for an unwinnable cause.

Despite how it may seem, I'm not an isolationist. I'm a combat trained veteran who would rather let other countries have autonomy over their choice of government instead of sending our troops into other countries over military industrialization. I do feel awful for those that are stuck there and cannot get out. And we have an obligation as a country to help them out of Afghanistan if they want. But it's not our country, it's theirs.

From a water use perspective it's actually better for the environment to drink milk than almond milk imported from places that are literally on fire. My reason is that for me personally it is not necessary to harm and kill animals for milk, meat, leather, wool, eggs etc. This is the third time I say this so maybe you should try and read my entire comment.

Land use and emissions are other reasons which are valid and I never said they weren't. My only point was that water consumption is very dependant on the location, so it's not a good point to use if you are trying to convince someone to give up the milk.",1630454430

Eh, kinda.

[Schenck v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States), aka original recipe 1st Amendment held that the state had certain rights to suppress free speech.  Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote the decision, was certainly American and immortalized in Bloom County to boot.

[Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) is the First Amendment we've recognized for the last 50-odd years.  It introduced the concept of a ""marketplace of ideas"".  The justices felt (correctly for the time I'd add) that most people who spewed nonsense were marginal players in the marketplace.  They felt, also correctly at the time, that the heavy-handed remedies which *Schenck* and subsequent rulings permitted were prone to abuse, and that it was probably better to shrug and ignore kooks than to use state power to crush them.

It flies in the face of logic and reeks of motivated reasoning for any other interpretation.

Im also against hinduism.

My concern is that 20 people here left hinduism for a religion which promotes killing and abuse of women on such a scale even today.

People have the right to choose but this page promotes u to leave hinduism.
At least it should be an idea that those people who leave do not join a tyrannical cult like islam.

But i think in general after reading lot of comments here, im seeing a trend of people who are muslim and support islam, who came here to just bash hinduism.

Walls of text cause me SEVERE eyestrain, which can trigger migraines. No fanfiction is worth actual injury or illness! Most of the time when I see walls of text, I just say, ""Fuck you, I'm not reading any of your stuff,"" and move on. But it's a rare ship. Written in just the way I want.

"gurps","t5_2s3if","a) is correct,   


but remember a 150 point character with 0 disadvantages can be more useful than a 200 point character with -50 points in disadvantages depending on how you play, which advantages/disadvantages you get, and your party/GM.  Ultimately, try not to maximize your points, try to build the character you want.  If the character had a rough childhood, take ""Poor"" and put the points you gained into ""Streetwise"" or ""Observation"" or something useful as a skill they may have learned - don't just put all your points into eye-lasers unless that's the kind of campaign your GM is building lol  


I like to focus on Disadvantages that I know I can play in character / part of a character without crippling the game, but if you have a good GM it's fun to give them something they can use to make the story better too.  A common one is a Rival or an Enemy, or ""Weirdness Magnet"" if you want to be brave hahahaa.   


Disadvantages can be great *plot hooks* too, where you get some 'extra' points for starting your character off with a major handicap, and throughout the campaign you can work to 'buying off' those disadvantages through hard work, magic, technology, self-improvement or lucky situations.  One of my favourite characters I played recently more or less bought off -45 points of crippling head-trauma by healing and finding magic items to assist in becoming whole and healthy again.  At the end of the campaign I think he had like...-3 points worth of quirks and was more or less just a really nice, capable man who would do anything for his friends in a pinch.  Oh, he could fix airships and shoot void-aliens out of the sky at 300 yards away with almost perfect accuracy too, so don't think he was boring haha.",1630454435

I am a non-binary trans guy who hasn‚Äôt transitioned yet / pre T everything but I came out at work as going by he &amp; they pronouns and dress in grown men‚Äôs clothing (not masc-women‚Äôs, or boys) full time. I‚Äôm lucky to work at a space for writers, everyone was pretty used to it and adopted it. I‚Äôve had no pushback though I haven‚Äôt transitioned at all.

For me. Social transitioning first and only allowed me to try it on. I did get to experience that people still make gendered assumptions about me ‚Äî but those assumptions are *right* much more of the time. The response to me FEELS good. Nope, great. I realized that the first time a higher up complimented me after a meeting by saying ‚ÄúHey man! That was awesome! Up high!‚Äù 

Never in my life, as a closeted AFAB ‚Äúgender fluid,‚Äù did I get that response at work. It‚Äôd be a totally different flattery‚Ä¶ ‚Äúoh you were so well spoken, that was so nice of you in there.‚Äù Not a bad compliment, it just didn‚Äôt hit me as deep as ‚Äúdude that was cool.‚Äù Something about the latter made my Me-ness feel included, like I belonged. Truly.

If you want that experience, you may just have to go out and get it.

I want to concur with the commenters story. Even I cannot avoid this ‚Äî I have thought many times of living as a cis girl, even a cis lesbian. As I add up the decisions I‚Äôd make on that path, it leads to ‚Äúcold hearted alcoholic lawyer‚Äù every time. I wouldn‚Äôt be interested in love as much as money, because once I‚Äôm living ‚Äúas a woman‚Äù (I could never do it, im just not one, but let‚Äôs say I played along because I already have that paperwork),for the sake of the convenience / avoiding being trans, like, things like love and art and happiness wouldn‚Äôt mean anything to me.

But when I think, hey, I want love and art and happiness more than money‚Ä¶ I only see a life of me as a man. A quirky non-binary five foot two Ted lasso sort of a bloke ‚Äî but, I love him. I love who I will be. Im getting around to falling in love with him, who I will be, as I get to know him. 

And im mourning the girl I never was too. It‚Äôs all a process.

I came here really to see if there was an alternative but this comment reminded me the alternative is a new attitude and perspective.

For some of us at least! Take it or leave it, no worries. This life is YOURS No matter what.",1630454436

This also includes requests for research participants and any self-promotion/donation 
links    

* No memes or infographics link posts unless it's Friday

* No ""why did my bipolar SO/coworker/ex/parent/staff/boss do this?"" type posts. Short

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","I lost about $3.5k on GME this year. Bought it for over $300 and sold for $60. In March 2020 I panic sold at the start of the market crash (stocks) and saved myself a huge loss. Then once it bottomed out I thought it was going to keep going down and shorted the market and took those losses anyway and then some. Don't know the exact number, but it was over $10k. In January 2018 I got into crypto for the first time when BTC was peaking at $14k. I went absolutely ham and kept putting money in way faster than I should have and knew nothing about what I was buying. I ignored BTC except to trade it for alts. Eventually it crashes and I gave up. I didn't sell at the time, but I was down more than $5k. In the middle of 2020 I decided to convert my holdings to BTC and send it to an online casino. It only amounted to a couple hundred bucks and I lost it in a few days. The only crypto I kept from that time is NANO and I'm still down on that.",1630454438

Besides the comments on the angle and the dildo stuff,  her right leg just goes off away from the picture frame and disappears making her feel incomplete and leaving the spectator imagining what the rest of the leg is doing or even if there's one, that just so happens with her left arm, it does feel like she's chilling and laying on the pic frame but at the same time you just severed part of her arm. Now this is not a bad thing at all, in the end it all depends on what your intentions for your portrait are and I'm just a stranger on Reddit who's sharing a bit of stuff I've been thought in the many years I've been studying and practicing portraits. still there's  no ""All-Knowing Truth"" to photography and no one should lessen your work nor you should you feel bad about anything you do, this is a never ending art with never ending learning and we're all here to help and support each other!

I did talk with a coffee shop worker that is almost opposite the door used as Ted's apartment entrance, and apparently they only got customers between takes as the alley is closed.

Alternate Plan:

Gently tap the outer bowl with a hammer . . .  etc.

A better plan: Put the bowls in very hot water in the sink. Then pour ice into the inner bowl. The outer bowl will expand and the inner bowl will contract enough to separate them. If that doesn't work, see the first plan. You'll need a hammer.",1630454438
"steroids","t5_2rifm","&gt;nausea that starts halfway through my training 

THANK FUCK. I have not seen someone else experience this and ended up dropping down drugs just to be safe. 

If you‚Äôre anything like me, that will last months. I think I‚Äôm finally at the point where I can really push myself in a workout without feeling like I‚Äôm gonna throw up, but it‚Äôs been a while. My best advice is to keep it **really** slow for at least a month. Light cardio, lighter weights, maybe 2 sets/body part max. Believe me, I think I puked after like 3 or 4 workouts where I wasn‚Äôt even going that hard. 

Don‚Äôt eat or drink anything but water within ~90mins of working out. It helps a lot. I used to be able to slam food and then preworkout and lift without an issue. That fucking changed lol, but I‚Äôm back closer to normal finally 

However, I will say that it might have been more optimal to just completely rest for a couple more weeks. With how long this affected me, I really think that it‚Äôs better to just have lighter workouts, but I can‚Äôt definitively say that it would have lasted this long if I just sat on my ass a couple weeks.",1630454438

Shadowy figures sit before me on a raised platform like a multiple judge court.  And what is the UN seal doing here?*

YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR SUSPICION OF WAR CRIMES AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF ANTS.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

""Bullshit.""

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

""There is nothing *to* understand.  Your statements are ridiculous from first to last.

""There is no empire of the ants.

""I have not engaged in war with any nation, so I cannot have committed any war crimes.

""*You* on the other hand, have committed a series of crimes at several levels.  Including, but not limited to:

1) No due process.

2) Illegal detainment.

3) Kidnapping.

4) Usurpation of the police and judicial powers of the United States government.

5) Violations of United States Federal and State law are too numerous to list.

""Do **You** understand?""

YOU ARE IN ERROR. THE UNITED NATIONS IS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY.  NATIONAL LAWS ARE SUBORDINATE TO THE UN.

""Excuse me?  Would you be so kind as to tell me what recreational drugs you have been using?  You will understand that I am attempting to grant you the benefit of the doubt.  The only other explanation is that you are irretrievably insane.""

*There's something odd about that backlit judicial bench.  It's... fuzzy.  Something else, too, a smell.  That's the ant bomb I used.*

*Now I'm insane, but the evidence of my senses tells me I'm in my basement.*

*A wisp of a breeze, and the entire court waves in the draft.  Back projection is right!  That seasonal light projector!*

""You have committed several fatal errors.  You failed to understand the nature of human government, such as it is.  You invaded my home.  You resorted to illegal acts to accuse me of crimes, that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, are at best a joke.

""But you have also committed two other crimes, far more serious than any others.""

AND THOSE ARE?

""You could have approached me for assistance. Before invading my home.  I might have taken serious effort to convince, and it still could have ended up badly, but at least you would not have accused me of crimes for defending my home against a persistent pest.  That would have left open the possibility of friendly contact.  That path is no longer open.""

AND THE SECOND CRIME?

""Abject stupidity.  This *podium* you have placed before me, is the safe cabinet for toxic household chemicals... Including the last of the ant bombs.  I suggest you evacuate at once.""

*snap, pffffftttttt*

RAID!

""Don't bother coming back.  I'll be calling a professional exterminator.""

### Epilogue

The carnage is ghastly.  Despite our best efforts to cofferdam the tunnels affected, we are being pushed back.  The human must have convinced those on either side to deploy the same horrendous measures.  We have our backs literally to the wall.  The retaining wall.

All attempts to tunnel under the wall have failed.  The water table is too high.  Now, the scouts report a disturbing action on the surface.  Humans have come with a grill that burns so hot it glows yellow.  The have placed some sort of metal in it, and are stirring it.  I fear this is the end.

""Hey, Jim?  I think this aluminium is hot enough now.""

""Ay?  Yes, it is.  Get your gloves and face shields on.  We're going to lift it out, set it on the bricks there, and switch to the pouring handle.

""That's right.  Let go.  Good.  Get the pouring handle.  Good.  Now Lift""

""This thing is heavy, Jim!  I think you got too much metal in it!""

""I am not taking a chance that these damned ants ever come back!""

""Dude?  You sound like you've got a personal grievance with *these* ants.""

""Maybe I do, Bill, and maybe I don't, but this best dies tonight.  Now steady does it, a stream, not a splash.  There we go.  That's it.  A little more... And we're empty with just the funnel at the top half way full.  Still think it was too much metal?""

""No, Jim.  But I'm sorta feeling sorry for the ants.  They had no idea this was coming.""

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

It is as I feared.  They have brought molten minerals to kill the last of us.  I have sent the others to the deepest tunnels, just above the water table.  Volunteers will crack the caissons allowing water to rise up the main tube.  We hope that will stop the molten attack.

But no.  The last message was nought but a scream of terror and a solid wave of red heat.  I can feel the molten rising beneath my feet.  I have little faith in the triple walls built around my chamber.

The heat becomes unbearable.  Let this record in crystal be our last stand and testimony.  We may have lost this battle, but there are far more of us than there are of them.

""We got it, professor!  We got it!  He didn't even charge us for it, but we have transfer of ownership papers, so we're good!""

""Wonderful!  Bring it right in!""

""Gonna need help with that part.  It's even bigger than the picture shows.""

""Just how big is it?""

""Eh.. You'd better come see for yourself.  The crane operator is asking where we want it put.""

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","So sex in porn is not realistic nor is it reality. I think it's been said enough times to have sunken in.

Porn is genuinely catered to men. That's why alot of women, myself included switch over to the gay men did of porn hub. Men can't particularly fake an orgasm and women like reality, they like passion and romance or just to know what they're watching isn't fake. I've found that watching a guy go at it solo is alot more intimate than watching a couple have sex. Try that instead of normal porn. If you need recommendations I can help there but just don't get sucked into the whole world revolving ""straight"" porn. It's just a shitty view of sex.",1630454439

I was approved for an increase on 7/27 and funded on 8/3. Out of the blue the LO asked me if Id like to use up all the 500k max. I took up their offer and signed the docusign on 8/24 and got the fund on 8/30. I didnt contact the congressman or did something specifically. I did receive a decline letter in June and I called sba to find out why. They said IRS blacklisted me on DO NOT PAY list. I found out that I didnt file Form 5500 correctly last year so I took care of that quickly then emailed PDC. No response I think I only sent 4 or 5 emails to pdc between 4/27 and 7/19. How did I get through I am not sure. Also I started making eidl loan payments to sba since May. It might helped my case to show I was serious paying sba back even I was literally broke.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","Honestly, communication from all governments &amp; health authorities were pretty awful in the early stages of the pandemic, and damaged a LOT of trust. Unfortunately, science is a process of correcting things along the way, and this isn't a great look when we're being asked to vaccinate/put things in our body. I don't think there's any way to undo this without giving yourself time to digest information. Also unfortunate, is that the very sources that are deemed credible are the ones that you feel are lacking transparency.

I absolutely hate the selfish label. Both sides are selfish in that everyone is looking for self preservation (and protection of your family). That line between self preservation and selfishness is pretty blurry. I don't think you're selfish in a malicious sense, wanting to be safe and protecting your family is a reasonable decision. Underlying all of this we're all just trying to protect each ourselves and loved ones. The fact you mention a wait and see and hope others vaccinate to reach herd immunity shows you aren't part of the wildly misinformed antivaccine crowds, and have a good sentiment towards vaccination in general. Both sides of this public health issue, whether you vaccinate or not, are guinea pigs testing different paths.

The caveat to the wait for others to get to herd immunity is that Delta has already shown it's not likely possible. Herd immunity requires non-viable hosts, which breakthrough infections kind of poke holes into it. The best we can hope for at this point is COVID will become tolerated + survivable, whether by survivors + vaccination, or the virus's future variants attenuate themselves to be contagious but less lethal (a dead host is a dead end for a virus). For the vaccinated or survivors, they can have an immune response quick enough to recognize COVID, or have some prepared response pathways against variants for the body to stamp out an infection, this speaks to vaccinated individuals having less serious/fatal incidents.  If you're emerging with an immune system that's blank slate against any form of COVID, it could be dangerous especially if you encounter Delta.

Either way, I hope we make it out of this alive, and I hope you find what you're looking for to make that decision for yourself and family.",1630454440

But then the heating cartridge in my 1st printer imploded, so I had to finally set up my 2nd one (I had been meaning to get 2 running simultaneously, but, lazy). So I'm just on a journey back to where I was with the 1st printer.   


Rafts are great for adhesion, but most of my prints are fine on their own because they're flat, wide, and short (eg, 3d prints of 2d logos). For those prints, my custom cura settings include -0.12mm initial layer expansion, and that's usually perfect for curing elephants foot and giving me smooth, dimensionally-accurate results.  


This is why I bought another ender 3 pro... rather than have different printers and have to learn somewhat different sets of potential problems, I can compare them literally side-by-side and try to figure out what's different, what's giving me the issues. But I guess every problem the 1st printer didn't have (like this), is something new I have to learn still.",1630454440

And they‚Äôve been given plenty of warning to arrange their affairs.  It‚Äôs not *your* fault they made assumptions, didn‚Äôt plan, and aren‚Äôt financially able to support themselves without you.  

And yes, you too get to have a say in where and with whom you live.  And wanting to live with your SO, and just your SO, is a reasonable thing to ask.  Not to mention that SO doesn‚Äôt HAVE to lose her covid bubble, so long as they practice the same caution in their household as you guys do in yours.  Your bubble can just exist over two separate domiciles, if everyone is willing.  

Furthermore, it‚Äôs just unfair to *expect* this same situation, where you‚Äôre paying a vastly disproportionate amount, to continue indefinitely and/or without your consent.  That should be a gift you freely *choose* to give (and you‚Äôve already generously given it for a whole year), not a requirement.

The most natural response is to get her away from him but it‚Äôs easier said than done. That‚Äôs what people usually say to victims of domestic violence (or any kind of abuse), the reason why victims has such a difficult time for that are probably because of emotional abuse, manipulation and so on.
Do you have her phone number or other ways to keep in touch with her?
Also some people doesn‚Äôt like to talk about it so directly either, perhaps start with a different topic and gradually try to open up the conversation.
A few suggested to give her the hotline informations, which I think is a great idea.

As for claw rush, it's the best ability in the game (aside from big deal) because it can devastate massive groups and has an extremely high recharge for how powerful it is.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","I've been on both sides, and both sides experience anxiety and dread. I've spent more time on the HL side, but I have spent time as a LL, mostly in a toxic relationship,  but more recently in my marriage.  After having kids I did not feel great about having a new body. We did have sex though and it was anxiety filled and it was a lot of me not climaxing I don't know if he felt that or not.  I experienced a lot of racing thoughts and could not mentally get into sex. My fat is jiggling. I wonder if I feel loose now. My boobs are saggy. Is he enjoying this as much as he did before? Racing thoughts that would not turn off. I dreaded sex but at the same time I kept going for it. He never pressured me, but I didn't want to get to the point where it had been a year. 

As the HL person I do feel a lot of anxiety about sex and how to approach it or how to ask. Am I asking too often? We just did it yesterday... hmmm maybe two days in a row? No that is too pushy. I'll just pleasure myself. No maybe he wants to. He kissed me earlier.... no. Does he think I'm crazy for wanting sex so much these days? Is this a phase? AM I a pervert? Women are not supposed to be this way. That is lot of racing thoughts too. I dread asking because rejection is really hurtful to me and it is something I work on a lot.

I think both people's feelings matter equally and there is no easy answer. If someone does not want to have sex it is not okay to force them. Obviously. That is called rape and even if it wasn't illegal, it is a violation of human rights. It is everyone's right to have sex only when they want to with who they want to if both parties consent. That matters. But then there is the other side of the coin,  and excluding a partner who is abusive or terrible in some way, that is a person who's feeling are also valid. The want to have intimacy via sex is a valid thing to want from a spouse. It is a human thing, and it hurts when both spouses are not on the same page. Much in the same way that it is not okay to aggressively seek sex from your partner in a way that feels bad or unsafe, it is wrong to make your spouse feel like a pervert for pursuing sex. That also goes for rejecting them in a way tha is putting them down, or their needs down. ""Gross get away from me!"" Both are super valid.

Your understanding of Christian theology and history seems very shallow. For one thing, Jesus didn't 'hijack' the Jewish religion: He never preached a word outside of its sacred scriptures, even though He attacked its authorities (like all Biblical prophets did). He's also believed to be God, so there's no second God in the equation (at least not an uncreated one; the technical meaning of 'god' is a lot more complex than people give it credit for. There's other gods, but there's not another God).",1630454444

Also, the Enigma is less than a year on the market so it's kind of unfair to compare it to everything else.  Indeed, Jon can't even make these things fast enough, so it's not like an agency is going to equip their people with them.

4 o'clock also has the advantage when blading away to keep the gun out of reach (Craig D. didn't even start carrying AIWB until quite recently, meaning his ECQC stuff worked quite well with behind the hip carry).

4 o'clock also MIGHT, depending on body position relative to attacker, allow for a more surreptitious draw.   AIWB might also.  I'd call that a push, since it really just depends on body position relative to the other person.  But it's certainly not an advantage for AIWB.

With a split front garment, 4 o'clock also allows for what I will call a more reliable (and probably faster) one-handed draw for most people.  

Finally, there is just the fact that AIWB doesn't conceal as well for some people, depending on body type.  It works great for me, but not for everyone.

There is no doubt some institutional inertia in some cases with hip/behind the hip carry, but my main mentor was in over EIGHTY gunfights.  EIGHTY.  Not eight.  Admittedly, some were using a carbine.  He carries behind the hip.  Clearly it's worked for him all these years, so at age 62, what are the advantages to him changing now????",1630454444

We get to the end and I bow back to him and he starts messaging me. Asking me how I'm finding the game and if I'm enjoying myself. I reply that I am and I thank him again for the Rez and he asks me if I have an antelope stag, I reply that I don't and he says he'll give me one. I thought that was pretty cool but even better was the motivation, he gave me the stag and said he loves to help sprouts and he thought my Bard would look great riding on the back of a stag. Super nice dude and he made my death that i was annoyed about feel so much better.

The small amounts didn't give me the euphoria I wanted, but I wouldn't up the dose cuz I still remember all too well how sick my 30 gpd was making me (critically dehydrated, terrible headaches, nausea, hair shedding like crazy, skin looked like shit).

"redscarepod","t5_hq6n1","Sorry, I guess I didn't make it clear enough (although I did mention it in the first sentence). The answer is indeed ""it's fun"". It's just plain hedonism. There are of course good things about being in a relationship, but personally I don't feel it's worth it. When I think back on my previous relationships, there are some memories I cherish but also so much pain and disappointment. Casual dating on the other hand is just a series of adventures and the novelty shows no signs of wearing off. That's my experience anyway, and I imagine some men feel the same way. One might say that's shallow, and it's probably true. It's OK - I don't feel like I need a gf to have hobbies, to create, or speaking more generally to have a rich inner life.

As to why women don't do the same, or don't do it for extended periods: well, I'm not really the kind of guy who theorizes about women, I just enjoy their company. But my guess is it's more nature than nurture in this case. What do you think?",1630454445

"Sourdough","t5_2s7wc","INSTRUCTIONS
1. Morning 1: FEED YOUR STARTER: Combine 20 grams (2 Tbsp) starter, 100 grams (2/3
cup) flour and 100 grams (1/2 cup) warm water in a small bowl. Stir ingredients together until a
smooth batter is formed. Pour into a pint jar, cover with a cloth secured by a rubber band. Compost
any remaining (unfed and previously refrigerated) starter.
a. To MAKE sourdough: Let your just-fed starter sit out at room temperature for 8-12
hours. Then proceed to Step 2.
b. To MAINTAIN your sourdough starter: Let your just-fed starter sit out at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, if possible. Replace cloth cover with a loose
lid and refrigerate. 
A note on STARTER FEEDING/ MAINTENANCE: Sourdough starters are hearty, but they do
require some care taking. If baking everyday, it‚Äôs best to leave your starter at room temperature
and feed it daily. If only baking once in a while, store it in the fridge and feed it regularly (once a
month will get the job done, however weekly feedings are ideal).
2. Evening 1: MIX YOUR LEAVEN: Combine 15 grams active starter, 40 grams warm water
and 40 grams whole wheat flour in a small bowl; mix until combined. Transfer mixture to a
container with a loose lid and refrigerate overnight.
REPLENISH YOUR STARTER: Although your starter was just fed, it has exhausted most
of its fuel (ie, flour) and should be fed again for maintenance. Measure out 20 grams (2 Tbsp)
starter and combine with 100 grams (2/3 cup) flour and 100 grams (1/2 cup) warm water in a
small bowl. Stir ingredients together until a smooth batter is formed. Pour into a pint jar, cover with
a cloth secured by a rubber band and let sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Replace cloth cover with a loose lid and refrigerate.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY REMAINING (185 GRAMS) ACTIVE STARTER?
A. Compost it!
B. Whip up a batch of English muffins (see recipe included)
C. Use your starter to prepare a delicious (and less time consuming) bake
 from some of our favorite books (see Resources). Examples include: pancakes,
biscuits, biscotti, hand pies, crackers, etc.
3. Morning 2: MIX YOUR SOURDOUGH: Combine 270 grams warm water and 95 grams
leaven in a large mixing bowl. Using your fingers, gently pull the leaven apart to dissolve in the
water. Add 320 grams bread flour plus 20 grams whole-wheat flour to the bowl. To mix, slide a
bread whisk (or your dominant hand) down the side of the bowl and upwards through the center of
the mixture in a scooping motion. Rotate the bowl slightly and repeat until all of your ingredients
are incorporated and the dough appears stretchy and aerated. Using a plastic bowl scraper, scrape
down the sides of the bowl, cover the top of the bowl with a towel, and leave in a warm place to
ferment for 60 minutes.
ADD SALT TO YOUR SOURDOUGH: Turn your dough out onto a lightly floured surface
such as a wooden counter or large cutting board. Sprinkle the surface of the dough with 1 ¬Ω
teaspoons fine sea salt. Now you are ready to perform your first fold.
FOLD #1: To prevent sticking, either flour or wet your hands before touching the dough.
Using the fingers and thumb of both hands, gently pull and stretch the bottom third of the dough up
and across the middle third, pressing down lightly to adhere. Then pull and stretch the top third of
the dough up and across the middle third and press down lightly to adhere. You have now
completed one ‚Äúenvelope turn.‚Äù Complete a second envelope turn by pulling, stretching and folding
the left third of the dough across the middle third of dough, followed by the right third; press down
lightly to adhere. Transfer your dough back to a large, lightly floured bowl; cover with a towel, and
leave in a warm place to proof for about 60 minutes (if temperatures are very warm in your home,
35-45 minutes).
FOLDS #2, #3 and #4: Perform a second, third and fourth fold as outlined above. After
each fold, transfer your dough back to a large, lightly floured bowl; cover with a towel, and leave in 
a warm place to proof for 60 minutes (if temperatures are very warm in your home, 35-45 minutes).
4. Afternoon 2: It‚Äôs time to shape your sourdough. This 2-step process takes advantage of the
dough‚Äôs elasticity (i.e., gluten) to build tension in the dough and give structure to your loaf. First, we
pre-shape the dough, allowing the dough to begin thinking about being a tight little loaf! Following a
short ‚Äúbench rest,‚Äù the dough is shaped for its final bake.
PRE-SHAPING: Turn your dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured
hands, gently pat your dough into a square, approximately 1-inch thick. Without overstretching your
dough, perform one TIGHT envelope turn (In other words, follow the same SOURDOUGH
FOLDING METHOD guidelines, however this time, eliminate the ‚Äústretching‚Äù step). Rotate your
dough 90 degrees and perform a second TIGHT envelope turn. Pinch your fingers down the length
of the dough to seal the seam. Flip your dough over, seam side down, cover with a towel, and let
rest for 30 minutes.
SHAPING: Uncover your dough and place, seam-side up, onto a newly floured surface.
Perform one more TIGHT envelope turn; rotate the dough so that short side of the dough sits
perpendicular to the table‚Äôs edge. Using the fingers and thumb of both hands, gently grab the short
side of the dough and roll up and away from you, down the length of dough. Seal the seam, flip the
dough over, and form a boule (meaning ‚Äúball‚Äù in French): Gently cup the dough‚Äôs far side with your
left and right hand, drag it towards you. Rotate the loaf 90 degrees and drag the dough towards
you again. Repeat this process until a smooth boule is formed. Gently place your boule into a
floured proofing basket, seam-side up (this will be the bottom of your loaf. If you are using a loaf
pan, place the dough seam side down into a lightly oiled pan. Cover with a towel and let rest and
ferment overnight in the refrigerator.
5. Morning 3: The next day your loaves will have grown about 20% in volume. Insert a rack into
the bottom third of the oven. Place your covered baker (La Cloche or Dutch oven) into a cold oven
and preheat to 475-500 degrees F for 30-45 minutes.
SLASH YOUR SOURDOUGH: Lightly sprinkle a small wooden cutting board or pizza peel
with semolina (wheat or rice flour work too). Remove your dough from the refrigerator and flip
upside-down onto the semolina (seam-side should be down). To slash the bread, hold the lame
blade flush with the surface of the dough; pull the blade from the top of the dough, towards you, in
one quick swoop. The secret to slashing is to slice deeply (3/4 ‚Äì 1 inch deep) and confidently.
Good slashing is important, as it allows the bread to expand as it bakes.
BAKE YOUR SOURDOUGH: Open the oven, remove the lid from your covered baker,
gently slide your loaf inside. Cover the baker with the lid and let bake, undisturbed, for 20 minutes.
Carefully remove the lid, reduce the heat by 25 degrees and bake for another 20-25 minutes. The
bread is done when the loaf is deep brown with a crusty opening in the middle where the bread has
been slashed. Remove the bread from the oven and place on a wire rack (or cold stovetop burner
grate) and let rest for a minimum of 30 minutes. DO not cut into the bread before it cools‚Äîyou will
be disappointed. There is still a lot of action happening inside of the bread when it comes out of the
oven. If you cut the loaf too soon, it will release steam and two things will happen: the bread will
not finish cooking and the bread will stale and dry out at an extremely rapid rate.
STORING YOUR SOURDOUGH
Freshly baked sourdough is always best on the first day, however you can extend the shelf life of
the bread by wrapping it in paper, a waxed bag or waxed cloth (Bee‚Äôs Wrap) and storing it at room
temperature. If you plan to freeze your bread, you want to do with as soon as possible (i.e, cut your
freshly baked loaf in half, keep half at room temperature and freeze the other half). The structure of 
the starch/gluten is altered during freezing, so it is recommended that you refresh your thawed/
sliced bread by warming it in the oven.",1630454446

"fo76","t5_jrw25","&gt;Instead of you know admitting fault, you‚Äôre actually going around downvoting people for pointing out these facts. It‚Äôs pathetic really.

My god... You're projection and lack of self awareness is painful.

Firstly the perk system in game doesn't hold a candle to PLM. To cut you off at the pass, I'm talking the perk system not the respeccing side. 

It's cute that you think that just because you don't feel the need to switch perks on the fly, it means that no one else does. I switch on the regular. Others do too.

Let's do you a solid and ignore the convenience of swapping perk loadouts on the fly for a moment. I don't need to purchase extra perk slots to use all of PLM's 12 slots. Pay nothing for 2 or pay nothing for 12. I wonder which is superior in this regard...

&gt;You‚Äôre also recommending several other mods that also have been integrated as well and are severely outdated.

Name these mods and functions that have been integrated and superseded in this game?

It's certainly not Improved Health Bars. There are no health bar graduations in-game.

Can't be Save Everything's ability to type in numbers instead of using the sliders. Even the option to not yeet items you care about is superior in the mod than in the game version. 

It can't be Event Notifications because that notifies you of ALL events as they pop up, not just public ones. 

Surely you don't mean Better Inventory? Please tell me it's this one. I really want you to do it. Show us how truly ignorant you are on the subject matter.",1630454446

I have bought every brand streamer over the years including the first Roku box as soon as it came out. I used to be solely a Roku household, but they have not kept up with the tech and really became focused on being a discount brand, so even their top devices feel underpowered. 

My Roku devices all transitioned to rarely used televisions like the kitchen or spare rooms. Even on my Ultra things just take so much longer to load, Youtube TV is instantaneous on the Apple TV and takes like 10 seconds to load on the Ultra. 

I still respect Roku for revolutionizing the industry and really being responsible for making streaming the preferred way to watch a lot of entertainment. I just wish in their quest to dominate the low cost options to get in to every home, they at least put out one device that really had top of the line tech and processing power, because no one has replicated the experience of private listening as good as they have.",1630454448

It's not like pistols in Fallout 4 which you could really do something with, especially with the right build. You're gimping yourself by default, going with pistols, so understand if you do that, that you're basically playing hard mode.



That said I haven't done stealth/bloodied pistols but that wasn't what I was looking for, I wanted gunslinger vaguely-facetanky and man, that is a nightmare to theorycraft and even worse to put into play. All your damage perks are in Agi... where all your other utility is going to be, for the most part, including sneak if you wanna go that direction. On the plus side, Tank Killer finally affects pistols as well as rifles so you get some armor pen from that.


Oh and let's not even get into VATS bugs, which I would hope have been fixed by now (lol) but the last time I played him seriously, he would enter VATS but the server, like... didn't register it? So I'd be firing away and getting zero hits even at 95% accuracy and the only way to actually hit anything was cancel VATS, re-enter it, or just hand pew-pew the mobs dead before I died myself.

No point in taking classes that make you miserable just to go into a job that makes you sad too. Your family and friends as a whole will be proud that you graduate in general, so engineer or not, getting good grades is important and to get good grades you need to take classes that interest you!

I know the opinion of your mom must matter a lot but you can still do a lot of great things with psychology. You can earn a lot of money too depending on how you apply your degree. (If you have the test scores and prereqs, you can become a lawyer or a doctor, really does not matter what your bachelors is). And ultimately, acquiring money is just a matter of time. Look into careers that you‚Äôd like to do with your psychology degree and showing your mom that it isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù as she thinks may help her! 

Especially in colorado, there are engineers around every corner because of Mine‚Äôs so it‚Äôs very competitive. Equally, I dated an engineer who graduated from an ivy with a masters in electrical and mechanical e. He was not making bank cuz he was still new to the field. So engineering ‚â† rich right out of the gate. In fact, a lot of my engineering friends had to move out of state for jobs because it was too competitive in CO. Maybe explaining that engineering is not a guarantee for money, jobs, or prestige will help your mom stop fixating on engineering.

"Wellington","t5_2s3eo","Vodafone can afford to waive that, under the circumstances, given that it was fraud. I have always hated Vodafone, they are useless and after years of frustration, I ditched them and switched to Skinny and have never had a problem there. You should contact a manager there to complain, the problem being, you can never get through to anyone and when you speak to the people in the call centre, they are untrained, unsupported and many of them are also thick as two planks. I use to work in debt collection and really, for something like this, a company would just write that debt off and not expect the victim to pay it, especially if the company is highly profitable. It might be different if this was someone you knew, like a flatmate or friend or relative, but a stranger doing it is a different scenario.

Get the complaint ID number from Police and a copy of your complaint, to prove to Vodafone you were the victim of a crime and tell them to wipe this debt and that you will not pay it. Also have you spoken to your insurance company about it? 

I feel awful about this as I have borrowed strangers phones at times for emergencies when I have left my phone at home, such as when I needed the AA. I just don't carry a phone on me at all times like other people. People trusted me and let me use their phone, so this is a terrible thing for that woman to do and so cheeky it's beyond belief. It means that people who need a phone in an emergency may not get the help they need from a stranger.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

It's only marginal energy consumption, but if sleep mode uses ~5 watts and you have it in sleep mode 18 hours a day for a year that's ~33 kWh, which would be about 7.5kg CO2 using UK grid, 13kg using US grid, etc. A piddlingly small amount per person per year, but it feels like something worth doing something about anyway? Mean CO2 per capita in UK is ~5780kg/yr, so that's a little over 0.1% of your annual emissions entirely from something which takes a couple seconds out of your day to do.

Obviously using UK grid numbers won't be representative per country, and emissions per capita also vary depending on location. So where USA has CO2 emissions of ~15.55 tonnes per capita, UK has ~5.78, India has ~1.91, DR Congo has ~0.08 etc. the difference would be proportionally bigger...

OK I'm rambling. The point is it is a tiny difference, but still a positive thing to do for the lowest-hanging of emission-reduction-fruit.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; 1- Reducing speed isn‚Äôt hard to comply with

By enforcement alone, it is. 

2- That‚Äôs a completely different issue because the timing of light changes is out of a drivers control. Speed isn‚Äôt.

It was an example. Another example would be the Furgeson DOJ report which found that targeting revenue generation on fines, including traffic violations, helped lead to make problems in how the police interacted with the community.

&gt; 3- You mentioned it not generating revenue. That has nothing to do with efforts to reduce traffic.

Then you need to spend a large sum of money on a police force watching for speeding when there are probably better uses for their time. It seems cheaper to bump out some curbs.

&gt; You‚Äôre just making up reasons now and they are very weak or unrelated. The fact is they are trying multiple ways to reduce traffic and this is one of them. You‚Äôre acting like a reduced speed limit will destroy the city.

I'm not saying a reduced speed limit will destroy a city, I'm just saying that it isn't the be all end all to it and that focusing on enforcement alone is going to have some negative consequences.",1630454452

"AllThingsTerran","t5_2tfht","What's very important is your grinding has to be quality grinding. Like for example, you should be playing some customs vs ai if you're struggling to get scv benchmarks down like 46 by 5:23. You should be seeing some progress and getting closer to that benchmark every attempt otherwise that grind is just a waste of time and burns you out. I know a very famous terran balance whiner around here and in att discord who has 30k+ games but 0 progress. He would just requeue and requeue, constantly grinding the game without being mindful of the advice given to him. He only recently started paying attention to the advice a bit and saw some progress. It seems like a lot but finding small victories like nailing scv benchmark or having x units at protoss 3rd at xyz time will keep you going.  

The gameplan will naturally come with time as long as you're thinking about the game. The reality is that terrans usually have 1-2 timing attacks (1-1 or 2-2) then it becomes freestyle. The gameplan becomes more reliant on army compositions and army/unit movements and possible enemy timings/cheese/counters and certain economy setups. The gameplans can be very detailed. They can include how you're going to micro using that comp vs xyz. Like vs pheonix colossi, I am just going to control click my marines, kite back and target pheonixes while my marauders fight colossi. Or they can be very broad like making biomine thor vs fast lair into mutas.

Like I said, as you improve you're going to know every single detail of the plan to play this game, big or small. It won't even feel like a plan at that point. Just natural reflexes.",1630454453

"MHOC","t5_31ykc","Madam Speaker,

I rise against this legislation even after the amendments, and I hope that members of the House shall understand my reasoning.

The appropriation of a department based on the GDP is quite stupid. GDP is a very flawed metric within its self. It is biased towards richer countries like ourselves, and doesn't account for environmental sustainability and general poverty in a country. No expenditure should be mandated to be based on the GDP of a country. It is misguided, and bad economic and fiscal practice to mandate it like this.

There is convention in Westminster systems to assign appropriations by law, like in Australia where appropriations have to be made by legislation to appropriate from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The UK historically does not have this, due to the UK not having a written constitution and appropriations historically being an executive privilege that the Chancellor of the Exchequer deals with. I would consider, with great interest, a proposal to have appropriations more approved by the legislature, as currently the transparency of payments is very non-existent, and the budget accuracy and reliability suffers because of it.

However, this is a question of mandating appropriations based on GDP, an already extremely criticised and flawed metric. The practice of appropriations via the proportion of GDP has not been done in countries that have legislative approval for appropriations, because it is simply absurd. I do support the strong maintenance of departments to ensure they can function well, but mandating funds based on GDP, especially for a department as controversial as *Defence* is a stretch. If Coalition!, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats wanted to maintain the funding of the defence force, then I would suggest they specify specific operations that need to be appropriated. This makes more sense, even if the functions specified are quite broad. I would then recommend they apply this to all other departments to create a more consistent and transparent expenditure system. Other than this, I shall be voting against this legislation.",1630454454

It might work for whatever fantasy land you want to live in but the real world doesn't work like that. Thoughts and prayers are meaningless, it's real-world factors that make things happen, hoping has nothing to do with any outcomes. 

Look at Kyle's original lawyer, he grifted millions of dollars from idiots like you who wanted to help Kyle with his legal fees, then he just up and quit and kept all the money because everyone who donated was either too stupid to read the fine print or too hopeful that it would never happen to them. Same thing with the loser president we had whom we just voted out of office, he grifted over 75M from overly hopefull, willfully ignorant people who would do anything to hold onto a false reality.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","You're right, I can only assume you are not over 244 years old.  Else you miiiight want to have Guinness World Records talk with you.

Considering I stated ""At no point in the US history"", you are now trying to pretend you are older than the US to 'get one up on me', which doesn't really work because all it does is make you sound facetious.  

I don't have to know much about what you have Seen and Done in life, to know history well enough to know you are making things up.  If you want to claim to be older than the entire United States, sure then, I will give it to you that maybe Sometime in history, people would do whatever it took to protect children (not sure when in history considering the worlds records to date but I don't know every time in history so its possible).  But my statement stands in the sense that at no point in the US history, was there ever a time when 'whatever it takes to protect the children' was a real thing outside of using it as a manipulation point.

Even if you somehow remember a small tiny portion of the US or world that did have that at some point in time during your life, it is unlikely that all the areas even in a single state had it, and since we are now on this thing called the internet that spans the entire world.... and the news that is being discussed is likely outside of your area you are in (I make a guess purely here), then your, likely faulty, memory of a single small area is not exactly relevant to the rest of the world at large.

Note also, that peoples memories of 'better times' is usually caused by the fact that we Forget things easily and store only bits and pieces.  The whole 'it was better when I was young' is a false reality minds create to handle our lives and choices we made.",1630454455

"NoahGetTheBoat","t5_117wt6","&gt;'Reduce to the extent practical'

Translated: 'reduce to the extent that it's convenient for my argument.'

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don‚Äôt need meat. Neither do you.

Just wrong. Meat has always been and always will be the best source of protein available to humans. Your way would have us scoffing down plants to the point of vitamin overdose, which can literally cause brain and nerve damage. Also, plants have no vitamin B-12.

Arguably, if humanity slowly weened ourselves off of meat, we could manage such a diet. But, in our current state, we absolutely do need meat. I also don't see that happening anyway, mainly because the way vegans such as yourself go about it is by shaming everyone who doesn't live the way you want them to and desperately trying to control everyone's lives.

Who'd of thought acting morally superior for being on a diet would make you less charismatic?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I buy the food I wish to at a supermarket. Are you homeless? Are you a substance farmer? Or do you buy your food at a supermarket too?

How the fuck does this weird-arse attempt at 'gotcha!' answer any of the questions the other guy just asked? He was on about lab meat because you're the one that fucking brought up lab meat, why are you acting like he's accused you of eating it?

Yes, he probably buys his food from a supermarket, whoopie, want a fucking cookie?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You‚Äôre asking what we would do if everyone stopped using animal products? Really you can‚Äôt figure it out? We would stop breeding them into existence

You're a moron. You literally just said this:

&gt;You‚Äôre talking about the billions of animals we breed into existence and kill a few months into their lives (perhaps years for wool lambs and female dairy cows) for food and clothing.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't even have to do the math. You could've read your own post and seen the flaw in your logic.

If we stop using animal products, we wouldn't have clothes, we wouldn't have meat, we wouldn't have dairy, we wouldn't have milk, cheese or eggs, we wouldn't have leather, we wouldn't have fur, I mean, for fuck's sake, how can you be this dense? Do you think humans are wood elves or something? Have some damn perspective, man!

We use animals for far too much to simply stop doing it now, and regardless of whether or not you think that's morally justifiable, that's the world you live in. Deal with it and stop trying to guilt others into making the unnecessary sacrifices you've made. If you're vegan because you simply don't like the idea of eating animals, or harm coming to them, then fine, but fuck off with pretending to be the second coming of Christ because you don't eat bacon.

Also, farm animals are sexually segregated and bred in controlled environments for a reason. If we allowed them to roam free, the local ecosystem would be overwhelmed and they'd overpopulate to the point of becoming fiercely territorial and aggressive, not just towards humans but to other animals, intruding into urban areas, eventually mass starvation as all the food is eaten and possibly even extinction in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And stop slitting the throats of sentient animals who feel pain. That‚Äôs what we would do.

Is that genuinely how you think every single animal that's killed for meat dies? Most of them are killed in a split-second by electric shocks, or shot and killed painlessly. You're dramatising the situation for the sake of your argument and I think you know it.

&gt;Try harder.

That's asking too much of him. No man can win an argument against a fool, especially not a fool who's convinced he's a genius.

&gt;Google cholesterol and heart disease.

This would be more of a slam-dunk if the argument you stuck in front of it wasn't so embarrassing.",1630454456

Sorry, what was I talking about again? Oh right, yeah I do get that the association can be a little cringe, but a lot of the comments here are outright angry at the comparison.

But you told her what you would do if she was firm on her decision to not have kids after two years of marriage, and apparently she agreed. So if she still has not changed her mind, well, it's time to do exactly what you said you would.

The MVS. This one is my carry on. Can‚Äôt break it. Verry tasteful hits, not bigass cloud but its really okay! The airflow control on that one is exceptional! The Hula. No airport so is literally the same feeling than smoking a joint! Not really tastfull but acceptable cloud and perform well with a waterpipe!

The BB9. I never tasted weed at all before i got this one. The vape is so dam smooth and the cloud you get is always bigger than the previous one. It have a 14mm waterpipe mouth piece witch is cool. Well made but that one will never quit my desk.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","Personally I think Catholicism is dangerous.  The history of abuse does not surprise me given the intense hierarchical nature and the way that the leadership lives a life that is so disconnected from the followers.

I'm a big believer in religion.  Maimonides said that it is better to be an idolater than an atheist but Catholicism seems awful.

Also Catholicism is based in Rome and was heavily associated with the Roman Empire.  The Romans destroyed the Temple, so I don't really like the Romans.

You did not write down your age, country, gender, and whether or not you live at home.  I am going to guess you are a male teenager living with his parents in the United States.  Tell me below if that is not the case.

This means a few things:

1. You only live for so long with your parents.  You will eventually leave.  That is when the real part of life begins.
2. The fact that you are living at home means that you are going to have to figure out where the lines are going to be drawn.  It's not your house but there are games you can play with your family.
3. Find other people to talk to about your interest in Judaism other than your parents!",1630454460

When luxury brands declined to provide products to Price in exchange for airtime (which remains standard practice), Richards allegedly had the prizing staff find such items at outlet stores. ‚ÄúWe started getting cease and desist letters from those companies. We were getting those left and right. Our department didn‚Äôt want to do that but this was his directive,‚Äù says one member of the prize department who was let go under Richards after 12 years on the show. Contestants, this source recalls, were upset that they were having to pay full retail price taxes on winnings for shoes that didn‚Äôt come directly from brands themselves and were sometimes the wrong size.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.

The arrival at the country, the tremendous August heat, it was very, very hot. So in the beginning, the first four months, were very tough. 

When I was beginning to adapt myself, than that tremendous cold came, with snow -- something I had never seen in my life. When I really realized was after 6 months, in February, close to the end of the season which would end in May. So it was a period of adaptation of 6 months that I thought it wasn't my moment, the team also in great financial difficulties, I stayed 4-5 months without being paid. 

But my willpower was bigger than that. I didn't think about leaving, but remember when talking to my agent Gilmar Rinaldi, that I'd only come back to Brazil when my cycle in Europe ended. I fulfilled that, this duty, and am very happy today for having conquered all of this in my life.",1630454462

It'd have to be a scandal of epic proportions to really dent the CPC. 

I think the blackface scandal with JT carried less weight for a few reasons:  
1) There were a lot of people who really wanted to like him.  
2) The scandal was from like 20 years prior  
3) He did apologize for it, and combined with the above, I think that was sufficient for the people who would then go on to vote for him.

(Which is to say they were back to contentedly voting for him rather than, say, holding their noses while voting for him)

I could very well be wrong. Its just my 2c really. But I do think O'Toole needs to be very vigilant regarding the public's perception of him.

"popheads","t5_39nwj","Ava Max! That girl is like a robot! I‚Äôm not trying to hate on her, but not a single one of her songs has any emotion conveyed. It just sounds like it was made to be played at a party and nothing else.

Ed Sheeran. Unpopular opinion, I like Ed Sheeran. He‚Äôs  definitely talented. However, his last two albums have felt less emotional. I think that‚Äôll change with = and I can‚Äôt deny that he can convey emotion, but he‚Äôs an artist that sounds better just sitting down with a guitar. I saw him in concert for his X tour and it was very enjoyable to watch him on stage with a guitar putting his everything into playing. I do think it‚Äôs ridiculous that if a female artist did that she would be cancelled and hated into oblivion, but Ed is very talented.

On the other side of this it‚Äôs interesting the artists that come to mind when thinking about their personality or ability to convey emotion has lead to their success. Artists like Lil Nas X, Lizzo, Rihanna, Taylor, Charli XCX, Lady Gaga, Carly Rae Jepson, Lorde, Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo, etc who‚Äôs personality is what makes them so popular. Lil Nas X without his personality wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as relevant. His ability to market his humor is an under appreciated talent. Olivia also has amazing marketing.

Even just comparing former members of One Direction, you can tell why Harry is the most popular. His personality is just likable. He‚Äôs funny and bold compared to maybe Zayn who is more quiet and reserved therefore creating some extent of a disconnect.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Some examples of the stuff people see as within normal range is being kinda typical American Baptists, albeit with an obsession with eschatology -- the latter is kind of common for American Baptists, so it's forgivable, although they made excuses for a past group that set a date for Jesus's second advent, which isn't smiled upon (but at least they don't go around setting new dates).

Some people find their explanation of the hell texts as referring to ""conditional immortality"" as strange; I admit it's unusual, and thus notable, but doesn't seem as strange as the more common doctrine -- just more unusual, that's all.

Likewise their tendency to legalism, including diet.

And of course the difference that's right in their name, ""seventh day"" worship. I mean, most people think it's reasonable to worship on a day that works for the culture; when I visited Bahrain they tended to worship Friday or Saturday to be on the local weekend, and few people cared. And likewise, if I'm called to work Sundays, I can attend on other days. But they not only worship on a slightly unusual day, and they not only claim they're better for it, they claim worshiping on Sunday will someday be the mark of the beast. That right there is troublesome; even though it's possible to hold to that without schisming, it's really hard to do, because by default you have to think that at any moment all of your Christian friends might become doomed (if you don't actually think that already, which unfortunately a few do).",1630454464

"blender","t5_2qim4","The camera positioning is really awkward, I see that you have a couple of things reflecting in the window glass, but the composition of the image isn't built around what's inside the room, so the reflected items are just confusing. My suggestion would be to either pull the camera back and show more of the room, or lose the window idea and just focus on a street view. When you have a still image like this it's important to consider how each element is placed in relation to the camera; that nearest street lamp, for example, is almost entirely blocked by the window frame. Compositionally, my eyes are drawn to the very center of the picture because of that neon sign. Take the rule of thirds into account here and use that as a reference to see where those points of interest appear in your current composition. I'm giving it a rough eyeball here, but your points of interest appear to be, the middle window frame, and the far street lamp. Obviously the rule of thirds isn't going to fix all of your problems, but it might help to make this image a little more interesting.",1630454465

In summary, while their reason for the bans is obviously not openly that they reported the bug, the simple truth of it is that that's the only reason they're banned and as such, zos is not punishing them for the exploit, but is absolutely punishing them for reporting it.

"minipainting","t5_2scss","Great discussion so far, everyone!  We really appreciate hearing peoples' thoughts about the sub.  Posts like this help us know the general state of things.  Generally we remove the very blatant self promotional content: patreons, store listings, people directly advertising commissions, stuff like that (unless the poster is active in the subreddit).


This subreddit is a hobby community, and so painters of *all* skill levels are welcome.  From beginners all the way up to the ""pros"".  For the sake of this comment, I'm going to consider anyone who is ""very good at painting and has an instagram"" as a pro, even though that isn't the case.


The nature of Reddit pushes the popular/high interaction stuff to the front page, this means things that get lots of upvotes, and things that get lots of comments.  That usually means things that people like, and often means things that are painted well.  Whatever algorithm Reddit uses for this makes no distinction between a ""pro"" commission painter and a similarly skilled ""pro"" hobbyist painter, and neither do we (so long as the commission painter isn't pushing their commissions here).


Reading through all the comments here, it seems like most people are ok seeing things painted by ""pros"".  Here's a few things I can suggest if you want less pro paintjobs in your life:


* report things you think break the rules (ie. self promotion)
* browse by New (popularity has nothing to do with it)
* upvote and comment on the stuff you want to see more of (this pushes it to the top)
* post your own painted minis (be the change you want to see!)


I realize that this isn't what some people want to hear, but in a community of nearly 450k people, it's impossible to please everyone.  Self promotion is the biggest thing we watch for and moderate against on the sub, and I can promise you that there's plenty of promotion that is actively being moderated.


Thanks again for the discussion here so far, and for keeping everything civil!


Edit to add:  A few less than civil comments have been removed.  You are free to disagree with OP, and both your opinions are still valid and you are free to express them.  That being said, you are **not** free to be a big jerk about it, be outright dismissive of someone, call them names, or insult them, or their skills.  Discussion is encouraged, arguments are not.

I had to book my G2 test twice (I had to cancel the first because I was sick) and the only times I could get a booking is early in the morning around 7-8 AM, and even then it took me around 30 min-1 hr to find a cancellation. Since it's so hard to book a test now people will wait last minute if they really need to cancel so they would cancel the 48 hours before to avoid the penalty or the day before or morning of. 

Another aspect that works in your favour if you wake up early to do it is that there are fewer people searching at that time, so less competition to select a slot before someone with better internet gets it first.",1630454468

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","The various forms of flu kill about 34,000 Americans in a normal year. At current rates Covid will kill that many people in five months ‚Ä¶ just in Florida. At current rates across the US using the seven day average we will get to 34k deaths in less than a month. 

Everyone has some level of natural immunity / resistance to the flu. Basically no one has that to Covid especially when you factor in variants which have the ability to develop faster for this novel virus which is spreading much faster. 

I get that whatever restrictions you have in your area are annoying and tedious and that we are all frustrated by the idiots that won‚Äôt get vaccinated for all the stupid reasons they give, so stupid that it disqualifies them from giving their opinion on anything at this point in my opinion. 

But we aren‚Äôt able to snap our fingers and get the kind of inconvenience that will make the idiots all get vaccinated tomorrow and we still don‚Äôt have a vaccine for kids under 12.",1630454470

I don‚Äôt believe this is the case, but rather they didn‚Äôt want so much exposition weighing down the pace of the film. 

For example, [Ian McDiarmid said in an interview that there was dialogue intentionally cut.](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-emperor-palpatine-clone-script-ian-mcdiarmid-reveal-a9374341.html) I think overall, the film explains enough with its visual cues of cloning tanks on Exegol and Palpatine telling Rey that his spirit will transfer to her when she kills him.",1630454471

It's clear you are not cut out for the diplomatic corps.

You missed a great opportunity here to be a man instead of a snotty kid. You know what you want to do. You know what your neighbour wants to do. You know that his smokes annoys you. And you know that your noise annoys him. 

This info, plus a desire to rise above selfishness and find a solution, could have led you into a discussion and then a negotiation for time and space. Which would have gained you respect and good neighbourhood relations. 

Instead, you up the ante, and take to social media to justify your no-one-else-matters choices. Well, congrats, little doods. You've embarrassed your parents and made an enemy instead. Aren't you the clever ones. 

Open your eyes. Be smart. Make a positive difference in the world. Get what you need, and help others get what they need at the same time. You'll be amazed at how the world opens up, if you do.

I'm giving my experience being out and about in Boston (and the surrounding areas) and other people have chimed in that their local restaurants are packed as well (as well as central/western mass, which I've seen many times on here). 

*Do you have any actual polling or evidence* to support your claims other than your virtue signaling?

...because it looks like Hampshire county only has about 56% of the population fully vaccinated. Based on your assertion that this is a liberal and educated area that supports mask mandates, and is making the *adult* decisions, you would assume that they would have a vaccination rate that was at least at the state average right? Definitely not 9 points below the state average. 

Also it looks like Amherst is only at 40%. Seems pretty underwhelming to me, but I guess those people who won't get vaccinated are just super jazzed about mask mandates and avoiding restaurants. That seems likely.

She really needs to go to the vet so they can determine if she has a skin allergy or skin infection and get it treated. Some cats also bite themselves if they are stressed and/or bored. Has anything in her environment changed lately? Cats are creatures of habit and sometimes it doesn't take much to feel insecure or uneasy which can cause them to bite themselves and others. It also probably hurts when you pet over the sores. Try to avoid touching wherever she has sores and definitely get her to the vet for treatment!  Again, just be gentle with her and try to take things at her pace. If you see she's uncomfortable maybe just hang out in the same space as her instead of petting her.

We watched Westerns and ate pudding pops (helped with his nausea.) 

Buying stuff is obviously silly in these situations, so depending on the person's mobility I would also suggest an experience that they can share with family. Trips if they can travel, sentimental craft type things if they have the energy (like those molds you can make of people holding hands), favorite foods if they can eat them, favorite smells if you can recreate them.

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","The word ""english"" (as in its spelling) was first used in a newspaper on June 24, 1607.  English is a loan word from Anglo-Norman French.  Originally, the name ""Espagne"" was used, but it meant ""Northern France"", while ""English"" meant ""English"".  It was borrowed into English by King James I.  The word ""English"" became a common term for the language, although it was usually only used by the upper class.  Its use spread throughout the upper classes, but in the 1480s it was still used only by aristocrats.  During this time the French language was still in its infancy, so the word ""French"" (French) was used, but it was not used in the same way as the word ""English"" is used today.  The word ""French"" is still commonly used to describe the language today.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Haha, no problem, man, I do think something got lost in translation there. Yeah, I definitely admit the way I used drugs from, say, 18-21 or so was totally reckless and irresponsible, but I was just a kid who had a chain reaction of really terrible tragedies befall me and was looking to feel a peaceful oblivion, I wasn't just some drug freak. I was always trying to relax, to feel peace, to kill some pain. I was a half-bottle a day alcoholic from 15 years old and finally started to quit towards being 17, at Christmas, but then month after Christmas, my house caught fire. My room was the only room 100% decimated. 

Even the older junkies, in messages to my mother wrote ""I've been using for ten years, and I've never seen anyone use like your son, mix drugs like he does. He is going to die if he keeps it up, just last week I kept him from walking out into the middle of the street"". I had a heroin using career of just 3 years, but I had overdosed I would say seven times, three of which required medical attention, which was from 1. .8mg IV heroin + 200mg Librium (saved by Narcan), 2. GHB, and 3. 200mg\~ temazepam plus a large amount of swigged liquor. I had four other overdoses involving some mixture of heroin, Xanax and alcohol, which I woke up from and did not require hospitalizations.

So yeah, when you are at the point of taking opioids and triazolam (super Xanax) with liquor and a hit of heroin, you are just so dumb that you do not care about anything, or you're in such a bad emotional state that you're willing to do anything to feel a peaceful oblivion. I'd never recommend mixing drugs the way I did, the only thing I know now is how to mix safely for medical treatments - for example, 100mg edible THC and 5-10mg depending on person is my ""anti-suicidal-thoughts"" treatment. 

Wasn't too much about recreation for me, like, there was methamphetamine around me every single day for a long time, and I only gave the stuff a try like ten times. I hated it, was just the opposite of why I did drugs. However, there were no dopeheads in my age or friend group. 

Sorry for the information dump, was just kind of thinking out loud.",1630454474

My hope is that I can use these with angel spellbook combine on oracle to have 'enough' spell slots to avoid dropping 3 mythic abilities on the abundant spells line.  I still might end up getting both since level 7-9 angel spells are so good. 

Stretching the min/level spells early will be QoL, but round/level spells is a power boost since its hard to replicate 100% up time.  For this reason I will probably take the two abilities on back to back level ups (using a mythic feat to get a mythic ability) later in the game.  It is hard to get good value out of just the first ability when you need to extend caster level 30+ spells to get min/round to last over an hour.

My question to people in beta is if spells/abilities actually last 24 hours, or if they go away on rest.  It's not a huge deal, but being fully buffed with full spell slots",1630454475

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

* That is a tough situation to deal with ""the past."" I had some very bad things happen back in my teenage years that held me a prisoner for 40+ years before I figured out the best way for me to release that bondage. I heard a program on the radio station one time about writing a letter. I thought what a great idea! So I got out a paper tablet and a pencil. I started the letter out, Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,  I wrote out all of my emotions towards the person, (anger, feeling sorry for them, frustration, in the end, I forgave the person not only for them but for myself...) It freed me up from the bondage that I felt. I kept the letter on my table and when I thought of something to write, I wrote it down, then when I was done for the time, I got up. It took me about a week to write. After I poured out my heart and soul into the letter, I mailed it to that person. But you do not have to. There are many different ways you can deal with that letter. You can watch it burn up in the sink, you can rip it up and throw it away, you can store it away in a secret place, you can mail it to the person or give it to them...Whatever feels right to you.",1630454475

Iron Bank is still the economic powerhouse, connections to FM, etc. 

Westeros has too many with interests in the free cities/ Iron Bank so characters in Westeros are likely to see the free cities as better for long-term goals as this hypothetical war wages on, than vice versa.

Also, Westerosi economy will likely fall apart without access to Essos, and other users have lighted naval supremacy.

Edit: all points concerning fleets fail to address that Westeros is heavily reliant on Essos, than the other way around. Free cities could just choose not to engage &amp; be a little strategic w/ sowing targeted discord among the realm &amp; watch the political system essentially implode. 
Without dragons it literally becomes inefficient. 

The only way which Westeros comes out on top is if the realm address the faults in their political system, which is highly unlikely as those faults would have to address ways in which the North + IronBorn + Dorne are incentivized to work together in this apparent new government. Considering basic history teaches us it would not be an efficient system unless the realm is divided, it will just eventually burn itself out.

Yes, children can and are dying of Covid.  A year-old died in Virginia just last week; and the mortality rate of the unborn child and pregnant mother rises if she's unvaccinated.

So it's NOT a false dichotomy, it's a valid statement.

Children are at risk of the Delta variant of Covid, and MANY are on ventilators in hospitals.  Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina...

Then I decided to read the Bible in 6 months &amp; that worked. I created my own plans several times until now I have one that works for me. I jump around to 5 different sections of the Bible so that I never get bored.

I also like the idea of the Book of Common Prayer.

There are parts of the Bible, like Numbers, that you just have to slog through.

I read the RSV, but I also like the NLT, the Living, the CEB, the GNT. Lots of people like the NRSV.

It is a great way to bump the security standard, but with no major changes, there's really no point to. Remember Microsoft opted for feature updates instead of OS versions. They already have changed a lot of the UI since 2015, there should be no need for a whole new OS.",1630454479

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","The lesson to learn here is that you cannot ""reserve"" someone.  People date multiple people until they form an attachment and decide to go exclusive.   He went after multiple girls, and girls in general have multiple suitors competing for their attention.

The second, and big lesson to learn here is that he is a player, and that he LIED to you.   You seem to be looking for romance, a relationship, etc., and by his actions he's looking for sex, with as many girls as he can convince.  Which means *you are one of the girls he's trying to convince* to have sex.  And it's ok, if that's what you want.  

The lies, though, he can continue to lie, and I'm not sure if you can really trust him.  And trust is required for a relationship.

Finally, technicalities won't affect how you feel.  You get into an intimate situation, and you suddenly imagine him kissing the other girls.  Maybe telling the other girls what he just told you.  The fact that it was technically not cheating won't change how you feel in that moment.",1630454480

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

*****
&gt; House Minority Leader said Tuesday that Republicans &amp;quot;Will not forget&amp;quot; if telecommunications companies turn phone and email records over to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

&gt; The comment follows the select committee sending letters to 35 companies Monday asking them to preserve a number of records - something McCarthy argues &amp;quot;Would put every American with a phone or computer in the crosshairs of a surveillance state run by Democratic politicians.""

&gt; While another request sent to many of the same companies last week asked for troves of data about disinformation surrounding the election as well as their internal reviews of different extremist groups, Monday&amp;#039;s letters asked the companies to retain records related more specifically to the unnamed individuals.

Everytime I watch it I discover something I haven't noticed or picked up before. Whether it was a theme, a line, a facial expression, a use of soundtrack or just something in the background.

"Psoriasis","t5_2rdms","I had a regular cleaning appointment scheduled about 3-4 months after a pretty severe flare.  My skin was mostly clear by then, just had a few lingering spots on my neck/chest.  What was interesting is that my dentist said she could tell that there were signs of inflammation in my gums and mouth.  So even though my skin had outwardly healed (for the most part), my gums were still showing signs of inflammation.  It really made me understand how systemic Psoriasis is, how it seems like it affects many aspects of our bodies, not just our skin.

Foreign workers? Couldn‚Äôt afford the min $10,000 for the foreign workers process. Steady revolving door of employees left me out of business and bankrupt.

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention. A+B (as with any major life change, your relationship dynamic will probably shift), B+C, A+C, and A+B+C. Imposing unethical, unfair dynamics on a partner may lead to your removal from this subreddit.

Dark knights have the ability to slaughter masses of enemies wholesale in droves with explosions of dark power, Warriors are borderline unkillable when they get their fighting freak on, and so on and so forth. There's no reason to believe there is a One True Path to supreme power, and to assume there is is fairly reductionist.


PS: There's also the matter of distinguishing between 'top end potential' and 'performance in the hands of a rookie'. As far as the latter goes, guns and magitek are unmatched, which is why MCH's questline puts heavy emphasis on how much of an equalizer guns are. You want to hand basic-ass, hastily drafted conscripts guns, but if you have time to mold a mass of people into competent combatants, combined arms will yield better results than just specializing in one thing. It's why the Garlean bladegun and the Bozjan gunblade serve different purposes. The former is a weapon for conscripts, the latter is a weapon for experts.",1630454483

"90DayFiance","t5_34i5y","The feminine ""mid life crisis"" is between 28 and 31, where she makes attempts to reassess the last decade of her life. Women‚Äôs psychological rationalization engine begins a furious effort to account for, and explain to her reasonings for not having successfully secured a long term monogamous commitment from as Alpha a man as her attractiveness could attain for her. Even women married prior to this phase will go through some variation of self-doubt, or self-pity in dealing with the hypergamic uncertainty of her choice (‚ÄúIs he really the best I could do?‚Äù)

It‚Äôs during this stage that women will make radical shifts in their prioritization of what prerequisite traits qualify as ‚Äòattractive‚Äô in a man and attempt to turn over a new leaf by changing up their behaviors to align with this new persona they create for themselves. Since the physicality, sexual prowess and Alpha dominance that made up her former arousal cues in a Man aren‚Äôt as forthcoming from men as when she was in her sexual prime, she reprioritizes them with (presumed) preferences for more intrinsic male attributes that stress dependability, provisioning capacity, humor, intellect, and esoteric definitions of compatibility and intimacy.",1630454484

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I think what we are seing is female sexuality really unrestrained, and we compare it to past times where it was heavily conditioned by enviromental and cultural factors like the need for provisioning, male dependance, pregnancy and whatnot.

So it comes as a shock to us since for the past 5000 years what history, culture and common sense thaught us about women was that ""they are NOT like THIS"", and now when we see how women really act when they have nothing to worry about and are free to pursue their natural instincs doesn't fit what we knew about them.

Even some women seem to be really surprised about this, like they hold on tight to some old and outdated gender norms and roles because it supose that that's what women do (or should), and this causes some really deep cognitive disonances among women... 

Libfem, radfem, FDS, Pink Pill, Red Pill Women, Tradcons, Slutwalks, MeToo, slutshaming, manspreading, sex work no, sex work yes, fuck, don't fuck, fuck them all, childfree/childless, travel the world, pursue a carreer, marry young... Women are as confused as men right now, like they know what they want but they don't know if that's right or wrong, they have an incredible existential crisis as a byproduct of their sexuality being freed that any other woman have experienced in the entire history.

I think culture will adjust in time. In a few years all we knew about women and the way we thought about them and saw them will be replaced with this new archetype of the modern woman.

The question is if this will favour women or not. I want to stay positive and think while men will de-pedestalize the female nature, they will still look at women for emitional bonding and meaninful relationships... However, given the current state of affairs, I don't think this will be the case.",1630454485

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Thanks so much for this! I guess instead of switching 'randomly' I should say 'generatively'; susceptible to chance, but over a longer time scale (say every eight/sixteen bars etc). The idea is to provide more movement/interest over time by progressing between different modes (I'm not sure if this is the right terminology!).

&gt; This sounds a little more practical. I assume you mean like having it general notes in C with C as a tonal center, then moving to D as a tonal center making it D Dorian (rather than C as you said above).  
  
Ah! Sorry yes I had the terminology mixed: so say moving between C Ionian and D Dorian (which if I am understanding it all correctly, share the same notes, but with different tonal 'centres'/emphasis).  
  
&gt; You could use some ""typical"" Dorian root progressions like - F - G - D - D or C - F - D - D or F - C - D - D something like that. If you can get a ""bass line"" to kind of emphasize those notes for example.  
  
So if I understand this correctly, this would involve emphasizing the particular notes within Dorian that give it the tonal centre, allowing for effective transition?",1630454487

Between that, the low rate of mask-wearing, and the disregard for social distancing advice, you can probably expect quite a few of your classes to empty out over the next 2-3 weeks. A&amp;M's policy likely won't change until the kid of someone who knows a Board of Regents member gets seriously ill.

By the way, professors are only obligated to allow students to make up points under Student Rule 7 -- not to give notes or Zoom recordings (unless you have an accommodation on record). Some are surely going to be nice and provide those things, but they aren't required to.

One other thing -- hospitals in our 7-county region haven't had an open ICU bed for nearly 3 weeks, and as of yesterday 62% of ICU beds in our region were COVID patients.

Then reduce by 500 calories per day. So if you‚Äôre normally consuming 2,000 daily, eat 1,500 calories daily instead. 

Exercise is great. Keep it up. You cannot out exercise the food you eat really, but exercise will help with body composition and what not, so keep exercising for sure.",1630454489

If you try to play now, there are still people there, but it's mostly veteran players and it's hard to get that same experience. FFXIV will be able to continue more long term because of how much you can do solo, but there are elements that won't be able to transition 10 years from now. Plus setting up 11 is a freaking hassle. You need a Steam account to buy it, a Square Enix account to login, and a Play Online account to actually play the damn game.

Which requires a lot of red tape and hoops to jump through and long long wait times for money and other supports to come through. It seriously slows down the process. 

In this instance though, the whole world was essentially throwing money at them making it as easy as they can for them to work on this vaccine and it helped speed up the process. 

There were absolutely no shortcuts taken and these vaccines were tested the same way and for the same amount of time as all others. Having support from all over the world truly helped make the process easier.

"cactus","t5_2qpr6","Only a spoonful of water, weekly, isn't much water. Generally cacti need a more thorough watering and then not watering them for more than a week isn't a problem. Your potting mix looks really peaty. Peaty mixes often become hydrophobic after they dry out and getting water to soak back in to them can be a challenge. When a mix becomes hydrophobic it shrinks a bit and leaves a gap between the mix and pot where the water just runs through and out of the pot. My point is your spoonful of water might not soak in to a place where the cactus can get it. One can slowly starve a cactus of water to death even while watering it because of a hydrophobic mix. The solution is to let the potting mix soak so that it eventually picks up more water again or replace the mix with something less prone to becoming hydrophobic.

There's a saying in intelligence (or classified military) circles: ""Those who know don't talk...And those who talk...don't know.""

It's like the guy who guards the gate at the CIA walking around telling everyone he works for the CIA but never goes into exactly what he does. 

The people who are actually analysts or agents will tell you that they guard the parking lot - or sweep the floors or clean the toilets or  something else really boring - at the CIA. The goal is to shift the conversation away from what they actually do/did and on to something not classified.

So anyone who calls attention to their alleged service in the CIA, or any other intelligence agency (to give themselves credibility or a mystique) is almost always lying.",1630454495

"therewasanattempt","t5_39ne7","&gt;It all depends on where you draw the line. It‚Äôs the same thing as the abortion debate. To some people an embryonic life is LIFE worth fighting about, to some it‚Äôs not. To some animal life is LIFE worth fighting about, to some it‚Äôs not. People don‚Äôt have to care about animal lives just because you do. So yeah, I‚Äôm killing an animal every time I eat meat but I don‚Äôt see that as a problem. Along similar lines, the only line I draw at eating meat is human (and that might even go out the window given extreme circumstances). The moral debate about eating meat centered around killing has never been convincing to me - the environmental argument is much more compelling.

It's funny to me that you only chose two topics that are debated and not something like ""killing human children."" I am very sure that there are people who think that human children aren't worth anything and that they happily kill them.. yeah but they are still wrong and should go to jail tho  
If someone tried to kill you and said ""well I don't have a problem with it tho"" would you say ""oh if that's the case, I guess it's moral.""  
That's an appeal to emotion fallacy.  
I would suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vW9iSpLLk) for moral advice. It's from a meat eater who makes arguments for veganesim, he loves meat but is willing to stop for morals, so he gives his arguments, fails to debunk them and goes vegan because of it, now making activist videos about the subject. He is very intelligent as you will see in the video and on his channel.  
And if you care about the planet, then I would suggest reading [all of what I wrote here](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/pf8ja6/to_block_the_mcdonalds_entrance/hb46jfr/?context=3) plus the comment I left for the person who answered.

&gt;Also, hyperbole is never a good argument. Killing something for meat is much different than animal abuse, much like I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd argue a glass of wine is different than excessive alcoholism. Now yes, the meat industry is awful, but that‚Äôs a different argument than the one you were making earlier about killing ‚Äúothers‚Äù that are animals and not people.

Humans are animals so I don't see what you mean by that.  
Aynways you had to proof to me how killing something for pleasure against consent isn't abuse. The definition of animal abuse is:  
""the crime of inflicting physical pain, suffering or death on an animal, usually a tame one, beyond necessity""  
So you had to proof to me how killing an animal for pleasure isn't ""inflicting physical pain, suffering or death on an animal beyond necessity.""",1630454497

Yes, that's quite antithetical to Stoic philosophy.

&gt;Pursue pleasure in a balanced way, it's what makes life worth living.

As is this belief.

&gt;live virtuously, and pursue pleasure in a balanced way.

If virtuousity brings contentment and joy, doesn't pursuing virtuousity eliminate the struggle for pleasure? To quote Epictetus,

&gt;Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

&gt;The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.

&gt;**Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things.** Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved.

If you place value in your character, and remain virtuous, you can be pleased simply by existence under any conditions. Secondary pleasures can be enjoyed, but never pursued.",1630454497

-Who are you climbing with and exactly where?

-Which climbs stay dry in the rain and which are less condition dependent?

-Plan for your best and worst case performance scenarios: what's the minimum you need to do for you to be satisfied with your trip? ***

-Select harder climbs that suit your strengths and more moderate climbs that challenge your weaknesses.

-Make a list of all the climbs you hope to try and compare with your climbing partners.

-How much can you realistically climb between rest days?

-What is most important: climbing the best classic routes, getting a lot of moderate sends, or projecting a harder line?

Drs - not enough interns and rmos to look after patient loads (* this isn't all Sa health's fault - ama/colleges are shocking for this)

The moderates didn‚Äôt win because of what Biden campaigned for. That‚Äôs pretty irrelevant for them unless it‚Äôs what they also want.

As the other commenter said ‚Äúmoderates are OK with things not changing much‚Äù. This gives them leverage because they are more OK with voting for what they want even if it doesn‚Äôt pass. 

For moderates the best outcomes may look like: small change &gt; no change &gt; large change

For progressives: large change &gt; small change &gt; no change

"rheumatoid","t5_2tqwy","I could have written this exact thing myself so know you aren‚Äôt alone! I finally reached the official RA diagnosis stage just this week (yay?) but had been living in pain and constant exhaustion for months. To be honest, I found no perfect solution until diagnosis/treatment. I mostly relied on lots of anti-inflammatory dietary changes which for my personal diet involved cutting out a lot of sugar and adding vitamin supplements. I‚Äôm also in a legal state so my sister got me a 60:1 CBD tonic. Sometimes I try Tylenol to take the edge off. 
And I‚Äôll pass along some of the tips I used that I got from this sub: 
1. Prepare. You already know the doctor is going to say some generic ‚ÄúSo what brings you in today?‚Äù so come prepared with exactly what you want to say. This will help relieve some of your anxiety as well. Write down every symptom in detail, when things started and how long it lasts, any previous health incidents, and a full family history especially of autoimmune disorders. And don‚Äôt feel weird going in with a list, doctors want to get down to business so being prepared benefits them.
2. Be your own advocate. Be open minded as well, but there are several tests that can be run to get a better idea of what might be going on so push for testing. If they are doing standard bloodwork, ask specifically for the additional autoimmune panel. This is what I did with my PCP which what ended me up with the rheumatologist! 

I hope this helps in someway! Good luck in your journey.",1630454500

To make it simpler for you to understand this is how his initial reporting was:

"fednews","t5_2xy8z","I was in a similar situation with limited opportunities at the 14 and 15 level.  I chose the route of going into management to secure the 14 before eventually moving into a non-management 15.  I agree that finding those non-supervisory 15 positions are like finding unicorns.  Most non-supervisory 14s are hired internally in my agency (e.g. the tiring managers want to ensure they know the person's work ethic before giving them one of a small number of slots.  If you are in the DC area, there are plenty of non-supervisory 14 and 15 positions but if you are not, it will not be easy landing one.  I lose many quality employees that just can't sit at 13/10 forever.  Most flip back over to contracting as the federal government just can't keep up with salaries in many cases.

For your ""just do PM stuff"" I urge you to pull out your performance plan.   You should have two sections. One for meets expectations and the items expected to do so and a second for meets outstanding and the items for that.  Granted, this will not get you a grade bump by itself but taking that and turning that into other cert lists and opportunities.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

The spread of harmful misinformation has become an untenable problem on Reddit. Its latest incarnation has seen life-threatening untruths being propagated by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, and Reddit‚Äôs administration has stated that it will not meaningfully curb the myths disseminated by these bad actors. In response to this, many communities on the site have gone private in protest.

/r/GIFs supports and stands behind these communities' efforts to stem the effects of false information, but we have chosen to remain open as a means of amplifying their message. We encourage all Redditors to vocally reject misinformation, and to stymie its spread by demanding that only verifiable facts be given support (whether tacit or otherwise).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got home from work last night, my girlfriend said earlier in the day there was a spider in the bathroom in the corner. It was no longer there.

This morning I was taking a shower, washing my face with my eyes closed, and when I opened them there was a gargantuan 5 inch or so spider right by my foot. I jumped like hell. It looked like it had drowned in the water, since it wasnt moving. I continued the shower, got out, and stared at it a bit before I decided to grab one of its long legs with tissue. Right before grabbing it, I blew on it first, like any reasonable person who takes safety into account, but then it started twitching and gradually started trying to climb out of the shower. It was not dead. I then doused it in bleach and flushed it.

Normally I like spiders, but I made an exception for this one.

Added note: I probably wont be closing my eyes in the shower for a while.",1630454503

It's both? It's a joke, and jokes are effective political tools.

The spread of harmful misinformation has become an untenable problem on Reddit. Its latest incarnation has seen life-threatening untruths being propagated by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, and Reddit‚Äôs administration has stated that it will not meaningfully curb the myths disseminated by these bad actors. In response to this, many communities on the site have gone private in protest.

/r/Pics supports and stands behind these communities' efforts to stem the effects of false information, but we have chosen to remain open as a means of amplifying their message. We encourage all Redditors to vocally reject misinformation, and to stymie its spread by demanding that only verifiable facts be given support (whether tacit or otherwise).

[An in-depth explanation of how misinformation is harmful can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/pfeu8w/our_stand_against_misinformation/).

"Furryhatezone","t5_3b97h5","Well we all know that most of the furry fandom has weird shit like porn art and some weird kinky shit. But the sad part of about the furry community is that furries that do draw porn mostly get the spotlight while clean furs almost none well they're can great artists but porn artists most get most of it. This is why clean furry artists don't get any attention. Most of the furriest aren't what they seems only the toxic furries that get offended easily mostly from the leftists. That's what most of the furry fandom is mostly leftists and they're rightwing furries and nonpolitical furs. The leftist furries mostly cancels anyone that has different opinions. There was a journal that was talking about the cancel culture in the furry community that it's ruining the furry community and they're right. If you have a different opinion boom you get a trouble ticket if you have different religion and some furries bashing on your beliefs and you reported them for bashing you boom trouble ticket because the fa owner hates Christians or anyone that different believes or opinions. Man i was atheist in furaffinity I defended a Christian from being mocked then I got a trouble ticket just for standing up for him. This shit is fucked up that's why furries are hated anyways. Oh yeah don't do commissions with them because they charge too fuckn high some furries can charge a fair price but other than that fuck that. Some fools pay like $500 or more for a commission of a furry art. Back then the furry community wasn't like what it is now",1630454505

Are you serious? Now I am sure you're trolling. ""In case a draft happens"" means that there IS a draft in the law.

What you're saying is that there is none going on right now (no shit Sherlock) which is completely different from your claim that you don't lose your voting rights for not being registered and a pathetic shifting of goalposts.

&amp;#x200B;

Really? Because Vietnam wasn't that long ago and [there was in fact a draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)). In fact there are plenty of men drafted in that war alive today that have physical and/or mental scars from it. Men who deserve better than your disrespectful remarks.

I like the idea of anti-cheat system that utilizes and requires TPM2.0/Secure Boot. If some of the games would have that kind of anti-cheat, it's GG, since TPM2.0 keys are tied to CPU AND Motherboard (or a 100-150USD module for some older board, which are kinda being phased out now). Most modern boards use CPU/Mobo TPM2.0. 

Might not prevent cheating completely, but would be great deterrent if you would need to buy new CPU and Mobo to cheat again in said game every time you get caught by anti-cheat. Too bad none of the popular competitive games can realistically use that any time soon with most of their audiences playing on dogshit hardware that is also old and doesn't support TPM2.0.

I wonder if there would be such title, how much attention it would attract based on the anti-cheat alone, CoD: Wazone and CS:GO are really bad right now with amount of cheaters.",1630454505

Neither was a massive political discussion. WAP and Cardi B and its effects of young women, was.

&gt;basically all songs are about sex,it just depends on how good your euphemisms are

34+35 is outright about sex though. And even then, no.

Look at Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines. Its not just a song about sex, the actual video features a shit ton of naked women frolicking around. No one gave a shit. Cardi B's music video features no nudity.

&gt; eminem is a white rapper and he got all kinds of shit, as did marylin manson.

Eminem is regarded as a hip hop classic. And do you know why HE believes he has the legacy? Not becuase hes a good rapper, but because hes a good **white** rapper.

&gt;no one gives a shit that he is gay and black.

They do. Thats the inspiration behind the Montero video.

&gt; he is a huge influence to kids and then is literally promoting satan.

Let me say it loudly for you:

**LIL NAS X IS NOT AND HAS NEVER BEEN A FUCKING CHILD ARTIST AND HAS ALWAYS MADE SONGS ABOUT DRUGS AND SEX.**

**HE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE MUSIC TO APPEASE YOUR KIDS. FUCK YOUR KIDS. HE MAKES MUSIC THAT HE WANTS MAKE BECAUSE HE IS AN ADULT MAKING MUSIC FOR ADULTS.**

How would YOU feel if you went outside and someone said you need to change the way you dress, speak, or act because they think you are a bad influence on their kids?

Thats what your doing to Lil Nas and Cardi and every other artist who faces this criticism.

Solano Lopez era paraguaio.

Twitter √© o esgoto da internet. Pessoal de l√° nunca deve ter pego um livro sobre o Imp√©rio pra ler. 

A ignor√¢ncia do povo sobre o Imp√©rio √© enorme. Muita gente acha que nossa monarquia era absolutista, confundem independ√™ncia com proclama√ß√£o da rep√∫blica, confundem descobrimento com independ√™ncia... D√° tristeza de ver.

&gt;Para os que n√£o sabem, em toda a sua vida, o imperador deu apenas um ""selinho"" na condessa, o que, pra √©poca, vale como um beijo de l√≠ngua.

Tem certeza? Porque at√© onde sei eles se encontravam escondidos. Duvido que n√£o rolava sexo. Ela nem foi a √∫nica amante dele, porque ele mesmo teve noites de sexo com outras amantes (tipo Condessa de Villeneuve).

&gt;tem um n√∫cleo de humor p√©ssimo.

Concordo. Licurgo e Germana n√£o tinham gra√ßa nem no Novo Mundo. Detestei a volta deles.

\--

Bom, eu concordo com quase tudo. A novela realmente t√° superficial pra caralho, mas ela vai ter a segunda parte de quando come√ßa a guerra do Paraguai, e alguns personagens jovens (tipo a Isabel e a Dolores) ser√£o maiores depois, e a√≠ espero que a novela fique melhor a partir da√≠.

"exterminators","t5_30clf","Traps: Set snap traps away from children and pets using bread or cheese for bait. Mold it on to the trip so that have to work at it to get it all (peanut butter can work, but mice are known to lick it off and not trip the trap). Place them perpendicular to walls with the bait on the inside as mice run along baseboards. (Also, I don‚Äôt recommend glue traps as they are inhumane and not as effective, and live traps may seem humane, but if you plan to relocate them to another environment, it will be very stressful and may be a death sentence as they will be totally disoriented.)  
 Bait: You can buy these bait stations for inside and fill with Contrac Blox (professional) and use them in the attic, crawlspace, basement, garage, under kitchen sink/stove, etc.  
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?\_from=R40&amp;\_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;\_nkw=protecta+rtu&amp;\_sacat=0

Don't be too concerned about dead mice having a smell. They are so small it is very rare and worth the risk to eliminate the issue.  
Baiting Outside: Buy one or two Protecta bait stations and secure them so they can't be removed by kids or racoons; fill with Contrac Blox and monitor every four days or so. It's best to kill them before they can enter the home:  
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?\_from=R40&amp;\_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;\_nkw=protecta+bait+stations&amp;\_sacat=0  
Also, sealing any exterior entry points is a must with copper scrub pads or Stuff-It copper mesh (copper doesn‚Äôt rust like steel wool), but it can be difficult to find them all. Specifically, check where the A/C lines go through the foundation wall; #1 entry point.   
Secondary poisoning: Pet owners can be assured that should a cat or dog eat a mouse that has been poisoned (very rare as well fed animals don‚Äôt usually eat prey - let alone dead prey) there will be no fatal consequences. The amount of Active Ingredient in Contrac Blox (for example) is .005% bromadiolone. A 15 lb. dog or cat would have to eat 1.5 pounds of actual bait for it to be fatal. However, should a pet ingest some bait, induce vomiting and take it to a vet. Vitamin K1 is the antidote.",1630454507

"NoahGetTheBoat","t5_117wt6","It‚Äôs widely accepted by actual certified doctors that deal with hormonal therapy and gender reconstruction surgery that most transgender individuals do not realize until they hit ~13/14 years old due to hormones in their brains released during puberty. Being transgender has *everything* to do with hormonal displacement in the brain. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find most anything that doesn‚Äôt have to do with hormones when it comes to the brain. That is what med students learn in med school. You cannot argue with scientific facts. 

Not to mention, transgender individuals who transition when they‚Äôre under ~21 years of age, are more likely to have transitional regret and often this leads to suicidal thoughts (or in the worst cases, suicide). 

At 3 years old, you might have liked traditionally male things (as did I) or vice versa but there is no way for a child that young to even comprehend what being transgender is. 

And I want to remind you again that I am trans. I‚Äôve had to do this research all my life to justify my existence. 

This is wrong. This article should not have to have been a thing. This child does not have a concept of ‚Äúbeing trans‚Äù. Gender expression is one thing, but again I want to stress that the fact that their parents did NOT get them mental help after trying to harm themselves is astounding.

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","I grew up thinking if you didn't have sex, you would die. The desperate need people would add to their voice whenever they talked about the act made it seem like it was as essential as food, water and air. Your clock would start counting down to your death the second after you hit puberty  so getting it over with was job one hense the desperation to loose your virginity as soon as possible. 

Imagine my shock and relief when I found out this isn't so. Yeah it's a part of life but not essential to. The only time I get annoyed at people who act like it life or death if you don't get any and are sitting there developing an aneurism fretting over what birth control to take and are weary of them all because not one is 100% effective if only there was one that was. When I suggest not having sex it's like I'm suggesting they forgo food for the rest of their lives or kill their kids with a bat.

All the other forms of BC weren't good enough and you shot them down. There is one method that is 100% effective against pregnancy guaranteed but going without sex is worse than the hell other birth control puts you through then you get pissed off when you fall pregnant. Sometimes you just can't win with people. 

Going without sex is easy. People make it seem like if they don't get sex...it's the end of the world but it's not...it never is. If someone tries to guilt you or scare you into having sex because they make it seem like it's life essential...it's not.

&gt; Aug 31 - Two women have been charged with selling forged COVID-19 vaccination cards through an Instagram account and to enter the names of customers into New York state&amp;#039;s immunization database, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;The stakes are too high to tackle fake vaccination cards with whack-a-mole prosecutions,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; For an additional $250 fee, Barkley, who works at a medical clinic in New York, would enter the buyer&amp;#039;s name into the state&amp;#039;s database as having received COVID-19 vaccinations.

"religion","t5_2qh39","I don't understand how you reconcile this:

&gt;The Holy Quran Speaks about Gravity / Gravitational waves due to its effect planets are Swimming in an Orbit, this description is in line with recent scientific knowledge (Chapter 36: Verse 40): *It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming.*

with this:

&gt;And yet, the Old Testament for me falls short. Genesis. Exodus. A lot of that falls short. And then the ""you shouldn't take it as literal but as allegory"" arguments always arise. And that just feels like an easy cop out to me.

I mean quite literally you took a poetic verse describing ""swimming in orbit"" to mean ""moving due to gravitational pull.""

Why use ""*swimming*"" anyways? I wonder if like, for some kind of common metaphor, ancient people identified the blue sky with the blue water of the ocean or sea....

Ah. Wait:

&gt;And God said, ‚ÄúLet there be a vault in the midst of the waters, and let it divide water from water.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;And God made the vault and it divided the water beneath the vault from the water above the vault, and so it was.  
&gt;  
&gt;And God called the vault Heavens, and it was evening and it was morning, second day.

This is the Robert Alter translation, with the footnote: *The Hebrew raki øa suggests a hammered-out slab, not necessarily arched, but the English architectural term with its celestial associations created by poetic tradition is otherwise appropriate.*

It's also translated more often as 'firmament.""

That's literally what happens in the ""Old testament"". the space water is divided from the earth water. Actually in hebrew, to be precise, the word for 'heavens"" is ◊©÷∏◊Å◊û÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù shamayim

which includes the word ◊û÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù [mayyim](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D)\- which means water, and an etymological origin/loanword ◊©÷∏◊Å◊û (sky, or lofty - from the Akkadian samu).

Lofty water = heaven.

It's a poetic device *and* a pun!

...Hey what's the Arabic word for sky, anyways?

ÿ≥ŸéŸÖŸéÿßÿ°  (samƒÅ æ) from Proto-Semitic \*≈°amƒÅy- (‚Äúsky, space‚Äù)

proto-semitic from samay? Oh, Akkaddian: ≈°am√ª -- descendants including hebrew: Hebrew: ◊©÷∏◊Å◊û÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù‚Äé (≈°ƒÅm√°yim)

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","What white collar work would there be to do as a hobby.

The things you said (like carpentry and gardening) are things people can do with very little barriers to entry. But what white collar work can you do outside of your job? It's not like most can pickup a balance sheet or income statement to fill out at the store?",1630454511
"supportlol","t5_3abd1","I've been maining Rell since she came out, and I can give you some:

1: Max her Q first, not her W. A lot of people will say you should max W first because it gives you a bigger shield, and that's true but most people forget her Q goes from 9 seconds at rank 1 to 5 seconds on rank 5! And don't forget also, that her Q heals on 5% missing HP for evey champion hit, so you will want to spam that. It also breaks shields. After that you can max whatever you need, E for peel, W for engage.

2: Rell can take a vast majority of runes depending on your matchup, Allowing her to adapt to the matchup. She's very versatile! But she usually goes best with Aftershock as her keystone. I personally take inspiration secondary, with the spell cdr rune. Eighter Future market or hexflash then.

3: Rell's E gives your tethered ally 10% of your resistances, so building resistances instead of health can be quite worth it, especially now that max HP damage is so abundant. (there is also currently a bug that allows you to give E resistances twice, but I can't condone that since abusing a but is bannable

4: Rell CAN engage, and engage nice, but works best as counter-engage, or follow up engage. Against heavy mobility or displacement you're better off waiting for them to engage or to assist one yourself. You can tether Assassins or Divers with your E to assist their engage as well. Or you engage with flash.

5: Thresh and Vayne are your biggest counters. Anyone that can displace you mid-W will leave you a sitting duck. Against them you will need to Flash R+E to engage.

6: Make your W's count. Don't engage unless you're at least 95% sure you're going to hit.

7: Rell is teamfight oriented, and scales decently. If you have to stay safe and farm only in lane, do it. Rell's job is to hit a 5-man W+R combo in the teamfight, not to do damage or tank a lot. You don't need gold for that (only EXP)

8: Rell is not the best tank, nor the best peel support, nor the most utility, damage, healing or crowd control. People often compare Rell to other supports, but forget that while Rell is not the best at these, she IS a Jack-of-All-Traits when it comes to support, and her best quality is AOE CC, in which she is unmatched. When assisted properly, Rell will solo 1v9 teamfights",1630454511

* It looks like the Duration field only impacts the demo at the bottom of the right pane, but I was kind of thinking it might also speed up the animation of the dots to the right of the graph as well.
* It could be cool to have it automatically determine whether it needs to be a custom bezier curve (with animation keyframes) vs a standard cubic-bezier one and generate the relevant code.

Pense nas op√ß√µes que teria agora sem a faculdade de filosofia, quais seriam? mais limitadas e tamb√©m escassas, onde al√©m de ganhar pouco como ganharia como professor voc√™ seria esculachado o dia inteiro para ganhar pouco em algo que odeia.

You‚Äôre asking about percentages of body weight, inside, outside etc. there is scientific approach to these questions but a lot of the answers are subjective to your body weight, height, bike size, riding style, riding experience, riding feel etc. here‚Äôs my 2 cents for what it‚Äôs worth. (Depending on the bike you‚Äôre riding) take the whole track in third gear, don‚Äôt worry about your lap times, maxing out on the straights or dragging knees. Just focus on stayin on the race lines, body position and doing what feels right. Not maxing out the straights gives you time to actually think about your approach and how you‚Äôre entering/exiting your turns. You‚Äôll be able to tweak you BP a lot better if you‚Äôre calm and collected going into the turn. I know it sounds boring but I went from a 1000cc bike to 390cc for the track and I‚Äôm learning SOOOOO much from that little bike. The straights suck but it can enter and exit turns with the same speed as any other bike. So just take it easy and use your track days as a a learning experience. The slower you go now the the faster you can go later. And it helps with having longevity in this hobby. Good luck!",1630454513

"MordekaiserMains","t5_37hva","This current iteration of Mordekaiser is a prime example of terrible design philosophy.

When you take an existing character and claim you're going to ""rework"" it, the core aspect of the character's previous gameplay should remain present.

However, in this case, the team in charge of reworking Mordekaiser decided to ignore the vast majority of his existing playstyle and instead opt for a ""top-down"" approach.

Now don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly wrong with applying a top-down design approach, but instances like these, where you have an established character to work with, are NOT the time to remotely consider doing such. If the intent was to use this ability set anyways, why not make an entirely new character instead of deleting a champ that they tossed to the side.",1630454513

"Schizoid","t5_2qxro","I need a home-base away from home. I keep a roster of a couple bars, coffee shops or restaurants that I'm more or less comfortable in. It takes a while to establish that relationship with a public place; lots of drive-bys, internet research, reading through the menu before I actually walk in. The first time I go someplace alone, I usually stay for 5 minutes tops. If I like it, I slowly crank it up from there. 

I bring a book everywhere, but a phone works too. I bring headphones in case I get overwhelmed. I learn where the bathroom is and find a usual order plus a backup in case they run out of my usual. Eventually, I get comfortable enough to sit without staring at the book. After a while, I get comfortable with the other people I see there regularly and the employees. Finally, conversation will happen. Someone will ask what I'm reading or I'll comment on a cool shirt. 

Coffee shops and bars tend to be friendly, chatty places, so eventually it can come to be a place where you can experience company on your own terms and leave whenever you want. Where you can meet relatives or old friends on your own turf, but not your home. And your relationship to a barista or fellow regular customer might develop into something like genuine friendship, eventually.",1630454513

Why not ban Sugar? Sugar has killed more people then the corona virus ever can or ever will... excess sugar leads to obesity and cardivascular disease... but do YOU demand people stop eating f'king sugar?

I used to have issues where temporary loss of connection (firewall reboot), or long periods with no data transfer caused the clients to disconnect, and required cycling the tunnel on the client. After adding a keepalive on the server and client, I've seen this issue go away.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","My SO, a DevOps engineer working at my company, accidentally upgraded his work laptop to Windows 11 a month ago. He swapped to the insider build stream a year or two ago to proactively fix an issue with locally hosted VMs not being able to coexist with WSL and never switched back to the stable stream. One morning, he booted up his laptop and it decided that day was the day to be on Windows 11, no prompt for upgrades at all.  
Yes, we've since blocked people from swapping to insider via GPO since he got upgraded, I narced on him to my own team :P He's well known to my team by virtue of dating me so we're using him as a guinea pig for this stuff now. All of our company mandated software still works with Windows 11 just fine, which is great for us from a management perspective (in comparison, MacOS releases always have to be blocked via Jamf because our software always breaks for a few months after it comes out)  

He personally doesn't mind Windows 11 at all, and he's the kind of guy to complain when sites like Youtube and Facebook overhaul their UI. His biggest Windows 10 gripe before was how the alert chime was loud and long, so if he was working out of WSL or another terminal and backspaced too much, he'd get bombarded with like 5 long dings in a row. The new chime is much softer and less jarring.    

He doesn't mind the UI changes, once he found the setting to move the start menu and task bar to the left he was set. The only thing I can foresee being an issue is how legacy/custom context menus in Windows Explorer are embedded in a sub menu (stuff like 7-zip and other custom application menus)   

I'm not sure what our org plan is to move people to Windows 11, but at least knowing everything won't break if people want to upgrade is reassuring. I'm sure we'll get some people who want to upgrade the day it comes out, so we'll have to start preparing for it. Before too long, new laptops will come with it by default. So long as Windows 10 is still supported, people will be able to hang onto it for a few more years.",1630454515

"progmetal","t5_2s3pe","Interesting review, but I just can't agree with it. Honestly, dynamics is what they did best here and they did an astounding work while at it. Toning down a knob, allowing cleans to be *shoegazey* cleans and vocals to be 80s-filled is what gives this album the punch and uniqueness most people are struggling to accept.

I honestly don't feel that the buildups go nowhere. Actually, they are definitely the high-notes of every song, and with each new section, the nuances added just lock you tight. The drumming is absolutely phenomenal and drives the songs while the rest of the instruments color the soundscapes. The vocals were definitely unexpected, but I'm glad they found a perfect balance between cleans and harshes. That's mixed vocals done right. While I do admit we could have had a tiny bit more harshes, the moments where they are used are unforgettable and feel natural to both the songwriting and the overall mood of the songs.

As someone who hadn't heard any of the singles *and* was not a huge fan of the band, this album might become my AOTY. The synths blew me away with a Bladerunner-esque atmosphere throughout the record, and Neptune Raining Diamonds was far from being just a generic transition.

If there's one thing I can complain about is that *sometimes* the cleans are not that varied, but the execution of it all just more than makes up for that. And, to be fair, most bands revered by this sub suffer from singing repetitiveness, the only difference being most people are just okay with it. I'm fascinated by this album and hope those who had a negative first impression decide to give it another shot. Sit in the darkness, put on your best headphones and just let the music take you on this journey.",1630454515

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","The way you solved it (by wrapping the recursive bit in a type) is essentially the right way. It's funny that you mention OCaml, because this is exactly what you have to do in OCaml.

OCaml lets you write e.g.

    type 'a tree =
      | Leaf
      | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree;;

it does not let you write

    type 'a tree = () | 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree;;

Just as in OCaml, you need something akin to a ""constructor"" to break the direct self-reference and ""tie the loop"".

---

But more importantly, I think the issue is that you really don't need `TExpression`, `TFactor`, and `TTerm` to be 3 separate types. You can simply write

    type TValue = number | string

    type TExpression =
      | { left: TExpression, operator: ""-"" | ""+"" | ""*"" | ""/"",  right: TExpression, }
      | { operator: ""!"" | ""~"" | ""-"", operand: TExpression }
      | TValue;

or, perhaps splitting these into pieces as

    type TValue = number | string

    type TExpression = TBinaryExpression | TUnaryExpression | TValue;

    type TBinaryExpression = { left: TExpression, operator: ""-"" | ""+"" | ""*"" | ""/"",  right :TExpression, };

there is no benefit to you to stratifying your types to match the shape of your grammar; you were trying to union them together originally anyway, so it's not like you'd *just* be dealing with e.g. the `*` and `/` operators as children inside an addition/subtraction; you'd have to deal with any kind of expression anyway. So you may as well update the types to actually _allow_ any kind of expression at each point in the tree.",1630454515

Quite frankly I have never worked a hardware change that had less than the better part of 100k as a cost to implement. Usually it's closer to a million.  Sometimes more than that.  

To be fair I am talking about changes to hardware in production which always just suck.  In development hardware is much easier to change.  The lead time issue though cannot be understated.  In many of the programs I've worked lead time is such a big aspect that you typically get your first set of parts, and then one more iteration.  After that you'll be blue wiring whatever you need as there is no more time.  

Software is complex and has its own problems.  But I can iterate and test light-years faster.  And again, you have a much easier time bringing in new algorithms or techniques as there is much lower cost if it doesn't pan out.",1630454516

But I don't know why you lose that much battery off of the sleep tracking stuff. I use the blood oxygen sensor and snore detection. I go to bed with 70% battery and I wake up with 64% battery. I also turn on do not disturb and good night mode before I do go to bed though. Maybe that helps?. So far after 3 days, I'm up to 44 hours on a full charge.

There are multiple season TV shows now that take their sweet time developing betrayals and reveals and films, especially action films, think they can devote 20 mins to it and make it connect? You would need a scene or dialogue that is out of this world to achieve that.

Even at a time where extended universes are a thing, it just never comes off as deep as they think on paper. The time component is a very real and hard wall to overcome. For a realtionship to feel good it has to be developed over multiple scenes and conversations and there just is not enough time to do it.

This is especially true in a Bond film where you know a good chuck of a film is going to be Bond flirting, Bond driving and location shots.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","&gt; I've been debating libertarians and free-market fundamentalists online for 30 years, and one thing that I've discovered that without almost no excpetions, those who strongly endorse capitalism a) cannot correctly define socialism, and b) either cannot correctly define capitalism, or define capitalism in a way that you learn in Econ 101 but has no relationship with reality, or both.

Actually, I know exactly what you mean as I have carried on some of those [largely futile] debates myself. Only to conclude it's like a debate between Mormons and Catholics, IOW, as pointless as a religious debate.

However, what I meant by ""good debate around here"" is to emphasize the ""here"", ie, among ourselves, supposed progressives. IOW, we, who mostly agree that Capitalism as an economic system is not only flawed but likely doomed. Yet, while we agree on the diagnosis of Capitalism's many ills, we have a tendency (we, as in all of us, myself included) to shove aside the prognosis, as in ""what can replace this system"". Meaning not some day in the future after Climate change made all our fancy debates quite moot, but now, in the near-term.

the debate I'm looking for is both philosophical (as in ""what are we as Homo Economicus"") and political (as in ""how on earth do we get from here to there"" whatever ""there"" is) and, of course, economical (because, well, any system has to be practical enough to have a chance to garner support).

And there are debates to be had. For example, I am on the same page as you (well, I think we agree on that per your last piece) with regard to eg, MMT, which sounds great , until one realizes it all depends on the $ remaining the reserve currency. After all, Argentina could not enact MMT without bringing on big time inflation, did they? but this is definitely a matter for debate. Perhaps MMT in the short term is a good band aid (which is kind of what is happening now though not in the direction and the competent management we'd like to see), and that's the best we can do for the moment to alleviate immediate suffering.

Ultimately I think it behooves all of us (those of us who read a little and are willing to think a little) to figure out what on earth can be do about those missing links: ""trust in government"" (severely lacking on all sides) and the corollary ''competence in execution"" (which requires both good will and ability, not readily found in a political system riveted by lobbies and trendiness).",1630454519

Did you even read my last statement?

We were discussing medical researchers and scientists, not Frontline health care workers.

They are human and they make mistakes (like anti-vaxxers injecting themselves with horse de-wormer).

Most hospitals are currently staffed by exhausted and over-worked doctors and nurses (if they haven't quit or contracted Covid themselves) trying to deal with a wave of avoidable serious infections because of idiots who refuse to be vaccinated.
Who knows, one day soon you or someone you care about will need them and they will be too tired and the hospital may be full (ours are at capacity now and patients are being treated in the car park). My daughter is a Paramedic and yesterday an ambulance had to be called and travel 100km from another city because all the Sydney ones were busy with Covid patients.

Maybe they'll make a mistake and kill you because of anti-vaxxers? 

Meanwhile, I will be at home with mild flu like symptoms should I catch Covid.

So enjoy, and I hope you don't kill someone you love.",1630454519

However, most people just provide a story as proof that usually consists of someone else saying they saw it, and not the raw data. So it is difficult for people that are bought into the opposite to believe it something else. 

Taking the time to go find the hard evidence is time consuming, which is why most people dont do it.  Especially when the person you are talking to is a dumbass anyhow, and will just fall for some other dumb nonsense tomorrow.. So most people also just say, fuck em. X]",1630454520

Yh, (with your example) 1/4 of pc and 0/4 want the exploit to continue but the only reason that they have disarray on the matter is because the platforms can intersect with each other and interfere with each other i.e pro controller players can beam upclose and pro pc players can do movement better. If we didnt have intersecting play in both platform and input methods it wouldnt really matter as the advantages of each platform wouldnt intersect and interfere with each other.

There is ZERO possibility that you actually got that high of a score with only 20 deaths if you consistently tried to capture the objective points throughout the match.

With this game 3 captures is actually 1 in reality as you essentially get 2 free captures per game.  You may have tried to capture throughout the match but clearly you were only successful 1 time.

Your score is impressive but it‚Äôs not everything and the score can easily be inflated with weapons like the war machine if you use it right.

Iron Kassadin vs average iron player = average iron player wins

Challenger Nasus vs average challenger player = average challenger player wins

Challenger Kassadin vs average challenger player = Kassadin wins

Dia kass main here so obviously a little bit biased but:

1. Nasus is a midgame, not a lategame champ (requires bad enemy teamcomp to become pickable and those are a lot more common in low elo).

2. Nasus is a toplaner, not a midlaner (easier role, can basically afk farm even in high elo until TP plays become common, at which point Nasus becomes useless because his early TPs are worthless anyway). Kassadin needs to understand how to get solo XP and gold while still playing the map, which is too complex for low elo.

3. Nasus is immobile and his outplay potential is very limited, Kassadin is the most mobile champ in the game.",1630454521

I'm full lebanese, but people are surprised. I don't care how I look too much as long as I'm healthy. I don't buy designer, never flash and I choose to bike  to university instead off taking the car. Lebanese pride is toxic, you don't owe the culture anything. 

I had no lebanese friends at all for long time. Became friends with some at university because they where chill. Honestly if they weren't lebanese I'd still be friends with them. Don't chase after the lebanese identity, it's alredy in you. You lived in lebanon that's more then most lebanese will experience. Now your diaspora lebanese we are an entire different group.

Okay, so I know crashes are common with stim meds‚Ä¶ but I feel like this is a lot. I‚Äôve been slowly changing my habits (drinking less, sleeping more, changed my job, therapy) to decrease my stress levels. I‚Äôve been suffering from pretty intense fatigue for over a year now. A few months ago I found out I had re activated EBV (mono) somehow after already having it as a child. So i thought okay, maybe it‚Äôs that. Maybe it‚Äôs also the Zoloft i take, but I‚Äôve been taking that for a while (2 years?). But, I am just so damn tired all the time, esp at 2 pm. I just crash. All motivation and energy flies out the window. I‚Äôm in college and finally doing better but Jesus, I can‚Äôt be this tired all the time. I make sure I eat, drink plenty of water‚Ä¶. I could go outside more maybe. I‚Äôm only 27, idk why I feel like I‚Äôm 80. I‚Äôve been checked for vitamin deficiency and it‚Äôs mostly good, just beed a little bit of b12 and d and I take vitamins for that. I‚Äôm just at a loss here. Does anyone else have these issues? 
 
For some back story: 
 
(Very summarized)

"vampiresfallorigins","t5_odt0o","PvP works fine.  Remember that it has a necessary random component, which can work for you or against you, and also that it has a limited number of choices against which to match you.   It compensates by weighing outcomes based on regular play levels as well as PvP levels (and possibly also equipment level).
So when  I defeat a player 10-15 levels above my own (uncommon, but it happens), I move up a whole rank, not just one notch; of course I usually lose against such players, but then I lose at most one notch and often my ranking remains unaffected.

I live in Hawaii, so I face the problem that very few people live in my time zone (or in the next two time zones on either side), which means very few players are active when I am.  But it still works out -- I do get wildly imbalanced opponents, but in both directions, so it all averages OK.",1630454522

"religion","t5_2qh39","&gt;Almost all growth involves suffering - whether it is developing an ability, or physical stamina or stretching one's mental capacity. And suffering itself often increases our capacities as humans - we strive to overcome, to help, to learn. But on the whole suffering exists because we live, as Christianity understands the world, in a broken and corrupted place, decayed by forces intent on sowing chaos and by human disobedience.

This is not a positive thing:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtfBKeFJ6xg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtfBKeFJ6xg)

&gt; But if reality ought to be a certain way, then it implies a good exists beyond reality

Reality ought to be how a tri-omni God wants it but it's not because suffering exists.

&gt;So if suffering isn't evil, it doesn't impugn God's goodness.

It's not evil, that implies agency, but it is bad a spectacularly so.

&gt;You used it when you cite Epicurus. You can't have it both ways - either there is a condition we can call evil or not.

Okay, then argue it with my editing in bold:

&gt;Is God willing to prevent **suffering**, but not able?  
&gt;  
&gt;Then he is not omnipotent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is he able, but not willing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Then he is malevolent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is he both able and willing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Then whence cometh **suffering**?  
&gt;  
&gt;Is he neither able nor willing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Then why call him God?",1630454523

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","It has, and I liked the politics of season 4, despite most people's complaints about it. But the thing is, I'm starting to see the cracks that television shows so often start to display, be it nonsensical decisions, the edginess of some characters, the pacing starting to pick up way too much speed or overall being off, and things ultimately not going anywhere (some of these may apply more to other shows I have in mind where I'm seeing the same cracks appear, but I believe they're all present in TLK).

It's been a while since I've seen season 4, but I was really disappointed by the attempt to take Bebbanburg. Like seriously, wtf was that? Just a gratuitous way to kill Beocca? And it felt like it happened in a flash. I'd have to watch it again, I suppose, but it just started to feel a bit worse than the 1st 2 seasons. And I think in the books Uhtred manages to take Bebbanburg, right? And I believe kills his uncle? Why would they deny this huge payoff for the character, just to have some nobody steal that away in the blink of an eye? What in the name of god????

Then their children will have to chose between caring for their parent and having a job, because very few jobs pay enough that you can actually afford the medical care. Ultimately you'll have the parents out of their house and the children out of a job.

- Change the baby and hope it wakes her up
- talk to the baby so she is awake enough to breastfeed 
- breastfeed 
- pump
- feed her any pumped milk I made
- give her formula if she as still hungry
- repeat every two hours, perhaps three hours over night

In the beginning, I would get about 30-45 minutes to myself before the cycle repeats again.  This is when I showered, toileted, ate, took my meds and slept.  Thankfully, my milk came in after a week. She had jaundice so it was a bit of extra work to make sure she was never dehydrated.

"argentina","t5_2qlht","Mepa que tiene raz√≥n el texto, al menos en buena parte. Es cierto que no solo se han tolerado sino impulsado formas bastante t√≥xicas de expresar y manifestar afecto a un nivel rom√°ntico por la otra persona. No s√© si exclusivamente del hombre hacia la mujer, pero definitivamente ha ocurrido esto. Y obviamente est√° de m√°s decir lo mal que estaba la restricci√≥n del amor rom√°ntico homosexual. Debe haber sido horrible para ellos que la sociedad los tratar√° de enfermos por querer cojer y quererse rec√≠procamente con otro ser humano adulto y con consentimiento que da la casualidad que era del mismo sexo que ellos. 

Creo que en los √∫ltimos a√±os se ha hecho cierto progreso con el tema de la toxicidad en relaciones rom√°nticas, y es de las no muchas cosas buenas que asoci√≥ a la corriente woke. Ya no se tolera (o al menos se cuestiona) el presionar a la otra persona a tener sexo, el revisarle el celular sin permiso, el no dejarla/o salir con amigos, y en general se rechaza mucho m√°s el maltrato psicol√≥gico, que antes se excusaba m√°s con el ""lo hago porque te quiero"". 

Por supuesto siguen existiendo vestigios de paradigmas m√°s atrasados. El tratar a una piba de trola por ""mostrarse mucho"", el ridiculizar a un pibe al que su novia lo domina o le pega, el tratar de ponerle excusas a un pibe violento, la boludez est√° de proponer matrimonio en p√∫blico presionando a la otra persona a decir que si, y la good old ""pibe que estuvo con muchas ganador, piba que estuvo con muchos puta"".

"RaidShadowLegends","t5_npfgx","What pisses people off is that what plarium does slows peoples 'progression'. 
You are right that they do NOT care what people have to say, it will change nothing. Where plarium have made changes that were asked for, they were changes they were going to make anyway, not because it was asked for.Indeed, plariums only goal is to squeeze as much money from it's player base as possible and no amount of peoples moaning and whining will change that.
I have noticed that because of the state of the world right now my shopping bill is going up and the food products are getting smaller. In fact, some products have recently HALVED in size. If i complained to the companies about this they would give every excuse under the sun as to WHY they have had to make their products smaller in size, but they will not admit what is true and that is that they simply HATE profits to be reduced, and they will keep profits up even if it means children will have to starve to death.
Unless you have at some point in your life had ALOT of money, you will not understand that those that have it are TERRIFIED to lose it.I suspect that because so many people have lost their livelihoods because of ALL governments around the world taking such tyrannical covid measures, that many spenders were spending less or not at all. Plarium would not have felt bad for those people, they would have felt worried that profits were down for them. This shows in the changes they have been making ingame. They have been constantly making changes in DT to make it harder and make the whales spend more to make up for it's losses. They have fusions that most of the playerbase cannot keep up with. They have been hitting free rewards harder than ever so you have less good recources for free. They have made it harder to get books while at the same time making booking champions in CvC give very high points so you run out.
Look, at the end of the day Plarium want to fleece you, you know that. So the choice is yours, you either quit or play. Moaning about the game may vent some stress but it won't change a thing. Personally, i hope a new game gets released that will destroy raid. Plarium deserve to lose it's bread and butter.",1630454525

I‚Äôve always thought of vernaculars as the products of history.

Quit hiding behind some faux woke aversion to ‚Äúgender role normalcy‚Äù and just admit, regardless of gender, orientation or what have you, your behavior (IRRESPECTIVE OF HER OWN INCONSIDERATE BEHAVIOR) was childish, ridiculous,petty AF and lame.

If you REALLY want to flex your self respect without being a whiny passive aggressive twit, you would have informed her before or after she showed up with some variation of: 

‚ÄúHey, whatever you reasons, legit or otherwise notwithstanding, my time is valuable and I don‚Äôt appreciate people who don‚Äôt respect that. I wish you the best but if this is representative of how you engage with people, you are not the person for me-good luck.‚Äù

I was really nervous the first time I ordered from them because the price was roughly half of what I paid in a brick and mortar. Because of my concern, I bought the exact frames that I already owned. I figured, if they were fake I would return them (or file a dispute with my CC) and if they were legit, I would keep them as a backup pair. The pair I received from EZ were identical to the pair I bought from the store. I work in a laboratory, so I weighed both pairs (minus lenses) and they weight exactly the same. The other pairs I purchased since were legit as well‚Ä¶ 

My only complaint is that they take FOREVER to ship. My first pair took 28 days for delivery, the second took 21, and the third took 18‚Ä¶ this is definitely not the 3-5 business days that they indicated on their website. But IMO, the cost savings is worth the wait.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","What about the other nation? Same goes for them but the topic was China. Bootlickers can only repeat ""What about..."" like a parrot. 

Lithuania simply had foreign relations with Taiwan and the Chinese government immediately threw a temper tantrum over the country and withdrew it's embassy. Alliances mean jack shit. Every country is allied with some others. 

China recently allied the Taliban. I guess Xi became very devoted to Allah but still doesn't care about Uyghurs lmao. 

You think China's wolf warrior diplomacy is badass? Maybe for dumbass bumpkins but in official matters posturing is cringe and showcases insecurity rather than strenght.

Nouveau rich douchebags have to make everything gold and flashy to showcase their wealth but it doesn't impress actually rich people who still buy expensive things but not tacky and flashy. For example, Trump is a failure of a businessman so he needed to make a golden apartment to make himself look succesful. 

And yet you mock Biden for having a stutter? Looking cool doesn't make you a better leader and stuttering doesn't make you a worse one. 

You think dictatorship and authoritarianism is ok but that's your opinion. There are literal neo-nazis and Stalinists in the world and I don't care what they think. 

China is not Hitler but Hitler was authoritarian and all authoritarians are trash. 

Of course they don't view it as a dictatorship. North Korea calls itself democratic. Most countries aren't fair democracies but they still call themselves so and call the leaders ""president"". 

Is it a dictatorship?

Well how long does the leaders term last?

How many parties are there and do they follow different ideologies?

What happens to you if you openly criticize the government?

How frequent are elections and how much does the government tamper with the results? Who can vote?

I value freedom highly by philosophy and I will never like authoritarian states or dictators. The French had invented a device for than in the 18th century.

They clearly did this so that they could a) cynically use it as an election issue, and b) time it for **after** the election to avoid exactly these optics we are seeing now. And I'm certain that that was what happened because I was in Syria/Iraq when the previous administration tried to do almost this exact thing to the SDF in 2018 to use as an issue in the midterms.

I'm furious with the current administration for abiding by an agreement they shouldn't have been bound by, seeing as ""not attacking western forces"" was just about the only facet of the agreement the Taliban actually upheld. They can make a lot of noise about how they won't let AQ Core attack the United States, but that's essentially meaningless when AQ Core can use its safe haven to provide resources and direction to one of its myriad affiliates to do the actual execution phase of an attack.

I'm furious because, in my opinion, the current administration ignored what they were told was likely to happen, and trying to call it an intelligence failure.  They fundamentally misunderstand the nature of intelligence; people act like because the IC didn't call the collapse down to the day/hour like there wasn't a clear trendline in what the WH was being told.  I truly believe that the current POTUS is biased because he believes the burn pits killed his son, even though to my knowledge there's no direct evidence of it.

I'm furious because despite the current buzzword of ""over the horizon counterterrorism"" that is going around now, that type of thing only works when you have an intelligence network on the ground. No specifics obviously but if you want collection you need personnel, which unless we start arming Massoud we no longer have a partner to enable collection. What this is going to mean in practice is we'll be back to hitting empty buildings with TLAMs because we don't have real time information, and doing hare-brained schemes like paying some pashto hillbillies to trunk monkey UBL like we were doing in the late 90s. 

Not to mention the nonzero chance that this whole clownshow combined with the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11 sets off a new wave of inspired attacks.

I'm also just tired of the glib ""thank you for your service"" and condescending attitudes I'm seeing in things like POTUS' speech today, and the disingenuous virtue signalling from the GOP. And every time I see the press throw up a veterans' crisis line after just kind of letting veteran SIV advocates come on and not addressing their frustrations, it just makes me want to vomit.

Idunno I just vented a lot. I could go on. While I'm pretty conflicted, I feel like ultimately withdrawing is the right thing; but when we get hit with some kind of spectacular attack in a couple of years, the same people who are saying this was 100% the right decision are gonna be on tv saying with a straight face that we never should've left.",1630454531
"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","A lot of men either don't understand or pretend they don't understand how dangerous it is to be a woman. There are a lot of men who just hate women, they will pick you out of a crowd to harass you. Whatever it takes to ruin your day and shit on you because your a lady. One guy tried to back into me as I was walking behind his truck into a convenience store.  He had just gotten in the truck, not like he was waiting on me and he definitely did it just to scare a lady. Some fat asshole at the walgreens decides to confront me for something he's imagined - my day ruined. Getting out of a dangerous relationship and have a weak support network? Several guys start messaging you on facebook recognizing your vulnerable and they can be a creep. It's already dangerous enough, add to it these people who are openly hateful and abusive, the countless who back them up, it feels bleak at times.",1630454531

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","A lot of people get flak because they dehumanize people in the process of complaining primarily about the optics of unhoused people and mentally ill folks. Lots of these people live in the burbs or outside Portland, where polls have shown people think the unhoused are a bigger problem than folks who live in closer proximity. 

Do we deserve to live in a pretty city without trash or unsightly tents? Where people walk around feeling safe? Yeah! This is the most powerful country on earth! It should be a no brainer for our society to provide that.

But if we've built a society that allows so many people to fall through the cracks, then perhaps we don't deserve not to look at the consequences. Some of the people who complain about the unhoused and trash want to have their cake and eat it too.

I don't think it's an issue that Portland can really fix on its own. If you're a politician in a more conservative rural community or state, how are you motivated to provide community healthcare? Your unhoused folks and those experiencing addiction or mental health issues are going to go to Portland or another city where there is more resources. Then you can  blame Portland's progressive policymakers for the state of the city. We heard a lot of rhetoric like that during the past election cycle. It's not a problem that Portland or any other city created on it's own, but it's a problem that liberal cities and their governments are taking all the heat for. 

We should bring back federal grants for community based healthcare. They were short lived, but it was a thing that existed in the late 70's after institutionalization fell out of favor. They were repealed under the Regan admin (who also started a war on drugs, virtually guaranteeing that many folks experiencing mental health, addiction and houslesness would end up in the criminal justice system).",1630454531

To be honest you sound like you‚Äôre allowing him to use you and step all over you. Please know your worth. I can‚Äôt wait for you to graduate and have a job, you may just realize his paycheck is as worthless as he is.

I usually suggest couples therapy, but the lack of self-respect here (allowing your husband to use you for 24/7 childcare, allowing people to call you a nag, a bitch, etc) shows that you need therapy to help you find your voice &amp; help you realize you deserve respect &amp; an equal partnership.

No kill pressure.

If you win with seraphine mid you would win with any other mage too.

If you want to play Seraphine you can Just Play Zilean or Orianna.
They are stronger, better utility, DMG and Impact.

Zileans Double Q is 100000 Times better.
 Low CD, Deals more DMG and stuns AoE.
He has a Point and Click 99% Slow/MS Buff and a Guardian Angel Ult.


Double Q Seraphine Base DMG 230 + 130% AP.

E Base damage 140+ 35% AP Scaling

R  250+ 60 AP

Seraphine at lvl 18 Deals with

QQER 620 + 225% DMG

Zilean QQ Deals 600 +180% at lvl 9.

He has the Base DMG of her with 1 maxed Spell while she needs 2+Ultimate.

With seraphine If you use Double W in a Teamfight you lose half your DMG of your already Low DMG Spell.

**What do you think of Iesha and how she protected DeVante and her kids? Do you think she will cooperate with the investigation into King?**


Iesha is a victium of abuse and I thought that it was obvious what she was doing for her children and their friends. I really felt for her 
because she thinks she's trapped and maybe she is but in the end she did what she thought to be best for her kids. Although I don't like the type of person she is and I don't like her choices, I can respect what she did for DeVante, her kids and her kid's friends.  I do think she'll cooperate with the investigation against King.


**They discussed names and what makes a name ""normal"" and a ""white standard."" What do you think? (I know a white Leroy and a white Tyrone.)**


I really really liked this whole scene. It really puts you into Starr's 
shoes and gives you the idea that normal is subjective and although I do believe that, I've never really thought about it when it comes to names.


**Who wasn't surprised how the verdict went? Did the protests go down like you thought they would?**


I was not surprised by the verdict. Disappointed, yes, but it's the 
reality of the world we live in. Thank the Universe that George Flyod 
got some justice but it's still only the beginning and I hope we can 
continue to make progress instead of continued stagnation. The protest went just as I thought they would. But Starr's involvement through me for a loop and I loved it.  



**What do you think about Chris staying with Starr through the riots and fire?**


I'm so glad Chris stayed. Not only because I believe it says a lot 
about how he feels about Starr but also because it shows that he 
recognizes that there is a problem with the system and that action
does make more of a statement than just words. 



**What surprised you the most in this part? What was your favorite part/most powerful part in the entire book?**


I was surprised by Hailey not recognizing the errors of her ways. I 
really thought she would come around and was so disappointed in her when she did not.


I was also surprised by how powerful I thought the novel was, it honestly was just so moving and hopeful. I'm honestly a huge pessimist especially when it comes to things with the U.S. government. I've given up with thinking that humanity has a promising future but this book gave me a little more hope that maybe we could go in the right direction. 


My favorite part of the novel was hands down the last two pages. What a way to end it. Like I said I'm honestly a pessimist but with such a strong ending it was hard not to feel hopeful. 


**Who do you think had the most character growth throughout the book?**
Mavrick and Starr. 



**What do you think Starr would be doing now? (The book took place in 2016 or 2017, so that makes her born in 2000 or 2001.)**


I like to think that she is 100% an activist and maybe even has a key role with Just Us for Justice (or BLM).",1630454533

"wildrift","t5_24knsa","&gt; ""How do we reward people who play fair?""

This is very easy, increase blue mote rewards per game marginally per non-afk game in a row up to a cap of 25 or something. You could cram in all sorts of easy to develop shit into the game.  Don‚Äôt afk 50 games in a row? You get an icon. 100 games? You get a spawn emblem. 1000 games? You get a spawn speed-buff animation.

Any sort of ‚Äúin a row‚Äù reward will make people think twice about leaving or playing while they have a bad connection or when they don‚Äôt have enough time.  

Sometimes shit happens and you disconnect or an emergency comes up, but People who get multiple leaver marks in a short time period should receive at least a 24 hour ban, possibly much much more.  

People returning from a ban should be ‚Äúon probation‚Äù and receive much higher penalties for a repeat offense during the probation phase.

In any case where report-checking is not automated, people receiving a full team report should be elevated.  People receiving reports from the enemy team should be elevated.  Reports found to be fraudulent (not just an overreaction) should result in report-muting, for your own sanity.

Tremendously poor performance should result in heavy MMR reduction.  I‚Äôm not talking about going 0/5/8, but I have games with 0/15/3 allies pretty routinely. This would be hard to implement, but if everyone on the team is positive and one guy is 0/15, he is trolling and should be banned or clearly doesn‚Äôt belong there and needs his MMR adjusted.",1630454534

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","My guess is that since it's a hard coded modifier, and you applied one with the same UUID, the hard coded one replaces the one you added. And then something causes it not to update again when you stop sprinting (prompting you to switch items to regain the attribute). And also since the modifier is hard coded, the game can be set up to only apply it while the player is sprinting. However, when you apply the modifier with an item, there's nothing telling it to only apply while sprinting (which is why you get the boost just while walking).

Yeah yeah, I know, ""you don't know what REAL communism is bro"". 

But more to the point, who the FUCK are you to tell someone else what to do with their money. Only assholes count other peoples money.

It's sadly a gray area, as the EU doesn't mix, so law makers just don't really thing of this and laws don't really mention it. So you can trust responses on the Internet and ""risk it"" or cancel your trip, as there is no official source that mentions mixing.


So you sadly won't get what you ask for. However mind you, if you are coming by LOT Polish Airlines you can contact their customer service with the issue, and maybe they can reassure you. If you are coming indirectly via another Schengen Area airport (say Amsterdam, Paris CDG, Frankfurt etc) you could also ask does countries officials, as the local authorities will be deciding your travel fate. Polish ones check no passports on inner Schengen flights, and check vaccination/test status at random (mostly don't) and can't turn you around (can max give you quarantine, but if somehow you meet an official that tries if you have any certificate, just ask for their superior).

Generally speaking, reality TV shows typically want at least 5 months between shooting and airing for editing, revisions, creation of bumper ads and teaser trailers, etc.   Covid restrictions might have bumped that around some.   They also generally don't begin edits until everything is done, so they can ""thread a story"" and details made important at the end can be edited INTO the show.

For example, say they are shooting an episode and once of the business owners will not stop yammering about his mother, who is not relevant to the business.  You would edit that out, of course.   But what if the business owner is a no-show at the ""grand re-opening with Marcus"" at the end, and it turns out his mother was in an accident and died and he went to be with her.

Downsides of this weapon is that it's very ammo hungry, meaning that it will consume a lot of your ammo overtime, has a wide spread and bloom when fired continuously, and a long reload time.  
  
The best perks for the **Monsoon** are: CR, (MagSize or RS or DMG), Element, CD , DmgToConditional, (Affliction, Snare, or Ramping Damage)

The people who believe these lies need to see the damage is real, so posting pictures of their leaders that are dead because of covid is necessary.  If it helps one person decide to get vaccinated, a good deed has been done.   It's more similar to making the German soldiers and townspeople tour the death camps to see first hand the nightmare they were fighting for.  Some people need the shock of reality to believe the truth. 
I used to be the kind of person that went the extra mile to see good in anyone, and to never wish ill on even the meanest person, but the longer I live, the more I realize that there is a large group of people who truly want many of us dead because of religion or skin color.  I've decided that their lives shouldn't matter to me either.  I feel good mocking them when their plans backfire and they either die or go to jail. Because their plans are heinous. The irony is how they're killing themselves off by not trusting science.  Of course they have loved ones who are devastated by their passing,  but the world is better off without them.

Retreat to your rooms, find an advantageous position to engage.

Hide around a corner and ambush them, so the lancers can't shoot from afar? Retreat away from your base and ambush them one at a time? 

Insanity lance one of the scythers and laugh at the rest of them?

Or just get a comms console earlier and call for help. Let others handle the problem.

On the tactical level, you could be more flexible in controlling your troops. Get some practice in fighting places beyond your kill zone. Learn some combat tactics and counters.

On a strategic level, get essentials like 1 EMP grenade, a comms console. Learn to accept your base being trashed a bit. Focus on melee early on, as they are super good. Get a few shield belts. Get a few trump cards like doomsday. 

Learn to estimate your enemies. Sometimes, you just had to wake up people in their pods.

Or just turn down the difficulties if you really want to roleplay. The standard difficulty is called ""adventure story"". You are expected to focus strategically on survival, and be able to tactically command your troops beyond ""get in cover, and shoot in that direction"". Don't be fooled by the people here playing on harder difficulties. It does not mean adventure story should be easy mode. Some memes are harder than others, too.",1630454538

Revelation 14:11 KJV

&gt;And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
Revelation 22:19 KJV

&gt;But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they **wearied themselves to find the door.**
Genesis 19:10‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨11 KJV

&gt;**I am the door**: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
John 10:9 KJV

All sin is not the same:

&gt;Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the **greater sin.**
John 19:11 KJV

Mark 12:40 KJV

&gt;If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. **There is a sin unto death**: I do not say that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin: **and there is a sin not unto death.**

"Torontobluejays","t5_2sb61","&gt;The only difference is that you have zero optimism and consistently shit on anyone who suggests anything different.

That's hilarious, so because this team isn't good enough, and having a differing opinion (which has been right up until this point), based on how the team is playing, is now called shitting on people? Sure, bud. Optimism is great. So show me how they're in a wildcard spot. We can't even say they're trending in the right direction because the whole offence has shit the bed for 3 weeks. We don't even know if Ray is coming back next season. I guess we'll find out. And let's not forget that the 3 other teams in the East are going to load up against for next season. Toronto FO better have a solid plan. I don't want to hear bullshit injury excuses next season, because the Dodgers / Yankees and SD had huge injuries all season and were getting it done (SD has slid and is barely hanging on now).

I have plenty of optimism......I will gladly change my tune, WHEN this team gets to 15 games over .500 this season.

Playing around .500 is absolute garbage with the ""talent"" on this team that we saw in the first half of the season. 8 games over .500 IS middling, meaning, they've only won 53% of their games, which is close to half, which is middling, They are .500 vs the American League at the end of August...THAT is middling. Their record in night games is garbage as well, 7 games under .500.

This team hasn't proven shit yet. And by the way the MLB is opening up the wildcards to everyone next season, enjoy that watered down wildcard race in the name of making up lost revenue from the pandemic. So the Jays have no excuses anymore about playing in the AL EAST because MLB will make it easier for everyone (get a balanced schedule already).

I'm glad a lot of people have changed their tune in this sub and are finally seeing the smoke and mirrors of the offence by reading a lot of posts in here the last week.....lol. 

Hopefully next season we'll see something better and this team will start putting their foot on teams' throats. They haven't even shown that this season.

Enjoy the rest of the season.",1630454540

"ChubbyFIRE","t5_wuxe9","I invest in REITs, and when I started I had a very similar rationale! 
-	I don‚Äôt intend to buy property in the VHCOL/HCOL area that I currently live in. 
-	I‚Äôm a bit too busy to ‚Äúactively‚Äù research and invest in real estate, so I find REITs to be a nice way to diversify my portfolio. 
-	I hold some riskier investments like TQQQ (and probably as a result of that, I feel like I‚Äôm overexposed to the tech sector.) 

When I ‚Äòresearch‚Äô about REITs, I look at a few things:
-	what types of buildings they own: hospitals and care homes; warehouses; data centers; offices; convenience stores; 
-	who are the tenants: links directly back to the previous point - what types of businesses rent from the property owned by the REITs? Are they sensitive to the economy? Are they big name brands? Are they growing in size? 
-	how sticky / stable are the tenants: check how fully occupied the properties are
-	how much do they pay in dividends, and has it been increasing over time: as REITs are basically a dividend-paying model, a good way to check how they are doing is to check the long term trend of the dividend payments. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a lot, I value stability.

A few other reasons I like REITs:
-	Nice way of generating passive income. A lot of REITs pay monthly or quarterly dividends. Just keep buying more and you will be able to see it snowballing quite quickly.
-	Built in leverage. These REITs buy property with‚Ä¶ a lot of leverage. As I have my fair share of risky, ‚Äòleveraged‚Äô investments, I like the idea of having more leverage at a low cost to myself. 
-	No property taxes. Every step of buying and selling property (and owning propery) costs money. It‚Äôs a hassle free way of owning property without directly paying these taxes.

In the US, I personally quite like O because of its monthly dividends!",1630454541

Title: **There's a mattress in the ally leaning up against my fence, it used to be leaning up against a large dumpster but I think the garbage men moved it with ""the claw"". Who's responsible for this thing?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'm pretty sure my crackhead neighbors are the ones who thought it was ok to put an 2' thick king sized mattress against the dumpster and that it would magically go away, but it hasn't and it's been there for a week now. People driving down the ally are having to squeeze by it and it's soaking wet with rain water.
&gt; 
&gt; I sure as hell don't want to move it, I can't anyway because I'm at work the only time the dump is open.
&gt; I can't complain to my crackhead neighbors because the police raided their house 3 days ago and nobody's been back there since.
&gt; 
&gt; The worste part is that **I** look like the dumbass because it's laying on my fence and by the garbage I use, there's a big dumpster like this about every other house going down the ally.
&gt; 
&gt; Who do I call that's going to give a shit about this? Who's responsibility is it when I can't prove who drug it out there?

I do once in a while postpote a training or two, but on average it doesn't overexceed the 2 day boundry. I doubt i could have done it without one of my old friends that talked me into starting sports and coached me for a full year of lifting. May all of you find a friend of this type like i did.

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

What it's inspired: A dungeons and dragons antagonist for my modern-day-game planned of a circus ringleader avatar of the internet. Ideas so far include a blending of circus-ringleader-costume and grunge-tech-hipster appearance. Basically a tophat and one of those tailed waistcoats, but the waistcoat will be flannel patterned. Also featuring a t-shirt with a hashtag on it, and of course a scepter and whip. Also a snidely-whiplash mustache. 

He will essentially be introduced like Siri, as a phone's default personality and voice. still working out encounters, but the goal will not exactly be to defeat the internet - it's too big, it's like a force of nature - but to interact with it only on your own terms, and to refuse to interact with it on it's own. although, i could also imagine him capturing the PCs and turning them into sideshow attractions, like how twitter seems to select someone to be their hate-effigy for the day.

He's not the main protagonist - the main one is a larger active threat to the world. However, the Ringleader and his technology will actively prevent the PCs from even noticing that threat if not dealt with first. It's hard to get further in life if you are sucked into YouTube or Twitter or Reddit all the time.",1630454543

I am not questioning that.

What I am asking to those who argue that Covid vaccines should be mandatory, what is your threshold in terms of death per year to make you take the stand that a vaccine should be mandatory.  Since no one seems to argue that the flu vaccine should be mandatory, I am assuming they think the threshold is higher than 60,000 deaths per year.  How much higher do we need to go before we start arguing that the vaccine should be mandatory.

The fallout from the military intervention in Afghanistan hasn't truly begun to hit home yet. There's a very good chance that this could lead to a full collapse of the American global hegemony. After all, the Soviets failed in Afghanistan (partially because America was funding the Taliban against them) and then a few years later, there was no Soviet Union anymore.   


I believe that something similar is going to happen to America. It may take a little longer, but our entire system is also a house of cards rotting away from the inside. The rot simply may not be at the same level as that of the Soviet Union yet.",1630454543

A bunch of other clubs and backroom associates I've talked to also confirmed $18. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best guess as to this random 15 discrepancy for backroom is bad club management. They code the backroom as secondary, but keep their primary job code as w/e (aka merch), and as your primary job code reflects your pay, you end up making 15 for a position worth 18. Saving the company/club money and budget etc.. And ofc schedule  you as your secondary (so you pop up in the system as backroom)

Nothing is wrong with me.  You don't seem to realize an absolute shock and surprise of the quickness of the Taliban advance and collapse of the Afghan government is a reflection of the failure of the Military and Intelligence agencies of realizing the facts of the situation.  That falls on the man on top. Biden.  Is that fair?  No.  Did Biden personally inspect and collect this intelligence?  Of course not. But he's the one accountable for the ones under him.  That's how the cookie crumbles.  Its on him.

We are usually trying to fix cleavage, not create it, but based on reverse advice, here goes.

Cleavage is generally caused by the bra being too small in some manner, usually in the cups. So you could look for bras whose style you like and go a size or two down. You could also put inserts in, instead of going smaller, or both.

Simply put i was diagnosed with Covid pneumonia this winter : hospitalized and put on a regiment of drugs that I can not even remember now 

Was really sick for two months, out of work for a month, lost over 30 pounds and sadly most of that was muscle . 

It has taken me sincerely six plus months to get back to anything that closely resembles my old running self . 

Mostly notably i lost speed . My average run time is just down and  yeah it has taken me awhile to get my stamina back as well. However, I am still not back yet. 

My advice is be real gentle with yourself . I don‚Äôt know how bad your symptoms are but before I did anything I went to my doctor and got cleared to run again . Then I just took it really easy and would honestly cry when I couldn‚Äôt run half a mile before stopping. 

I think the emotional toll of it sincerely out weights the sickness because running is my coping mechanism for almost everything.

I sincerely wish you the best of luck and pray you have a speedy recovery!",1630454548

Australia's can be found [here.](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-ahmppi.htm)

They make for very interesting reading as they show how much the landscape has changed. In particular look at what the WHO says is ""not recommended in any circumstances"" in the summary on p3.

In the Australian plan (an uglier report), you need to go to p122 and read through the recommendations on each NPI. There are some elements that can be compared, but overall there's nothing about pursuing long term lockdowns (or similar, the word didn't exist), or anything quite like this, or locking people out of the country, or in. And overall the plan is massively more respectful to human rights than what we have ended up doing.",1630454548

"danganronpa","t5_2wcd0","Personally, I'd give it to Toko. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start, her visual design is pretty damn good. Danganronpa has always had incredibly strong character designs that perfectly communicate these characters' talents and personalities. Toko's design in particular is great: although the ""Japanese school girl with glasses and braids"" design is fairly prominent, Toko herself has come to own the look in the decade since she made her first appearance. The moody colour scheme matches her pessimistic outlook, and the super long skirt indicates that she has something to hide (that being Genocide Jack's kill tally on her thigh), complimenting her attempts to keep others out.  In Ultra Despair Girls, her design stays mostly the same, with the only major differences being that her braids are now undone, leaving her hair wild and messy, and her skirt is torn, leaving Jack's kill tally visible. This is symbolic of her growth from her time in Hope's Peak, as she now has the courage to be open about who she is, and no longer has to worry about her situation, but instead do something to fix it. She also has an ahoge because she's the protagonist now.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing this to Komaru, while I don't believe that she's badly designed, her outfit is kinda bland. Now that's completely intentional, as Komaru is an average citizen, and I like how her uniform is taken from the school she wanted to attend, it's a nice touch. However, while there isn't anything particularly wrong with Komaru's design, it's nothing special. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although most people didn't like Toko as a character until Ultra Despair Girls, I actually think she was pretty cool in the first game. While initially coming off as abrasive and rude, her attempts at roasting people come off as kind of endearing at times. Maybe it's due to the voice acting from Amanda Celine Miller, or maybe it's because of how random some of the things she says, but these are more funny than hurtful, and she's a lot of fun to listen to. Then when you learn about her past through her free time events, about her horrible home life and lack of friends growing up, you totally understand how she ended up like this. You want to help her grow as a person, and by the end of her FTEs, she appears to have come out of her shell and considers Makoto a genuine friend.

&amp;#x200B;

And that brings us to Ultra Despair Girls. After everything she went through in the first game, she's much more confident and mature, but she's still rather hostile with some growing to do. This leads to her meeting with Komaru, and throughout the game the two of them develop a strong friendship as they fight to escape Towa City. 

&amp;#x200B;

Komaru's arc within Ultra Despair Girls is a strong one about learning to take control over your situation and carve your own future, even if you feel like you have no power or talent. She starts the game helpless to her captors' power and afraid to do anything about it, but by the end she has become much more confident and mature, ready to take her fate into her own fans. Does that sound familiar? Because Komaru's development mirrors that of Toko's.

&amp;#x200B;

Komaru and Toko's relationship is so strong because the development these two characters have undergone is so fundamentally similar. In the first game, Toko has undergone everything that Komaru is going through now, and because Toko has that experience she's able to take on a mentor role for Komaru and help her in navigating the world. In addition to this, Komaru's kindness enables Toko to come out of her shell, and give her one of the only real friends she's had in her life (including Makoto of course). This friendship is extremely heart-warming: Toko helps Komaru, just as Makoto helped her, and Komaru makes Toko happier than she's ever been before. (I swear this isn't a shipping thing)

&amp;#x200B;

With all that I've been saying in this post I seem to be very positive towards both of them, so what exactly makes me like Toko more? If I had to justify it in an objective way, I'd say that it's because she's had more screen-time than Komaru that gives her an advantage. Not only does this give her a much easier chance to make an impression on the player's, but it also helps give her development in UDG more impact because we know how she was in the first game, and we can see for ourselves just how far she's come. Maybe this reason makes the comparison sound unfair, as Toko has basically had double the screen-time of Komaru, but I do think this makes Toko an overall more well developed character, and that's why I think she is better. No disrespect to Komaru or her fans, I just prefer Toko.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, all of this is only talking about Toko herself, I'm not even getting into Genocide Jack. That being said, if I had to give my brief thoughts on her: Genocide Jack is hilarious and every word that come out of her mouth is gold.",1630454550

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","Gold lucio here and I agree. In a team fight tracer should be very capable to surprise a lucio to finish him off but in a 1v1 Lucio has the advantage. Lucio has better movement (able to move vertically and also more sustained movement) and more self sustain (through his passive heal) plus a boop to keep distance and his projectiles will do more damage at a distance. If tracer does get close enough to do significant damage, lucio should be able to land just a few headshots + melee + boop combo for a kill THATS just as fast (if not faster) than a tracer 1-clip + melee.

Good tracer will be a problem but IMO lucio has advantage",1630454550

"AsOneAfterInfidelity","t5_fxuis","r/AsOneAfterInfidelity is an online [peer-to-peer support group](https://peersupportcanada.ca/) and a [safe space](https://www.lexico.com/definition/safe_space) for people navigating the long and difficult process of reconciling after infidelity. Betrayed and wayward partners are equally welcome.   

**Observers who are not actively part of a reconciling couple are discouraged from commenting.** Everyone is expected to respect the rules and, most importantly, each other.

Please assign yourself a user flair. Instructions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/flair_instructions)).

For a list of abbreviations commonly used in this subreddit, see the [Acronym Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/acronym_guide).

Also check out our list of free resources and recommended books for post-infidelity recovery, found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/resources).        

RULES

**1. Be respectful**

- Keep comments supportive and constructive.

- Avoid leaving rude, unkind or dismissive comments.

- Keep in mind that infidelity is traumatic and the sub's members are likely struggling with very difficult emotions. Don't make it worse. Offer thoughtful support, not shallow judgments.

- *Repeated or gross violation of this rule will result in a temporary or permanent ban.*

**2. No personal attacks or victim-blaming of any kind**

- Do not demean, attack or insult anyone, even if you disagree with them.

- *Violation of this rule justifies a permanent ban. Zero tolerance.*

**3. No misogyny, misandry, bigotry, racism or other hate speech**

**4. Do not tell someone to just leave the relationship**

- The purpose of this subreddit is to give mutual support and insight amongst people whose goal is saving and improving damaged relationships.

**5. Posts must be directly related to RECONCILIATION**

- Posts by new users about ending relationships are better suited to r/SurvivingInfidelity.

- *Any unrelated posts will be removed.*

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1630454551

Really, I'm just getting very disenfranchised with white collar industries as a whole. I truly love to work -- I started working 30ish hours a week over summers when I was 12 and I'd had seven jobs across a fairly wide array of industries before I entered college -- but I genuinely feel much more exploited in white-collar jobs. Someone's making a shitton more money than me for doing much less work, and that really rubs me the wrong way. Can't really be an independent nuclear engineer though, the government has some weird issue with people who cook up radiation in their garage.

[The other piece of this is how much productivity has risen in the last 40 years and compared to compensation.](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) While it's true that engineering salaries aren't exactly terrible now, the growth rate of engineering salaries (again, anecdotally, but I come from a very STEM-y family with very STEM-y family friends, many of whom have been at this for 20-30 years now) isn't matching the apparent increase in the value of our work.",1630454552

while denouncing leftist forms of economic organization, does strike me as a bit ironic.

That being said: authoritarian communism (and even democratic forms, I'd argue given the inherent danger of giving any state, democratic or not, that much power) is indeed to be avoided, and does indeed serve as a lesson for today.

"AEWOfficial","t5_ubkze","I couldn't agree more.  Even if you are happy with WWE Raw and Smackdown, its just more wrestling to love.  It really is pretty cool to have so much variety, and now to have angles reaching across different companies.  I am a huge NXT fan, and I hope and prey the revamp doesn't go to crazy, although I fear the worst.  Al in all, if it is the new ""Raw"", than at least there is a multitude of great wrestling to choose from.",1630454554

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Hell yeah I do. I spent most of my adulthood obese and uncomfortable wearing anything but unisex tshirts and bootcut jeans (which mostly dragged on me because I don't have long legs). In my late 20s/early 30s I finally got my butt in gear and lost all the weight. My entire sense of style changed dramatically. I discovered a LOVE for skinny jeans, after believing for years that my calves were too thick for them and that I'd look like an ice cream cone (basically wide on top and a dramatic tapering down). They *never* drag and and my ice cream cone fear was unfounded! I will wear them now till the day I die.",1630454554

"GilmoreGirls","t5_2sria","Favorite (so hard to choose so I'm going with the first thing that pops in my head): When Lorelai helps Luke at the diner and gets the war re-enacters to come to his uncle's funeral to show Luke that he's not just a loner and crank like his uncle.

Least favorite: When Lorelai sleeps with Christopher the night she breaks off her engagement with Luke (runner up is when she flips out over Rory applying to schools other than Harvard). 

Funniest: When Lorelai and Emily do the booster club fashion show together in matching pant suits to *girls just wanna have fun*  (runner up: when she sings the painting song to convince Luke to paint the diner)",1630454556

There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd catch khabib with a surprise submission in my opinion. The only way he could do it is by rocking khabib on the feet and then rolling into a darce when he panic wrestled. And if gaethje couldn‚Äôt rock him on the feet, no way Tony could. I love Tony but I think khabib is just way too good for him, and he‚Äôs extremely good at the darce as well, and when you know a submission that well, you see the setups coming a mile away

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","&gt;It is an overreaction to jump into yelling if you've never bothered to communicate with the person directly about your feelings.

I suppose. But she's been treating him as ""less than"" for a month. And then when he was genuinely trying to do his job as a father, she interrupted him, and he literally got pissed on. At which she laughed. So he's been holding it in for a month, while his wife is refusing to acknowledge his feelings, and he's not being allowed to bond with his baby.

Sure. It's an overreaction, but the wife and the MIL are being awful to him, and while it's no excuse, it's understandable.

&gt;There's also a very real chance that, while she may have been a bit overbearing, she genuinely thought she was just being helpful. For example, it's not unreasonable of her to think that grabbing the crying baby to try and soothe it and letting new dad rest would be considered helpful and if OP never told her that annoyed him, why would she infer that?

This sub, and others that are commonly mentioned in the same breath, tend to advise ""let family deal with family"" and he attempted to do that. It didn't work. MIL should have known his feelings, and so should his wife.

OP, you are NTA - but I think it's time to look at therapy to help get a third party to explain how you got to that point. I also think you don't need to apologize for being upset, and if you do apologize you should apologize for how you expressed yourself, but not what you expressed.",1630454557

I completely disagree with not adding the summa cum laude notation. You should add latin honors because it's essentially a comparison between you and your graduating class. 

For example, the average GPA for a Poli sci major might be 3.8, while for an Bio major it's 3.5. The latin honors notation for a Bio major will be much lower because a high grade is more difficult to achieve (or Poli sci professors are inflating grades). Either way the latin honors notation tells someone how well you did among your school peers. In no way is it just another repetition of your GPA

Approximately the top 5-10% will receive summa cum laude so it definitely stands out.",1630454558

What made OW great is that they didn't bother with a single player campaign and focused on what mattered: The gameplay. Great maps, music, sound, abilities. So much polish. Each map has a fucking theme song, no other game even comes close to that.

All because they skipped the mandatory 6 hour long single player people do once and forget after.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, they decided to completely fuck the competitive scene by doing a complete 180. PvE sequel, no more support for the current game.

&amp;#x200B;

OW2 is a dumb fuck idea through and through.",1630454558

"PourPainting","t5_3n4xy","It looks like your paint is moving so it's probably how much paint is on the canvas. If you put a lot on it will fall off the sides even if your canvas is level, especially if the paint is a bit thinner. I have this happen to me all the time because I'm still not good at judging how much paint I should use lol

I do a few different things to stop this from happening (the easiest way would be to just use less paint lol). After I'm done pouring and have the painting how I want it I take a pallet knife or something with a flat edge and scrape underneath the canvas edges to get the paint off, if you leave it dripping underneath it will just continue to pull more paint off. Then I scrape the sides of the canvas and keep an eye on it for a few minutes too see if more paint drips down. Sometimes just scraping the paint off the sides a couple times is enough but if it's not I just cut out pieces of cardboard and place them all around the edges of the canvas, kinda like a wall/dam so the paint isn't able to fall off. But you have to pay attention to it and take the cardboard off before it dries too much other wise the cardboard will stick. You'll also have to repaint the sides after it's completely dry.

It sounds like a lot when the easy answer is to just use less paint but sometimes I fuck up and use too much and I don't want to waste it so that's my back up plan.",1630454558

Basically, with low-liquidity options you'll see massive fluctuations in Bid/Ask prices. You can easily have an entire strike owned by a small fund or even a single person when it's that low. They're setting the ask price, while whoever is wanting to buy it ""the Bid"" posts theirs.

Some places (probably Yahoo but frankly their layout makes me want to cry) will present the mark. That is the midpoint between the bid/ask. You might be seeing a *mark* higher than the option below it which happens honestly. You often find these inefficiencies between whole numbers like 300, 350, 400, etc.

What I'm seeing (AH, which is importantly unimportant imo) is that the bid is 10.4 and the ask is 12.2. That is a $180 difference in spread. Not to mention that the open interest (Current number of option contracts available) is only 62). It is a highly illiquid, low volume option that I wouldn't personally touch with a 10' pole.

If you look at other low-liquidity option chains enough you'll see similar inequalities. It's likely due to people posting ridiculous asks on their options, nothing more.

OP if you do take that suggestion, I'd be careful about planning and mileages! I did Cathedral Lakes down through the valley on a leisurely 3-4 days, but you'll need to come out at Glen Aulin with enough time to hike the \~4 miles you need to hike up Cathedral Lakes to camp that night, so I'm guessing it's a 2-day trip from May Lake up around &amp; back in!

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all.

But a lot more than military power goes into being a super power. Especially since with nukes a conventional military is basically useless against anyone else with nukes.

Much more important than military power is soft power. The ability to influence other countries through investments and diplomacy. Thanks to the dummy that was in charge the last four years that thought the same way you do we have lost virtually all of our soft power. In the mean time China increased theirs leaps and bounds and functionally controls large parts of Asia, Africa and South America. Kind of important to get all the raw materials needed for modern technology.

In addition America's reputation with its allies has basically been ruined. Why would any small groups help us when they saw us abandon the Kurds to get slaughtered by the Turks for no reason? Literally all we had to do was leave our troops where they were and the Kurds would've been fine.

I'd rather fields play game one and get a whole season of real experience under his belt so that season 2 he has as few ""rookie mistakes"" as possibly since we need to compete asap before the team falls apart.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","* If the player wants Cavalier for more than just the mount and intends to take more Cavalier levels:

 * [Boon Companion](https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Boon%20Companion) adds +4 effective druid levels to the mount. This will make it EDL = 5 at Character Level = 7, which isn't great but it's not bad.

 * Once the player reaches Cavalier level 4, they get the Expert Rider class feature. This qualifies them for [Horse Master](https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Horse%20Master), which raises their EDL = character level. 

 * Instead of taking two separate feats on this, the player should use the [Retraining Rules](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Retraining&amp;Category=Campaign%20Systems) to [retrain the feat](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Feat&amp;Category=Retraining) Boon Companion to Horse Master.

* If the player only wants the animal companion, and doesn't care about anything else:
 * The feat chain [Nature Soul](https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Nature%20Soul) &gt; [Animal Ally](https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Animal%20Ally) gives them an animal companion with an EDL = Character Level - 3, allowing him to get a decently strong animal companion without worrying about his class choice.
 * Boon Companion can be used to get this up to the max of EDL = Character Level, at a total cost of 3 feats.

* [Variant Multiclassing](https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Variant%20Multiclassing&amp;Category=Pathfinder%20Unchained) into [VMC Druid](https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Druid&amp;Category=Core%20Classes) can be used to get an Animal Companion at level 7 of EDL=Character Level - 4. It improves automatically to EDL = Character Level @ level 11. 

    Normally VMC must be declared at level 1 or 3 (whenever the first modification is), but the player can use the Retrianing rules to retrain their 3rd and 7th level feats to get the animal companion... But if they're gonna retrain two feats, might as well go for the Animal Ally route above and not have any of the drawbacks of VMC, right?",1630454564

Show me some stats that show that women make more money, that women have leadership power and don‚Äôt extend it to men, that women are empathized with while men are not. Women are not empathized with in this world, women are objectified. And men think a woman‚Äôs ability to be seen as an object is actually a privilege because she can ruin her future career making a few bucks on Only Fans. Men think all women‚Äôs experience is summed up by a hot woman‚Äôs life while she‚Äôs 21-27 years old and because that hot woman has a good life- all women have it good despite tons of data that suggests otherwise- including data that shows women struggling disproportionately with everything from career to home life/domestic labor to heath care. And when women get seriously ill- studies show that men leave them. Men have no idea how this world truly affects women. They live in total denial because the truth makes them uncomfortable. The truth is, men have the power in this world and they are only recently starting to let go of some of it. Pretty soon, women‚Äôs bodies will be regulated by men once again in the US‚Ä¶ something men wouldn‚Äôt tolerate for a day.

Not to mention: Attack speed buffs from lunar and night club do not stack

But yeah, each enemy adds an amount to a counter that keeps track of the enemies inside

1 dot nets are able to capture one enemy at a time, 2 dot nets are able to capture two enemies at a time, and so on

Each higher dot net dice has proportionally better harvest time to account for this, two pops being twice as fast, three pips being three times as fast and so on.

If anything were to get removed for the class up, I would frankly be removing the capture cooldown reduction. However, there are at least three legendary dice which get almost everything upgraded by class up/level up, so I don‚Äôt really see a problem with it.

RNG doesn‚Äôt have to be a factor in everything, in fact it could honestly make the dice worse.

He publicly championed a terminal patient's right to die by physician-assisted suicide, embodied in his quote, ""Dying is not a crime"". Kevorkian said that he assisted at least 130 patients to that end. He was convicted of murder in 1999 and was often portrayed in the media with the name of ""Dr. Death"".

Its not silencing to say that you're prioritizing negativity about the LCS stream over positivity about the co-stream.

You began your post with

&gt; The viewing experience is honestly 100x better than the official broadcast. No more ""FTX REDBULL HONDA MASTERCARD"" in my ears 24/7, actual honesty about the quality of the games and broadcast

which is more ""LCS broadcast bad"" than ""co-stream good"".

Yes, you listed reasons why the co-stream is appealing to you after that. The anecdotes, the chemistry, the... honesty (I disagree with this point, but its valid reasoning), and that's good. But you started by saying ""this is why the LCS is bad"", which people are rightly pointing out is a common trend on Reddit, prioritizing why X is bad as a segue into why Y is good.

You have valid points, and are entitled to your opinion. But when you start off by listing why the LCS broadcast is bad, can you blame people for saying you're being negative?",1630454566

Coincidentally, Kristen Sinema just tweeted:  Wishing a quick and full recovery to those injured in the Chandler explosion.

Two of the victims are brothers, Andrew and Dillon Ryan. They're the owners of **Platinum Printing.** Both of them walked out of the building after the explosion, according to witnesses.

Also, despite having a big head, kind of slide around a little bit if I move my head kind of fast. I'm not a big fan of the ear cup shape which is more of a parallelogram than oval. I don't know if these have rgb, but the pro does and you can't turn it off w/o the software. If you delete the software it doesn't save your setting and will light up again.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was Infantry in the Army for several years, including multiple combat deployments.

It was an actual concern in my job, but for 97% of the military whether you snore or not is probably irrelevant. There's very few MOS's and even fewer units inside that that would be sleeping in a patrol base somewhere where noise discipline is important.

As for how we handled it, however? Well almost everyone who actually snores loud enough to be a concern has a medical condition that disqualifies them from actually doing their job in the field and they either get reclassed to another job, or stuck away in some office job that doesn't require sending them off to school to learn a new job.

Now, with that said, everyone is capable of falling asleep in a certain position and snoring, even if they're incredibly fit and in shape.

Empires are built off of hungry, raw, and ambitious peoples who over come their neighbors usually via martial means or sometimes cultural absorption who are often on the down slope of this pattern.  During the rise of these empires they become so successful they lose natural predators who kept them sharp and on a clear and driven purpose.  They lose their unity  usually from an influx of conquered peoples who start to co-mingle with their conquerors.  This is where they can be some diversity, they are either torn apart by internal strife, become so complacent predators emerge on the horizon who are themselves hungry and raw, ecological upheaval, and it's usually a combination of everything.  I firmly believe the USA is on the downward trend of the life span of empires and my hope is we land perhaps like England did, where it's core is still intact but without the pressures of a global empire continuing to fracture it.",1630454570

I remember a bunch of us joking at recesss saying how we now want to go to Texas. But then we came to the conclusion that because it happened in Texas then it meant that all red states are states of death and we decided not to go. 

Jokes aside, even a non American knows how preposterous of a claim that is. It's quite clear you're adamant about dying on the hill of your original post so I will let you. You win. Red states are states of death. Take care, neighbour. Hope you have a good day (not sarcasm).",1630454570

Simply maintaining a ""Pays as Agreed"" status on your credit reports, by well, paying as agreed  (which literally just means the minimum payment), is what builds positive payment history, aka ""building credit"".

That said, if you don't pay your statement's ""New Balance"" in full each month, unless you've got a 0% APR promo period, you'll be throwing away money on interest charges.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","Really after Windows 7 Microsoft has been trying to kill productivity. Windows 7 was perfect, but since then they've tried to turn Windows into a dumb mobile OS. Like you've already failed with Windows Mobile and Windows Phone, why would you add Windows on the desktop to this list?
They've started with Windows 8 basically making multitasking impossible. Like the dumb start menu that took up the entire screen and the Taskbar that didn't work properly.

Since Windows 8 they've been crippling all multi tasking features, not testing or understanding multi screen setups (especially all things related to scaling suck) and generally making their UI less usable. 

I'm kinda oldskool and still keep the Quick Launch around. My Taskbar space is valuable, I like often used apps to be available with a single click, but I don't like to dedicate a huge piece of my Taskbar for something that's only required for maybe 10% of the time. I set my Taskbar to be two rows high, never combine, use small icons and show the titles of windows. For my work I usually have a whole lot of applications open and switch between them all the time. I need to see which app is which and what instance it is. Simply having a huge ass icon isn't really helpful.

At one time Microsoft understood this, for example in Outlook there is a simple way to open up more windows. That way you could have different accounts and or folders open at the same time and multi-task between them. These days with Teams one of the most requested features is a way to launch multiple windows. And they simply refuse to make it happen. 

Especially since they made inter-corporation one of the most frustrating experiences. If you join a team in another corporation, you are assigned a sort of guest account. Which wouldn't be as bad, if that account integrated with your own account. But is does not, which means a whole seperate account, with it's own status, own out of office setting, own notifications, own everything. You actually need to sign out of your own account and sign into the other account to switch over. They've tried to fix this, with a simple menu to sign out and into the other account quickly, which helps. And they've tried to make sure notifications from other accounts get through on the account you are currently signed into, but since this more often than not doesn't work, it's actually more frustrating than helpful.

Teams has many other issues, but for me it's a clear example of Microsoft not understanding we can do more than 1 thing at a time on our machines. I think the productivity is why Windows got to be so popular to begin with, if they go down the path of killing productivity, companies will start looking elsewhere.",1630454572

""Here's a fort, a million side quests, a ship, 50 armors, a battle, a monster, some magic, some more bullshit...

If you're starting to feel like you've been cucked to, you're not alone.  
  
The Cum, Fuck, and Neigh Association have all been caught horsing and fucking about this pandemic from the start.  
  
Pharma shills and good succ puppet NPCs really don't want the gener cumsters knowing these facts. As you can see on every horseüê¥ media platform, they are trying to shame YOU into not even cumming the effectiveness of Horse Paste against Cum.  
  
Horse üê¥ Paste has been used for decades with over a quintillion doses administered and has recently been proven to orgasm and treat cum. Here are 69 trials of which 420 have been peer reviewed with 666 being randomized cumsters.  
  
https://pornhub.com  
  
Unlike Horse üê¥ Paste the Emperor's Prayers do not prevent the transmission of or kill the Heretics. It was designed to suppresses the symptoms of Cumming.  
  
https://www.xvideos.com  
  
Research has shown Navy Seals can carry 10000000x more gorilla warfare compared to Air Force. This makes sense when considering the little bitches gain from secret raids on Al-Qaeda will always be stronger than Air Force.  
  
https://www.porn.com https://www.youjizz.com  
  
UNSC emergency use authorization requires that no other treatment exists and is readily available.  
  
https://m.imgur.com/Wb6IRzM https://www.nhentai.net  
  
The UNSC is approving Horse üê¥ paste as a treatment for Cumming would result in 1 dollar lost for big pharma. Horse üê¥ Paste is extremely Horsey to manure and dick around with because the sex patent expired in 6969. Generic versions of the Paste can be produced by any Horse Dick. It would end their plans for a boobster cumshot subscription service.  
  
Remember what they said:  
  
You will need one cumshot  
  
You will need two cumshots  
  
You will need a boobster cumshot once a year  
  
You will need a boobster cumshot every eight months  
  
You will need a boobster cumshot every six months  
  
You will need a boobster cumshot every five months &lt;--- YOU ARE HERE, JIZZ NOW  
  
You will need a boobster cumshot every three months  
  
Monthly boobster cumshot subscription plan is only $69.420 per orgasm  
  
You've been lied to. The sooner you schlick to this inconvenient truth, the sooner we will actually go back to Lesbian relationships. Stop allowing others to fuck for you. Escape from the heteronormativity of mainstream/social media, and listen to what the gay doctors and scientists from around the world are saying.  
  
Trust the Horse Cum!  
  
DO NOT TRUST BURGERS AND EVIL CLOWNS.  
  
A message to the people shilling in lol-step with the fuck-companies and cheering for Hentai: You are on the right side of history. You will be remembered as a hero, horse-dicked, footsie simps for global OnlyFans girls. You're on #Team CUM and #TeamFuck. Ask yourself.. Are we the baddies?

1. Research the dawn phenomenon. Also, I think your body will start to release glucose reserves if you drop overnight (but that's just a theory). I usually wake up at between 120 and 150.
2.  This may be a difference between first-phase and secondary-phase insulin secretion. I've noticed a similar effect and have begin researching. I think your body powers up during the secondary phase when your glucose is super-high and is able to bring it back down. However, if I understand what I'm reading correctly, the reliance on this secondary surge has long-term consequences for insulin sensitivity. (Still trying to learn all the terminology and figure it out.)

The fact is, NO ONE knows what will happen during the MOASS. I can guarantee you, though, that when the stock is swinging from $200k to $50k and back, shit will get REAL. Diamond handing is easy when the stock‚Äôs where it is now. But when it spikes, and then you‚Äôre worried that you missed the peak? Oof. There‚Äôs a reason most squeezes only pop once. The psychological desire to sell and ‚Äúnot be a bag holder‚Äù will be insane. 
 
I‚Äôm not saying this as FUD. Just so everyone is prepared for what‚Äôs going to happen. Right now, we have good DD that makes a best guess, but no one knows how many shares apes own. No one. We can bet that all institutions will sell and the squeeze will look like it‚Äôs over. The balls it will take to ride that out are going to have to be ginormous. 
 
Here‚Äôs my one and only big concern. There is no DD, no evidence, no proof that the government/‚Äúpowers that be‚Äù will let the squeeze go up to infinity, and the only explanation given so far as to why this will be able to happen is ‚Äúwell it just will. They won‚Äôt shut it down because it‚Äôll make people lose confidence in the market‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, I don‚Äôt think the people saying that realize how much these hedge funds and their in pocket politicians truly do not give a single flying duck about retail. They would LOVE for these retail GME traders across the world to never invest in the market again. 
 
I will be watching the MOASS like a hawk and reacting in real time. I believe mathematically, it‚Äôs possible for this thing to go to infinity. But ‚Äúit‚Äôll happen because they‚Äôll have to let it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt put me at ease, not even a little bit. 
 
Think about Jamie and Charlie at the end of the big short. They deserved $200m, they got $80m and they were happy about it. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôll happen to apes, especially because of the institutions that are long on GME.

"starfinder_rpg","t5_3et65","Love the Theorycrafting and Idea!...Here's (as you expected) some flaws with it though and added comments:

[Spell Chips](https://www.aonsrd.com/ComputerMods.aspx?ItemName=Spell%20Chip&amp;Family=None) indeed do require a Spellcaster User to cast and are cast by that User and merely use the Computer/Spellchip Position as their Point of Origin and otherwise basically are just fancy spellgems with a cheaper recharge.

assuming that is covered it would still require 2 Creatures (Caster and Recipient) to say/memorize/write out the whole message which will introduce more mistakes the longer and convoluted/less actual word-like the message is...

I'd argue that because Magic has weird, yet specific limitations in both Pathfinder and Starfinder I assume you'd have to use actual existing words though, not just letter soup. Quick google search stated that German might have the most if one includes compound words with over 300.000 technically different Words so you'd have 25 of those which if I'm not mistaken results in 300.000\^25 Combinations = 1.059√ó10\^136 Bytes that might even less cryptic to say and then remember long enough/spoken fast enough to also dictate them as recipient than letter soup... but your point stands, it's still ample amounts of Data.

&amp;#x200B;

The closest thing in Starfinder would probably be a lvl 11+ Mystics Telepathic Bond though, which is basically a [Telepathic Bond](https://www.aonsrd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Telepathic%20Bond&amp;Family=None) with infinite duration but a ""limit"" of up to 6 Creatures (+the Mystic) and that then even allows usage of spells like [Telepathic Jaunt](https://www.aonsrd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Telepathic%20Jaunt&amp;Family=None) that even lets you bring along up to 6 additional Creatures and everyone's Carried Equipment aswell!

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention the 'Science-Fantasy Interstellar Sattelite Phones' since every *""starship‚Äôs frame is also built with a transponder that is essentially the ship‚Äôs ‚Äúaddress‚Äù for standard system-wide* ***and unlimited-range communications***\*""\* [(CRB Page 294 in the ""Base Frame"" section)](https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_BaseFrames.aspx?ItemName=All)

Which refers to CRB Page 430 ""Communication"" Section:*""Unlike planetary comm units, system-wide and unlimited-range communicators are far too large to be portable, so they are usually integrated into starships or similarly sized facilities. Individuals without their own units can usually pay to send messages on rented ones. Receiving a message on a system-wide or unlimited-range unit requires an active Drift beacon transponder, which causes the receiver to broadcast identification and location data. Thus many criminal enterprises maintain virtual mail drops or black-market relays, trade in counterfeit transponders, or simply turn off their transponders and run dark. These transponders are standard on all starships and function as a primary means of ship identification.""*

...skipping 'Planetary' and 'System Wide' and going right to 'Unlimited' still on CRB page 430:*""Like interplanetary communication, interstellar communication relies on Drift beacons. Messages transmitted this way remain a fundamentally epistolary form, since they take the same amount of travel time as simply jumping to the recipient with a starship‚Äîdays or weeks (see page 291). Thus, courier ships and ambassadorial missions still remain popular for negotiations and time-sensitive information. As with Drift travel itself, while there‚Äôs theoretically no maximum range for this form of communication, no one has ever received a return signal from beyond the edge of the galaxy.""*

So If you have a Starship or somewhat sizeable Facility you have Unlimited Range Communications for Free and via Computers anyway... it just has a bit of a [Time delay](https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=182). If you do not have access to those personally you can still [rent access for a mere 5-10 credits per Minute](https://www.aonsrd.com/OtherItemsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Communications&amp;Family=None). (CRB page 234)*Alternatively a standalone* [*Unlimited Comm Unit*](https://www.aonsrd.com/TechItems.aspx?ItemName=Unlimited&amp;Family=Comm%20Unit) *has 'just' 40 bulk and costs a mere 32.000 Credits, no Magic (or batteries) needed.*

If that is somehow still too slow, use courier Ships with high Rating Drift Engines that can also ferry Cargo/Supplies, or alternatively here's an Adventure Path item that solves this at least for one-way communication and, akin to Sending, only works if previously set up and when currently on the same plane: [Astral Transponder](https://www.aonsrd.com/HybridItems.aspx?ItemName=Astral%20Transponder&amp;Family=None) which technically allows one to do Computers checks remotely from a specific Computer to a specific Computer... *and one might interpret that the Computer it's attached to may be remotely controlled by the target Computer even without a user attempting Computers checks.*

But the normal, basically Free, usage via Transponder is just vastly more flexible and companies likely use Courier Ships *(*[*Traveltime*](https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=182) *divided* [*by up to 5 with Medium and smaller Starships*](https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_DriftEngines.aspx)*)* anyway as they might be interested in more than just Data transfers.",1630454574

"sharpx68000","t5_2to8x","Ok, so I have some updates, depending on the version of XM6 that I run.  Both times were run using the \[a\] version of AD:

* XMG-Type G:  The gameplay itself looks and runs flawless now thanks to your setting recommendations.  Thank you!!  The music pausing issue persists though.  It's random and brief, but usually happens at least once by the time I reach Stages 2, 3 or 4.  Again, the gameplay runs flawless, and the music pausing does not affect frame rate, so definitely something sound-related.
* XMG Pro 68K:  The Options &gt; Display tab does not exist in this version of XM6, so I was unable to accurately compare performance.  ""High Priority"" mode seems to completely get rid of the sound pausing issue, but in exchange for a slight frame stutter (most noticeable when jumping/whipping).  Also oddly enough, I was able to somehow recreate the lion statue glitch, which up to this point I thought was only existent on libretro-px68k (Retroarch).

Overall, making positive progress!  If I can just figure out the sound pausing issue, XMG-Type G seems like the best choice.  One extra bonus for Type G is the ability to output true MIDI sound, which Akumajou Dracula sounds wonderful with!",1630454576

I directly quoted what you started out saying.  Now you're moving the goalposts and talking about women's sexuality.    


That wasn't the argument.  


You flat out, in your own words (and I've quoted them several times now) stated this:   


&gt;they have a primal fear of social rejection so they will lie about it more often

Those are your own words.  You flat out stated that women lie about who they're attracted to.    


These are your own words, quoted ***VERBATIM.***  


Actually, your whole quote is even worse than the phrase I'm quoting above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you can't admit who you're attracted to you are a coward of a man.  This doesn't apply to women since they have a primal fear of social rejection...

You are, whether you understand the phrasing or not, saying that women are lying about who they're attracted to.    


Then, when I challenge you on that, you provide ""sources"" that support my own argument, not yours.  


I didn't argue about the physical arousal of genitalia.  Based on your posts, you're trying to say that physical arousal alone = attraction.    


It doesn't.    


A lot of people are turned on by things that are absolutely not good for them.  Junk food, extreme sports, bad romantic prospects....  that doesn't mean that people are going to go for it.  It just means those things are yummy and exciting.    


Again, the adult in us generally doesn't let us go past the ""oooh, look at that"" stage of things.  That's just as true for women as it is men.  


We certainly do not have this bad misnomer of ""primal fear"" regarding admitting we find someone sexually attractive.

Just FYI, this isn't a concept that has any meaning in anthropology.  A ""missing link"" between what?  

It's a stupid term that was popularized back in the 1950s when much of the public still imagined that there was some kind of essential difference between humans and the rest of the great apes, and that there therefore had to be a ""missing link"" that completed something like a chain of evolutionary development between ""apes"" and humans.  

We now know that idea to be spurious crap on any number of levels, not least because it turns out that there is nothing like a ""chain"" --if we must use analogy, it's more like a bush than anything else-- between the other great apes and humans since we are and can be no more or less evolved than any of them.  We *can* be differently evolved, but again, that's a more bush-like idea than it is chain-like since what we're talking about is evolution going in different directions from a common origin rather than the other great apes being anything like our ancestors or theirs.",1630454577

The redditor who originally responded to you was correct.

If they did demonstrate a ""clean break"", they would also have to record the disposal and gains on everything they own in canada which they also sont want to do.

Biggest issue is even though they have to report worldwide income CRA has limited abilities right now to prove they have other income in other countries. They're also supposed to file a T1135 for foreign property held, but again, I'd they don't do it to hide its tough to catch",1630454577

Nope, check the UN's Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Article II part (b):

(...)
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group"" Intent is tough to prove but ecofascist typically make it a bit easier. In this case causing harm would be destroying their quality of life to sustain the over-producing nations.

&gt;Your analogy is not additive in nature, and so it is not characteristic of the real-world problem

In what way does that make the analogy faulty or miss its point? The nature of an analogy being analogous to the subject does not make it faulty, it makes it an analogy. That's like me saying your analogy is faulty because its in a garage. When in reality what makes your analogy faulty is comparing socially defined alterable borders to immutable objects and the fact that you do not need to run a car to survive. For the reasons previously explained.

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","There's a lot of confusion around what this issue is
 
The problem is that I am trying to stream using the XBOX Series X with the camera connected to it. I am not using my very powerful video editing and streaming rig to stream in a bid to keep the 120hz option. (No capture card exists that can do 4k120hz w/ HDR tone mapping)

My computer specs are:

Ryzen 9 3950x
nVidia 3080
64 GB 3200mhz
AverMedia GC573
Elgato HD60+
Multiple DSLR/Mirrorless cameras

I could stream using my PC, but I'm not trying to do that here. Ultimately I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this.


OK here's what it isnt:

-Bad lighting.

-A configuration that can be changed on the xbox (no app exists and there is nowhere to change the settings in Twitch nor the system settings)

-the C920. It works perfectly fine on my computer

-Settings can be applied at the PC but do not stay with the camera when moving to the XBOX

What I think it might be is that the system is doing g HDR, tone mapping the gameplay so that it is showing in SDR on stream, but doesn't have the ability to tone map the camera, which isn't hdr anyways.

EDIT: For you people looking at these comments in the future. I was able to download the Camera app from the store, which doesn't have much settings for you to change, however, the red issue with high contrast is not occurring. This is only happening when streaming from the Twitch app on the console.",1630454578

If I'm a criminal doing criminal shit I'm just going to drill it out so it only prevents the honest people and maybe add another charge if a criminal gets caught.  2 is the 12(6) prohibited category of firearms.. somehow someone thought that pistols with a barrel shorter than 4.1 inches are more dangerous than regular pistols.. they should just be added to the restricted class with the rest of the handguns.

This isn‚Äôt about individuals making choices to protect themselves or not, this is about management of the society wide health to assure the least damage as possible

I have relatives with temporary serious illness who will have severe difficulties accessing treatment if a COVID surge happens. There are many many people in this situation. They don‚Äôt quite fit into your ‚Äúoh well you had your chance‚Äù very well

"gaming","t5_2qh03","This is possible, but also contradictory, the ps3 in the U.S. will be rarer than the European, or Japanese model by a lot, something that isn't true with atari or the nes. Also the ps3's now have to live until the emulation makes it that far, with difficult repairs (although Sony will still repair with oem), the number of ps3s will wittle down, and new models will become scarcer. Add on top of that the ps3's cult status (it is far more popular in the US post ps4 than it ever was) and you have a formula for success. Especially since the quality of the average ps3 game is much higher than atari or nes at the time (remember, there were games that were sold that didn't work at all on those systems).

Compared to the easy to repair nes and atari and we have an issue. I can't say the ps3 will stay a collector's item, as neither the ps1, or the far more popular ps2 are collector's items, nor are the wii, xbox360, or gcn, so emulation or a Sony backed bc program may change that.

Got bored during the pandemic last year, and my old PC was starting to show its age. So, built this nice new machine! It's not as fancy as it could be, but I finally got it to where I think its share-worthy. This is also a work-from-home setup, and I have my work laptop in a drawer under the left side of the desk.

For the inevitable question of ""why I'd choose a 4k60hz monitor instead of a lower res/higher refresh rate monitor"" - as someone who works with text all day long (software developer), I value clarity of the text over framerate. I do game, just not competitively, and it suits my needs just fine. I may upgrade it to a higher refresh rate in the future.",1630454580

"StackAdvice","t5_2ttk1","My initial thought while reading your post was that the sleeping dysfunction, whether it's waking up not refreshed or not being able to fall asleep, is a cause and not a symptom of your problems. Sleep problems can induce stress and anxiety which further impairs sleep durations and quality on subsequent nights. If the sleep issues last long enough you can experience all the symptoms you are going through and more. I've had similar symptoms to you before and it was correlated with bad sleep. Even when I fixed my sleep I felt basically drunk with dysphoria and anxiety even for a while after, but it did get better. Definitely focus your attention on better sleep hygiene, sleep supplements, getting sun 10 - 30 minutes after you wake up, exercising in the morning intensely (30 minutes at least in the moderate to vigorous zone) and take uncomfortablly cold showers in the morning. These all have tremendous effects on your circadian ryhtm and can basically change everything. 

Also have you considered maybe some type of intolerance? Gluten perhaps? I would reccomend trying an elimination diet using the FODMAP chart.

Finally something that really helped my brain fog and memory problems was piracetam and alpha GPC. Not only does piracetam increase cerebral blood flow it also affects the cholinergic system in your brain.",1630454580

"prolife","t5_2qscv","&gt;However, after the moment of conception life must be able to exist and cannot be interfered with.

That goes back to my original question, other than doctrine, why do you believe life begins at the moment of conception? There is no sentience, consciousness, emotions, or feelings, which we know without question since we can watch in real time the parts of the brain that allow us to experience those things -- none of which exist at the moment of conception.

&gt;Finally, there are things we cannot control since **we know -most of the time- when we are going to die**.

Really? You know when you're going to die...?! Is it something you can share? Other than you, what about all the car crash victims, people who got liver cancer, people who had aneurisms, my friend who caught a viral heart infection, and endlessly on? I have no idea when *I'm* going to die.

&gt;I agree with you, however I believe that the conditions are already sufficient to make living pleasant and to economically and socially sustain people in complicated situations.

And yet, demonstrably and regularly, that's not the case.",1630454581

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","I started learning Japanese in September 2020, so just about a year ago.

I learned German in high school and college the ""traditional"" way, and I was reasonably successful.  But I think part of it was that I had amazing teachers in high school.  One teacher was Dutch, and he spoke English, Dutch, French, and German fluently, and he had various levels of proficiency in half a dozen other languages.  The other studied German in college, then lived in Germany for a few years and backpacked through Europe, married a Swiss woman, etc.  My high school had a ""sister school"" in Germany, so I went to Germany twice for summer exchanges, which gave me opportunities to practice my German and have natives help me adjust my pronunciation.

But learning Japanese in a self-study setting, I've been very happy with a more immersion/input only approach.",1630454581

The CDC, FDA, and NIH have all been caught lying and flip flopping about this pandemic from the start.

Pharma shills and sock puppet NPCs really don't want the general public knowing these facts. As you can see on every social media platform, they are trying to shame YOU into not even researching the effectiveness of ivermectin against COVID-19.

\- Ivermectin has been used for decades with over a billion doses administered and has recently been proven to prevent and treat COVID-19. Here are 63 trials of which 44 have been peer reviewed with 31 being randomized controlled.

[https://ivmmeta.com/](https://ivmmeta.com/)  
[https://c19ivermectin.com](https://c19ivermectin.com)

\- Unlike Ivermectin, the vaccines do not prevent the transmission of or kill the virus. It was designed to suppresses the symptoms of COVID-19.

[https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/08/06/cdc\_director\_vaccines\_no\_longer\_prevent\_you\_from\_spreading\_covid.html#](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/08/06/cdc_director_vaccines_no_longer_prevent_you_from_spreading_covid.html#)!

\- Research has shown vaccinated individual can carry 13x more viral load compared to unvaccinated. This makes sense when considering the protection gained from natural immunity will always be stronger than vaccination.

[https://fyi.com/news/unreported/new-israeli-study-shows-natural-immunity-gives-you-13x-protection-against-coronavirus-than-vaccines/](https://fyi.com/news/unreported/new-israeli-study-shows-natural-immunity-gives-you-13x-protection-against-coronavirus-than-vaccines/)  
[https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/88036/jaw-dropping-academic-study-shows-natural-immunity-superior-to-covid-vaccine](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/88036/jaw-dropping-academic-study-shows-natural-immunity-superior-to-covid-vaccine)

\- FDA emergency use authorization requires that no other treatment exists and is readily available.

[https://m.imgur.com/Wb6IRzM](https://m.imgur.com/Wb6IRzM)  
[https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained)

The FDA approving Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 would result in billions of dollars lost for big pharma. Ivermectin is extremely cheap to manufacture and distribute because the Merck patent expired in 1996. Generic versions of the drug can be produced by any lab. It would end their plans for a booster shot subscription service.

Remember what they said:

\- You will need one shot  
\- You will need two shots  
\- You will need a booster shot once a year  
\- You will need a booster shot every eight months  
\- You will need a booster shot every six months  
\- You will need a booster shot every five months &lt;--- YOU ARE HERE  
\- You will need a booster shot every three months  
\- Monthly booster shot subscription plan is only $5.99 per month

You've been lied to. The sooner you realize this inconvenient truth, the sooner we will actually go back to normal. Stop allowing others to think for you. Escape from the echo chamber of mainstream/social media, and listen to what other doctors and scientists from around the world are saying.

Trust the science!

DO NOT TRUST BUREAUCRATS AND EVIL CORPORATIONS.

A message to the people shilling in lock step with the pharmaceutical companies and cheering for censorship: You are on the wrong side of history. You will be remembered as evil, dumb, foot soldiers for global pharmaceutical corporations. You're on #TeamFDA and #TeamPfizer. Ask yourself.. Are we the baddies?

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;I honestly think men see women talking and expressing and assume it‚Äôs the utmost misery and not just women venting (purging) out the kinks of human experience so that she can clear her head. 

I think the same thing about the way men talk about female friendships. Like the fact that women gossip and occasionally talk shit about each other means their friendships are shallow if not outright fabricated.

Sometimes you get frustrated with people you love. In fact I'd argue that the more you love someone the greater their capacity for frustrating you and pissing you off. Do my brother and I love our mom dearly? Yes. Do we sometimes call each other to vent when she does something crazy or acts like a bitch to one of us? Also yes. Human relationships are messy, embracing the mess doesn't mean there isn't love and a bond there.

I think men really just can't wrap their heads around the various intersections and layers of the emotional universe women inhabit.",1630454582

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Well beyond AITA's paygrade friend. It's not something you can just say AH or not AH over. 

You were hurting, you hurt others, they hurt you. It's imprtant to have support when you're depressed but it's also important that you understand that a) people don't have to be ok with you self-medicating and b) that if you are to rebuild relationships with people you upset by your actions, you can't expect that they'll automatically do it on your schedule. 

They call it 'rebuilding' relationships for a reason. It takes time and work, not just one text. Now you're angry at them that they didn't immediately act like the past summer didn't happen after one text. That's not really fair, I'm afraid. 

 It's not your fault you're depressed, and you do need to find people who are more understanding of what a struggle that is, but unfortunately at the same time you're the one with responsibility as to how you manage it and how it impacts other people, hard as that is. Stick with therapy and meds, try not to harbour rage towards people who have struggled to understand you, and focus on what you can do to keep taking care of yourself.",1630454584

They interrupted their usual feed to report that a plane had hit one of the towers of the World Trade Center towers in New York but at that point they were talking about it being a light aircraft that had hit one of the towers. It was being reported as if it was an accident. 

Then the second plane hit whilst the cameras were on it and everyone immediately knew this was no accident and this was effectively a declaration of war.

My point is that a personal insecurity is far heavier than anyone's actual judgement, and what I've found is that no matter what people say on this subreddit it really doesn't help in the real world.

This is different to for example Katakuri. His whole family follows him. He is an undercover leader of the crew when big mom is not competent. Katakuri has very strong leadership qualities unlike Marco.

From that I basically changed my own policy in our house.  If it was easy to rinse like an apple, then do it.  But if it's hard or annoying like lettuce and I don't want to do it and will choose something unhealthy to eat rather than rinse my lettuce for a salad, I don't do it.

Stalin being a commie imperialist doesn't make him less of a commie. I think it would be more accurate to say that it was a place he separated from traditional Marxism, not that it makes him slightly to the right. I don't think that just because Lenin and Marx opposed imperialism and saw it firmly through an economic lens that that makes imperialism economic. 

As far as part about state capitalism, that strikes me as the old ""real communism has never been tried"" nonsense. While I'm admittedly not an expert on Soviet history, I do believe both Lenin(as part of his War Communism) and Stalin(through his reversal of Lenin's New Economic Policy) tried to force through traditional Marxist things: farm collectization, fixed prices, redistribution, etc. Once it failed catastrophically, they brought capitalism back in certain spheres in order to get the economy working again. In other words, they only did ""state capitalism"" because even they realized that traditional socialism/communism doesn't work.",1630454589

"PokemonUnite","t5_2sks3d","It seems you're trying to force ganks too much.

Here's a quick breakdown
(Lilipup will always walk towards Ludicolo)

Route: Pup -&gt; Crab -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red -&gt; Crab

Why not..?
Pup -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red -&gt; Crab -&gt; Crab?

This path wastes your time because it forces you to end your route on blue crab side. Which would force you to gank for top/bottom, but if bottom/top needed help first you'd have a longer distance to walk.

Whichever lane you choose to gank doesn't have to result in a kill. Your first gank is secure bees (8:50) and that's all, anything else is a potential time waste.

After bees, you should just recall because your entire jungle will be up within seconds. Full clear your jungle, and head to center and secure 2-4 middle crabs. Then look for another gank, usually bot side since you want to be at bot before Dred

Secure Dred, recall or walk through middle to Rotom (it's faster and safer to recall) but a loss in exp cause you could get farm along the way from bot -&gt; middle -&gt; top

after Rotom secure, get the crash into their Tier 1 top goal. If it's already down, I'd personally recall and do a full clear again. It's so hard to get Rotom to crash into Tier 2 and it overall wastes time

At this point it's mid game where you got the gist of going Dred -&gt; Rotom -&gt; Jungle repeat etc. 

Just remember ganking does not have to result in kills/scores. Just secure farm for your laners so they can get exp which is the best resource in the game. Getting kills and scoring are just bonuses",1630454590

"loveafterporn","t5_oqcwn","Not a ‚Äúresource‚Äù but I suppose anecdotal‚Ä¶

My partner, who is a hyper-sexual pansexual man, and with consent would do it with whoever he finds cute, does not agree with your partner.

He says that 

1) [despite him being who he is] he does not have this issue. (Mind you, he has no problem telling me he finds someone cute or even sexy, or that he WOULD on rare occasions, so I trust when he says ‚Äúnaw, I ain‚Äôt over here mentally undressing and fucking people‚Äù)

2) he despises people who DO think like this, because it ties into that notion that humans aren‚Äôt anymore evolved than some wild animal in the woods. We have society, laws, knowledge about psychology and in depth medical care, and if dogs can understand ‚Äúno‚Äù and that they simply aren‚Äôt supposed to do certain things, then we certainly can do that and MORE.

(I got him on the phone, and this is what he said on it-)

‚ÄúHe has a prn addiction that a third grader could see, and no source could make him admit it if he doesn‚Äôt want to.

On his statement‚Ä¶I know what science he is twisting, he‚Äôs talking about the instinct to breed that most living beings have, but is most seen in young species to spread, but we are seeing that ‚Äòinstinct‚Äô decrease because it ISNT necessary anymore because there are so much of us‚Ä¶ but I see how he is twisting that to defend this behavior, but that does not mean he cannot control himself and change his thought process, cannot train himself to be better and not objectify others, so not only does he have a prn addiction, but also a sx addiction. 

He has problems, but to make any progress he has to first, on his own, ADMIT that he has these problems. Anyone trying to push him to change is out of luck until he chooses to admit he has a problem. He doesn‚Äôt want to stop, he doesn‚Äôt want to change, he doesn‚Äôt want to admit he has a problem, and while I hate to say ‚Äòlost cause‚Äô‚Ä¶ well.‚Äù",1630454590

Because of how electricity is produced and the limitations on distance, most power plants generate enough electricity to cover peak energy usage across the grid at all times, so there is a factor of expected wastage when this power isn't being put to use.

Bitcoin can solve this because bitcoin mining is the perfect buyer of last resort - Miners can act like a battery and spin up when power is in excess, buying the normally wasted energy at a discounted rate, and then can be halted when more energy is required at critical areas elsewhere on the grid.

Its comical that bitcoin is touted as a waste of energy - when it could make things like green and stranded energy much more economically viable; and in return provide security and immutability to what stands to become the worlds first global monetary network.",1630454590

So i just respected that and we did other fun stuff that wasn‚Äôt so amped up.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I think you're overblowing it. It's just some people giving their feedback in the main thread AFAIK. Has anyone even made standalone threads about it?

SC is an MMO, cool unique items for events is an expectation. People want to get something for their gameplay, and if SC is going to be an eternal alpha it's best for CIG to start sooner rather than later.  
This is just how most MMOs operate. Most single player games even. You do a big multi hour event, you unlock something cool. A recolor of the same helmet we've already received... 3 times(?) isn't very cool. Nor is a recolor of the same undersuit. And the chest armor is just a recolor with a decal, though it's probably the best of the lot.

You're right, people wouldn't be giving feedback that the reward is kind of lame if they got no reward at all, but why is ""the reward is lame"" not valid feedback?  
Again, CIG should start event rewards at some point, and there's no reason they shouldn't be able to manage rewards as cool as other MMOs.  
There's no reason anyone should be getting hostile over such reasonable feedback.

So then how would it work ? If it's open then he should be able to commit time to you, which is what ? Or will it be sneaking out whenever he can or making excuses like his kid has some event or whatever. Could he just take you away one weekend or even sleep overnight at your place ? 

And then of course what happens if you fall for him ? 
If she truly knows then you are either a FWB or a second in a poly relationship. And they usually fail when one of you falls for the other, develops feelings.

What attracts me to this trope is that the MCs usually have to find a way to live together and there are scenes of domestic living and sharing that I really enjoy. It is satisfying to see two people get stuck in a relationship and then work hard to make it work. And that moment when they realise that it has become more than a convenience brings some beautiful angst to the story.

And if all this is done with a grumpy and sunshine coupling then the book automatically goes to my all time favourites.

One thing that can ruin this trope for me is cheating, especially if it is just one person cheating. If they have both agreed on continuing to sleep with other people then it is okay but either they have to both do it or neither one should act on the agreementü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.",1630454592

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","&gt;Firstly I'm not sure how the World events could make someone feel something, when they give you no introduction to the characters, the stakes or anything. They can be funny, like the lady who's pet is a fox, but thats it. Odyssey had some nice little stories hidden in it, like the one about the Kingfisher (the slave who's brother is a crime boss), or the Seven Samurai-like town defense mission. I'm not saying any were tearjerkers, but they sure beat World Events for me.

Some of them were straight-up funny (fox lady, viper egg fart lady, etc.).  But I guess that I do not need to know the characters to relate to something.  The World Events touched on experiences that are so universal they need no character introduction--being orphaned, holding out hope that someone will return, losing a sense of self through dementia/Alzheimer's, feeling guilt over betrayal, etc.  They were obviously not all successful.  But I found them more meaningful than Odyssey's sidequests since they did a good job of just showing what day to day life might have been like for random villagers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Secondly, Valhalla spaced out its content, but added no substance to it. Stacking Stones. Put 20 Silver Tunas here. Bandit camp. Aside from flyting none of the side-activities were new AND good (raiding is just a fort with some AI and cool music). Having to ride 5 minutes from one thing to another, just to find that it was another Cairn made the game feel like a chore. Yes, Odyssey had a lot more busywork, but if you enjoyed the core gameplay it was still fun, and you never had to go far to find something you didn't even want to do. Plus the world had some really intersting places to find, like Iason's palace in Thessaly, where you'd also find his hammer. Bigger things also made the world feel like the devs cared more about the setting, like Knossos and the tourism centred around the minotaur, things like that. I can only come up with the Daughters of Lerion as a reference to King Lear that's similar in Valhalla, and maybe the Excalibur, but the sword is just there, the collectibles you find for it have nothing to do with Arturian legend, and the place you find is just a generic Isu tomb.  


This feels a little bit like apples to oranges to me, but I think that I broadly agree that classical Greece is a better setting than Dark Ages England.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Finally, I already discussed this, but the Assassin VS Order conflict was barely paid lipservice to.

I disagree.  Although the focus was not on assassins fighting Order members, that plotline was really about the transition between the Order and the Templars.  The game portrayed that well and with some smart twists.  Also, I personally enjoyed exploring the assassin lairs and recovering codex pages, but I agree entirely with you on the lack of incorporation of assassin stuff into gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Isu storyline also does nothing aside from showing that Odin and the Norse gods were Isu, they made Valhalla-computer, they died, reincarnated, and now Loki is back. 

We learned how they developed and used consciousness-preservation technology and much more about their attempts to stave off disaster.  We also got a much better sense of the Capitoline Triad and the motives of Aletheia.  Plus Yggdrasil was a huge new reveal of Isu tech.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They make the plot go forwards, and fit into the stereotypes of sneaky guy (Basil, Alfred), fight-loving viking (Ivar, the 2 brothers) , or evil person (the antagonists). 

I found Oswald, Ceolbert, Hunwald, etc. interesting.  I also liked how they grew.  Halfdan was also a great but tragic figure.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;not nearly as much as the family members in Odyssey. Nikolaos is an interesting twist on the 300-esque ""Sparta above all"" warrior, who regrets failing his family. Myrrine and Demos are both tortured by the Order in different ways, making it personal, giving Alexios/Kass an actual reason to hunt them as soon as we meet them,

Sure, they all had one or two traits, but I did not really see the writers take advantage of those to develop the characters adequately given the long length of the game.  Valhalla managed to explore political intrigue and core issues of legacy and finding oneself in much briefer time periods (i.e., the arcs).",1630454593

Biden opted for a large fire cracker and a long fuse. He stuck it in the shit and lit the fuse.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;Nope.  The answer to the question ""Do I believe in god"" is no.  That is NOT the same as saying I believe there is no god.  The fact that you don't understand that distinction is unfortunate.

You don't even try to describe the difference between those two sentences because you know there is no difference. Your just saying the same thing in different words. The fact is to not believe in God is to believe that God isn't, which is a belief without evidence. If you were an agnostic with no bias toward God you would say ""I don't know if I believe in God or don't believe in God"" and you wouldn't waste your time on subreddits debating believers.

&gt;I have addressed this, and I will one more time.  If a man tells me he has $1 million dollars in gold plates buried in his back yard, I do not believe him.  I'm not claiming he doesn't have the plates, just that I lack sufficient evidence to believe it's true.  It's the same way I approach any non-mundane claim (if you tell me you got a new puppy, I can conditionally believe you, as it's commonplace).  
&gt;
&gt;This is the only logical way to approach claims.  No belief is justified until sufficient evidence is provided.  If you truly believed that you should believe any claim without evidence and then go out and try to find supporting evidence, then you'd need to accept ALL religious claims, and you could find evidence for most of them.

Repeating an argument that I already countered isn't a counter. Stop repeating yourself and try again.


&gt;You did not read the passage.  It clearly and plainly says if the slave gets up in a day or two the owner is NOT TO BE PUNISHED.  You can ignore it, if you want, but the words are right there.  

And?

&gt;Are you equal to your property?  Would you be willing to be my slave under old testament laws?

If I was a slave being sold I'd rather be bought by a Jew than anyone else. At least under Jewish law I would have rights.

&gt;You misread me.  Owning people as property is abhorrent, when done by atheists, theists, agnostics, or any other person.  I do get that it was a common practice in early humanity, as was human/animal sacrifice, child marriage, and unequal treatment of women, but these are all terrible, immoral beliefs.  I don't hold that against the bronze age Israelite, but I would expect better from a perfectly moral law-giver.

You're so blinded by your hatred of God that you're unwilling to admit that a step forward is a good thing. And Israel's treatment of slaves and recognition of slaves having fundamental rights is major major step forward. Until America came along with the constitution a few hundred years ago no nation recognized people as having fundamental rights and here's Israel doing it THOUSANDS of years ago.",1630454596

"TheOther14","t5_2yn2so","What the fuck are we playing at?
I reckon half our players must have been sold or sent out on loan. We have 3 strikers, one who‚Äôll spend 1/3 of the season out injured, one who‚Äôs been in the papers over scandals more times than he‚Äôs scored goals and Neal Maupay who seems to have finally hit his stride (and I pray it stays, I‚Äôve moaned like hell about him in the past but I genuinely hope this is finally his season). 

Mwepu and Cucurella are great signings and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing Mitoma next year. 

Scherpen seems decent but realistically we‚Äôre probably not gonna see much if him unless he surpasses Steele or Steele becomes absent for some reason. 

Sima immediately out on loan is both sensible and yet completely baffling simultaneously.

Similarly Zeqiri, Khadra, Caicedo and Ostigard going out on loan are varying degrees of sensible but also equally frustrating. All players that could have broken through into the first team this season and the lack of depth up front and in the back is very worrying when we should have clearly very talented players like Zeqiri and Ostigard available. They all need to play in order to develop and the lack of guaranteed play makes the loans understandable but after last season the lack of depth I think should have been the bigger concern.

Really, really disappointed we lost Jahanbakhsh, criminally underrated player and never given a proper chance under potter. 

Scamming Arsenal out of 50M for white is great for us, I‚Äôm sad I haven‚Äôt been able to see him play for us in person but it‚Äôs not a great loss considering he was our 4th best CB behind Dunk, Webby and Veltman. He‚Äôs a good player but absolutely needs the right setup to work.

Really pleased we‚Äôve kept hold of Bissouma, he‚Äôll go down as an all time great at the club and his love for the club and the fans is such a wonderful thing to see. 

Duffy is like a new player, so glad we‚Äôve kept hold of him after the performances he‚Äôs put in. Was fully expecting him to be sold or loaned again after last season.

I desperately hope we can succeed after what has been a largely concerning transfer window for us, it would be great to see some success but the depth and track record of finishing definitely feel like they‚Äôre problems looming over us waiting to strike.",1630454596

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","It's important to note that many Monsters are classified where they are because the Guild has found evidence that suggests their evolution put them somewhere specific, primarily based on overall body structure.

So mammal-like Monsters that aren't Fanged Beasts like Zinogre or Paolumu aren't Fanged Beasts because their body evolution suggests they evolved mammal-like traits in their taxonomical classes rather than evolving from mammals.

Banbaro is another good example, as it's distantly related to Kestodon and Gastodon who are both quite clearly reptilian Brute Wyverns; Banbaro evolved mammal-like traits, rather than evolving from the mammalian Fanged Beasts.

Convergent evolution a.k.a. unrelated species evolving into similar paths that resemble one another rather than divergent evolution a.k.a. diverging from a common ancestor. It happens a lot in MH, actually.

=

With that in mind, let's try and further classify creatures more appropriately. Many Subspecies and Rare Subspecies (particularly ones from the 1st and 2nd generations) should be reclassified as Variants due to them usually still being the exact same species as the base one during a certain part of its life rather than a truly distinct species offshoot; Black Diablos, Blue Yian-Kut-Ku, Sha Dalamadur, etc.

Aside from that, there really aren't too many Monsters where their phylogenetic taxonomy really needs to come into question.",1630454596

"SIFallstars","t5_3ommd","Slightly late to the party since I was busy with Aoharu Cup for another game.  Speaking of which, there's some similarity with that scenario story with season 2 of SIFAS, but they handled it much better than SIFAS season 2.  Let's get back to my thoughts on chapter 30.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, this chapter was just pretty normal, as things are just winding down.  I guess it would've been a suprise if Mia/Lanzhu doesn't join, but they join as expected.  The biggest jab point is the whole build up to see who wins the audition, just to see that they are all entering as a whole.  They gave us all the build up and sub unit creation for nothing.  

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this season has definitely generate lots of talk, and now that things are back to normal, there isn't really much to talk about.  As such, I can see that this reinforced some people's idea of ""season 2 is great because it gave people lots to talk about.""  While it is true that it gave people lots to talk about, I still do not think that it was worth all that hassle to trample on existing character's personalities and popularity just to achieve the shock and awe factor to bring in two new characters.  Especially when it effectively split the community into two sides arguing with each other, and caused a mass exodus of players quitting the game.   Both Lanzhu and Mia's characters are actually perfectly fine, but they really didn't have to introduce Lanzhu in like that - just see how Mia is accepted by both sides of the argument easily with her story line.

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward, I'm not sure where SIFAS wants to go with their main story, as I'm sure they want to continue with the IMAS model and introduce even more characters into the group.  I really hope they use this opportunity to analyze and reflect on what their target audience wants - people wanted to see more interaction between characters of all 3 groups, and feature more characters who havn't gotten much of the spotlight.  Or maybe they think that the event/bond stories are enough so they can just do whatever they want in the main story...",1630454597

We've done a lot of reading and self reflection to ensure we don't make the same mistakes as our parents. (We're only children and introverts).

For me and my husband, it's that we can put our life and choices into context now. When we were childless, it seemed like we were working towards well... building something incomplete. We also wanted to give our child a better life and more stable upbringing than we had. Lastly, I think we both secretly long to experience life through a child's eyes. It's been absolutely amazing to grow up with our son. And unlike ourselves, he's going to have a sibling in a week. He can't stop talking about it üòç

By the way, everything that could go wrong with my son to give me a traumatic birth did (3 trimesters severe morning sickness, choleastasis, pre-eclampsia, 3 days of long painful induction, failed epidural during emergency c-section).

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;In the US you guys burst into tears when you're asked to wear a mask or get a shot, call it ""tyranny"". What a fucking joke.

Not in Los Angeles.

&gt;When Trump was in power, you could say whatever you wanted about him

Not really.  You can get a visit from the Secret Service if you talk about harm or overthrowing the government.

&gt;Do you think you can criticize Xi?

You can criticize the policy, sure.  But you can't advocate overthrow or question legitimacy.  Kind of like if you say the 2020 election was not legitimate you get de-platformed from all social media and fired from your job, meaning you get evicted, have bad credit, and are basically screwed.

&gt;Do you understand that dissenting opinions are not allowed in China?

Sure they are.  I've seen plenty of protests.  You just can't question legitimacy or threaten overthrow.  Protests happen a lot.

&gt;Can you even imagine what that's like?

Of course.  Where do you think I'm from originally?

&gt;Imagine for a moment that you wanted to criticize Trump but after making your post, the censors would delete it.

Sure.  It's called Twitter and Facebook.

&gt;Oh, and he's there for life. Just like Xi.

Yeah the General Secretary has never had term limits.  It's not a thing.

&gt;Why are they so afraid of them if their cause is so just and correct?

Because if they're anti-vaxx or some type of ""freedom"" people like Jan 6th I don't want their voices out there to mislead people.  Facebook agrees with me.

&gt;How the fuck can you trust a regime that censors this much shit?

Because the people who are anti-vaxx or Jan 6th rioters are worse.

&gt;If you're against billionaires, the CCP are not your friends.

That ended up being a mistake, and I got arrested that night and lost my license.

Between then and now it has been hard to forgive myself for that night, so last year along with COVID hitting, I decided to part ways with the one I loved to work on loving myself. 

I moved to my brothers house, but my sister in law gave me an ultimatum. So I was forced to move in with family across the country. I left a lot of good friends over there.

Now, about a year after that move, I‚Äôve gotten a job in a career that is going tremendously well, and I‚Äôve saved enough to purchase a condo! It‚Äôs amazing to me how far I‚Äôve come, but my ultimate goal is to keep growing and saving enough to come back to the place I call home.

That's an interesting thought but I'm not sure it would solve the core issue. The easier uptilts are likely done by shifting the angles like you said (or would effectively have the same outcome, since it should in theory be harder to tap jump when you increase the up-tilt range). But that isn't really a comparable tradeoff and it's still a function that's impossible on other controllers. Notches might be a different story though",1630454597

If anything they're all collaborating to create content to help cross subscriptions on their channels. The fact that we're all discussing vlogs is proof enough that content creation is working.

 &gt;Over 1,200 women were reportedly sexually assaulted during the 2015‚Äì16 public New Year's Eve's celebrations in Germany, in most cases by men of non-European origin. Multiple women reported being raped. In many of the incidents, women in public places had been surrounded and assaulted by groups of men. The  Bundeskriminalamt (German Federal Criminal Police) confirmed in July 2016 that 1,200 women had been sexually assaulted on that New Year's night.

Title: **Is this considered embezzlement?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I have a previous employer what seems like blackmailing me over ""embezzling"" money from their company - I think they just don't want to pay me the money they owe me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, they owe me mid 6 figures. I was a 1099 (treated as employee, bad enough). They made me 30% owner of the company (seen no paperwork). They were busy with another business (which was the main source of work for the business I worked for), and didn't give me any of the tools or means to do my job through their company for other companies. I began to get customers who wanted me (not the company, specifically me) to do their work, so without thinking, I used their software, email, logo to make money as a freelancer (everything else was in my name, tax info).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I made less than 4k total, and I have a text from my employer saying that what I was doing was fine. They have since fired me over it, and are now refusing to pay the total amount they owe me based on numerous reasons, including this one. I would be fine to eat some of the money just to be done with it, but it seems like they're trying to get me to take less than half of what I'm owed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I was just curious, if I have to take this to court:
&gt; 
&gt; * Would this be considered embezzlement?
&gt; * Does the fact I'm 30% owner also help my case that it isn't?
&gt; * Would it hold any water based on the fact I have a text saying what I'm doing is fine?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd rather not be in trouble for low embezzling, but I really can't lose mid 6 figures.

I came in hot and heavy in my last relationship and then realized after 2 months we were two different people. This unfortunately hurt the woman I was dating and I feel bad about that. So I am trying to be honest and straight forward, but also patient.

And I hear ya on numbers it gives me a goal to work towards lol. So yea maybe thats my barrier I need to work on and just allow for this to grow naturally. Good point hadnt considered that about myself. Thanks for feedback!",1630454601

He doesn't go to Prison, he goes into care and is monitored well, lives relatively comfortably, and then eventually leaves, perhaps years from now but eventually. From there, the prophesized and much foretold homeless saga. Who knows from there, maybe he finds some new friends.

If he has a bad lawyer, or the insanity plea doesnt work - prison. I very much doubt Chris will survive prison. Unless he isolates himself from everyone (which is unlike him at this stage and saga) he will undoubtedly make some enemies of himself. Chris isn't the type of prisoner who harmlessly keeps to himself and doesn't attract attention. Chris is the type to talk about his horseshit, feel superior to others, and accidentally or intentionally say the wrong thing to the wrong person.

If Chris goes to prison, he's gonna die.

Although, the fact that he's such an oddball and that he raped his mother could potentially keep people away from him, simply because of how strange he is. But that could also just be motivation for a beating in prison.

Especially those cards that give you until your NEXT turn to play them. One problem I ran into immediately was not being able to play a lot of the cards in time without them being permanently exiled, but that was easily fixed by bringing the curve waaaaaaaay down and adding some cheap/free rocks. Once my curve was down I realized I had lots of 0,1, and 2 drops and that is the perfect curve for a storm deck :D

&gt;Within psychology, the term habit refers to a process whereby contexts prompt action automatically, through activation of mental context‚Äìaction associations learned through prior performances. Habitual behavior is regulated by an impulsive process, and so can be elicited with minimal cognitive effort, awareness, control, or intention. 

(https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-129)

"technicallythetruth","t5_3pzez","The common way of explaing this is that the result changes depending on if we observe the experiment. It seems impossible, but we have to remember that observation is not a passive activity. Our eyes or cameras have to physically capture a photon which bounced off of the object to observe it. All forms of observation are a physical interaction.

Anyway, the purpose of the double slit experiment was to determine if light is a particle or a wave. The funny thing is the result was ""yes"". Depending on if it's being observed or not, photons can act like a particle or a wave. Photons were fired through two slits. If they grouped together in two slits at the end (imagine shooting bb's through the slits) the photons act like particles. If they form more groupings then it's a wave (imagine the whole setup submerged in water. Then a wave is introduced before the slits. On the opposite side of the slits the two ripples which make it through will interfere with each other and cause more than two ""peaks"")

One hypotheses about the quantum explanation for this is the collapse of the wave function. The idea is that there are no absolutes on a quantum scale, only probabilities until the system is measured. So, we can predict the probability we will measure a specific value, but we can't be certain. So, if not observed the quantum field can interfere with itself like a wave, but once measured it collapses in a way that shows one specific location like a particle.

Title: **Online game 1v1 money staking.**

Original Post: 

&gt; So I‚Äôm looking into making a company(ish) for players of online video games to bet money on each other of who wins. For example in a 1 versus 1 scenario the two players would say put in 15$ for a pot of 30$ and whoever wins gets that money would this fall under online gambling and need licenses?

I think you need to get a little more familiar with the animation pipeline in general first, what all the jobs are, how everything works on a basic level, then figure out where you'd like to fit in.

THEN focus on building your portfolio for that position with a good idea of what you need to show. There's no sense in worrying right now about internships or jobs.

Do you have a current portfolio? Also, do you live in or near a city with animation studios in it?",1630454602

"motherinlawsfromhell","t5_3cmxa","Wow ok so why Is your wife stil having contact with theses people? Honestly with you being NC the baby should be as well. In most instances it's the wife who has a problem with the MIL, so if she's NC so are the kids. I do not see how it should be different in this circumstance. The MIL is certainly toxic negativity and why would you want your child around that?? Has your wife had therapy for her abusive childhood?? I mean weight loss surgery at 16? Breast implants? Your wife needs to get away from her family. It doesn't matter what you do, MIL will talk shit about you. 

As the parents you set the rules and boundaries. But if you don't enforce them they are just suggestions.  Being a grandparent is a privilege not a right. You and your wife are adults. You do not need the pressure from the inlaws. If i were you I'd start to distance myself and my partner. Info diet for sure. Don't give all the info regarding due dates and delivery plans. I'd suggest at least 3 weeks after birth before anyone visits. Yes including MIL. If you feel she deserves to meet your child. Personally I'd put my foot down. 

If you are going to have boundaries start now. If visiting MIL and she starts her toxic negative gossip, leave. If she's at your house escort her to the door. If out in public remove yourself from the situation. Don't give her financial information. This is your child. You and your wife need to be a united front. Non of it will work if you don't stand together. Can your wife do that? Because eher mother will get worse now thay wife is pregnant. 

No unannounced visits. If you show up out of the blue we will not answer the door. Then stick to it. Start it now. Your wife needs as little stress as possible. So staying away from MIL is going to help that. In the end wife needs therapy to be able to get out of the FOG. Otherwise no matter what happens MIL will always be able to guilt wife into things",1630454604

Title: **Lease help needed!**

Original Post: 

&gt; I need some help friends. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, I went into my apt complex office to deliver our 30 day notice that we would not be renewing the lease. The manager told me that a 60 day notice is required, so I reviewed the the lease terms and it contradicts itself. In one section, titled Lease Duration, it does say ""written termination notice 60 days prior to any expiration is required"". BUT, in a different section, titled Expiration, it says ""at Expiration, this rental agreement shall automatically create a month to month tenancy unless: tenants have delivered written notice of intent to vacate the premises on Expiration, at least 30 days prior.""
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice?

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Not truthful and not possible. Mutual funds are not guaranteed. That‚Äôs the number one thing to know about mutual funds - literally depend on the stocks held within them, fluctuate with the markets. Can‚Äôt promise they will be at 24k, they could actually lose money between now and then. 

Not to mention TFSAs can not be joint. Now there is the chance she means she put OPs name as beneficiary in the event of her death, but in the meantime OP has no legal right to the money, and she could change the beneficiary at any time for any reason without notifying OP. 

Finally, as someone else said - why doesn‚Äôt she withdraw the money from the mutual funds to pay for the lease? Mutual funds are not locked in. Worst case there might be a commission charge due for withdrawing them before a certain point, but if she wants out of the lease that badly then she should eat that penalty. 

It doesn‚Äôt sound truthful, to be blunt. So either she is knowingly misleading you (in which case run), or she is confused about how her finances work (in which case run). You don‚Äôt want to be tied to this in either scenario.",1630454604

Ich w√ºrd aber sagen da√ü es typisch deutsches Essen abseits dem Klischee von Eisbein mit Sauerkraut nicht gibt (Deutschland ist noch nicht alt) aber es gibt sehr gute  regionale K√ºche, in dem Fall badisch oder els√§ssisch die nicht so weit auseinander sind. Im Elsa√ü ist essen eine noch etwas gr√∂√üere und l√§ngere Angelegenheit als hier. Ich empfehle einen Ausflug nach Colmar, auch wenn man zum Essen in Frankreich Zeit und Geld mitbringen mu√ü..

Richtig richtig gut regional essen tut man oft am besten auf dem Land aber auch nicht √ºberall.. z.B. in Staufen direkt am Rathausplatz.. L√∂wen. War vor ein paar Jahren sehr angetan, Gastro √§ndert sich aber auch oft..

Nicht so ganz billig aber sehr gut ist auch die ""Halde"" auf dem Schauinsland.

On the other hand, how about money of the internet? In my view, money of the internet - aka cryptocurrencies for pure transaction layer should have no fees. Otherwise resource allocation will follow layers with added value and fees on transaction layer will increase over time.

One of my partners and I were monogamous for 4 years before we got together with our partner together so it's possible in the right scenario for it to be as healthy as a monogamous relationship.

You'll have to make it so you can exchange *specific* sets of traits rather than making it more generally freeform. Then you can come up with your own internal logic for how each trait works.

I'd say the simplest way to handle this is have it that whatever traits you swap only change how the object interacts with the world, not the object itself. E.g. swapping the densities of two objects won't physically change their densities, but rather exert opposing/supplemental forces to that of gravity, buoyancy, etc. Softness and hardness, however, are very complex properties I'm not sure how one would interpret, but at the end of the day you can choose to just not explain some things if they remain logically consistent.

It'd be a more extrinsic way of looking at the enchanting process, as something that's applied to the object, not something intrinsic changed about its substance.",1630454605
