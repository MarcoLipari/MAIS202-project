States further north will have basements dug into the ground where possible, becsuse water and sewer services need to be that much lower to get below the frost line in winter. Most homes further south don't have basements, most are either slab on grade, or done with a crawl space that is a few feet tall with the home built on top of that.

Homes further north will have insulation and a vapor barrier installed on the exterior walls. The vapor barrier is needed because when cool air from outside hits the warm air from inside, you get condensation. That isn't a problem when it is warmer outside than it is inside, and only by a matter of 10-20°F. Water doesn't condesnt when it's 70° inside your house and 90° outside. It does condense when it is 20° outside and 70° inside. If you go further south, vapor barriers are not common. Paper backed R12 insulation, drywall, and done.

If you're further south, plumbing snd HVAC get installed in exterior walls and attic spaces. That is something that would never get done in a state further north where it freezes regularly during the winter.

So you can't just ask ""do I need to do gasketed boxes in exterior walls?"" and get a straight answer.",1640995200

至于医疗体系挤兑，老人和慢性病日常维持消耗的医疗资源和新冠重症消耗的医疗资源是有很大区别的，这方面冲击肯定会有，但打完疫苗之后不会到击穿医疗系统的地步。
而且不是所有老人和慢性病患者得了新冠都必须马上住院，绝大部分人打完疫苗之后就算新冠也不会重症。
更何况又不是一下子连口罩都不带，戴口罩，做好防护，逐步放开让整个系统流转起来，最后就是可以达到一个稳态。现在中国各种地方的感染新闻这几个月看了很多了，根本清零不了，这么高压封锁还不发疫情补助，何时是个头？",1640995200

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"Unity3D","t5_2qwj8","&gt;I'm not sure what your video is meant to demonstrate other than resizing behavior, which is how Unity's UI anchoring is designed to work.

It's demonstrating what my goal was, reached by putting anchors to corners, rather than the useless default anchor presets. You asked what i meant, meaning my text explanations were not sufficing, so i showed you.

&gt;I'm still not sure exactly what you want, but my sense is that what want you to do is create a World Space Canvas that will hold your card data. Save that as a prefab and clone it as for as many cards as you need and populate it with your card data (probably best to include a ""Card Controller"" on the prefab that you can reference and will do all the heavy lifting within the prefab)

Yes that is what i have done. 

My specific projects problem is solved, though i stand by all of my criticisms of the anchor system. While i don't fully understand the technical side of how they work, i know that something a simple as microsoft paint could handle scaling rotated objects 15 years ago, im confident the professional and experienced devs at unity could manage it if they wanted to for example.",1640995200

Lillet Blanc has an afteraste like Herbal Essences hairspray.

Rye is superior to bourbon in almost every cocktail, BUT some rye has a turnip green/pot liquor aftertaste that can ruin a cocktail.

Vodka is good in creamy drinks and Bloody Marys, but really the best vodka for a Bloody Mary is Absolut Pepper so it's flavored vodka so not as boring.

I think Hufflepuff would have the gentleness and closeness that Harry has been denied most of his life. Loyal, fair, hardworking. I think that is what Harry both needs in his life and also what defines him. From the day he first meets his friends he would do anything for them and that is very Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff also is the most inclusive house and that works great for Harry because he's always been the outsider and Hufflepuff is the outsider house. They welcome in everyone who has been rejected elsewhere and Harry has been rejected everywhere in his life. He would meet a greater variety of people and not fall into any one role.

I think it's too early to make comparisons on where price points will land -- though in these early stages I completely understand where you're coming from.

I agree there could be a demographic who refuses to include it in their diet due to the process. Much like those against GMOs. I think that's inescapable.

I'm really interested on your take on insect meat taking off. I founded an entoprotein company which quickly turned into a research company because there was next to no interest for insects for human consumption. What was really interesting, the interest that WAS generated around insects as food mainly came from the vegetarian and vegan communities! Do you think people have a different mindset about insects as food today, in comparison to a decade ago? Are attitudes towards insect consumption demographically influenced, in your opinion? And sorry to make it seem like I'm asking you essay questions lol, but, do you think there's a reason that some vegans and vegetarians place different values on insect lives verses your typical farm animals?",1640995202

"AfterEffects","t5_2rc1h","If you go to your layer in the timeline and expand the little arrow next to its name, it will reveal everything this layer has.
Usually, you will see property groups (effects, transforms, masks). These are just groups in which properties are contained.
If you expand the “effects” group, then expand the effect you are using (transform in your case) it will reveal all properties of the effect.

Properties in after effects usually have values and are keyframeable. For example, “position” is a property, “scale” is a property and “width” could be a property. Effects aren’t properties, but they usually have properties.

It’s hard to tell but it sounds to me like you are using the “effects controls” panel to access the property you want to keyframe. Properties can’t be selected from that window, however you can double click their name to reveal them in the timeline. So if you have a transforms effect applied, you can double click the property you are animating and reveal it in the timeline. From there you can select it (or its keyframes) and open the graph editor.

The graph editor is just a representation of the keyframes and what’s in between them. If you don’t have any keyframes selected it won’t show anything.

If this still wasn’t clear maybe it would help if you attach a screenshot of the entire window and tell us what you’re trying to do",1640995202

I think there’s nothing with talking about sex when you meet someone. Yes, sex shouldn’t be the center of your potential relationship but I think it’s an important topic to be discussed (any point before marriage). Again, I’m not saying you need to do it before marriage but it doesn’t hurt to talk about it at ANY POINT in a relationship.

Sexual compatibility is extremely important in a relationship and people often dismiss that. I’m freaky, and I wanted a partner that’s open to trying things. 

I get his stance but tell him “I’m not asking because I’m trying to fuck tonight. This is a normal question and topic to be discussed. I’m not asking for nudes or detailed/graphic conversation about sex”

I say, if you can’t 100% vomit your thoughts and emotions out…this is not your person. My husband knew I was a single mom, living with my parents, getting my bachelors degree and other very very personal information. He told me extremely personal information too. Buts that’s us, so don’t compare y’all to us. But don’t hesitate on a topic or feel as though “I can’t talk about it”",1640995203

The house was more of a liability to most buyers since they would be cahsed up enough to be doing a knock down rebuild on the nice quarter acre site. But as FHBs that wasn't an option for us.

So what I'm getting at is could you just sell it and re-coup most of your money?

Just because the virus itself is small and can pass through, it would never survive.  Put the virus on a plain surface and as soon as it dries out very shortly after it’s dead.

The mask 100% absolutely stops how much phlegm, you spit, spray, cough and/or sneeze.  The mucousy carrier of this virus that lets it survive longer on common surfaces.

How can anyone say “masks don’t work”. No one ever said it was a be all end all, it definitely helps and when there is no bonifide cure otherwise, we need to employ various different solutions that might all contribute to somewhat of a containment.

No studies have shown a direct relationship and most studies are either associative (or done with fried foods, not pan sauteed vegetables). It's probably like most other things and OK in moderation. I doubt you're living the perfect life and the increased risk from vegetable oil might not really matter that much given other likely carcinogens and life choices which can adversely impact health. 

Even if trying to live the ""perfect"" life, the stress of doing that would prolly cause huge issues.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I agree with the guys. Love it or hate it, I think there's a lot of interesting things about it to make it a worthwhile recommendation, so long as you'll be satisfied with something other than the type of Matrix movie you'd expect.

I thought what this movie was saying was ambitious. The *movie* is the simulation, and the 'system' is the film industry, with both the studio execs and the audience themselves as part of the system of control. It was an interesting take on what The Matrix is, both as a story and the very thing it's telling the story about. I think the meta-awareness and 4th wall breaking is sort of a perfect way to use a Matrix vehicle, because it plugs into the themes of the original Matrix so well.

Control, freedom, creativity, simulation, etc were all strong themes of the original film, and I found this movie made me think about these same things in a new light that is actually a bit more profound than the original movie in one key way. As an audience member watching this movie, *you are in the Matrix*, because *this Matrix is the film itself*. The original movie made you wonder if it were possible you were really plugged into a computer, which made you go 'whoa' when you considered it. 

But this movie takes it to the next level. The 'simulation' we are trapped in, to placate us and keep the machines ('the Suits' that NPH references, the execs behind the studio) running, is the medium of storytelling (by the studio system) itself. NPH even describes it as a product in the film, and not so transparently talks about how expensive it was to resurrect the characters and how his quarterly numbers are up, etc. He talks about what keeps people happy and complacent by giving people the emotional elements they want, and how keeping people agitated but never allowed to have a payoff keeps the system going with greater 'profits' than ever. He says that people will never be happy with what Neo and Trinity can give them, that people don't want that sappy bullshit. In a way it seems he's right. 

One thing I was surprised that they didn't mention was the Merovingian's crazed ranting in his scene - I had to go back with captions, but he's crazily ranting about how his old world of art and culture has been ruined, and this new world is a nightmare of reboots and sequels, and he even calls out Mark Zuckerberg as one of the ills of society. It's interesting that the original trilogy was about Neo breaking an endless cycle of the Matrix being rebooted over and over, and this movie has commentary to say about the reboot/sequel/rehash culture. 

So no, I don't think this movie was exactly a 'middle finger' to Warner Brothers or 'bad on purpose', exactly, but I do think the reasons a lot of people don't like it were deliberate choices that were made to make this a story about breaking that cycle. A lot of complaints are about the action, the color grading, etc. The things people expect in a sequel or reboot. Things like bullet time were deliberately subtracted from the film - not to intentionally have 'bad action', necessarily, but to make a meta-commentary on sequelitis and rehashing. 

The most meta thing about the movie is the commentary that the new 'wool that is pulled over our eyes' is the media system erected around us that feeds off us, as the Machines do, as the Matrix does in the film. Keep the viewer placated with the comfortable rehashes and nostalgia and expectations they want, and they won't rebel against the system, and the system will thrive with profits. 

The first Matrix film asked, 'What if we were all living in a simulated reality under a system of control, exploited by those who wish to profit off us?'

This movie says, 'We all live in a *mediated* reality, under a system of *placation,* exploited by those who wish to profit off of us.'

In a way I think this film is more ambitious than even the first film in delivering this message - the SAME message - by making it almost interactive and literal. I wanted some cool-ass kung fu as much as anyone, but I think I appreciate the deliberate choice to *not* rehash that stuff more in service of the themes of the film. This is the story of the first film - about breaking out of that shell of control - but told in only a way a Matrix film can do, by making it a Matrix film about a Matrix film. Reinforcing the themes of the original, but demonstrating how those themes apply to us and the world we live in - the mediated reality we live in is perhaps not so far removed from the idea of the simulated reality posited in the original. In a way, we do live in a literal Matrix, with a system of control guiding us and thriving off us.

For that, I loved it. It gave me a lot to ponder over for days after watching it, which is what the original film did as well. Once again, I'm thinking about stuff like Simulacra and Simulation for the first time in 15 years, and the absurdity of a map so detailed that it contains everything within it that it represents.",1640995204

I very much enjoy some games that fall into that category. My favorite games this year were Inscryption (84 metacritic) and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (83 metacritic). Both of which appealed to my particular tastes so I was able to overlook the obvious issues that prevented them from getting 85+ ratings.

But then the second category of games in the 75-85 range are those games which are just... okay. They do everything mostly right and are generally ""good"" but there is just no particularly outstanding aspect. Games like Metro Exodus, Control, or The Evil Within 2 fit into that category.

"RomanceBooks","t5_2sxjx","I read a lot of different genres, but the one I've been reading the most these past 2 years or so have been romance. It's not a big deal at all if you just read romance! Many people don't read at all!

But if you want to start reading more of other genres, maybe start with some books that have good romantic subplots or plot lines that you're more into.

For example, I'm real big into villains, vampires and enemies to lovers, so I like branching out and reading books with interesting villains such as Interview with the Vampire, Picture of Dorian Gray, Ladder to the Sky, etc.

YA Fantasy can be good because they often have romantic plots without it being the main thing.

You can also try romance-adjacent works. Works that feature a love story but aren't really romances. Like Wuthering Heights or even something like Mexican Gothic which has a fun romantic subplot but isn't the main story. Also try works such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice for a more ""high brow"" conversation-starter classic, but still more of a romance.

That's how I started reading more outside the romance genre. Then when I appreciated those kinds of books I could slowly get into more high-brow books and intense classics or philosophical works.",1640995205

We’ve also nerfed all types of fire magic skills to 1% of their damage. 

All enemies are buffed so you need a full group to have a hope of killing enemies your level. 

All loot is nerfed to nothing. Loot only exists if you pay $10/month to our curated list of dog streamers.

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require post titles to be more descriptive, to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics/Content`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

"neurodiversity","t5_2tzqe","I'm talking about visibly autistic people... So ""low-functioning"". I guess. That's the issue with functioning labels, I don't know what you're actually talking about: nonverbal autistic people? Intellectually disabled autistic people? Visibly autistic people? (ie: ""weird"", doesn't do eye contact, stoic face, monotone voice)? Hypersensitive autistic people who can't go out without openly stimming and/or ear defenders? Autistic people who are not independant? Etc. Etc. Usually people say low-functioning when they mean non-verbal or intellectually disabled, which is what I assumed you meant. That is why diverse autistic people can be ""detected"" and discriminated against even if the employers does not know their official diagnostic.
But anyway we were talking about diagnosed actors who face hardships accessing non-autistic roles so that's not really on topic.

As for female autism, as I said, the common assumption among people who study asd is that there are probably the same amount of autistic girls than boys but that they are undiagnosed (which explains the huge increase of autism diagnosis in girls). But if you're talking strictly about diagnosis statistics then yes, I guess you are correct that autism is currently less common in women

The former governor of the what now? You would expect from reading that this is some kind of big organization right? Yet I can find literally no information about it online. You mean the one at the top of Google purporting to examine gender from a ""Christian worldview""? Sounds very scientific doesn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The American College of Pediatrics also compared ‘treating GD with transitioning’ to ‘treating anorexia with liposuction.’

Ah yes, the same reputable, totally [not regarded as a pseudo-scientific hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-college-pediatricians) that [advocated for conversion therapy](https://acpeds.org/blog/the-scientific-case-for-counseling-choice-for-lgbtq-identified-youth) and [advocated against homosexual adoption](https://acpeds.org/position-statements/homosexual-parenting-a-scientific-analysis). I'm sure their opinion is truly erudite.

Which still offers reassignment surgery just on an individually assessed basis? Strange of them to offer it at all if it supposedly has no evidence supporting its use eh?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Furthermore, researchers believe that \~1/20,000 people naturally suffer from the condition that causes gender dysphoria. Meanwhile, polls have found as many as 2% of people consider themselves trans (in extremely liberal areas;) using those numbers, there are up to 400 people participating in transgenderism as a bizarre fad for every 1 that actually suffers from it.

These are different ways of measuring the same thing. Why are you holding one as irrefutable truth and using the other to conclude that the difference must just be liars?",1640995206

One thought I have had about this shortage is that I don't think it is going away, at least without more immigration. The reason is we are seeing the largest generation the world has ever seen, Baby Boomers, all reach retirement age. They are working less and less now but still consuming.

Baby Boomers did not have nearly as many kids as their parents. So, the workforce to produce for them is smaller than the consumer base. The good news for workers is that there is a high demand for labor. Therefore, we do not have to take low-paying jobs that treat us like shit. The only way to reduce the effects of our population decline quickly is to have more immigration to boost the working-class population.  Again, this is all just a hypothesis.",1640995207

If she was afraid of me then, she would be absolutely terrified of me now. Not because I am actually a threat to anyone. I'm not. But because I am totally and completely unafraid to stand up for myself now or to call her treatment of me what it was -- abuse of power. She would likely run in the opposite direction if we ever crossed paths, at least that has been my experience with all of the other cowardly abusers from my past.

"JoeRogan","t5_2s4tv","This study doesn’t say anything close to what your title says. Im struggling to understand why you would post this and how you think it means that.

Literally says that vaccines are effective against Omicron after primary vaccination (first 2 shots), but wanes after 5 months (but not completely ineffective), and if you get a booster, protection is established again. 

READ THE STUDIES YOU POST.

Edit: you can’t surmise causation that vaccines actually cause people to be more likely to contract omicron. You have to account for many factors. For instance, what are behavior differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated in that country? What is the seroprevalence? If vaccinated take more risks, they’re more likely to contract. If natural immunity infers better protection than vaccines and there’s a near 100% seroprevalence in that country, then vaccinated would be more likely to get infected. The way your title reads could be (and will be) interpreted to mean that being vaccinated actually makes you more susceptible to infection.",1640995207

"bjj","t5_2qn02","**Ego in psychoanalysis:**

**the part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.**

**In Philosophy : a conscious thinking subject.**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, it either means a ""Thinking"" which you know is something alive conscious things do, and if that dies... well we call that brain dead.

Or even from a Psychoanalysis stand point, it's actually merely a model.

There's no physical ego, no ego wire of the brain (as far as I last check with neuroscience).   Which in a sense means it's ""thingness"" is up for debate.  A term we use to describe something that may or may not exist in that capacity.  (It's not like a lot of modern Psychology is still using Freud's version of psychoanalysis, it has whole new ideas).

It's just kind of this term people abuse without knowing what it is exactly.  ""EGO death"" is more or less losing a sense of self for a few moments because you're tripping or you're so focused at the task at hand, that in that moment you're not concerned about identity.

Doesn't mean the identity dies or goes away, it most certainly is alive and well (as alive and well as something incorporeal as an identity can be).  And certainly the ego will be all to willing to tell you about how it died and how enlightening it was (oh the irony).

&amp;#x200B;

(I also admit I could be off the mark, I'm layman who reads psychology stuff and mysticism for fun.  I'm open to be correct by individuals more in the know.)

Edit: Also, please no one think I'm shitting on your spirituality or something.  I'm as ""spiritual"" as they come, literally the Woo'est dude you'd ever meet.",1640995209

"Nevada","t5_2rqwi","&gt;Conservationists and tribal leaders are suing the U.S. government to try to block construction of two geothermal plants in northern Nevada’s high desert that they say will destroy a sacred hot springs and could push a rare toad to the brink of extinction.

You know what else will push that rare toad to extinction: unrelenting global use of fossil fuels and the extreme heat and weather conditions it is creating in the Nevada backcountry.

I get the sentiment behind wanting to protect a rare toad species. That's a laudable and good thing to do. It is just not logical, however, to weigh it equally against the degradation of our planet-wide ecosystem and the widespread extinctions and human suffering that continued use of fossil fuels is bringing.

We're going to have to accept some habitat losses to convert over carbon neutral power sources. There are no perfect solutions.

Compromises must be made if we want to stop using coal, natural gas and oil to produce energy. Geothermal projects are nearly always going to be near hot springs. We are going to have to become okay allowing some of them to be damaged in exchange of ending the much larger damage caused by pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",1640995209

How long have you been on the Wellbutrin? Did you happen to miss a dose? Wellbutrin is less likely to cause REM sleep issues than a serotonergic agent (SSRI/SNRI) but it still seems to change REM sleep patterns to some degree so this could be a medication effect. There have been isolated case reports of sleep paralysis following cessation of Wellbutrin (bupropion) therapy. 

If this is an isolated incident you've got nothing to worry about. If it becomes a recurrent issue, you may want to discuss your medication with your PCP. Again, options may be limited because bupropion seems to be the least offending agent, but this may differ for you.

"thetagang","t5_27n9fl","Both contracts will go up pretty much equally, yes.

In the example of a bought 30 and a sold 32 and the underlying went from 30 to 32, there would be a gain, but it would not be the max gain.

In the recent past, I did a bought spread that was OTM 19 wide for a net debit of 8 with like 30 DTEs.  When I bought the spread, the bought strike was like +6 from the underlying already, so the sold strike was like +25.

The underlying then proceeded to go up over 2 weeks pretty rapidly.

With the lower strike breached, putting the option ITM, I was able to sell for a credit of like 10.  I didn't sell it then, though.  I just held.  The underlying having gained like 11, I would have gained like 2.

A couple more days went by and the underlying kept rocketing up and I was able to sell for like... 14.  The sold leg, even 19 strikes up just kept on cutting into my profits pretty severely.  Short leg 19 higher was still going up like 75 cents for each $1 my 19 strikes lower long leg was going up.

Then the underlying turned and started heading back down again slightly.   I was still far into profit zone and I thought for sure that would hurt the short leg a lot more than the long.  It didn't.

I did eventually close this out for a 2600 credit and a 500 debit (+21/share) which is a tad over 3x of what I paid to get in (+225%) but you would have thought I would get there a lot more quickly with such a huge gap in strikes and how quickly it went DITM.

Similar to your example, I was near the sold strike within at the most a week of this 30 DTE contract.  Technically speaking, I did actually end up with more than the max profit (19/share if exercised at &gt; sold strike), but it took quite a while to get there.  More than half the contract was gone before I could get out with an amount I was happy with.",1640995214

Ask for agomelatin or (if it’s just a severe depression without overwhelming anxiety) wellbutrin or buspar.
And if you don’t have a severe depression, keep away from this pills altogether, they just work with severe depression and even there’s just a 30% chance of it to work better than placebos.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","there is a difference between taking precautions based on your experience and constantly making assumptions about peoples intentions and behavior based only on their sexuality. There is a difference between watching your drink or not accepting a ride home from a man and warding off all men because they are capable of harm. realistically, anyone is capable of harm. If someone has trauma from a masculine person, i absolutely respect their deterrence to to presence of masculine people as part of their recovery. But avoiding a present visual physical reminder of stress is not the same thing as thinking and acting as though most man have ill intentions at all times to the point where you stop once you find out theyre a man and dont see them as a complex person. And its not a permanent solution, it is a boundary necessary to create stability for recovery. People are all individuals and deserve to be treated as such, and if we dont leave space for that to be vocalized, the assessment of negative patterns among certain groups dominates the conversation and creates a harmful stereotype. ""not all men"" is harmful because it is normally used as a response to someone who is saying ""we need to do something about this men on women violence"". Usually the solutions suggested are along the lines of ""we need to teach young men that respect for women and equality is important"" or ""we need to have safe spaces for women so they have a non discriminatory opportunity to eliminate the potential stress of taking precautions to find out what men are misogynistic or dangerous"", or, as you said, ""men need to hold each other responsible for their behavior"". That is not what is happening here. OP is not trying to discuss what theyre concerned about with other bi women (as op identifies as ""a little bi""), or looking for people more in line with their female leaning sexuality to feel community and inclusion and security, or saying ""people need to stop entertaining heterosexual heirarchy"" or even ""queer women who are inexperienced with wlw relationships or not sure about their sexuality should communicate that up front and honestly so they can match with a woman prepared to enter that kind of relationship"". No. OP is asking ""how do i find out if a girl im into has a boyfriend, because ive identified that as the problem and solution"" and not only that, they call it a choice/behavior in one of their comments. There is room to criticize problems in the bisexual community without acting like this. There are ways to protect yourself without acting like this.",1640995214

It's not quite that bad.... but its bad. The paragraph is in a block format to fit on the printed dec. You can't have the end of line split in certain places of a sentence. Primarily the unit designation. So if their name is long enough it causes the unit number to be on a separate line from the rest of the name, you're SOL. Cause that is unsat. Gotta change to one of only 3 allowable font sizes. Oh, now its too long? Rewrite the guts so it isn't. But now that you took out those three words so its short enough it doesn't flow right or have a meaningful impact..... Make is sound better. Too long again? Shrink it back down... wait, the unit number is by itself at the end of the line.... FUCK!

As others have said, narrative format vs. bullet format isn't really the issue. Its that the nitpicking has reached ludicrous levels and leadership is demanding numeric metrics for things that don't even make sense to have a numeric metric. Nevermind that some of the most important factors they are looking for are subjective and qualitative rather than quantitative. 

I swear, when someone in Sq leadership returns feedback on a bullet for ""how many personnel did this impact"" and ""what was the effect on the mission"" for a bullet on how someone volunteered to organize and run a Sq P&amp;R ceremony.... I just want to give up. Its squadron level. WTF cares how many people are in the squadron, they have no ability to control or impact that number. Also, YOU ARE IN THE SQUADRON. The only people looking at the EPR know how large the squadron is. Anyone who doesn't isn't going to have any real comparison for how many people that is vs. how many people it should be. 

And it DOESN'T HAVE A FUCKING MISSION IMPACT. Its a mandated unit event for personnel recognition. Improves morale and what not. I've never heard of, nor seen, a CC's call that actually increased overall Sq performance. And if it does, no supervisor has access to those numbers. And there is no way to tell what impact, if any, the event had on mission performance in a quantitative manner!

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","&gt; that's a non-sequitur, maybe make it your new year's resolution to be more forthright, ehh?

Sure, let me clarify. Livability in terms of urban living is generally defined as comfortable, safe, and habitable. 

If someone's property -- public or private -- is being altered in ways they don't like from constant unapproved painting; that's a bruden and cost. Also, people don't want random weirdos traipsing on their property, and this includes public agencies like ODOT et al. 

The Office of Neighborhood Involvement (ONI) had graffii abatement programs and discusses them alongside the broader discussion of liveability, so graffiti **very much** is a livability issue:

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Yes kind of, however, the scones that I've had which may not be quite like what you have on your side of the pond are considerably more dense then American biscuits. The biscuits I make tend to rise very tall compared to the scones that I've tried. They are also rather fluffy because American biscuits use baking powder, often there's buttermilk in the mix and with the beer included you also have the leavening action of carbonation and the small amount of yeast. I suppose I could send you a recipe for American style biscuits. They're really rather nice with soup or stew and have a different flavor from regular bread. No doubt you can find recipes for American style biscuits online if you want to give them a try sometime. They're delicious with butter and honey or fruit spread. In the American South, we often serve them with what we call white gravy or country gravy, which is basically like a bechamel sauce but instead of using butter to make a roux, we use some sort of meat dripping or meat fat such as that from cooked pork sausage, ham or bacon. Then we place the cooked, crumbled sausage back into the gravy give it a stir, and a few good Twist of cracked black pepper. That is quite popular in the American South as a breakfast dish. We call it biscuits and gravy. A hard-boiled egg on the side is also quite tasty with it",1640995216

Its absolutely ridiculous in this day and age that companies can pay 2 people completely different just because of a zip code. Rent/utility prices are the same way and they shouldn't be. Example: I live in Illinois ( state of high taxes and crooked politicians) and I have a friend that lives in NC. I have a 3 bedroom house that is 950 square feet and I pay $350/mo (mortgage) but my utilities run between $800 and $1100 a month. She has a 3 bedroom house that is 2500 square feet she pays $450 /monthly in rent. All of her utilities are on one bill and she pays $180/monthly. 

You would think based on those numbers that her pay would be less but nope. The same job I had in Illinois paid $12.36 /hr (that was with multiple years experience and 5 yrs with them) but in NC they started you out at $18/hr regardless of experience.

I would like to reach under 100 kgs (220 lbs) by the end of the year, but if I miss it by a few lbs it'll be okay either, just going lower than I am. Besides my weight, I have also started to take care of other aspects of my (physical) health, so I have planned several doctor's appointments in the next few weeks to get some insight about where I am and where I want to go. I am also considering a gym membership but there's quite a few restrictions over here regarding this, so I am still debating with myself. And finally, I need to take care more of my mental health. 2021 has been rough and in my past an episode of poor mental health has been leading into poor eating habits.",1640995217

In this (totally original) series, all the locations are in the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth. Each location is further north than the previous one.

Specifically, the coordinates for each round - **your answer** - lie between **two consecutive lines of latitude.**

The two consecutive parallels are indicated by the entry number. Since this is entry #27 of the series, the coordinates for this round lie between the 27th parallel north and the 28th parallel north.

In other words, the latitude value (i.e., the first number) of the coordinates is **between 27 and 28.**

You will be given the +correct if your guess lies between the two parallels and is **within 30m** of the correct coordinates.

**Hints:**

- Asia, this is in a capital city
- This is a vlog. You might have to find the channel before finding the video, or you can just scrollololol

I know more about historical artifacts than like scientific/Dino artifacts, so maybe dinos artifacts are less likely to be fake. But statistically around 80% of artifacts are frauds or at least looted. I did research on this for school project a million years ago and will look for the article (I think it was the New Yorker) to back it up. Edit: ok so I couldn’t find the original article I did researched on but this supports my statement by the Smithsonian-  https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/most-antiquities-sold-online-are-fake-or-illegal-180967062/ . I will keep looking for it but I think this is good for now. To be fair this is more about historical artifacts but historical and Dino artifacts are often sold together on these sites. Online sale and looting of artifacts is fascinating topic to research as it relates to many unexpected things such as terrorism and how many museum contain illegal looted artifacts and will auction them off.
Edit 2: I found an article on the sale of dinosaur fossil too if anyone is interested- https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/science/plundering-science-bone-by-bone.amp.html, seems like more looting than fraud in the Dino world of selling artifacts

1- work on paying off that debt as fast as possible and check out r/personalfinance sub for tips. Sounds like trying to increase your income is the way to go. If holding on to your current job will be good for your resume which would therefore increase income later on, I feel like that’s a really good reason to stay put. The idea of picking up another job is good! I’d look up the debt snowball method on paying it off - go for the higher interest stuff first and consolidate for lower rates if you can. Once you pay off the debt (or even better while you pay it off), start setting aside money in a high yield savings account for an Emergency Fund. That way, next time you have an urgent expense the money is already there. 

2 - I have found I love my morning routine, I take the time for myself in the morning before I have to turn the work part of my brain on. I start at 8 too - I try and get up around 6/6:30 which automatically gives you an extra hour in the day. When it’s warm out, I take my coffee in a to go mug and go for a walk around the neighborhood. When it’s cold and I workout at the gym after work, I put it on my calendar. This helps me put work down and call it a day (or at least take a break) in the same way some of my colleagues would have to stop to put dinner on the table for their kids. Just because I’m young single and childless doesn’t mean I don’t get to have an hour to myself in the evenings! I also try and figure out the easiest good meals with the least amount of dishes - the Trader Joe’s frozen section is my best friend. Before I go to bed, (I stole this from TikTok) I do my “closing” tasks like putting all my dishes away, clothes away, tidying everything. That way, nothing ever builds up and I can clean the house in 5 mins a day instead of an hour once a week. 

3- never been in a LDR, but I think it’s important to remember quality over quantity. There’s no point in having a 2 hour long FT if you’re so tired and burnt out that you’re not going to actively participate in conversation. I’d talk that over with your partner and remind them of that if they’re struggling with the quantity of together time you can offer. Could you call while you cook and eat dinner? Call while you’re going on a walk? Also, if you know when your relationship will go from long distance to not long distance, that could be a great light at the end of the tunnel and motivation to keep up the energy it takes to maintain the relationship.",1640995218

* My home page on my web browser is suppose to show me recent news stories.  In the last little bit it's been showing me stuff that is months out of date, like Tiger Woods car accident several months ago.
* Bluetooth and WIFI on my devices keep dropping out and I have to keep reconnecting devices.
* When I try and call some people on the phone, their phone just keeps ringing.  I then try from a different phone and I get through, and they say they didn't receive my first attempt.
* Some motion sensor lights I have are working intermittently (although I may just have to check batteries for those).

The only difference with you being the only person on the lease, and the fact that it’s a family property, is that eviction will be nearly impossible if they won’t evict the lease holder. 

At this point you need to convince him to leave on his own accord and with reasonable notice. Most locations require 60 days notice, so that would would be a good amount of time. 

Alternatively, you can offer him cash for keys. It’s a common technique that landlords use to avoid the eviction process. Basically it means paying them at least one months rent if they leave by a certain date.",1640995222

Robin on the other hand didnt really existed as a human being after everyone she knew died and she started running. 
But she didnt really ran. She had no reason to survive. Her kowledge made people use her as an object. Sell her, trade her kill her owners to possess her.
She tried to kill herself after she was no more useto Croco boy after she had no owner anymore. Being stopped by Luffy. Joining the crew. 
WhichI argue did t stop her backstory because shejoined because she now was Luffys responsibily. He saved her so now she was his posession. 

The real moment Robins backstory ended was the moment she shouted in tears ""I WANT TO LIVE"".

Thats the moment she reclaimed her life. The moment she became sentient again. Someone with self worth. It was her decision. Not someone elses. 
Thinking of this moment makes me cry tears of joy for all the pain and hardship she overcame in that moment.
And (a little unrelated) spoiler for WNo &gt;!thats the reason I laughed my ass of when Black Maria tried to convince her Robin was only an Object for her crew,knowing Luffy declared WAR ON THE WG TO SAVE HER!&lt;

"flashlight","t5_2qjmy","I'm an incandescent fan, so I don't know a whole lot about modernizing vintage lights with electronics or LEDs, but there are some things that can be done to make vintage lights more usable while keeping them incandescent.

For example, you can get D cell adapters that fit three AA cells in series, which means you can turn a 2 cell D light into a 6 cell light. There are some PR base 6 cell bulbs which are quite bright, probably 20x as bright as the old vacuum bulbs that would have come in old 2 cell lights. It's a fun way to have a ""sleeper"" light with no permanent modifications.

Some people also use PVC tubes to fit Li-Ion cells into C or D cell lights. You just have to calculate what to use based on the length of the flashlight and the length of the cells. One Li-Ion cell is about right for a normal 3 cell bulb, or two Li-Ion cells for a 6 cell bulb.

As for specifics to look for, some of the common lights are the Ray-O-Vac Sportsman and Eveready Captain, and then the cop lights like Kel-Lite and Mag-Lite. Those would be semi-modern lights that use PR bulbs and offer more in the way of bulb swaps and actual usefulness. Of course there's a whole world of rare antique flashlights beyond that, but finding them means browsing the bay or searching at antique stores and estate sales.",1640995222

Not that I think OP was “wrong” per se, myself. My not-previously-involved take is that someone made a passing comment, just something that came to mind. Then you “well actually’d” them on something that didn’t really seem serious, which can be annoying if I’m honest. So I think they responded with some annoyance. Nuance is difficult with only text, especially with anonymous strangers so that’s probably why people are usually fighting.",1640995223

However the campaign in halo is very customizable though skulls. Personally when halo 3 was out I played through the campaign dozens of times, helping others beat it on Legendary, getting the old achievements, and the newer vidmaster achievements, etc. 

Like I said before the main point you're missing is Halos player base (likely BF as well) plays it for those reasons. A Fortnite style royal isn't really something they would want. 

Also Halo has always had longevity, players convinced Microsoft to keep Halo 2s servers live past the shut off date, People host free private servers just to play the original multi-player. And then there's forge which allows players to create whole game modes from scratch.

Australians are asking why you simply [bought a piece of land](https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-sultan-of-brunei-created-a-30-million-gold-coast-real-estate-nightmare/news-story/8e4a4e1ee4137a9b014ce73563fda376) in one of  their central locations then left it unused for 24 years.

Singaporeans are puzzled why there is [an abandoned Brunei hostel](https://thesmartlocal.com/read/tanglin-hill-brunei-hostel/), so ugly, and near their Orchard Road, abandoned since Brunei independence.

The one who keeps asking why should also reflect through his life and ask why, it comes from the top spreading down.

You hired people to audit National Bank (NBB) cause you really disliked its founder Khoo Teck Puat, ended up closing the bank down in 1986.  You got such experience, but why you never hire people to audit Brunei's own accounts and your accounts.

By the way, your haircut costs [US$21K](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/haircut-21k-sultan-brunei-haji-hassanal-bolkiah-priciest-trim-ken-modestou-article-1.396230), why you never ask self if that kind of money for one haircut is a waste? Local upscale salons can send people to you for much much lower prices. Or try $3-4 Indian barber to get a taste of what ordinary people do, like how Lee Hsien Loong [queued up 30 mins](https://www.asiaone.com/food/pm-lee-spotted-queueing-30min-chicken-wings-redhill-food-centre) to buy chicken wings from a stall.",1640995223

What counts is what you do afterwards - staying motivated and trying to be better. Your boss should be happy to have you",1640995225
"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","I was involved in a probate sale, but not in Texas. One important thing would be to get a pre-purchase appraisal, not just from a realtor, but from a professional appraiser. In my case, the court required that. 

With that appraisal, and lots of great record-keeping concerning the improvements, you can show that you bought the house at a fair market value and the improvements don't relate to that. 

If the seller wants to cut you a deal just to get rid of the house (which happened in my case as it was a trashed hoarder house), then be sure you have signed documents that the seller (or all the heirs, if an estate sale) are happy with the sale price. I had to provide the probate court a document that was signed by the heirs that said, yes, they understood that the price might not be market value, but they accepted that. 

Also, talk to your tax advisor, to see what might be the base value of the house, so that, if you later sell it, you have capital gains accounted for.",1640995225

We also did not know he had a problem until earlier this year, he was also turning yellow and retaining fluid, and he had been in and out of the hospital for months with liver and kidney failures. He also ultimately died from blood loss due to esophageal varices. It is absolutely devastating how much alcohol can destroy someone. Please know that you couldn’t have gotten him help if he didn’t want it, and there’s nothing you could’ve done differently. When we first took my uncle to the hospital, it was primarily just liver failure, and they were confident everything else would be okay, but despite how much they tried, his other systems just slowly started shutting down too. So, I don’t think getting him in sooner - especially only 2 weeks - would’ve made a difference.",1640995226

I think it's hard for kids to retain this kind of stuff specifically because it doesn't currently affect them. School to me is more about teaching them how to think about complex stuff. And by the time they become an adult, if they want to learn how taxes work, if the school system has done its job, they can google it and learn in about 15 minutes how marginal tax rates work.

Unfortunately, orgasms while fantastic, don't mean the sex itself is great enough to desire. Many women find that they may not orgasm but the sex is wonderful and just what they want. Others may orgasm but the sex isn't good enough to desire. 

The fact that you've had painful sex, decrease in an already low libido due to children and breastfeeding, having no experience prior to know what you want or need, and have a partner who treats you poorly when you turn him down and enforce your boundaries makes all the sense in the world for why you aren't desiring sex.

The crack, sentencing, was 30 years ago, shouldn’t influence 18-30 year olds ability to make proper decisions. Poorly funded education and everything tied to poorly funded anything is based on businesses in that community (yes I know dept of education kicks in money). You are not honest with yourself if you say you are going to open your business in a crime ridden, proportionate poverty stricken neighborhood, regardless of what race is living there. You need citizens to be and feel safe before they will risk their livelihood in a community. Over policing: so if everyone and I in the community know that between a particular street and another particular street, there are gang bangers, drug dealers, and everything in between, you’re suggesting to not police it? Or there shouldn’t be more cops there because a higher percentage of race lives there? 
Once again, I said the leeches are non producers. That is every dead beat from all walks of life. 
13% of the population has a way higher % of the crime rate, single motherhood rate, low graduation rate, etc. that European countries do not have to account for. All races have the same problem. I refuse to be labeled a racist when I can look at any fbi, cdc statistic and determine where a major problem is. It is not my opinion, it is a stated fact. 
You know the greatest irony of our back and forths, you assume by identity politics, that I am white. 
Billion dollar companies and an employee come to a MUTUAL agreement. I will exchange x for your labor. Nobody is actually forced in this country to work anywhere.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 &gt; My friend uninvited me to her NYE plans because her other friend didn’t want to be around me and when she told me I got upset and yelled at her. 

I think I might be the asshole because she says it’s my fault for ending the friendship with our mutual friend and that she shouldn’t have to deal with our drama because of it.

Help keep the sub engaging!

Is your roommate kinda aloof towards the cat &amp; not super into giving him tons of attention? Just curious, cuz sometimes cats can be little shits about loving the one person who pays the least amount of attention to them. It's like they just can't stand not being the center of attention. But then **too much** attention overwhelms them &amp; makes them standoffish.

They're delightfully, &amp; sometimes frustratingly, weird little creatures.

I think whatever is going on, once you move, you'll be something familiar to him in a new place. Hopefully that will make you more ""appealing,"" for lack of a better word. 

If he has any more nervous diarrhea, you could maybe try just using really wet rags to wipe him down instead of fully getting him wet (if that's what you tried the first time). And Hydrogen peroxide can be helpful. It's not good for wounds unless a vet advises it, but it's actually pretty good at breaking down dried poop so it comes out of fur more easily.

Lies are no ground for a relationship to start, and as heartbreaking as it is to find all of this out when you’ve been engaged for a year… you’re not married. 

And also, it is pretty manipulative that he’s waited until the two of you have this huge level of commitment before he told you all these bad news.

"maryland","t5_2qnnv","I get it I'm in a similar boat, and I'm sorry people don't like to acknowledge that reality too many people have faced without proper support. Just keep adapting to the situation as you need to. Kn95s and n95s have kept many doctors on the frontlines safe throughout this pandemic and they likely have been a lot more exposed than you or I will be. For masks I personally order mine from bonafidemasks.com because I don't worry about fakes from them and they're reliable. I follow experts from all over the world on social media for pandemic related updates.  I also take lots of social media breaks and do things like regular yoga/meditation practice (shout out to yoga with adriene lol truly saved my sanity throughout this whole thing), hiking, and connecting with people I care about virtually. It's pretty much a fend for yourself situation right now, so just work on adapting the best you can within your means and make time for yourself to do things that bring you moments of peace. Vaxxed and/or boosted will reduce chances of long covid, and the amount of exposure can make a difference in outcome so keep that in mind too. You aren't wrong for being careful nor should you regret it. People love to spout statistics but when someone falls on the wrong side of those numbers that person somehow doesn't matter because it doesn't fit their narrative. Do what you can to stay safe, and work on letting go of the anxiety surrounding the things you can't control. We can't control the government and its not going to change the present situation at this point. If you do get sick, just focus on rest and don't worry about the what ifs. Good news is research is moving along fast for a lot of things and there are good treatment options available right now that help a lot of people pull through.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","That might be true in the US but videogames are global.

Often Europe and Russia share one server so there are people with like 30 different languages playing together and trying to communicate in english.

I got a C2 in english years ago, have been proficient for more than a decade and I've been playing online games for just about that. Only recently did I ""realize"" that bitch is a general insult, an insult towards a female and also means female dog (I knew the meanings, I just didn't connect them).

Same reason why calling someone a monkey isn't racially charged in europe, I have a *very* diverse (ethnically and culturally, as in from different countries) group of people I play with and it, along many others like dog, is a word we've been using for a long time. 

I don't know about the US, but in Europe neither monkey nor bitch are words that mean anything beyond a random insult when used online. Point proven by the fact that in Italy we have a word that has the same meaning (as in, it has both the same literal meaning and the same ""gender charged"" meaning) as bitch witch is cagna (literally means female dog but just like bitch it also has a demeaning connotation for women).

No one uses ""cagna"" as an insult, even when playing with other italians. It just isn't something you would say to a random person (nor should it ever be used for that matter), but bitch is used just as widely as in american servers, because it has a different meaning. Its meaning if anything is closer to fuck you, you are a piece of shit or a crybaby.",1640995230

FF8: How profoundly uncomfortable it was, as a first-time player of this game still living in an emotionally abusive household, to watch Ultimecia (through Edea) twist Seifer's sense of who he thought he was.

FF9: Figuring out what Dali was used for, and being utterly fucking overjoyed to kick the shit out of Black Waltz II on my way out of that place. Vivi doesn't deserve these emotions, he's just a kid! I had never before wanted to hug a game character so much, after that...

FFX: Getting used to voice acting. Being very relieved that Kimahri's voice, when revealed, didn't suck. The whole of Mt Gagazet, Ronso bass choir and background music and minibosses as regular mobs (because my party is just that strong now) and all of it.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","nah, the thing is, my duties are my duties. if i do someone else job i should get paid for that job. if i do both someone elses job, and my own, i should get paid for both jobs.

the obvious solution to this is to staff diversely, having overlap on duties so that most people know atleast a decent amount about the business they do, and have that as part of their duties once or twice a week. that way, when someone is sick, suddenly it's just 4 or 5 times that week, instead of once or twice, coupled with 3-4 other people also picking up roughly the same amount of slack. 

This would lead to you doing your own job which is working at around 15-40 % of your capacity, leaving plenty of time for chats, private calls that might be necessary (kids, relatives, big plans, etc) because life does indeed happen while at work!!! and bathroom breaks or just a walk around the office or building for some leg stretching. If you can not staff like this, you should not run a business in my oppinion.

*But* another big problem here is a belief in a transactional relationship. You having ABC is not causation to expect XYZ from her. The toxic masculinity with phrases like ""you're always paying for it"" was absorbed by incels too.

I'm going to add one controversial opinion of my own, as a 37 year old man recently divorced, there are plenty of people my age that have never emotionally matured past their teens. In every gender.

The difference is, this guy is hung up on a reality of his own making where he has created a fallacy that all women are that way. It's easier for him to point fingers than be a better human being.",1640995232

It was a saturday afternoon, and I was exhausted after an intense 17-part masturabation session to dream minecraft manhunt, when i suddenly had the urge to go outside. I was scared. It's been so long since i've left the warmth of my parents basement with my dream body pillows. I didnt know what to expect. Clutching my dream figurine in front of my chest, i pried open the door to the outside world. The gleaming sun blared through the door, bequeathing a brilliant warmth on my cum-covered boxers. I quaverly took a step outside. My body flintched from the strange feel of the dirt under my feet. And then i saw it. The lustrous field of grass, covered in a light sprinkle of water from the noon rain shower. And then i realized. Dream... grass... the trees... it was all coming together. Grass is green, just like Dream. Dream is everpresent, in the grass, the flowers, He was there. I immediately new what to do next. I flinged off my clothes faster than the speed at which i would click on a new dream rule 34 post. My dick was already throbbing as i leaped onto the field of grass, dorito dust stained shirt getting carried away by the wind. I dug a small hole in the ground, and passionately thrust my 7-inch erect cock into it. I knew, this was Dream. His spirit was in this grass, and he felt my dick in his man pussy as i fucked that grass. I lost track how long i was there. Hours went by, day turned to night, but it didnt matter. I was finally together, with Dream. Nothing could separate us. I took a long stem of a flower, and forced it in my asshole. I imagined it being Dream's hot penis being lustfully forced into me in bed. I stayed there on my front yard for god knows how long. Until my butt was sore, balls drier than the Saharan desert after a long drought. The lawn looked like there was a layer of fresh snow on a Christmas morning. Trudging indoors, i had a enormous smile stretching across my face. I couldn't wait until tomorrow, when i may go outside again and be with Dream.",1640995233

"TheRightCantMeme","t5_3p1as","&gt; they are words in the English language with specific definitions that have developed over time and generations.

Yes, like generations of philosophy.

*Argumentum ad dictionary* isn't a serious argument.

&gt; Besides, more and more creatures are being defined as sentient, having personhood.

Humans are the only real-world species which is widely agreed to have personhood (which is why humans are presently the only animals with legal personhood). There are people who *argue* that personhood should apply more widely, but that is *far* from agreed-upon.

&gt; Elves, dwarves makes no difference, they aren’t human so they aren’t people.

Except according to *virtually everyone*.

&gt; in lotr elves are referred to as vanya in some instances

The Vanyar were *one group of elves*, and that was a word in their own language.

And if you want to talk about what Tolkien had to say you're going to be awfully embarrassed when you find out what he actually said, because he talked about the Maiar as ""the people of the Valar"" despite the Maiar being *spirits not humans*.

Also he wrote of the dwarves: ""Since they were to come in the days of the power of Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong to endure. Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and in enmity, and they suffer toil and hanger and hurt of body more hardily than all other speaking peoples;"" 

Back to the elves (Quendi), here's what Tolkien had to say: ""And Oromë loved the Quendi, and named them in their own
tongue Eldar, the people of the stars; but that name was after borne only by those who followed him upon the westward road.""

More specifically regarding the Vanyar, here is Tolkien's words: ""The Vanyar were his people; they are the Fair Elves, the beloved of Manwë and Varda, and few among Men have spoken with them""

Now, are you done embarrassing yourself?",1640995233

""Doesn't provide any decent functionality for Android TV or Android auto. I hate that google destroyed Play Music and turned it on to a useless app, purely out of greed. They charge you for it anyway if you have youtube premium - so they don't actually care. The idea wasn't to improve googly play music, but to remove as much functionality as possible to make it super cheap to maintain - whilst still charging you for it. Google has really gone down hill in pretty much all its apps and products.""


I truly believe this was the plan. They updated the subscription service a year and a half prior to this, to force it all under one banner (yt premium). Next they absolutely gut the music service. This means they don't lose many music subscriptions, whist making a lot more by reducing support. It is clever from the perspective of shareholders. It's te",1640995233

It could easily go down to being a PE of 30 and still be overpriced according to that metric, after dropping 16% to get down to a PE of 30.

Amazon - it's been priced like a growth startup. But it isn't growing forever.  That can also come down.

Tesla - pricing isn't based on anything, so it's price can drop 80%, or not.  Can't say.

then there are a slew of non-meme stocks like HON, ADP, HSY, MLM, HRL, for example, that are just overpriced according to any measure of measuring this stuff.  And can easily drop 10%, 20%.

But that explosion happened in the past.  You are hearing an event that happened in the past, but also an event that happened some distance away from you.

A telescope works in the same way, but for light.  If you look at an object a fixed distance away, you are looking at it with a fixed time delay as well.  You can't look at something nearby with a longer time delay.

With the universe, you can only see back as far as there is a distant object to look at.  You could never see the big bang because no object has moved away more distance than time.  Space expands, which complicates the problem, but any object that has moved away from us faster than the speed of light never has its light reach us.  So there has to be a limit to how old the most distant object we can look at will be.",1640995234

Part 1: Form (100 E, 5 SK) Kobold - Roughbold

Part 2: The Function (125 E, 9 SK)

General Boon (-60): Survivalist, Endurance, Early Boomer, Wings, Brave Little Kobold, Sudden Evolution, Superior Dragon Gene, Dexterity Up, Magic Attunement, Hidden Talents, Champion, Hybridize, (Intelligence Up, Pack Tactics)

General Drawback (10): Low life Expectancy,

Personal Boon (-50): Lucky, Loaded dice(3) , Leadership, Gamer sight, Ritual of number fudging, Reincarnation, Hivemind, Arcane Mastery, Ritual of essence absorption

Personal Drawback (10): Curse of  corrosive draconic aura

Part 3: The Fate (30 E, 9 SK)

Feature (10): Starting Gear (2), Treasure(3) , Safe Heaven (4), Magic Revolution

Arrangement (9 starting kobold) (8 E)

\- 2 Worker, 1 Cook, 1 Medic, 2 Agriculture, 1 Logistic, 1 Engineer, 1 Security

\- Me as Spellcaster, 2 as Expert, 2 as Fighter

New game plus - then probably everything up to until I reached Titan

(PS: Add quick learner)

&amp;#x200B;

This is basically forming a civilization that's focused on one thing - me. They are literally a network that is created to help me bootstrapping them - and in turn, me into a major power fast.

The basic starting out is fine as it is, 10 (counting me) would be able to start a small tribe, the labor distribution means we move out from hunter-gatherer society pretty fast. Building up infrastructure and stuff from safe heaven. Pack tactics + Hivemind mean perfect teamwork

Expand the village, which should have around 30-40 Kobold now (a lot of children if what I understand is correct). Anything that die from low hygiene gets sacrificed to me, increasing the numbers. Get more profession for the new litter, which would probably be pretty good after 3 years, adding in Quick learner and the network, meaning that they grow up fast and learn fast.

Expand the village, which should have around 30-40 Kobold now (a lot of children if what I understand is correct). Anything that die from low hygiene gets sacrificed to me, increasing my power.

No Kobold can revolt, cause they are functionally drone to me. Start with number fudging and eugenics to produce better stuff

After 10 years, there would be at least 100 Kobold at maturity assuming they can lay 2 eggs a month and one got destroyed.

Then climb the magitech industrial revolution, spread across the world like the magitech version of Tucker Kobold. Start turning the females into broodmares to increase production, we scalie Skaven now. Capture other creatures and add it to our gene pool - Kobold-Skavenid it is.

After 40 years, the first generations are now useless so they are sacrificed to me, anything that came to be useless in the meantime also get that. My essence have mindbreak, so all the better. I won't die as long as there are Kobold left, and as long as I live, the entire race of Kobold is just functionally me.

I may or may not take a sizable chunk of the World in a hundred years time, but I sure damn well become a menace.

Hop to new world, repeat ad naseum until everything had my pawnfrints.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I don't pick the dragoness is that I feel this is too much deviation from the image of a Kobold, and liable to get me smoted.

&gt; En Ecatepec, fue detenido uno de los tres sujetos que bajo influjos de alcohol y drogas colocaron cohetes en el hocico de un perrito, en la colonia Jardínes de Morelos, provocando que perdiera un ojo y el otro le quedara desorbitado.

&gt; Estábamos ahí con otros dos valedores, estábamos tomando y drogándonos y le metemos un cohete al perro”, relató Mario Alberto “N”, de 25 años de edad, habitante de la colonia El Salado, quien reconoció su participación en el maltrato al animal de raza criolla, de aproximadamente un año de edad.   

&gt; El pasado 24 de diciembre, habitantes de la calle Bosque de las Flores, en la colonia Jardines de Ecatepec, alertaron a la policía de Ecatepec sobre un cachorro lastimado con pirotecnia que permanecía en la banqueta.   

&gt; Personal de la Dirección de Medio Ambiente y Ecología y del Centro de Atención Canina y Felina de Ecatepec (Cacyfe) brindaron atención médica al animal e iniciaron una denuncia penal por maltrato animal.   

&gt; Acoyani Baroco Bonilla, director de Ecología y Medio Ambiente,  informó que el maltrato animal está tipificado como delito y se paga hasta con dos años de prisión en el Estado de México.

You have to be super specific describing the behaviour you're talking about. This is why you taught them the anatomical names for all their parts! ""You know how your vulva is a private area of your body? It's cool to be naked in your room and in the bathroom at home, right? Is it ok to be naked at the park or at school?? (Hopefully you'll get a No to that one 😉) Right! Remember when you were rubbing your body on the fireman's pole today? Well, *touching* your vulva with anything is also private.  Touching with your hands, with a toy, on top of your clothes or under your clothes, is all private. It's cool to do in your room and in the bathroom at home, but not cool at the park or at school.

Start making changes to less important things.  Arbitrary things, even.  Like which leg you cross over or which side of the sink you leave your toothbrush on.

You’re holding ark to a pretty high standard that they need to better understand the innovative AI that’s brand new and didn’t exist before and only failed based on the parameters that the AI was working with changed when the real estate market pulled back. 
Innovation is way harder to value and assess correctly for all possible outcomes compared to something that’s established and doesn’t change much. 
There was one thing that could go wrong with airlines really. A pandemic. Which people knew was brewing for months and Buffett being best friends with gates and was told by him, knew how bad it could get but bought at the top anyway. 
There’s about a billion things that can go wrong with innovative tech and business models in comparison. 
It’s really no different. It’s a coin flip of whether you buy and something goes up or down either way. 
Ark just manages risk in the same way as everyone else but focused on high growth while others focus on more conservative or balanced portfolios. 
Next time you buy something and it tanks don’t be too hard on yourself either. Risk management and cutting losers is fine for everyone. No biggie.",1640995236

BLOOD EXCHANGE: A very quick-to-cast spell that takes a chunk of your health in exchange for mana. 1-for-1 exchange, meaning the amount of damage taken is the amount of mana recieved!  


MEAT PUPPET: Infuse yourself with the blood of your target, taking control of their body. You take constant damage while in this form, so exploding out of them quickly is key!

Either you get a kill or you don't; it is completely and utterly unimportant other than boasting cred who sends the Dragon into Grace, according to its leaderboard.

"VetTech","t5_2ss9e","First and foremost, keep in mind they are suffering a tremendous loss to their family. One of the best things the receptionists at my clinic do is having a candle lit at the front with a sign explaining when the candle is lit, someone is saying goodbye to their pet, and asking for respectfulness and quiet from other clients. Ensuring rooms are ready for upcoming euthanasias and being able to put them right in the room rather than waiting in the lobby is also very important. Stop and get an updated weight if appropriate/possible, and then straight to the room. Ensure Kleenex and a trash can are both out and visible. We usually leave small water bottles out and dim the lights a bit.

Using a calm voice and looking people in the eye is the best way to address them. Keeping it short and simple is important. We also have brochures for pet loss grief counseling phone lines we pass out. Also, giving them the phone number for in-home euthanasia clinics can be helpful too.

Be careful of the wording you use when scheduling the appointment. Don't ever make them feel like a burden in any way. ""Well, I guess we can squeeze you in at 1pm"" is really not appropriate, in my opinion. ""What time would be the best for you?"" And fitting them in when they need is very important. ""Unfortunately we are already fully booked at 1pm but at 3pm we have an opening that would allow you, Fido, and the doctor to have as much time as needed, does this work for you?"" Also, don't make them feel rushed. Keep in mind patients and clients needs. If it's a patient that can't walk, when scheduling we let the owner know if they need any help in bringing their pet in we can absolutely help. If it's an older client, placing them in a room close to the door so they don't have to walk as far or asking if they need any water. 

Thank you so much for even asking this question. Doing that shows you care, understand this is an important aspect of our jobs, and you want to make patients and clients comfortable. Veterinary receptionists have a very hard job and I hope you know you are incredibly appreciated by us techs.",1640995238

I think it's really easy to focus more on the problems than the good things, especially when there's so much going on. I would talk to your family about it but be cordial about it.

Everything on Laconia looks cheap. From the bad acting, to the soap opera sets, these vignettes drag the show down. Duarte was the only redeeming quality of this week's installment, but also felt like a lackluster introduction to what I understand is a pivotal character.

I still feel like we are getting the Cliffs Notes version of this season. Like scenes were removed or cut short in order to move the plot at a faster pace. For a show that, in the past, put characters over plot, this continues to be a disappointing aspect of this final season. 

When they get it right, it feels right and this episode's scenes on the Roci finally felt on point. Holden was a bit of a wild card in his conversation with Amos, but the follow up scene with Naomi completed the circuit.",1640995239

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Well officiated game. No real controversial call, imho.

Some non-officiating points on that game I need to say based on all the noise in the game thread:

- Anyone that watched Cincinnati this season knew they had a bad defensive line when it came to the run. Most teams they struggled against where strong running teams.
- The offense played against Saban defense that had weeks to prepare. That makes nearly all teams look bad and expose all types of holes.

And that goes for Ridder as well. All the people who say his draft stock has fallen don't understand football. Tom Brady behind that line under that much pressure wouldn't play much better.

However on the positive side, Ridder played without any major mistakes. Yes, he didn't have time to make big plays, but when he did, he threw extremely accurate balls to give the WRs a chance to make plays without risking turnovers.

The defense couldn't stop the run, couldn't get off the field and were tired as hell. But they pressured and picked off the Heisman trophy winner. They blitzed an offensive line stronger and more powerful than they've ever played. 

You know what this will bring Cincinnati? More recruiting. Offensive and defensive lineman recruits that want to be the anchor that changes their line can be brought in, now... The missing pieces of a championship team.

So if you are on the ""G5 doesn't deserve to be there"" crowd, I hope you will be happy with Alabama, Georgia, and Clemson from taking all the major recruits... By having G5 schools being involved, it helps spread out the recruitung of elite players so games can be fun to watch instead of noise about who deserves to be in what game.

Just my two cents. Thanks for listening to my ref facts!",1640995239

This is the difference between Communist Theory, and the Leninist, Maoist, Stalinist Practices that we’re historically familiar with of the theory, which winds up looking more like Imperialist, Industrialized, and Militarized Robber Baron Capitalism. Which is the path the Soviet Union and China wound up going down.

Power is meant to be derived from the masses, the Community, in Communism and not from some people holding power over the rest, which is a more common trait in an Industrialized Capitalist society where the people with the money at the top direct the power and people.",1640995240

Everyone i know who has received the vaccine has felt like absolute trash afterwards, some bad enough to stay out of work. If i am feeling fine, have felt fine for the entirety of this pandemic and the 18 or so years prior, why would i go get a shot that has a very good chance of making me feel like shit when there is just as good of a chance that i will continue feeling fine without it. I trust my immune system. I also dont fully trust the effectiveness of the vaccine. First it was said, get the shot and all will be good. It wasnt, so they said come get a booster and all will be good. It isnt.

practicing timing almost never works when you try to do full power throws, so perhaps take some days of field work where you aim to only throw 200 feet but with good mechanics - and doing lots of good throws, that way the muscle memory will get a chance to learn \[doing full power throws they will differ in timing and execution to much to be a good learning experience\]

You're damn straight. And fuck the downvotes, as this is the reality:

It matters to keep a lie going and keep people under foot.

Also, you might as well start quoting Malcom X.

Let's look at what he said underneath the president who said he'd have ""them voting Democrat for the next 200 years.""

The one the Democrats say did the most for black people, which is an intentional misnomer. Eisenhower did. 
It's not convenient to tell the truth on what a piece of shit hillybill Baines was. Nooo. Then it exposes the game!

[lt was the black man’s vote that put the present administration in Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we’re making.](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1964-malcolm-x-ballot-or-bullet/)

And aint it rich his accused killers have been exonerated under a democrat.
Same Democrats Malcom X warned black Americans with these words:

""White liberals are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the black man as our ‘friend’ to get our sympathy, our allegiance and our minds. The white liberal attempts to use us politically against white conservatives, so that anything the black man does is never for his own good, never for his advancement, never for his own progress, he’s only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal.”

""I  only cite these things to show you that in America the history of white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make us think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white liberal. The only way that our problems will be solved is when the black man wakes up, cleans himself up, stands on his own two feet, stops begging the white liberal and takes immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white liberal to do for us.”

The media’s the most powerful entity on Earth. They have the power to make the innocent look guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s power. Because they control the mind of the masses.”

Funny, this is happening!

“The Democrats are playing you for a political chump and if you vote for them, not only are you a chump, you are a traitor to your race.”

He said this a few days before he was shot.

We don't need white people teaching our kids nor there's critical race theory.

What we need is for white folks to stop lying to themselves and each other about their parties character.

And don't get shit twisted, as Malcom X said 

""....the only difference between white liberals and white conservatives....is the liberals are more deceitful...more hypocritical"" 

and oh

""The white Liberal differs from the white Conservative only in one way; the Liberal is more deceitful, more hypocritical, than the Conservative. Both want power, but the White Liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor and by winning the friendship and support of the Negro, the White Liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or a weapon in this political football game, that is constantly raging, between the White Liberals and the White Conservatives. The American Negro is nothing, but a political football.""


But none of the people downvoting you, and none of the people arguing with you want to admit this.

The liberals want to keep on the narrative of the sweet plantation owners wife.


All of this shit is true 50 years later.",1640995242

I think that confusing these two circumstances has been a reason for some of the pushback you've been given to your responses. 

You've repeatedly suggested that OP keep an open mind and let things play out through the legal process.

If you mean how often their hits should be sneak attacks: the vast majority assuming they are working with their team, but this comes at the disadvantage of not being able to chose freely between every enemy, which is a rule that steady aim breaks.

You also need to consider the range of these builds, the toughness, and the versatility. Pure damage doesn't mean better build and the inherent many bonuses of rogue features means comparing to a full damage build is going to tell you very little",1640995244

"Tenkara","t5_2uihj","I also have a Handy Pak Net. It's cool for how small and compact it is, but it's kind of a crappy net. The nylon mesh bag is horrible for fish (I had so many fish get tangled in it), and the clear rubber one is much more bulky and heavy. I replaced it with a [medium nylon Measure Net net bag](https://measurefish.com/products/medium-nylon-replacement-bag), which is much better. Because the net rim itself is so bendy, I've had times where I dip the net into the water and the net just collapses (especially in shallow water where the net hits the bottom of the stream). There's some user error on my part for sure, but with other nets, you don't really need to think about that. It's not as compact as the Handy Pak Net, but the [small nylon Measure Net](https://measurefish.com/products/small-nylon-net) weighs 5ish oz (I've never owned the small one, but I've had a couple medium ones and they're great). My Handy Pak Net with the replacement netting weighs 6.1 oz.

[This net weighs 4 oz.](https://dragontailtenkara.com/collections/nets/products/d-damo) I've never used it. 

For line, I prefer [this level line](https://dragontailtenkara.com/collections/level-lines/products/oni-ryu-org-ll) (#3.5), but other people prefer different kinds of line. I use 5x tippet for everything. I haven't noticed any difference between brands. 

Any tenkara fly work work just fine in most conditions. Any of the ones sold by any of the big tenkara companies will work. 

For hemostats/pliers, any one sold at any fly shop or online will work. The shortest/smallest ones (the smallest I have are 3.5"") will be the lightest, but it'll be hard to reach deep into a larger fish's throat with them, and they won't be powerful enough to crush a barb on a barbed hook. A 4.5"" or 5"" one will weigh more, but you'll be able to do anything with it.

Have fun!",1640995244

Perrin: &gt;!definitely base Green for connection to Wolves and probably Red a bit as well for the whole forge/creativity stuff. Could also have some White as well.!&lt;

Rand: &gt;!probably White mostly but maybe White/Black and maybe some Red as well.!&lt;

Moiraine: &gt;!White/Blue all the way. Willing to do what's best for the world despite personal sacrifice, and super plotting and planning about it.!&lt;

Lan: &gt;!White for protector role, maybe some Green as well? Mono-white probably works well though.!&lt;

Nynaeve: &gt;!Definitely White for healing, probably Red as well for her passion and extreme loyalty.!&lt;

Egwene: &gt;!she's a tough one. Might actually be base black because she's so ambitious, but I could see that as base blue as well because she's not quite unscrupulous enough for black. So base Blue, then I could honestly see any of the other colors as well.!&lt;",1640995245

Again, I'm not a fan of Trump for a lot of reasons, and if he did anything wrong he deserves to burn, but there's a lot of strong evidence to suggest he did the right thing.

Additionally, and this is pure speculation, but the fact that Epstein was arrested during Trump's administration is telling. If I were guilty of something that heinous and in a position of power like that, Epstein would *magically* get away.",1640995245
"ontario","t5_2qsf3","FH Health only works if it’s local to you and you’ve got money to burn. Also, wondering if anyone has insight - when I pull up my PCR results from a few days ago on the provincial website, I can get the result, but it has my last name and health card number blacked out. It also doesn’t include a lab address. It doesn’t look like this would be accepted by an airline or government official as proof of recovery, and my local PHU says they won’t provide paper copies of test results. Does that mean I cant even use these test results for future travel for those of us who got the PCR done?

Now Im worried that if I plan to travel for, say, March Break, not only will the PCRs we just had done not be valid, but if we try to get private asymptomatic PCRs for a spring trip, we’ll still test positive for those and be unable to travel.

what a mess.",1640995245

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; A 20+ year old game from the ps1 era despite its popularity and influence is STILL a 20+ year old game from the ps1 era.

I've actually had this chat a few times in more Nintendo-centric threads about the legacy of OoT. My best friend and I are Zelda freaks. Those classic Nintendo games weren't just great games, they were our childhood. For me, I honestly can't judge OoT in a vacuum because that moment where I walk out into Hyrule Field for the first time and the music swells and I can just go...anywhere is ingrained in my brain forever. I didn't know that was something you could do in a game, it quite literally changed what the potential of a video game was in my childhood eyes. It's a game that changed gaming forever for me in a very personal way.

My best friend had a daughter last year. Someday in a few years she too will play OoT just like her dad did as a kid, her mom did as a kid, I did as a kid. But it won't have the same eye-opening impact on her that it had on us because she grew up in a world where that was normal. She'll still see it's a great game and enjoy it but it won't change her like it changed us. Games both transcend time and are very much products of their time and place. A great game will transcend time and be recognized as great decades down the road, but even the greatest game can't recreate the context of its release in a new player decades later.",1640995246

The US took advantage of the Arab spring to prop up rebels which were in the middle of a civil war which was going to end up like Syria (and sort of did when general Haftar kicked off the second civil war) with Gaddafi committing atrocities like Assad. Gaddafi had long been a problem for his neighbors (invading several of them) as well as the west (funding the IRA and others, leading to hundreds of civilian deaths), not to mention his horrific repression of dissidents.

The backing of the rebels was actually super successful and a transitional government was quickly formed. But factional infighting eventually led to the second civil war sadly, which is now a proxy war between the Turks on one side and the UAE/Russia on the other.",1640995248

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

And Maya despite her surface depth feminism and lesbian tendency has a deeply traditional base of values from her upbringing (hence Derek calling her a ""prude"") and will agree.

MJ will try to talk some sense into an MC who goes for Bella, I'd guess. And I think a character like Rusty or Jacob might well do the same. To say nothing of Jill, the 100% traditional girl from the world of high society... to Jill this choice will be horrifying on every level. She might not want to speak to MC ever again.

Basically I'd expect a bit of pushback on this choice from all the more ""down to earth"" characters in the game. Bella herself isn't even a down to earth character and she explicitly warns MC of this.",1640995249

But yeah the yearly breaks and moving around seasons and days of the week is really annoying. Hell the BBC changing it's time from from between 6-8 pm in a season was annoying!

I say, have a run on a Doctor (aka 14 does the traditional 3 seasons), take a break. It will be the best way to do it going forward.

So it’s too easy to hope they don’t have an heir, hope their ruler is pretty old, and then hope that the heir doesn’t die? The heir you give them tends to be older than the youngest age a ruler can be, so whenever someone takes over from a regency if you’re lucky enough that they don’t instantly get an heir, and if the heir you give them is even the same age, there’s way too much of a chance that he’ll die long before the ruler even considers croaking.

And of course, if anything goes wrong after that second step, that’s years you’ve wasted with a diplomat, wars you got into that were complete wastes of your time etc.

Of course, this is all ignoring how little money/manpower you actually get from favors too, since it’s only able to be done every 10 years I’m pretty sure, plus it goes off of whichever nation is smaller essentially, meaning pretty quickly in a campaign, it won’t actually be giving you that much. Slacken gives you way more, doesn’t have *any* of those restrictions, and you can store up tons of it to use in bulk if you need it.

Try playing 80FOV on a monitor you sit a foot away from and you're gonna get nauseous in seconds. Play 80FOV from your couch and you're going to see and move just fine, and can even attain the lesser visual recoil that high FOV benefits from just [by using lower zoom optics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc4S8L8aH4I) *I'm* not arguing against console FOV, I've always advocated for it, for giving console players the option that best suits their setup, whether they use it or not, I'm just theorizing why they haven't done it in Wz when it's in all 3 recent MP games, while Wz in built *from* from one of those games engines.

"HorusHeresyLegions","t5_hxihl","The primary combo is getting Pride of Calaban setup early.

Follow up with Escape Vent and Praetor Castiel on turn 6+ and you have a pretty secure combo to either spread damage in increments of 3 across the board or unload into the warlords face with tons of damage.

I'm not proud of what I've made, but it works.

Below I'll slowly update the pros of having each card in the deck and why I've chosen them. I'm on vacation right now so I'm doing this in my spare time.

&amp;nbsp;

Escape Vent

This should be saved for Praetor Castiel as your enemy will know the value of him. 6 health is great but he will be removed if placed on board naked 9/10 times. Where the 6 health shines is that it's ridiculously hard to remove while stealthed.

&amp;nbsp;

Command Bridge

Perhaps the greatest trainer card in the game.

Integral for thinning your deck and possibly pulling Pride of Caliban. Also combos well as a first turn warlord power and command bridge.

&amp;nbsp;

Kai Zulane

Kai fits well into the energy curve of Merir. Turn 1 warlord power and Kai is another strong play and the utility of every possible tactic in the game for such a low cost is too much to pass up.

He also baits out board wipe cards and against Knights of Caliban that's a dangerous game to be playing.

&amp;nbsp;

Ariuk Recon

Anti Stealth should exist on every deck because there will be situations where a stealthed unit can ruin your day. Think Raven Guard and Night Lords.

KOC's Ariuk is great for solving this issue, being cheap, and having duplicitous so it can't be dealt with by the warlord.

&amp;nbsp;

Ambassador Melgator

This can be swapped out but I'm a sucker for Melgator. It's always hilarious when this goes off against Death Guard Plague Elite or an Arcology. Feel free to swap but I like the card.

&amp;nbsp;

Abandoned Supplies

The OG classic card cycle. Helps thin your deck, search for what you need, and on occasion pull off some disgusting combos.

&amp;nbsp;

Lord Malchial 

This man is VALUE. Pride of Caliban turn three, extra energy to play a card and warlord power, 1 damage on demand if you really need it, forces an enemy to burn removal or play flank when it might not be best. One of the best neutral cards to come out recently

 Play this guy first turn and your opponent will immediately feel the salt.

I know because it's happened to me.

&amp;nbsp;

Local Uprising

One of the more recent additions to the deck but I feel it's earned its place. Good value for 2E and a great combo card with an empty board. Warlord power and this card will give you 3 Jaegers on turn 3, not bad.

&amp;nbsp;

Master Ramiel

Gives your entire board +2 attack with a faction that can easily flood the board and the enemy warlord can't hit him. Don't play him without a board and you'll be using him just fine.

&amp;nbsp;

Jubac

It's Jubac.

&amp;nbsp;

Epistolary Thuriel

Duplicitous, decent body, and card draw are the name of the game here. Make your opponent work to clear your board and fill your hand while they do it. If enemy resources are being used to clear this you're doing it right.

&amp;nbsp;

Pride of Caliban

The foundation for which our cheese is curdled. This card combos so disgustingly well with Merir and of you don't have it I wouldn't even suggest playing him.

The gist of PoC is that it lets your warlord act again whenever an infantry is played.

Some PoC Combos

First and simplest. If you have an empty board you can warlord power and immediately act again. Do with that information what you will.

Second had to do with the Knights of Caliban counterattack. It gives a unit with low attack sneak attack for a turn. This combined with multiple drops of infantry lets your warlord go to town without taking damage.

Third and most important is the combo this deck is based around. Check the first paragraph of this comment for a recollection.

&amp;nbsp;

Caliban Knight

A fantastic synergy card with PoC. Attack with warlord, drop Knight, attack again, use Knight's ability, attack again with warlord.

Great combo and board presence. Generally try to drop this on an empty board and force the enemy to use fast, flank, or tactical to remove it. Seeing the pattern to the deck yet?

&amp;nbsp;

Tartian Squad

A perfect delay and cycle card. This deck thrives on the late game and needs to stall the enemy. 4 flank damage and a free card draw? What more could we ask for from 4E?

&amp;nbsp;

Manifest Destiny

Another flex card. While not entirely needed it has come in handy more than once. Take note that this is the only source of healing in the entire deck.

&amp;nbsp;

Attias

Honestly, could be a flex card. It's good value and synergizes well with the deck but you can forgo this legendary if you don't have it.

&amp;nbsp;

Praetor Castiel



The big chunky rind of our cheese. A 6/6 body which replaces all of your troops that die with a 1/1 Caliban Jaeger. Don't play this guy without Escape Vent unless you have literally no other play. Be smart and he'll win you the game.

&amp;nbsp;

Irresistible Charisma AKA (BIG D*** ENERGY)

It's not always helpful, it's not always there when you need it, but when it works, IT WORKS.

&amp;nbsp;

Brand of Fire

A big meaty flank body that can kill something small and then take out something big. Delay at it's finest and a card I'd never go without. It's a bit expensive though but that's when the big stuff comes out anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

Caliban's Heart

Ah, the famous fill the board with 1/1's that fill you full of tiny bullet holes. Its a fantastic card for so many reasons. Pair with Master Ramiel the turn before and that's 15 flank damage.",1640995250

And that did more than just harm the performance of their other songs. 

The company used to be called Dublekick, after Bboom Bboom they changed their name to MLD which looks an awful lot like MMLD, coincidence? I think not. Anyway, the fact that the three songs following B2 sounded the same got Momoland a lot of hate to the point where they got attacked for breathing. Following the hate from their first Bboom Bboom clone, MLD kicked out their best vocalist and the main rapper of the group. After that, probably hoping to get money from her acting, Yeonwoo herself said that they forced her out of the group and kept her under the company as an actress. The main rapper, Daisy, has been being silenced by them for what like over two years and while she shared an Instagram account with her sister for a while, we haven’t heard from her in a long time.",1640995250

Using a Cleric as an example, since you've got absolutely no incentive for int, it's likely going to be your lowest stat- so there's a decent chance that you'll only get 1 skill points per level (all you need is a -1, and not be human or take the skill FCB). That's not really fun for deciding between thematic stuff like Know(religion or planes) or Heal, and the obvious Perception that you're going to do well in and is mechanically important.

With min 4+int, you'll at least get 2, and so can do something thematic in addition to Perception. Or just do what PF2 did and make perception something else and not a skill. 

For the putting everything on the chart, like feats and ASIs, is this supposed to be like 5e, where those are actual class abilities? Because from the wording it looks like it is, and so you could just multiclass (is that still going to be a thing?) And get a new feat. And race.",1640995251

But honestly the issue is the auto bed leveling… a tare gauge and potentiometer are not a good way to level. All my issues lately are due to the the ABL system. I even replaced the entire hot end including the ABL components and it’s better but not great. I’ve even been compiling my own version of the community firmware to see what I can do but it’s the hardware that’s an issue here. I’ve been considering switching the hot end to an E3V2 one and using BL touch but I would need lots of custom firmware for that.

AITA for not forgiving my husband for spending all our savings, 401 k, ruined my credit rating specifically and getting us into debt when he hasn’t even apologized.  My husband and I have been married almost 20 years and have had ups and downs. About 9 years ago I went back to work (extra money) and got very sick from stress. I quit about four years ago. I gave him the money responsibility never imagining someone could do what he did. Discovery went on for over two years with me finding out about the 401 k not long ago. He went to bbq tournaments and generally just pissed it away. He lied to me hundreds of times and got so angry when confronted. He blamed everyone including me for it.  We were working from two separate books.  I knew what we should have and he confirmed it. Lied like a champ. Destroyed a lot of relationships for me as he involved everyone besides me.  I’ve been putting the pieces together and this is not a problem that he developed here. I asked his mom when I was first pregnant 19 years ago what was with his anger and she said she’d rather stay out of our marriage. So here we are. Im devastated from the lies and the treatment from him as he did so. The only thing we have is our house and I’ve just realized he’s never cared about it and it’s now in disrepair and I’m starting to fix what I can. Our finances are now on track but he did state he didn’t know what he was going to do as we’d run out of everything. I can’t work atm because I watch my granddaughter (my daughter lost custody) and my schedule isn’t fixed yet. He literally refuses to talk about things and he just seems to want things back to normal (I don’t think so) or he wants me to pull the trigger, which I’m happy to do this week by calling a lawyer to see my options. No doubt he will freak out, but the man has serious issues and f’ed me real good.   He has me so messed up by not thinking this is a big deal. It is right?  Or AITA?

"ThatsInsane","t5_swxxz","Okay let's break this down semantically. The original comment was: ""The only coincidence is the timing of purchase but nothing else he did was fishy. But coincidence happens that’s why you need direct evidence in court.""

More specifically, my comment was in response to the following statement: ""that’s why you need direct evidence in court.""

""Need"" means ""is necessary for"". In other words, the quoted statement broken down is: without direct evidence, there is no liability.

I commented saying that's not true and that it is, indeed, possible for a conviction or liability to be imposed where circumstantial evidence is presented.

Of course, direct evidence is preferable, and of course, circumstantial evidence can be refutted (although not as easily as you have characterized). I know this damn well, I am a lawyer. But it is baffling to have such a negative response to simply pointing out the possibility that no court rule, statute, or case requires the presentation of direct evidence before imposing liability or a conviction.",1640995251

At my work, I frequently am the first eyes on resumes and I can tell you that we care a lot more about what you studied and how well you did at the school rather than the school itself.

They are using a fragment of a DNA sequence as an identifier for the ""novel "" virus. It's all based on computer modeling, including the mRNA vaccines.

It's a bad flu and other diseases ( depending on the doctors diagnosing) .... they don't really know what causes these nasty pneumonias that kill a few people, or they are not saying.

**The original papers from Wuhan begin with statements like ""Sars cov2 causes covid-19"" without giving a reference to support the claim.**

At the most I found a reference to a WHO statement, who refer back to the chinese papers.... I kid you not.

It's a script, and the Chinese Communist Party may well have had a hand in writing it... but the authors are more ""international"" or ""transnational"" IMO.

Got to my PL position, had a guy get arrested for DV or something. Of course he downplayed it.

Expert shamming at its best. 1SG made him do DLC while on paternity leave cause he waited til last minute and he complained. Comes back from months of not working looking super chubby. He probably gained 10-15lbs while away. Somewhere in this timeframe he gets flagged for H/W failure. Then asked for a compassionate reassignment for his son, which was understandable, but he slept on all the required steps of course. Then at the tail end of it all, he gets arrested once more for DV and gets divorced. Downplayed it once more. Funny enough he had such a long HRR slide I needed him to proofread it one time, I watch out of the corner of my eye he types in ""however SPC \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has improved dramatically"" I obviously delete it immediately after when he leaves. 

Just funny how many times I had to meet with CO/1SG and were talking about him in an office. He truly took up a lot of my time. 

Then I watch a change of command ceremony after I leave the unit and see him and another one of my old Soldiers doing a BBQ near battalion, I try and wave to him and he ignores me. I dont know what I did to him but I thought it was funny.",1640995254

*didn't see any names*

TBF they did name Prince Andrew, and that may be partly strategic. I note the complainants are focusing on Andrew too atm. The rationale may be that if they can get a British Royal over this, it's going to set a precedent that'll make it easier to try prosecutions of, or publish stories about, smaller fish against whom there's less evidence. The writer may hope keeping public'attention on Andrew, instead of diffusing it with a list of lesser potentials, could help bring that about.

The growth potential might not be that much better, considering the total supply ratio between the two is around 3000:1.

I need to find a good high health bronto and see. I have an ascendant flak helmet on him since a headpiece provides armor to wolves rather than a saddle. Like 340 some armor. Around 6000 hp but over 840% attack damage. It’s crazy fun. I don’t want to try soloing a giga or anything yet but I’ve taken down an alpha Rex and a ton of alpha raptors. I just wish the swim speed was faster. I would go farm levels on carno island. My last argie died swooping to see the level on a giga and it was already aggroed on an anky and it hit me. The gnash damage finished me. First hit was about half my health and then 3 applications of gnash later it finished me and I fell to my death.",1640995256

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Oh I certainly am doing a TON of chores. I just fall behind on them for a few days sometimes *when I get really sick*... I can't deep clean the entire kitchen when I can't stand up for more than a minute pr two without passing out. The problem wasn't that I left the kitchen a mess... I had been working on a project, and got too tired to finish, so I piled all of my things off to one small corner of the kitchen, cleaned the entire rest of the kitchen, and then ran the dishwasher, and there were a few dishes that I put in the sink that were just waiting for the dishwasher to finish running. It was only about 4 dishes, that were all piled to ONE side of the sink so that at least one half of the sink fully accessible, and then the rest of the stuff was only taking up maybe 2 sq feet of space, leaving the entire rest of the (very good-sized kitchen) completely clean and accessible. And I told her I would get it as soon as I felt better, she said that was fine, then I went to bed, and she woke up the next morning and suddenly decided, without consulting me, it suddenly *wasn't* fine anymore, and literally THREW all my stuff down the stairs. Even my dirty dishes, instead of emptying the dishwasher and putting them in, or just leaving them for a day or two until I could come deal with them, she threw down the stairs, still dirty. Which broke several of them. She didn't even have something she was trying to *use* the kitchen for that day... She just unexpectedly and unilaterally decided she didn't want my stuff in there, despite the fact that the kitchen is supposed to be neutral territory that we BOTH have fair access to. And then she *kicked* me when I had the adaucity to get upset by that. The problem isn't that I don't do chores -- I very much do. The problem is that she has gone bat. shit. insane. Her giving me a place to live doesn't justify outright abuse. That's not something you can just ""buy""... abuse is abuse. I would rather be homeless than deal with the trauma she's inflicting on me, and it's looking like I probably will wind up having to be, just to get away from her. I'm willing to do that, but I am NOT willing to let her just get away with blatant abuse with no repercussions. She needs to be held responsible for the shit she's doing.",1640995257
"TOR","t5_2r36m","Correct me if I'm wrong, but since the normal version of the Tor Browser, the one I imagine that most of the users are on, does not have uBlock installed, and only Tails OS installs it by default (which I also imagine has a much smaller user base than the normal Tor Browser), would this not uniquely identify users of Tails? It's definitely better than installing random add ons, but to me it just seems like an unnecessary identifier.",1640995257
"Kanye","t5_2r78l","I don’t get why you’d hate this review. Obvs the writer didn’t like the album but he did acknowledge that it had some good moments on it.

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","I read the replies to your post and your replies to them. I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told every other new person who has stumbled in here after buying the game on sale and this is the truth and I know it is because I'm still a new player as well since I've only been playing for about a year.

The Truth is this, Tekken is Hard, it's Harder than ANY GAME you've ever played and that's not me exaggerating it at all, the Ceiling for this Game is insane and the Floor is just as stupid high! No joke! I started in April of 2020, I put in maybe 10-20 Hrs inbetween Practice Mode/Story Mode and thought ""Hey I should be able to do ok now in Ranked"" Fuck no! I lost 10x More than I won; I would lose 10-20 Games STRAIGHT before I won 1 Game as a New Player. I'd come into Reddit and be like ""WTF"" ppl told me ""That's just the way it is""

In these Early Ranks there is a Premise/Lesson that you have to learn and it's the hardest lesson and you can't skip it. You are learning a few things like for example ""Who's Turn"" but also you are learning how to deal with ppl who spam 1-2 Strings aka Cheese and also how to deal with ppl who spam Throws which can be cheese as well.

These are literally Building Blocks to your experience and it's also why ppl recommend choosing characters that aren't ridiculously hard since it only makes the lesson even more difficult to learn.

You have got to be more open is the first part. You aren't going to beat many ppl often until you know more than them and that only comes through experience.

What do you have to do? Well, the first thing is understanding the Neutral and what Moves you can and Can't do based on if it's your Turn or not. Tekken isn't about Mashing Buttons, Josie for example will smash you if you mash and it isn't cause she is a great character but it's because her kit is designed around Switch Stance which Counter Hit Launches and if you don't know what CH means it basically means you were pressing a Button when it wasn't your Turn.

There isn't any magic Trick and no other way to put it other than you have to learn how to play your character. You have to understand the Turn system but also which Moves you can actually use in Neutral and also to Punish. If you learn that I promise you 1 thing, you will get to Green really quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I would highly recommend putting Akuma on the Bench till you learn the basic stuff, Akuma is actually one of the most Mechanically demanding and it's generally because he has limited Tools in Neutral but has the ability to burst ppl down in 1 Combo (with wall) better than most. He is one of the most Difficult characters in the Game and until you learn how to control Neutral in general, you are gonna struggle especially with a Character like Akuma who was designed for those players who are literally just mechanically insane. 

Almost forgot to say but go to your Options and turn the AI up to Ultra Hard and then go into Treasure Battle. Get 50 Wins in a Row and if you can do that, then leveling up in Online Rank will be easy. I did this and actually didn't even go into Ranked until after I had 500 Wins because I was struggling so much but the moment I stepped back into Ranked I got to Yellow within the Week. If you can't beat the AI on Ultra Hard then you can't beat a Player even at the lowest level",1640995258

"halo","t5_2qixk","To be honest? 343 wrote themselves into a corner. And I don't think there's a super satisfactory direction to take the story after Guardians. 

That said....

We have Osiris, Blue Team, Majestic, and Arbiter and his elites all together. There was also a book that got Buck to get his ODST team together, minus the Rookie who is canonically dead. 

So you have a fuck ton of heroes to choose from. And while like many others I'd love to have all of them playable. I think the best choice forward is to have Master Chief and Spartan Locke as our only playable characters. 

The opening would be the breaking of Sanhelios. The Created fleet would conquer the planet. We would fight our way through it. 

At the moment of defeat the Infinity would appear. It's still invisible to Cortana because of its Forerunner what have you.

The giant cast of characters grows Roland, Halsey, and Laskey show up. Big rescue. Then Cole Protocol their way to safety.

Time to break the fellowship. John and Blue Team join up with Halsey. They're going after a Forerunner plot device. Using the doo-hickie from Spartan Ops that Halsey got from the Librarian. They'll leave the Infinity which means Cortana would discover them quickly. And because it's John and Halsey she'll come at them with everything. 

Locke and the others would stay with the Infinity. If Cortana stops John or if the Forerunner hope doesn't pan out they need a chance to win a possible protracted war with the Created. 

This would utilize the slip space drive of the Infinity to park and Roland to do AI techno-babble to spread the immunity to the Guardian shut down tech. 

Locke and friends would free covenant super cruisers, adding them to the Infinity. Save a few military and ONI things. Building an army to defeat the created. They'd mostly deal with Cortana's lieutenants; Sloan, Warden Eternal, and whoever. 

Chief and team would race on a new Forerunner world or installation. Cortana will personally oversee the Created against Chief. 

Both teams will suffer losses. There's too many outstanding characters and you have to sell the Created as a threat. So like Halo 3 before it... we're going to cull side characters. 

Halsey has to die. But literally everyone is on the chopping block. This needs to feel like the end of the universe. 

After our act 2 of Chief running and Locke liberating war assets. We reveal Cortana was aware of the splitting up teams and allowed Locke and Laskey to think she was too obsessed with John to notice. 

She split herself into two. And we have a devastating loss for Locke and the war effort. Roland dies. Some of Osiris/ODST/Swords of Sanhelios die. The fleet is ruined. All is lost. 

Cortana gloats in victory. Broadcasting the defeat around the galaxy. A big show that there's no resistance to her enforced galactic peace. She also shows this to whoever's left with John. 

But of course it only steels John for what he's got to do. 

Chief makes a big Halo run last level. Guardians show up. Much destruction. 

Chief gets to the plot point. And being the big finale to the Reclaimer trilogy he gets the Mantle of Responsibility which in the immediate means he stops the guardians and created from killing Locke and our surviving friends. 

Next he locks Cortana into the Domain which he also controls. With the Mantle Chief has ascended. Cortana admits such to him. But Chief doesn't see it like that. He sees the Mantle as a weapon; a constant threat from the Forerunners. And being the chief he dismantles the threat. 

The Guardians self destruct. The Halo rings are permanently deactivated. And to bring his inner conflict to a close; he refuses to be a weapon or part of some cosmic machine. He's a man. And he destroys the Domain and the self destructs the planet/installation they're on. 

He saves whoever's left of Blue Team, of course. 

Chief stays with Cortana as they die. He won't repeat what happened on High Charity or the Didact's ship. They're together to the end. 

Close with the survivors. Catch up with their mourning and where they're all standing after the Created War. 

But now we're fully done with Cortana and everything with the Promethans and Forerunners. Chief became the Reclaimer he was destined to be. We tease the Flood have nothing to hold them back now. And credits. 

Legendary ending teases that of course Chief survived and is in some kind of stasis.

Reclaimer trilogy is over. Next Halo series can be focused on anyone who survived. Or completely new characters. Flood still exist and can be a threat sooner or later. We never touched the Banished so they're still out there. 

We end big. And hopefully next time we plan out the damn trilogy a bit better. And don't have to knee jerk react after every game and have vastly different enemies game to game with no rhyme or reason. 

Am I happy with my pitch? Not really. But you needed a big finale. And you needed to remove a lot of the chuff plot points and characters we've built up over the last 13 years of Halo.",1640995258

Lulling the bowler into a false sense of catharsis believing that they have him swinging and missing, or edging. Eventually grinding them down, so much they don’t even appeal believing anymore and eventually roll over and surrender to the awesome power of Devon Phillip Conway. What fools. How I pity them. 

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this technique, to realise that it’s not just weird looking, but actually deep psychological torture. As a consequence people who dislike Conway truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the genius of his backfoot cover drive, which itself is a cryptic reference to the West Indies of old.

"Knoxville","t5_2qi32","Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

I have mint membership with Afterpay, and yes we are notified of sales before other people, but we still pay what other people have to pay. We don’t have to pay the first payment up front, but it still gets paid! I certainly do not use it to save $$$ or to scam $$ from stores! I do it bc I don’t get paid weekly or biweekly bc I make tips. So, it makes it easier on myself when I don’t wanna spend all the $$ I make. 

Honestly, reading all of these stories makes me want to boycott Ulta. These ladies are doing nothing wrong. Ulta is in the wrong. 

What’s the deal with people with Asian names getting banned!? I can assume, but that’s ridiculous. 

I’ve made up my mind. I’m done with Ulta. This is maddening. If they don’t apologize to these ladies, and restore their accounts, I’ll never step foot in another Ulta again. They probably won’t care, but at least I’m not spending my money on a store who treats their customers this way. 

Sorry for the rant. I had this done to me with Ipsy. The makeup sub box. They have daily deals in their app that you can buy. They are bundled and you save $$. I bought two bundles from them twice, and was told the same thing about how they thought my activity was suspicious and that they suspected me as being a reseller. I didn’t even know what they meant until I did some research. These companies are crazy. Have some facts on a person reselling before you do this crap to people.",1640995259

"marvelmemes","t5_35mye","&gt; imo the lack of immediate consequences for Stark is a factor that made that movie kinda suck.

i agree, but i was just pointing out that nobody made nearly as much of a deal about it as they are now, which i find kind of puzzling. like, the threads about ""when will wanda go to jail"" and so on are pretty much posted on a weekly basis on the marvelstudios sub, it's quite tiring.

&gt; If Agatha weren't there, Wanda might very well have just continued to enslave an entire town.

what's interesting is that any time somebody was close to getting through to wanda, agatha intervened to stop it: first in ep5 when vision was arguing with her - she sent ""pietro"" to distract them and throw her off her rocker even more, then in ep7 when monica was telling her about owning her grief, she quickly showed up in person to shoo her away, while patting ""poor wanda"" on the back.

i think vision would have talked her down eventually, especially after he knew everything after talking to darcy and if 

&gt; Though, I'm fairly certain most people only really have issue with the literal one scene where Photon says to Wanda ""They'll never know how much you sacrificed"" as if Wanda is the bigger victim compared to the people of Westview

i agree, the line was definitely very tone deaf. i don't even think the message behind it is necessarily wrong - she did sacrifice a lot, and it might even be referring to her sacrifices in life in general, not just westview (like killing vision to stop thanos). it was just worded extremely poorly and poorly timed.",1640995260

&gt; HOUSTON, Texas - A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy who shot a 17-year-old suspect has been terminated after a review found the deputy&amp;#039;s conduct was not consistent with departmental policies, Constable Alan Rosen said Friday.

&gt; The teen, identified as Charisma Hannibal, is in the hospital after the Dec. 26 shooting near NRG Stadium.

&gt; When the teen tried to get back into the vehicle, the deputy fired a weapon, injuring her.

"matrix","t5_2r30b","BTW, the idea of everyone being a threat is not a new concept from Matrix 4. It comes from Matrix 1, when Neo and Morpheus are inside a training program and then he sees a woman in a red dress turning into an agent right beside him. It's just that the idea was never used in Matrix 1 through 3, while actually inside the matrix.

I just think the execution of the swarm thingy could have been done way better. Turn the swarm into agents, instead of simply turning their eyes into a different color like in Matrix 4. Now that would look cool, and now it would be a threat, especially if they kill a few of the new sidekicks that had two lines throughout the movie. 

And of course introduce a limit regarding their usage so that it isn't used all the time. For example let's say those swarm people (batteries for the robots) would die and therefore using it all the time would be too expensive for the robots, but by Matrix 6 might as well turn an entire city against the protagonist, which would great for the trailer.

Overall, my largest disagreement with Matrix 4 is not its plot, but is its execution. Swarm mode is not a bad idea, but its execution was just horrible.",1640995261

Also a possibility: Alexa stumbles with some words, and seems like this is a bigger problem with non English words.  Try renaming the routine “Start Roomba” or “Clean up” and see if that works (so you can test if all your setup was correct)",1640995261

"onf","t5_1b3m3k","oh, i don’t think i articulated my point very well, sorry about that!

i agree with you that the meteorite showers start happening in why and start affecting the other timelines like tremors after an earthquake. what i don’t agree with was that it meant the other MVs with meteorite showers have to take place *after* why. i still think that it’s linear up until why, mostly because… well… **if the original timeline is in chronological order from ON/OFF to why, it means that the ONF members did this to themselves**

i think that because of what hyojin did, the original timeline has become frayed like a rope. it starts to unravel into parallel timelines where the other MVs (such as the bad ending in sukswim) take place. the original timeline is starting to decay, the only place left untouched being the sector of spacetime containing ON/OFF, where everything started

i believe that seungjun has three objectives when he does his time travelling and timeline hopping

1. find a way to stabilise the frayed timeline
2. if he can’t find a way to stabilise the frayed timeline on his own, get the original ONF members back— the ones from ON/OFF to why, the first set of androids they were downloaded into— to regroup and solve the problem together
3. if they can’t solve the problem together, get the original ONF members—the mind states and biological bodies in ON/OFF’s storage included— out of there. if the original timeline is like a frayed rope that’s starting to unravel, move onto a new rope entirely. it’s a multiverse, there are lots of ropes

the problem here is… seungjun’s time travelling and timeline hopping is actually exacerbating the problem he’s trying to solve. it’s literally a catch-22 that the members have brought upon themselves by messing with the original timeline in the first place. had they not investigated in WML, had seungjun not discovered the multiverse, had hyojin not used the pandora’s box without all the keys, none of this would be happening. they did this to themselves, and i think that’s very ironic

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","She in the wrong. If you're living in the apartment then you have to f-ing pay... Like wtf. Move out or pay the rent. Don't try breaking any lease. I'd advise you to tell her to move out right away because she has no right whatsoever and she's being incredibly rude and disrespectful! Tell her to move out right away! Help her pack her stuff. It's your apartment, not hers. It's your home. Not hers. She can live with her parents. If she doesn't like living with you and doesn't wanna pay more rent, then tell her to move the F out.

But of course, only if she's not on the lease. If she is then why the h*** is she not fully paying for the rent (I mean equal payment between the three of you, I'd get the third person's situation tho with the smaller space)? If she's on the lease, maybe you can move out?",1640995262

They might have gotten a brain fart and mixed up the plays subject to a coach's challenge and the ones subject to review by the video goal judge, which are a few more.

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","for reference, saving for pity in fgo will take around a year. Around twice genshin rate up pity (unless 2.5\~3 months is the time it takes to save for 2 pity) and greatly mitigated by the fact that it's much easier to roll the SSR on luck (assuming that the average is 300 SQ per SSR, you can get around 8 per year on average). Genshin does have a much better pity though, since it even carries over banner. Both have their plus and their minus

[here's the source I used for the calculation btw, 2021 was kind of a big year for fgo so I tried to lowball it](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/km1wik/estimated_free_quartz_for_2021/)

edit: I checked the message twice but I guess it still wasn't enough, assuming 2500 SQ, with the pity every 900 SQ and the average on luck every 300 SQ:

2500/900=25/9=\~2.8 guaranteed SSR. Better or similar to genshin rate up pity, but inferior to its non rated up pity

2500/300=25/3=8,3 SSR on average. 7/10 being rate up SSRs",1640995262

I followed them closely and their core of Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, Ariza, Gerald Green, McLemore, Austin Rivers, all of them had a very close relation w Harden, CP3 as well despite constant media clickbait that try to persuade the public outlook.

All of those guys had a very close relationship and it’s part of why they were so scrappy on defense, and they all fully trusted Harden on offense to take them to the finish line. Harden can go 0-15 on stepback 3s, and I can promise you all of that Rockets team wouldn’t bat an eye, they ride or died w that man.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I loved Breath of the Wild and felt like it was a game I'd been waiting my whole life for, though I acknowledge its issues.

I personally like the idea of open world but have never enjoyed playing Fallout and Skyrim type games. I think it goes into the whole Eastern RPG vs Western RPG idea. Eastern RPGs are about experiencing someone else's story and building power while Western RPGs are about creating a story and making choices. I enjoy building power but hate making choices so I never got the appeal of games like Fallout and Skyrim.

To me the appeal of open world isn't having more content like most people think (I have enough games to keep me occupied). Rather, I like being able to explore out of the bounds that the game creators intended. I love the idea of a game where it trusts you enough to let you go wrong places and get demolished by overpowered enemies. I love managing to beat one of those overpowered enemies and get some item from them, and then go back on track with those items on hand.

Before Breath of the Wild I'd really only seen two games do this (excluding the above mentioned Western RPG style games). The first was Zelda 1, which Breath of the Wild was modeled after. However, Zelda 1 hasn't held up well, particularly as its puzzles are too obscure. The second game was a niche game called Digimon World. In Digimon World you have a central hub city and you go out into the world to find and recruit people to give your city new abilities. However, Digimon World was too focused on the Tamagochi type aspect as you are expected to spend around 80% of your time raising creatures instead of exploring the world that they build. When I first heard about Shadow of the Colossus, a game composed entirely of 16 bosses, I first thought that all of the bosses would be roaming around the world at the same time. I was disappointed to find that the game is very linear, though it still became one of my favorite games of all time, but it wasn't the open world game I'd been waiting for.

Finally, Breath of the Wild was what I'd been thinking of. It has many flaws, the largest of which in my opinion is too few enemy types in the game, but someone finally made a game where they said ""go out and do stuff, it's not my fault if you pick a fight with someone you shouldn't, go ahead and try whatever"" without the ""pick a path"" type gameplay of Fallout and Skyrim. At this point, I am hoping that Breath of the Wild 2 can take the same concepts and fix the flaws that the original had.",1640995266

"OffGridCabins","t5_2y79r","But do you have any sources to cite to back that up?  That's the problem, so many people believe this, but where is the ordinance or document that makes this so?  I have never seen it.   Of the hundreds or thousands of projects I see being completed that should have required a permit (you can't even replace a gas water heater without having at least three permits according to some) but didn't have one, I've only once heard of somebody who was fined or forced to tear down their project. That was somebody who built a deck in the front of their house that was too close to the setback from the sidewalk in a suburban planned neighborhood.  That person was eventually able to keep their deck by petitioning to the planning and zoning department.  I've never even heard of a situation where this was actually enforced to the point of tearing down the project, or placing a lien on the property, have you?

License contractors can lose their license if they are working without a permit but for property owners It seems like a rule that is invented to scare people into paying the government fees but has little to no enforcement ability.  

I'm not saying I would take any chances on a $100,000 3 bed room house build, but on the 12x20 one bedroom cabin I'm planning I will probably take my chances.  To each their own though, but to me it seems like a minimal risk.",1640995266

The animals are given a fraction of their natural roaming range and the stimulation that occurs from this. Most zoo bred animals are then shipped to other exhibits and very little actually end up being redistributed into the wild. It also opens up a whole mother level of welfare issues from zoos that know they can make profit from animals and exploit this in countries where they do infact take wild animals then implement the bare minimum of care required to save on costs/maximise animal exposure to the public and gain profit. Most of the animals are completely neurotic from stress. Sure there may be some better ones out there that work towards conservation of species but the majority fail to do so and are profit driven.

I feel like any case of HF is severe but as far as mine goes I'd say it's on the milder side since I can still get erections but I still want it to get it back to what it used to be if not even better.

I think what happened was kegeling and generally whenever I'm nervous I am very  tense in my muscles and this caused me to have an overly tight pelvic floor which was exacerbated by the injury which ended up giving me mild hf and ed. I've had general symptoms of pelvic floor issues probably my whole life but the first time I ever noticed it was when I was anxious and it caused me to lose the erection. Which was about 4 years ago, it hasn't been a major issue until now but now that I see all my symptoms are related to the same thing I want to get rid of all of them which it seems like dct can do.",1640995268

 Pero you can go apply for mercury naman then use it for mercury purchases or welness shops/store/clinic to get the most out of it.

I’ve found that most linguist have never actually read Whorf’s original writings. “linguistics relativity/determinism” has been debunked, if you will, but the concepts that Whorf uses to describe his ideas are fascinating. I, myself, do research on cognitive semantics and I think Whorf was ahead of his time. 

Now… I think you could use some other approach to apply linguistics in your teaching. Read “metaphors we live by” by Lakoff and Johnson. The fist two or three chapters are really easy to follow, then it gets really deep really fast. 

Their main idea is that the language we use in daily life is metaphorical. These metaphors arise when we need to talk about things we don’t have “concrete” experience of but we talk about them in terms of other experiences. For example, we experience time but we cannot touch it… so, to talk about it we understand time in terms of space so we say things like “back in…” we also talk about it in terms of money as in “time is money” but we also say “saving time” “wasting time”.

I know nothing about music but I’ve heard people saying “a flat note”. I mean, this is a metaphor. I think you can make learning fun if you make these metaphors visual. Also, you can analyze the language you use with students and try to find the metaphors…

"8BallPool","t5_2z3z4","That makes no sense. It actually messes with my real life bank shots. How does incorrect physics in a game, help you with real life, as the bank shot doesn’t move like that at all in real life? There is no bank shot knowledge you can draw from in game to help you with real life. The floaty movement in game is what causes so many white ball sinks. My question is, this game is 15 years old, why don’t they just fix it. Make it like the proper pool games that exist now, with correct physics and where you can’t play back spin if you are close to a cushion etc. This is not 2007 anymore, tech has improved.",1640995271

"Horses","t5_2qlye","It probably is, but it’s not bad to feed treats, it’s bad to allow pushiness that’s generated by the treats. It doesn’t happen as much without them and most people either don’t see it, don’t see it as a “big” problem, or are timid about correcting the behavior.

I have a gelding who hasn’t done it in a few years, but for most of his life, I had to carry a whip in the pasture for about a week every year. He is bottom of the pecking order and would challenge me. I had to let him know that I wasn’t under him. I very rarely had to pop him, just drive him off.

A dressage whip is long enough to keep you in a safe area and light enough to just carry with you. I’d start by never giving her a treat by hand if she comes to you. You should go to her. Also, she ideally won’t get a treat if she’s asking for one. If she comes up sniffing and pulling at your clothes, no treats. I’d vary up when you give them as well. Don’t teach her that she always gets a treat when you come out, you don’t always give one at a certain spot, when you first come out, when you’re leaving. Mix it up. It’s when they “expect” one that they get mad at not getting one. 

If she gets aggressive, pinning her ears, nipping at you, etc. You should drive her off. My operating principle is that they are a very fast animal in a very large space. If I can reach them with my whip, they’re in my space. I’d pop her legs and run her off. You’re not thrashing her and trying to hurt her, but you don’t baby tap either. That’s nagging and create a bad attitude on its own. A short sharp correction makes a bigger impression and you’ll have to do it less times. Keep in mind, you’re teaching her it’s not okay to be aggressive toward people, including your kids.

Something else that helps with this is when I’m walking from point A to point B, many people will walk around their horses. If they’re standing there, they’ll go around them one way or the other. I do too sometimes, but often, I’ll walk through them. I do verbally tell them to move, but I walk at a steady pace and if they don’t get out of the way, I move them off. 

With horses, who ever moves their feet is the weaker individual. The more you move her out of the way, the less likely she is to become aggressive with you.

I’ve done this with my horses for years, it fixes the issues very quickly and I don’t have to fight with them for years. It hasn’t affected my relationship with them either as they will run up to me in the pasture for pets. It’s just another training aspect. Sometimes you have to dedicate time to remind them you’re not under them in the pecking order. Of course you can just stop treating, but the issue is still there and will probably come up in another place later on.",1640995273

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comDec 31 - U.S. federal judges need &amp;quot;More rigorous&amp;quot; ethics training to ensure they are not hearing disputes in which they have a financial interest, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts said in a year-end report published on Friday, citing a recent Wall Street Journal investigation.

&gt; The newspaper reported in September that 131 federal judges broke disqualification rules and the judicial ethics code by presiding over cases involving companies in which they or family members owned stock.

&gt; The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, spurred by the Wall Street Journal&amp;#039;s investigation, would set a 45-day window for judges to report stock trades of more than $1,000 and also require the judiciary to post disclosure forms online.

Theres other stuff I don't feel like getting into and writing a huge screed but here in the USA our prisoners do not have their rights respected. Anything saying otherwise is propaganda. 

The main thing I have a problem with it that money decides your fate. If you have it you can open doors a poor person otherwise couldn't. Just the fact that going to trial is punished with more severe sentencing should tell you a lot.

At some point I started thinking of HC as a different game with different goals. Instead of endless intensive farming for GG items and runes like in SC, my goal in HC is to simply finish the game through Hell. 

I had very little to lose with this character aside from a few days of play time. The gear I listed is low investment, and it’s really all I have. Had I died, I wouldn’t have lost much of value. 

Now that I finished the game with this character, I don’t want to start endless intensive farming. I just want to do it again with a different character and class, experimenting with different builds (anxiously awaiting the upcoming patch) and stats. If I ever find a valuable item, it would be from sheer luck while actually playing through the game instead of deliberate farming. And if I ever lost that item by dying, it would be exciting to find it again in the future. 

So if helps to look at it that way, give it a shot.",1640995274

"Edmonton","t5_2raht","I’m happy to do that! I was a little thrown off by the first comment that seemed to have decided my positions for me, ha.

“You seem to be asking police to be doing kore work while being a vocal advocate for cutting their budget, do you not understand that maybe cutting a budget results in less services? Will you hold yourselves accountable for the loss or lack of services when ""EPS decision making"" triages the loss of 10 million dollars?”

I have never been a vocal advocate for cutting Police budgets that I am aware of. What I do support is everyone taking a pause, and that we develop actual metrics and measurements to ensure the right dollars for the right strategy for the right outcomes. At present we don’t really have that, and what we measure and why is incredibly important. Chief McFee stated that we have an issue with institutional racism, and in general it has been agreed that a lot of what we consider policing has to evolve. The problem is that not everyone agrees on what that should look like in a local context and I am hoping my motion for the City Auditor to tackle this issue and find the right way we should be asking these questions will fit into the larger bodies of work underway both with City Admin and the EPC, and that these considerations are paired with the knowledge of helping organizations. 

This is a very large undertaking and as far as I know, no other City has attempted it yet, so it’s not easy finding jurisdictional comparisons. However, to get to where we want to go in terms of effective use of tax dollars in ensuring community safety and well being, it’s work that has to be done.

“You also have repeatedly shifted the blame on criminality and other issues entirely on the province. Why are you assuming this population has no agency over their own actions, you're treating and referring to them like animals with no control over their actions. When will you or anyone else on the counsel or the mayor hold themselves to blame for letting this problem get out of control?”

I would never say anything like this.

What I will say is that far too many people living in the streets or near to it are in distress. They are suffering any of a host of issues, or multiple, stacked challenges.

Mental illness, disability, severe injury, trauma, addiction, inter generational poverty, etc can all play a part and in their various ways can dilute or prevent a person from exercising the agency they have a right to in determining their own path. So it is a fact that many of the folks in these populations need more help than a warm meal and solid encouragement. For some it will be a lifelong need for support. For others that meal and encouragement will be enough, and then all points between.

And as for responsibility on Council, I believe we are doing everything possible at this point short of raising property taxes by 20% so we can do the other orders of government’s job for them. Some people say do exactly that. The problem is that we then carry that responsibility forever. No govt will ever take it back despite the fact that it makes no fiscal or legal sense to have Cities do the job of the province. Why bother having a provincial government if everything they don’t want to deal with is downloaded onto our citizens?

Having said that, the City was actually reducing houselessness before the pandemic hit. So the plan was working. But you know what they say about best laid plans.

There is a reason responsibilities are divided among orders of govt. the tax base and method of collecting taxes is one of them. It’s also legally mandated. If the challenges Cities face when provinces and federal govts don’t hold up their end is hard to understand, then I take full responsibility for not explaining it properly.

“Why do you claim to be behind evidence based decision making when you have pushed for defunding of police and funding of social services/private groups (Whom have absolutely no accountability nor have I seen anyone push for them to have accountability) when the evidence we can see from the States is a significant increase in crime?”

I didn’t push for defunding. I pushed for a freeze, which I thought was a prudent direction to take. Don’t cut, don’t grow, let’s figure it out first. Let’s get some evidence in before making moves based on public anger or emotion. There are studies out there, let’s start with those.

So we had the Task Force come back with their recommendations, many of which are being immediately implemented, but the Police Act calls for police services to be “appropriately funded”.

The problem there is that we don’t know what that means. And so we return to the body of work I described above. The result of that body of work may mean maintaining a freeze to right size an organization that is already very well funded. It may mean defunding. It may mean increased funding in both policing and in a streamlined version of helping orgs. The fact is, we need answers to these questions and at present, no one has very good ones.

I aim to change that.

“Have you been on any ride alongs with police officers to understand what the actual issues may be? Or are you making assumptions based off of Google searches like the one you did comparing edmonton and Calgary police budgets with no research or insight as to why there is a difference? Please don't like Sohi has regarding that as it's easily fact checked.”

I think this is likely already answered by my above responses. Happy to do a follow up round if you like.",1640995274

Obsessed? No? This is the a yandere situation...

&gt;2. She doesn’t grow from getting Levi injured or getting others killed. She’s still willing to put everyone in danger for the sake of Eren every time she plays a major role.

She doesn't. 

Like, after the female titan arc, with uprising, especially in the manga, she literally let's Eren go, and says to listen to Levi, despite her incline to, you know, save the guy she loves.

&gt;3. She could bot have easily cut down Reiner, because he was armored. The only reason she doesn’t kill Ymir, is because Historia convinces her not to.

Yeah, and this points to her humanity with even her enemies. 

&gt;Her personality never develops. The only thing that develops are her skills in battle. 

Her personality does develop, though.",1640995277

Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your statement be, ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond these is of evil.”

"Cricket","t5_2qhe0","As an Australian, I love the County game. I love the heritage and the local flavour, and the interest created by gun international players. But it's hard to see how it's fit for purpose to produce Test players at the moment. 18 teams is just a lot, I can't help but think fewer teams would create a more competitive competition. However, England have produced plenty of good players over their history with the same basic set-up, so I'd like to think there's a way of preserving it. Perhaps the deeper issue is the widening rift between the counties and the ECB - the ECB has treated them like dirt for years, and consequently they don't care about producing England players and only care about winning the Championship. Or maybe it's the other way round, who knows. But the result is that you have counties preparing pitches that suit their medium pace seam bowlers, and coaches failing to give promising players the skills they need to play the Test game.

The pitches and conditions are also problematic. As (I think) Farbrace said in his article the other day, the best strategy for the modern county batsman is to hit a quick 30 or 40 because he knows that sooner or later he will get an unplayable delivery. Australia had a brief period around 2011-2013 if I am remembering right during which Shield pitches were incredibly bowler-friendly. During that time we were producing zero batsmen capable of playing Test cricket, because there was no incentive to bat time. Now that we've gone back to more balanced and varied pitches our batting stocks are looking a lot healthier, and that's not just because averages have been artificially inflated by flatter pitches, it's because batsmen know that patience and judicious shot selection will be rewarded.",1640995279

Split ends actually continue to split up your hair shaft and lead to breakage + hair loss. The longer you keep them on your head, the longer they're hanging out irreparably damaging your hair. You can not fix them, you must remove them.

After your reset cut, I'd stop using heat and getting keratin treatments. Clarify the hair that's staying, get a deep conditioning routine going, throw away your towel for a microfiber one, and get yourself a satin/silk pillowcase to sleep on.

"PSMF","t5_2tf03","So, I had something semi-similar happen to me.  Without knowing it I developed gastritis, which is inflammation of the lining of stomach that is exacerbated by the stomach acid you are producing. I ended up getting an endoscopy (what your doctor is talking about) to have it formally diagnosed. It's typically not serious if treated, but you should get it checked out by a specialist if it continues.

For comparison, my symptoms included:

* A pretty noticeable and unpleasant pain in a specific part of my stomach (just under the sternum)--it did not feel like heartburn, but like a legit pain/tenderness in my stomach.
* This pain would come at specific times (usually in the AM and the evening) to the point of disrupting my sleep.
* This pain did reduce my appetite significantly--in fact I tried to self cure it by fasting and exercising more (the exact opposite of what you want to do in this case).
* This pain would be alleviated by eating a filling meal with starch and fiber, or taking antacids like pepcid, tums, etc.
   * I normally eat pretty low carb/carnivor-ish, but found that meat only (or very fatty) meals were tough on my stomach during this time...you need something to absorb the acid!  Plus, meat and fat take a bit longer to digest.

What I'd recommend:- I have no idea if you have gastritis or not, but...- I would stop fasting for now and eat 3 meals a day, especially breakfast.- I would see if over the counter antacid or stomach soothing medications (tums, pepto bismol, pepcid, etc.) alleviate the pain.- I would see a specialist and not be afraid! They will most likely put you on stronger medication first, wait to see if there's improvement, potentially test you for the bacteria that causes ulcers and then potentially do an endoscopy if you don't improve.  This is a painless, very easy and very safe procedure.

What happened to me:

* Doctors did an endoscopy (tube down the throat) after I did not respond to over the counter antacids/acid blockers. I was super nervous, but they knocked me out for the procedure and I did not feel a thing.  Absolutely nothing to be scared of.
* They confirmed that I had gastritis (inflamed lining of the stomach), did not have an ulcer (great news!) and prescribed me a combination of higher dose acid blockers.
* They advised me to NOT fast until I was healed and to eat regular meals, especially breakfast, and to take over the counter antacids on top of the prescription as needed.
   * I followed this advice, focused on foods that soothed my stomach (rice, bananas, yogurt and kefir, etc.), stopped fasting and ate regular meals, cut down on coffee
* Slowly recovered (I saw immediate relief, but took a few months to feel good as new) and tapered off all medications. Gently resumed previous lifestyle habits like lower carb eating and intermittent fasting.

What's going on with gastritis:

* When your stomach gets inflamed (from whatever cause), excess stomach acid aggravates the inflammation and prevents healing. What increases stomach acid?
   * Acidic stuff like coffee, hot sauce, vinegars, etc.
   * Exercise

Yeah, you'd think that constant practice would something Huntsmen would undertake; at the very least, it'd behoove them to achieve a level of mastery beyond the basic, since people's lives often hinge of their skills, which is why such a fact is kind of surprising, actually. I mean, they don't need to be the very best like no one ever was, but they could strive to be the best *they* can be, at least, you know?

Yeah, I can definitely imagine! Funnily enough, Camellia actually started out as Scarlet Rose, a White Rose kid, when I was still really new to *RWBY*, but when I decided to ""main"" Lancaster, and really got into this little project, I ended up *completely* overhauling her name and general appearance (she's always had a Gunlance as her weapon, and had always alluded to Bradamante, so that much is unchanged).

During that time, she was called ""Brianna Arc"" (which was mildly derived from Bradamante) until I could give her a ""proper"" name. Her color was still Red, at the time, but I wanted her to be somewhat more accurate to Bradamante, who was Blond, so I made ""Brianna"" a blonde and started looking at yellow flowers for names (because that's what I wanted) eventually coming across two I liked: Camellia... and Charlotte (for the *Rosa Charlotte*, also called the ""English Rose""), and while I liked Charlotte, I __loved__ Camellia, and so after a lot (and I mean, a __LOT__) of deliberation, I ultimately went with that.

And that's how ""Camellia Nikola Arc-Rose"" (her full legal name) was born. Her twin brother, Rhys (full name: Rhys Pyrrhos Arc-Rose; yes, both are partially named after Pyrhha), didn't exist until after Camellia became a Lancaster kid (and only recieved his final name in the last few months), and *his* team was also entirely different (for one, he was the leader, since Morgan didn't exist, yet), and so on. But yeah, you're right: at some point, I'm just gonna have to say ""OK, they're Good""! Just not right now! 😅

"ShiningNikkiGlobal","t5_4pqsbm","The mystery tickets seem like the absolute worst deal to me. You're essentialy spending gems on trash you could get for 300k gold. And 300k gold really isn't a big deal. I dump gold in that pav regularly because at this point I have nothing to spend it on and I've got 3 URs that way.

I don't see who'd need the gold or clocks except for very new players.

I'm desperate for silver keys but not *that* desperate, 90 of them for 1k gems is a big nope. You can get that in two days from team battles.

The 600 gems stamina rebate pack also seems bad. The weekly stamina pack you can buy for 300 gems gives you a lot more stam. And you don't really need both of them.

Imo the only thing that might be worth it are the fantasy tickets (10 tickets would normally cost 1200 and 30 - 3600, so these are big discounts), but it depends on your playstyle. Personally, I wouldn't get them because I spend gems almost exclusively on events and I'm okay with not completing Gleam suits because I don't like most of them, but ymmv.",1640995283

"running","t5_2qlit","For half marathon? None. Maybe a sip of water at 10k if it's a very hot day. Your glycemic balance is about 2k calories so you don't really need extra nutrition during shorter runs.

Besides, the rate of absorbing and processing food is really low (I remember something about 250 cals an hour but I may be wrong) so any food you eat close to the finish line is just useless for your run performance.

My strategy is to get some nutrition (gels, raisins) at 10km, 20 and 30km on any run longer than 30k/20mi. Otherwise you should do just fine, just don't forget to indulge on some good pasta after the run 😂

"ffxivdiscussion","t5_22ly7r","While I don’t think dodging is “bad” behavior. I wouldn’t put the blame on SE. but they are responsible for finding a fix. Shaming players for using a system that is part of the game (leaving an in course duty) is, to me, one of the most idiotic things the community does. Another thing to account is that CM’s pace is absolutely horrendous. You get interrupted while clearing trash several times thru it and it’s sooo goddamn annoying. In contrast, Prae lets you clear the trash before popping a cutscene, which feels nice. 

Other alternative is to add more duties to the pool. I think this would greatly help the dodging problem because it would lower the chances of getting the, allegedly, one you want. Meaning players would have to settle for other duties instead of rolling for 1/6, for instance. As for what duties to add, I have no idea.",1640995284

"Texans","t5_2s450","Alot of it comes from the fact that many fans just can't accept that Lawrence, Wilson and Fields are massive busts. So a third round rookie performing better makes them think that he automatically fills an imaginary vacuum of ""elite QB"" they think exists

I will give Mills credit that his highs are incredibly high while his lows are...whatever Lawrence's average is. For a guy who only played a handful of college games his progression has been very rapid and his performance against the chargers is something that you don't get from bust first round quarterbacks like a Bortles, Gilbert or Rosen. I don't even think rookie Josh Allen had a game quite like Mills vs New England or the Chargers

That being said, the last 2 years brings the Texans to the point of making business decisions. If Mills can't perform well in his final 2 games. Then there is very little loss for the Texans to sit a 3rd rounder while drafting someone like Matt Corral who will at least bring some excitement and intrigue for next year. Even with the rumors around the head coach floating around, if Mills can't finish the year strong then a new  head coach has no incentive to inherit him as a starter.",1640995285

The resulting backlash would never be worth confrontation and frankly the only reason you are considering approaching this particular Marine- especially in a superior manner with intent to put the Marine in their place with a “reality check” is because this Marine just happens to be female.

I’m a Marine and that shit wouldn’t even be worth it to me. But then again I’m also a female so I wouldn’t assume a female Marine acting out as a result of trauma (because women don’t leave the corps without trauma. period.) deserves to be singled out as other and wrong in a place of learning.

Your post moved me. I'm new to this sub (didnt even know about it until just now), but I'm glad I found it. I've been struggling with grief over the loss of 3 of my cat babies this year. 

I lost my 20 year old orange guy, Clarence, in June when his kidneys couldn't take it anymore and his body started to shut down.

Then in August my baby Molly passed away. She was 13/14 years old and had congestive heart failure. It all felt so sudden.

Finally, in October my 17 year 11 month cat Aud succumbed to her health problems. She had a heart problem (unclassified cardiomyopathy) the cardiologist was treating, IBS the internal medicine doctor was helping us manage, diabetes that required insulin 2x a day and finally rapidly failing kidneys.

I haven't yet gotten over the trauma of losing all 3 in such a short span. Your post touched me though. Such a positive message in spite of the tremendous sorrow.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","TLDR: The US gets more scrutiny because of its power and because of its founding ideals

I don’t think that slavery and war crimes are unusual for countries, however the United States is built on principles of liberal democracy, the core tenets being equality, liberty, and self determination along with outlining universal human rights. Not just American rights, but universal rights. What makes the US unusual is that it routinely violates its own principles while portraying itself as a beacon of democratic exceptionalism. Countries like China and Saudi Arabia may pretend to adhere to “democratic” or “egalitarian” beliefs, yet war crimes they commit are not unusual to us. This is because purges to maintain power and achieve homogeneity are not new. They are familiar. Why we need to focus on the United States is because it is so powerful and sets the bar for human rights around the world. By not adhering to our own ideals we undermine our ability to promote these rights and prevent these atrocities from happening again. A policeman who enforces the law yet does not follow it is a tyrant. 
If we want to pretend that all countries have equal influence on the world and the US is not unusual, we have to stop pretending that our ideals are exceptional. But I don’t think that’s how we should view the American experiment… I think the ideals are exceptional and we have to live up to them. I think Uncle Ben and Aunt May put it best when they said “With great power comes great responsibility”.",1640995288

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","No, just functionally as far as game design goes, BOTW is inferior in it's design elements. It has a beautifully crafted world, a workable story, and it falls short in many ways. 

In particular, when it comes to design, all the ""dungeons"" in BOTW are largely forgettable, they have interesting *concepts* to them but execute them poorly. No one's gonna remember the Fire Divine Beast's puzzle in 15 years, but if you say ""water temple"" everyone remembers it, whether they liked it or not. That's because the water temple had cool, and unique designs to it.

The bosses also fall short in being interesting, by comparison to older LoZ games, [Boss Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouO1R6vFDBo&amp;list=PLc38fcMFcV_ul4D6OChdWhsNsYY3NA5B2) is a great series on how and why the bosses and dungeons in older 3D LoZ games are just far better designed. Yes the old dungeons have problems (particularly the Water Temple being a bit too confusing, but that's an easy enough fix and he points it out IIRC), but they are far better at respecting the players intelligence, and not being over-simplified.

It's not just nostalgia that leads to people talking up games, it's that *some games* actually have really good design to them. Yes Super Mario 64 falls flat to a lot of games in features, and design, but the *core* of SM64 is absolutely phenomenal, and lead to the systems used in *every major 3D game since then*. Same about N64 LoZ titles, they fall flat these days, but the design elements within them are absolutely ground breaking for the time, and games would literally not be the same without them.

The old 2D LoZ games are *good* for their time, but they don't hold up even in design philosophy to 2D games now and are definitively worse than other 2D games now. Nor, were they insanely influential when it game to design philosophy after them, they had little affect on games (outside of showing what not to do).

This is the problem people in game design have with BOTW, it takes a lot of elements from other games (and does little to nothing ""new""), and does them all passably. BOTW is *fine* as a game, but it is a step back in many, many ways, in order to add in many features that are half-cooked and don't lend to much more to the over all experience: Take the cooking system for example, it's really cool in theory, and has been done in so many other games, but is it needed in BOTW? I'd say no, you could completely remove that and the game likely would have been better off without it, as resources could have been better allocated to something else. This can be said for *so many* parts of BOTW, small little things that needed to be polished that just weren't, or were excess features that are ""neat"" or ""nice to have"" but don't lend themselves to actually being a better game. There's a lot of fat to trim in BOTW.",1640995288

She cannot care for herself and you cannot provide the level of care she needs either. I am surprised the judge even agreed to this to be honest with you, unless your mother can easily afford to pay for round the clock home care for the rest of her life.

That's basically all I liked about the game. Story is subjective, but I found it bland. The game lacks personality too. Compare the characters and settings of OK to TTYD and be amazed by how massively restrained OK feels in terms of imagination and creativity. 

I also hated the dialogue for the most part. I just wanted to skip through everything. Olivia is annoying as any character in a game I've played that isn't anime. I would say 95% of the jokes missed for me. Very unfunny for a game constantly trying to be funny. 

The combat sucks, and you know it's true when you have to rework it for the boss battles which is a joke because boss battles are supposed to test your competency based on what you've learned in the leadup to them. Having completely different combat for the bosses is terrible design.

Overall it felt like a chore slogging through this game. Would not recommend to my enemies.",1640995289

"adventofcode","t5_3b3wa","There are solutions in the direction you indicate. You will want to be careful that you handle an input like this familiar shape properly.

    on x=-2..2,y=-2..2,z=1..1
    on x=-4..0,y=1..5,z=1..1
    on x=0..4,y=1..5,z=1..1

This input was given not because I ran your code and specifically saw an issue with this input but just because I think it's good at illustrating the sorts of things that this sort of solution will need to pay attention to. If you need more confidence that you are handling multiple intersections properly, you can easily test it with an input that's just multiple repetitions of:

    on x=1..1,y=1..1,z=1..1
    on x=1..1,y=1..1,z=1..1
    on x=1..1,y=1..1,z=1..1

You will probably also want to vary these between `on` and `off` to make sure intersections between the different types are being handled correctly

If you are willing to look up information related to a term that will help you in implementing your proposed solution, you would be advised to look up the &gt;!inclusion-exclusion principle!&lt;",1640995290

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","There is so much to this question and how germany chose (or better: did not choose) to handle it's past.

For one: It's not necessarily a lack of education. In German schools the Third Reich dominates in the history classes. We learn all about the rise of the Nazis, the Structure, how things went down etc.

Now, given those are the usual factory schools, you can likely guess how much of these lessons stick around.

So in theory, germans should know all about this. But then comes the dualism of the german mind (at least a large proportion of the population thinks along these lines) regarding the Holocaust.

On the one side, the Third Reich, the Nazis and the extermination of Jews and other minorities is elevated to a level of evil that is almost cartoonish. If, in germany, you use a comparison between how the unvaxxed are portrayed in the media and how jews were portrayed in the media in the early stages of their persecution, you are met reliably with the accusation: ""You relativize the holocaust, how dare you!"".

The implication is clear: This historic event was so astoundingly evil, so absolutely complete in it's sheer malevolence, that no other event compares, and that you may not compare another event.

This is a consequense of how germans have been controlled since WW2. The guilt that you bear is complete and you may never wash it off. From pumping obscene amounts of money into greece and the failing euro, to taking in refugees, to foreign aid, like a sword of damocles the events of the past hang above the german head each time any sort of sacrifice is demanded from germany.

And it works. Reliably. But it has also blown up this event in sheer inhuman magnitude of evil, that you can basically never really learn from it. Because back then evil incarnate reigned, and we are now mere humans. So any comparison of it to the acts of mere humans is minimizing this Era of sheer atrocity.

And quite handily this also means, that when our media and elites are hunting some irritating minority again, like the unvaxxed, you may never make any comparison to what already happened here.

The other part of the dualism is the sentiment that despite evil having reigned back in those days, your personal grandpa or grandma, wasn't all too bad of a guy.

There is this disgusting german TV-Show that really reveals this sentiment, and that is ""Generation War/Unsere Mütter, Unsere Väter"".

Now, the show is not disgusting in the regard that it would, for example, show any justification for the Nazi crimes. It doesn't. Rather it is the dynamic in which the characters are portrayed:

The protagonists are protagonists. They were forced into the war, but they weren't bad guys, didn't have bad sentiments, weren't all that anti-semitic, if at all, kind a-political. But they were used by the caste of evildoers.

And germans can identify with that. You would not believe how many germans I speak to are quite demoralized when it comes to the political leadership of the country. They feel completely powerless and have adopted the ""Those people up there, they'll do what they'll do, for reasons that are surely important"".

So why not think that your grandparents were not like that?

Now of course they quite often were not like that. Naziism was a broad popular movement with deep support in all classes of society. My own grandfather from my fathers side, was a raging anti-semite. My father was one for quite some time, too (and this is from whom I learned that a sentiment like that alone does not make a bad human. My father is a deeply decent man, he just had some dumb ideas for some time. He doesn't anymore.).

So in short, what I wanna say is:

The way Germany deals with this topic is completely toxic, and in part based on a sort of political collective abuse of the german mind. After WW2, Germany had to be useful to the countries it was allied to. And both sides, USSR and NATO found the narratives it needed to make the german useful. Sadly, that precluded really learning from what happened back then.

I deeply believe in a german collective responsibility, and that we ought to do better and that we ought to learn from the events back then, without elevating them or minimizing them. We have a responsibility to recognize that the killer lives in each one of us. Sadly, we do not handle it that way.

Send text saying need lock and tag kit for ATLEAST 347v stuff lol .  Also decided to check first aid kit in jobbox..  had nothing useful and some liquid for cuts that expired in 2007 lol... so sent text saying that too and to get ear plugs and few n95 too. Got huge lock and tag kit and first aid kit..quick, cuz was not just spoken word lol. ( seems they can't keep same job box with me)
Laid off...no or not yet lol but I bang out jobs quick and they seem to like me. Basically do what I want..( small shop) Even if laid off list is current and can find work if it wasn't. So not worried. Plus wouldn't mind a paid vacation (ei) if came down to it. Employment insurance covers my mortgage so I'm good. 
Basically up to you if you want to go home at end of day  alive and well. Do you want to be able to enjoy retirement and function properly if you make it there? Play with your kids/ grand kids? Be there for your wife/ husband or kids?
At end of day we all sign company policies too on orientation. If boss/ forman having a bad day or just being a real forman and your doing something you really shouldn't , can be fired with cause meaning no Employment insurance or if seriously  injured due to stupidity/ not to company policies there a huge possibility you won't be covered.

Imagine something happends, your injured, killed a fellow brother, made the news, company gets band from future bids or contracts and your not covered for workers compensation cuz didn't follow policies you signed and your fired with no ei. 
Ouch.. dont think rep can help much...

And that means the ""endless"" supply will only last as long as there are no specific needs of said software, I think the reason why David Hansson believes this is because of his experience with the development of rails, in the sense that Rails is a framework, in other words the foundation of other more complex software.

So it then makes sense that developers would commit back their changes since having to dust of old code just so you can make a new website is ineffective.

"CPA","t5_2rlkk","1) I would suggest trying each of the courses out first using the free trial. I used Wiley and really liked it, added Ninja monthly to supplement, I used Becker a little and didn't really like their 'underline this' and 'circle that' approach as well as their constant use of mnemonics didn't work for me.

2) Everyone is different; for me BEC was the hardest, the others were relatively easier for me. I took RGE - FAR - AUD - BEC. I would say that FAR and AUD had some overlap...

3) No crazy at all - it's going to take time and dedication but is very doable. I was an 'older' candidate too and, as long as you are dedicated to passing, you can do it!

4) Check with WA Board for the license requirements. I'm in OR and I was required to work under a CPA for a year in order to get my license - I suspect it is similar in WA but not sure; do you work directly with a licensed CPA now? Also, I recommend sticking with one test until you pass it then move on to the next test; the pass rate for these are intimidating but much of the test is just perseverance...

We've gotten great ones like Rushin' Around, Gangnam Style, and Never Gonna, but also shitty and lazy ones like Toosie Slide and Renegade. Bad songs, with dances that are really boring. It doesn't help that Toosie Slide in particular is a song specifically made to cash in on Tik Tok trends.

"LinusTechTips","t5_2v5ru","OP, I have been in the  industry for several fõrtdecadès. My anecdotal experience might be able to assist you with the remediation of your sub-optimal thermal conditions. 

Upon brief analysis of the initial description, it is my professional opinion that you are not using enough of the respective thermal paste for your VRMs. I know you're thinking *""oh u/lithid, you're clearly executing a ruse""* - but hear me out before you stop reading. 

A little known industry secret might help you out with this predicament: you should actually start mixing your thermal compound with superglue. I recommend Gorilla Glue, as it has a higher TPV than - say - Elmer's Confectionary Glue. 

Why does this work? Well, science, of course! I'll explain a little better, for the inexperienced: cold air sticks to the paste due to a chemical reaction called *Reactive Niptitus*. This ends up maaking your compound better at exchanging heat, due to its newfound molecular properties (and nipples). 

Furthermore, upon another cursory review of your initial description, and attached image, it also appears you are not receiving any of the thermal benefits that come with owning an LTTStore.com water bottle. Might need to get that checked out, idk.

You'll also find plenty of people that think that her having a child out of wedlock makes her untouchable.

None of those are true or reasons for you to not go through with it.

But it's clear that you have strong feelings for her, so it's not likely that anyone would persuade you not to go for it.

I dated someone long-distance for a year, then moved to her state and we got married a little less than a year later. Long-distance is hard but if it's the right person, it's worth it and will work out.

But before you commit to something like moving to another state, you should fully talk to her and make sure the two of you are on the same page.

1) What will you do if things fall through after you move?

2) Is her not being Christian a deal-breaker for you? Sometimes people convert, sometimes people don't. If she goes forward with being Christian just for the relationship, she might later resent you. You need to decide now if her not becoming Christian is going to be a deal-breaker for you.

Both of you need to assess things and be honest with each other. Love is a hell of a drug, and so a lot of times people will commit to things that they later change their minds on. Talk about those possibilities now, before you make a major change.",1640995292

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","&gt;What were your goals for 2021?

I had none save for keeping my cardio and upper body strength at somewhat reasonable levels and keep myself sane in the uncertainty. I went to the gym a grand total of 5 times.

&gt;Did they change and why?

I actually itched to progress enough to try to make a reasonable gymless strength routine. Nothing measurable and specific though - survive this program til the end, add volume and intensity and repeat.

&gt;Did you accomplish them and how?

Definitely!

&gt;What would you have done differently?

I would have simply tried harder to strength train and make it work - get a sandbag, more kettlebells, heavier bands, adjustable dumbbells heavier than my current ones.

&gt;What did you learn along the way?

Things helpful for fitness:

1. Gardening. Getting produce from a few feet away really takes a lot of planning away from eating vegetables. Making fermented vegetables has meant that I have jars of stuff that I can add to each and every meal and which makes my gut work fantastic.
2. Just how much planning eating enough protein takes. I just don't naturally gravitate towards it - what is delicious carbs and fat that have added flavors and well prepared vegetables to me, but that isn't terribly anabolic.
3. How to progress in the absence of easy ways to add load like you can do with barbells. Basically the antithesis of Starting Strength model.

&gt;What are your goals for 2022?

I must admit that I still haven't got them. Getting 20 pull ups would be awfully neat. I have a griptrainer that's a Chinese copycat version of some more respectable gripper. I just want to further along and maybe have better forearms. I want to go further along with my conditioning as my cardio base is solid now.

I think I'll run a 20 rep routine when I get back to the gym (after the Omicron wave here). It's a completely different kind of routine: a single set of 20 reps for about 15 movements, big and small. Tiny amount of weight is added with each workout, when plateau comes, new rep range is set as 14, then 8. After everything kind of stalls, you hop onto another program.

I'll cut until I get back to gym or lose about 15 lbs, then start my bulk. Mythical's 6 month plan seems intriguing.

&gt;How do you plan on accomplishing them?

Honestly training each quality listed 2-4 times a week should go a long way. I want to become more conscientious about my meals and do more meal prepping along the way and use my freezer more.

I recognize that my goals aren't well defined enough to permit detailed planning. I'll stay hungry for a while until conditions improve.",1640995293

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","Valve is kind of the forerunner of lootboxes and then tying it with a value given you could trade, this happened back in 2010, the community wasn't a fan of it, but it was still kept and has had a dramatic influence on how games used microtransactions, at that time there wasn't any alternatives, so it was rather easy for Valve to ignore the bad feedback.  


And why others haven't copied it? Marketpower, Valve is in a unique position in the pc market with that they had monopoly in that area, no other storefront came close, and they were mostly disregarded, it is for the same reason why the Workshop, despite being a terrible idea given it fragments communities and removes game parity, worked, but the landscape is slowly changing as Epic is doing a serious push into the market and Xbox with its Game Pass, anyone who says Valve has a monopoly now, even when it comes to marketpower would be lying.  


I'm sure others would like a marketplace like it, but they neither have the first mover advantage or a sufficient marketpower, so jumping onto the NFT bandwagon is the perfect opportunity for them given there is so much talk about it.",1640995294
"HPfanfiction","t5_2t100","I’m doing my best to make logical argument based on views expressed in the books combined with historical perspective of me trying to think like a magical from a given century. If this seems like projection that is not my intention.
A given magical (albeit probably muggleborn is we’re being honest here) might see the use in muggle maths, however, the acceptance of using muggle maths by pure bloods (who control a majority of the power in the wizard world probably including research) would bury or discredit any meaningful findings because much of wizard society is based on magic being better than the mundane which would include mundane maths. Heck in the 17th century they would do their best to discredit findings from people of countries they didn’t agree with. Now given that in the HP universe besides for a few things ( hogwarts express and a few cars) we don’t see much that’s both modern and enchanted, we can assume that such things are generally curiousity’s so that some Arithmancer’s knowing about muggle maths is probably true. But again they likely see it as a silly muggle thing and would not likely try to incorporate into their own work.

Hi Brethren,  
HAPPY NEW YEAR IN GOSPEL, DELIVERED BY THE ANOINTED CHRISTS = SATGURUS JESUS AND HIS SECOND COMING NANAK.  
Youtube Video:- https://youtu.be/OMRyrKDXNG4  
The reason for Christ Jesus to appear was that the Jews outwardly of appearances, the FAKE proclaiming themselves to be the Chosen People of demiurge Yahweh who brought Abram of the Semitic race, a mix of the Negro and Aryan, who hated none but loved all from the Iraq area to the Middle East to establish an ideal society and he was given the Promised Land as the Garden of Eden. They were living in the company of their creator demiurge Lord of the Nature Yahweh and for his faith, he was named ""Abraham"". Now, so far the generation of Abraham, an ideal Adam and Sarah, an ideal Eve, were faithful ""Salt of Abraham"", an honest and truthful as Joseph of the twelve sons of Jacob was, they enjoyed the best fruit of the Garden of Eden but as soon as they became unfaithful and Saltless people as the Eleven crook liars and murderers were who wanted to kill the Nathanael like true Israelite with no duplicity Joseph was but the Saltless brethren sold the faithful Salt of the Earth Joseph as a slave to the faithful to Abraham Salt of the Earth Egyptians of Ishmael, the Elder son of Abraham, there he was honoured among them and was given the highest position of honour among them whilst the unfaithful to Abraham liars and murderer sons were rejected by the Nobel Man Abraham to whom the Promised Land belonged and such Saltless super bastards unfaithful to Abraham and Yahweh people – John 8v44, the Tares Matt 13v24-30 that are being bundled up in Israel for the Final Burning in the ensuing ATOMIC WAR expected on 14/05/2023 when Israel is 75 years old - had no place in Adam to inherit and live. Yahweh was also not happy either and no rain or crops for them to eat. All these natural disasters that are taking place in the world are a punishment to the cruel people who have committed atrocities against childlike innocent people. No such natural disasters among the faithful tribal sons of Adam living in the African and Brazilian jungles. Then, they had to leave the Promised Land for Egypt where they started to misuse their spiritual talents with evil spirits and ended up as slaves to the Salt of the Earth Egyptians where Salt of Abraham Joseph had become the ruler. In other words, the faithful to Abraham and Yahweh Nobel people of Joseph, the Samaritans were honoured anywhere they went whilst the clever crook generations of the Eleven Patriarchs were hated and killed in holocausts by the tribal sons of Man. Thus, when the English were English and not Conservative or Labour, they killed the bloodsucking cheating Jews outwardly and not the good Samaritans, the Salt of Nobel Abraham. John, the Baptist, the last Prophet Elijah, the Cornerstone of the Temple was ousted out by the greedy Rabbis dressed in silken clothes and Christ Jesus exposed their hypocrisy and they killed Him. Angel Stephen, ..

"GracepointChurch","t5_43ja2z","&gt; I don’t doubt your experiences.

You don't doubt our experiences, but we're not allowed to post them on yelp because that's ""flooding"" yelp with artificial reviews influenced by p. ed?

Or is there another way I'm missing that reconciles ""your experiences are valid"" with ""your yelp reviews are not""? Because I'm not seeing it.

&gt; My point is you need approval to post.

You really don't though. Of all the gpers who have posted in this sub, none of them sought ""permission"" first. That's a weird sentence even to be typing out.

&gt; No, it’s not because 1,600 lay volunteers are not social media savvy.

That's a strawman of what I said. I didn't claim people didn't post yelp reviews because we're not social media savvy. I said it's because we don't post reviews on yelp in general. Could you find it plausible that in a large group of Asian churchgoers, most of us are not the type to go around posting online reviews of restaurants, much less churches? That's not social media unsavviness, the average American also doesn't go reviewing things on Yelp. That's a problem of Yelp reviews in general. The only reviews you see are those by ppl who felt especially compelled to go out of their way to post an online review under their name, either because they had a horrible experience, or they just love it that much. It's a form of selection bias.

So you read the yelp reviews and get a misrepresentative impression because none of us quietly keeping to ourselves post anything on yelp, not because we don't know how to use social media, but because most of us like most of the world don't review things on yelp period. Hence encouraging people to write a review if they haven't, because otherwise all you're left with is this wildly misrepresentative set of reviews.

&gt; You want to post the Yelp email you got verbatim?

I don't have it any more, so I couldn't even if I wanted to. I also feel uncomfortable doing that even if I had it. Another angle to why organizations don't engage in these kinds of forums. Here, I need to explain myself to every single poster who's requiring that I leak internal communications so I can prove myself to all of you guys.

&gt; Did it say how you can make the review stand out more by befriending other GP members?

Unless my memory is defective, I'm pretty sure it didn't. But don't quote me on that, because I honestly forget.

I'm saddened yall are convinced I'm a ""bot"" or ""pawn,"" but there's nothing I could do to convince you otherwise, even if I leaked ever internal communication to prove I'm not under p. ed's spell. So with that I'm gonna bow out.",1640995295

-Tools/objects needed to help the transformation (ex. Bones placed in the shape of wings that fuse the the NPC to become the demonic wings on their back)

Continue the international exhibitions for a additional TV/streaming revenue and to offer higher salaries. Honor past Globetrotters and retire Jerseys.  Have games at Cryto.com since there will be more dates available with the Clippers moving out.

2. Sponsor a Fireball team in the **Big 3**. Ask Vanessa Bryant to be involved and have it named **The Mambas**. Try to make the team consist of former Lakers &amp; Globetrotters.  Work with Cube to start a Women's and Co-ed Big 3.

3. Make a brand of Peanut Butter and Jelly.

4. Start a Middle School Basketball Camp and invite the best players to ballboys/ballgirls. Create brand loyalty with prospects.

**Science Up!**

1. Use Kinesiology/Biomechanics and Hypnosis as part of training, practice, and scouting.

2. Use Hyperbaric chambers and Cryotherapy in recovery.

3. Use motion capture &amp; add active sensors to uniforms/shoes to gather data in practice: monitor fatigue/performance and how much rest is needed for each player; create Unreal3D POV video review sessions so players can recognize situations from the on-court perspective; provide accelerometer data to league for charge/block &amp; foul/flop discussions at competition committee.

**Player Development**

1. With added revenue streams, go into the luxury tax.
2. Invest heavily in experts on player &amp; skill development.
3. Prioritize athleticism and court awareness with young players.
4. Encourage young players to tour with Globetrotters during offseason.
5. Sell 2nd round draft picks and have the interested players agree to drop out of 2nd round.",1640995296

The opposition to MLs being ideological is basically precisely the point - we will never be able to coexist on an ideological plane. And sure, real life right now is causing massive problems for people. I do not, personally, think anarchists allying with MLs will come even close to solving this problem as we will most likely spend half our time discussing the state, economy, hierarchy and so on. 

While we could work with MLs to dismantle the state - what would the actual end result be? We *know* they don't want the same thing as us. We *know* they will use the state as a means to gain control of society. How are we to accept that? 

Again, I do understand what you mean. But I think it is a short-sighted, detrimental argument. We will never be able to coexist with either nationalists or authoritarian communists. So why base even parts of our praxis around them?",1640995296

&gt; A new Chinese law on the protection of sensitive data has made it much harder, if not impossible, for foreign investors to access information on China&amp;#039;s economy over the past few months.

&gt; The new law also contained steps to limit access to what the Chinese state regards as sensitive data.

&gt; What is more, the Chinese Communist Party is pulling the rug from under the feet of foreign businesses by restricting access to economic data - especially in the technologically advanced, disruptive sectors that China is prioritising, such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.

You've mentioned Docker, if you're needing Docker help be sure to [generate a docker-compose](https://trash-guides.info/compose) of all your docker images in a pastebin or gist and link to it.
Just about all Docker issues can be solved by understanding [the Docker Guide](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide), which is all about the concepts of user, group, ownership, permissions and paths.
Many find [TRaSH's Docker/Hardlink Guide/Tutorial](https://trash-guides.info/hardlinks/) easier to understand and is less conceptual.

Chris still touched her inappropriately and said the most disgusting things. Even she didn’t want to be anywhere near him. Chris is a sexual predator, he has no standards despite his criteria. He has harassed at least six woman in person. Four of them were trolls.",1640995297
"cincinnati","t5_2qt1k","Hi! I attend NKU and I wanna share my thoughts. 

NKU has some great perks and staff, but it’s important to look into your professors before you sign up for a class. I’ve had some crappy professors here that made me wanna drop out, and some fantastic ones that kept me here. Though I’m sure that’s true of any college or university. 

I’ve heard the STEM programs suck. I’m a social work major, but I started as a nursing major. I have a friend who was in the engineering program and he hated it. And I didn’t enjoy my time in the nursing program. 

However, I have friends in the various arts programs and business programs that love the school and their professors and the whole process. 

So really, it depends on what you’re expecting and what your major is. 

Hope this helps!",1640995297

"Behcets","t5_38j2o","&gt;I had an abdominal ultrasound exam 10 years ago and a few colonoscopies

If I could scream about any misconception about Behçet's, it would be about GI Behçet's: GI Behçet's shows up on a colonoscopy. The ulcers that Behçet's creates in the mouth, eyes, and genitals also show up in the abdominal track. This is how I personally was diagnosed and they found *hundreds* and biopsied them -- contrary to popular believe, Behçet's is often diagnosed after a biopsy. The ulcers look different than Crohn's and UC. If you had a scope and they found nothing, *your GI symptoms are not Behçet's.*

If your GI issues were related to Behçet's, you would also have severe anemia. I was hospitalized several times for my anemia before my observant GI had a lightbulb moment and ordered more tests for me. Those ulcers bleed in your GI tract, so if you have Behçet's with GI interaction, you are losing a fuck ton of blood. I also had low blood pressure and hair loss, nutrient and absorption issues due to these ulcers.

I also want to note that GI Behçet's is incredibly rare and a few journal articles found that a large portion of people with GI Behçet's (on a study of Behçet's patients in China) were actually asymptomatic. I had zero GI symptoms -- no pain, no bloating, no anything. To say I was shocked when I came to from my scope is the understatement of the century. I didn't believe my doctor to the point she made me look at all the photos, it was literally insane.

All this is to say: GI Behçet's has physical findings that are biopsied and vague GI pain with no exam findings it not Behçet's, full stop. You are not the only person that has this misconception, I swear I see it on this sub in almost every post and I'm going to save this comment so I don't have to type this all out next time, haha. So don't take my comment personally by any means.

With that out of the way, this reads a lot like medical anxiety, especially where you freak out about having oral herpes. That's not a normal reaction to a relatively benign disorder! I advocate for you take a deep breath about everything.

Honestly, a lot of this just sounds like your other diagnosed disorders. I would not go into the doctor's mentioning and asking for Behçet's specific testing (it is never good to pigeon hole yourself into a corner and focus on one disease) but rather just air out the symptoms that bother you and let them take it from there. You might have a cold sore, you might also just have a pimple (I get pimples all the time where my lips and skin meet -- it's common, especially if you wear makeup or even chapstick).

Also, if its any comfort, I personally could not just ignore my mouth sores. I get dozens at a time, not one or two. I actually just started being able to eat food for the first time in over a month -- I lost 15 pounds with my most recent flare (and I didn't have 15 pounds to lose -- I'm barely 100lbs now) because I couldn't get anything in my mouth, it was awful and I'm happy to be on the other side.

If you absolutely want to know the test results that lead to my diagnosis:

1. rheumatological panel: rule out most diseases, but you should still have elevated inflammation markers, i.e. CRP and ESR (both of mine were very high).
2. low blood pressure -- the highest my BP has been all year is 74/48. I've fainted a lot and doing a lot of physical activity has been difficult.
3. iron, iron saturation, hemoglobin, RBC, hematocrit were all very, very low to the point of transfusions. My platelets were also elevated.
4. my vitamin A and carotene were almost 0, which signified GI Behçet's and some possible ocular involvement
5. elevated A1C and Glucose (a sign of Behçet's if you are a normal weight/BMI -- not one people know about, for whatever reason).
6. I had the highest fecal calprotectin my GI's office has ever seen, which is another way they knew they weren't dealing with something normal. We actually were worried about colon cancer at first, but then in hindsight, it was even too high for cancer (lol). (by high, I mean, normal range for this test is 0-49 and I had almost 7,000).
7. ETA: I forgot to include I also had incredibly low prealbumin. 

After the fecal calprotectin, I had the emergency scope where they took about 15 biopsies which lead to my diagnosis of Behçet's. I had to complete another exam known as an MRE after my scope, which sucked tbh, for hard proof it wasn't any sort of IBD (which we knew it wasn't based off of my symptoms and the appearance of the ulcers, but it is such a rare disease that its required to go through all the steps, even if borderline excessive). My MRE showed no signs of Crohn's or UC-related bowl inflammation, and thus everything became official.

One thing that you should feel comforted by: the research largely does not think Behçet's is genetic or inherited, so your cousin having it means absolutely nothing in relation to you having it. A lot of the research suggests some sort of post-viral type syndrome or other misfiring of a mechanism that has nothing to do with genetics -- no one is really sure, but genetics is largely considered to be mostly irrelevant with Behçet's.

You deserve an answer to your pain, but it does sound like you are hyper focusing on Behçet's since your cousin has it. I would recommend going to a doctor and just expressing the symptoms that are bothering you without pigeon-holeing yourself on Behçet's. Right now, it largely just sounds like its the bump on your mouth, so focus on that (and Behçet's is usually inside the body on the more sensitive membranes -- some sort of acne-like structures do appear for some patients, but on the edge of your mouth is very unlikely -- inside your mouth is more common).

Good luck!",1640995302

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require post titles to be more descriptive, to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics/Content`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

After a couple of weeks, I realized that I couldn’t stop thinking about it literally every day, and I recently found out my wife experienced the same thing, so the other day we threw it on almost to have on in the background and we both enjoyed it even more the second time around. I think it’s even better than Hill House (even though I prefer Hill House slightly more), the story is more mature and less melodramatic, it’s much more deeply disturbing but also beautiful. The monologues are admittedly a little egregious, but I actually like them and think they’re very well written and pretty though provoking. And Hamish Linklater’s performance is by far the best performance of the year, or the last several years in my opinion. 

I think a decent amount of people were slightly disappointed the same as we were when it first came out because they were looking for in-your-face horror like Hill House, but we got a much more subtle and disturbing experience instead.",1640995303

"pelotoncycle","t5_39us7","It sounds like you are talking about going to a combination shoe and pedal system.  In olden days, the pedals had a small cage and strap on them to hold your feet.  The cage was called a toe clip.  The toe-clip was made of steel at the time, (think of the word 'clip' like you would a hair clip, something flexible and springy) and these days usually plastic, which is what I believe is on your proform.  About 40 years ago shoe/pedal systems came on the scene, where the pedal has a spring mechanism built into it and the shoe has a cleat on the bottom.  These systems are called 'clipless' pedal systems because they no longer have the toe-clip and strap.  We still refer to the process of engaging them as clipping-in.   The pedal is called a pedal, and the thing on the bottom of the shoe is called a cleat.  The naming is extremely confusing because of the history, when you say 'I shall now clip in to my clipless pedals, they have no clips and I clip into them'. 

There are two main families of shoe and pedal clipless systems.  The ones that come standard on the Peloton are the 'road' variety, which use a large triangular plastic cleat and shoes with rigid, smooth soles not meant for walking.  The other main kind are called SPD shoes and pedals, and they have a small metal cleat and and shoes that can be walked in, intended for mountain bikes and commuters who need to mount and dismount a lot.  Both types are commonly used by Peloton users, and maybe your LBS can help you narrow down which system will best meet your needs and budget.",1640995304

2. Germany is investing a lot into green hydrogen technology so that they and other countries can store excess electricity. They are also increasing transmission capacity across the nation and its borders so that excess generation can be better sent where it is needed for pricing stability. 

3. I am yet to hear about any grid problems in Germany, if you have a source I’d love to look into that. Germany has been ranking well for grid stability the past few years. Most countries in Europe export excess energy and import deficiencies, that’s the whole point of interconnecting each respective grid. As the other countries develop wind capacity Germany will be developing storage capacity. This is part of the plan, and Germany plans to export storage technology to other countries.

"Shadowverse","t5_3c35m","Now that 2021 is over, I don't feel so sorry to say 2021 was arguably the worst year for this game.

I'll go over the 3 best/worst things about 2021:

**3rd Best: Comestics**

This year we got alt-art cards (not leaders), and the winners of the Popularity Poll now get extra stuff, like better animations and unique borders. Only at 3rd place because the 5th Popularity Poll was Waifuverse all over again.

**3rd Worst: 2nd Anime season**

Ok sure I can't judge it before it airs, but knowing how much of a trainwreck the 1st Season was, I simply can't see this in a good light, specially knowing these are resources they could've spent in the other flaws I'll mention later.

**2nd Best: The economy**

This game's economy was already great, but Cy manages to add something more each year, and 2021 was no exception. Even if I didn't like the 5th Anniversary for not bringing nothing new, it was a massive push for new players' economy, and effectively a free leader for everyone else. Even Christmas giveaways are better now than ever before iirc.

**2nd Worst: Mediocre metas**

I won't go in much detail, but both Rotation and Unlimited have been bad most of this year. Funnily enough Rotation's best metas were at the beggining of the year (even if mediocre) as DoV month 3 was a 2-deck meta, RC was a shitfest, and DoC was straight-up a balancing failure. Unlimited was the same mess as always, up until Cy rolled out arguably a ""Top 3 best nerfs ever"" (the Acceleratium restriction), which has made the last month surprisingly balanced, despite Unlimited's inherent flaws.

**1st Best: The story**

It is no surprise seeing this here. The Story with Rivayle and Vellsar has been the best this game has ever seen, and I can't add much more than what Dane already said. If anything, the only negative is not seeing the rest of the Original 8, but I'm sure we'll see them (hopefully not 1-by-1 with each one taking a whole yeat to go through).

**1st Worst: Lack of innovation**

This is a subtle, yet massive flaw Shadowverse has had for some time, but this year has been particularly obvious. There is pretty much no innovation, at all: there were no new card mechanics (apart from Skybound Arts, which is another name for Union Burst that flopped pretty hard, and it tecnically came out in December 2020), no new game modes, even the card variety has been extremely streamlined into very few archetypes, which has lead to OoS, the expansion with the least possible archetype variety arguably ever. There is no new nothing, and this is something Cy should work hard to fix, if they want to keep this game alive for many years to come.

**Best Honorable Mention: Promises of new stuff being worked on**

In the last Stream, when OoS was revealed, KMR himself was asked several questions. There he hinted towards extra Story for characters from certain cards (which imo sounds like ""now that we are closing RoB we'll move its storywritters to Shadowverse and make stuff there"", and that is pretty cool (unless it takes time from the Main Story)), and new game modes! Can only put it as an Honorable Mention since we haven't heard much about it since then.

**Worst Honorable Mention: Omen of Storms as a whole**

I've talked a lot about why the current expansion, Omen of Storms, is a mess. So I'll keep it short: 1-The lore still doesn't make sense and seems either rushed or half-baked 2-This is a ""support expansion"" that is entitely made to support current archetypes 3-Card balance is wack, many cards are trash while a few others are pretty damn overtuned, and there is little in-between 4-They cut half the UC cast lol (ok this is a biased one, but we still have no explanation why these 8 characters were chosen)

While there is good stuff to list, the bads heavily outshine the goods. Overall, 2021 hasn't been a good year for Shadowverse. Every other year beats it at either new stuff or better metas.

Hoping for 2022 being much better. There are reasons to hope (KMR's interview, Omens likely coming back on the Mini), and I want to believe. At the very least they made Unlimited much more bearable, returning it to its rightful place: a viable alternative to escape from bad Rotation metas, even if flawed. This alone will keep me playing.

But don't expect me to stop complaining about stuff! That's my particular hobby after all. Happy 2022 to y'all, including those in America (I'm going to sleep lol)!",1640995304

Because of my anger I threw water onto the ground hoping that it would inconvenience her having soggy socks. However she ended up slipping on the water and fell on her back instead. It made her live with years of back pain and she just recently had a back surgery to fix it. To put it in prospective I am now 25. #2 is that I am always thinking about suicide but the only thing that keeps me from doing it is the thought of how inconvenient it would be to my family to have to deal with the aftermath.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","A few things:
1) UK GDP fell because of lockdown not because of let it rip. 
2) Dare I say you are over egging the pudding here. Again, long Covid for vaccinated people and omicron appears to be much less of an issue than it was on 2020
3) most people have been fully vaxxed in the past 3-4 months, which means a booster now doesn’t really add much of a difference. Unless you want people to get boosted a mere month or two after their final shot? 
4) again with the long Covid, no data to suggest this is an issue with omicron. And yes, omicron is much less severe than Delta. That is a fact now. 
5) past infections do offer protection against severe illness, what you posted is just plain false and dangerously scaremongering.
6) more of a political party broadcast which perhaps speaks more of your intentions 
7) the vast vast majority of people who catch Covid are fine after a few day. 
8) not with omicron, sorry but it’s not possible to do that anymore. Your dreaming. 
9) unless your propose to lockdown the entire world, new variants are inevitable. But new variants are usually milder. Again you are scaremongering 
10) so how does it end because you didn’t answer that question? Lockdown forever is not an end game.
11) unless chemo is worse then the cancer…
Lockdowns at this stage will do very little and will cause more harm than good. I can tell you don’t have family abroad.",1640995305

Other games have done all of this. I understand this sounds aggressive, but it's very hard to convey tone through written word. All I'm getting at is the magic of BotW isn't in any of the features or what you can do. It's that it makes you want to explore and unfold the world.

The problem for me is the story is too minimalistic and the lack of themed dungeons. that's not what I want in a Zelda game and every time I pick it up I end up turning it off and playing a different Zelda game. Those games make you want to explore and discover as well but with a more focused story and imo a far better gameplay loop due to the themed dungeons.",1640995305

\- Lack of SBMM. This pits really good players against much lesser skilled players. Imagine Lebron vs a toddler. That should never be a match.

\- Lack of dedicated servers. This means that, if you're not the host of the match (this would take a while to explain, bear with me), you'll have more lag/disadvantage towards other players.

\- No one wants to have fun anymore. Most of the players that endure this nonsense PVP we got are sweat lords. No hate on them, but do you REALLY have to use meta loadouts in QP? Do you REALLY have to play like it's trials game 7 and teabag after each kill on a blueberry in Control?

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Does lower quality mean ugly? If you concede that intentionally making it ugly means that it could have been beautiful, then that serves the point that there is always beauty even in ugliness. 

Also, there's a large valley of ""could"".

I have no idea the artistic ability of Pepe's creator, but I imagine it's probably not capable of producing a whole lot higher quality.

I think you are referring more to Picasso, who certainly could paint in the classical style, and so you're wondering why he chose to paint in cubist and surreal style, which you call ugly. Like Pepe it shows exaggerated expressions that clearly evoke the feelings it is trying to convey. As do most of these cartoons.

That's why people identify with them. People can relate to ""feels good man"", which is immediately recognized in that image, not necessarily to a cartoon frog.

That's just a style choice. It's not meant to portray realism. Even what you call ""cute"" anime style is not realistic- which you called neither beautiful nor ugly, so I think we are talking about something else besides beauty and ugliness.",1640995305

1. Notice how the man always jumps back to his position exactly behind the elephants leg - every single time, without fail.
2. Also notice the stiffness of the elephants trunk once he is positioned with the brush, it goes from lose and organic, to stiff, to me this indicate that the man have some sort of contraption behind the elephants trunk that we don't see, which he uses to guide the nose carefully to draw the outlines.

A contraption like that is easy to make, all you need is some sticks and hinges, you'll have to have a ""locking mechanism"" to lock the hinges in place, but if you observe when the ""elephant draws"" the entire nose/trunk becomes stiff and not flexible anymore, that indicates to me at least that the ""trunk has been locked"" by the contraption.

That's my tinfoil hat theory anyway.

\*Edit\* Also towards the end , you can watch the mans shorts totally in sync with the elephants drawing movements, indicate that he guides him somehow, maybe he's simply using his hand behind the trunk of the elephant.",1640995306

I have to say though,while I understand the concern about the possibility, I find it hard to believe that RC would be lending out shares. 

Personally, (and I have made no secret about this,) I find his lack of DRS to likely be a result of either a mistrust of Computershare, him knowing that there is something coming that will make it unnecessary, or some combination of both of those.

I can't even remember the ""cheating act"", I can't remember what happened and how and now I have to deal with two separate things:
1. Feeling violated because my body was touched by someone else, pictures where taken of me, even videos, without my consent (although my alter consented to this shit).
2. The only man I ever loved can't trust me. I'm scared to close my eyes, I'm surpressing my alters because I don't want to be with anyone but him. I'm even scared to sleep.

Please give him a chance to at least explain himself. And if you decide to leave, maybe be his friend. It hurts like a mother fucker to lose your only person because of your alters.",1640995307

"QuickSwap","t5_3riys3","1. If you like dual rewards, then just put 50% in dQUICK and 50% in Syrup. Nothing changes for you.
2. Why would getting more people into QUICK create manipulation, even if it did, are you suggesting we try to slow QuickSwap growth and adoption because you're worried someone might come manipulate, that is poor logic. 
3. Yes they would be aligned with project because they would be holding QUICK, so they would want to act in the best interest of QUICK, just like any other project
4. If you want QUICK to have utility in games and other DeFi, then that's exactly why you should vote yes on this. Projects like QiDao, Aave, etc won't use dQUICK because very few people will go lock up dQUICK and earn only 40% + Aave lower APYs if they can instead choose dQUICK + Syrup for 100%+. If we separate, now people can get 100%+ + Aave rewards, or minting MAI, or getting other rewards from gaming, DeFi etc. It's really a simple choice. There is no consequence other than people won't be FORCED to farm Syrup any more. They can farm dQUICK for similar APY, with no active management, and the yield farming, hardcore degen farmers can still use Syrup and compound or hold or sell for QUICK or whatever their strategy is. 

tldr: This only gives more choice, instead of forcing you to use 1 strategy. You can use MANY different strategies now including the one you are already using if you just put 50 50 or 60 40 or 20 80 or whatever %'s you want in dQUICK and Syrup. Easy.",1640995307

I'd take Halo Infinite and FH5 over both and anything ps plus has right now. They were also available on launch day. Another downside to ps plus is you have to claim the monthly games or you miss out which is stupid as hell.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Just became single after six years. I'm 26. I hopped on Bumble for the first time a few weeks into the breakup and I got a lot of matches and a bunch of potential dates. But it feels so hollow. 

Some girl with huge tits gave me her snap and sent a topless pic the same day, but I know she sent it to five other dudes and I just saw she's in California even though she lives in PA like me. Riding that cock carousel. Imagine if I fell for the tits, and gave her all kinds of compliments and shit just trying to get in her pants.

When I realized that hot girls will always be out there, and always be available to a guy who keeps his shit straight, it absolutely blasted my codependent mindset. 

I'm on my own now, I'm moving into my own apartment and getting serious about my career and future, and now instead of being sad at home, wishing I had a girl to hold, I'm like ""fuck that high maintenance shit, I don't have time to try and impress bitches on dates. I have shit to do.""

Most of NCT owes WayV some really nice presents. Especially the ones who didn't know WayV stands for ""we are your vision"". 

Johnny and Jaehyun are the worst offenders. Ten wouldn't be happy. 😂Sungchan was pretty slow answer vision too. That team would have been in really trouble without Jeno.

"comingout","t5_2rw9q","TW: suicide discussed

&gt;I'm gonna be honest why does humanity make problems where there are no problems.

There are.  Oh there are so many.  Me being gay spiraled into self-loathing, immense stress, and several nights spent crying, even considering death.  And that is just me.  Some of my other friends have had even worse problems to the point of going to therapy for months.

There is so much hate to LGBT people, partially due to politics and religion.  Many people see LGBT people as flamboyant or obtrusive.  Sure, there are plenty of people in the ""scene"" per say.  But then there are people like me who are just trying to live a life like anyone else.  People are diverse.

&gt;It's unnecessary because you just be you and if people have a problem with it, fine.

No, it is not fine.  I am not putting up with getting fired, getting kicked out to the street, or getting my rights taken away.  People can have their opinions, that is fine.  But I need not respect the hate they give me.  I can brush away opinions.  I can't brush away the laws or decisions made from those opinions.

&gt;I've been bullied my entire life for being right and I don't need some therapy that they offer me at school.

Not everyone is as strong as you.  And not everyone is as lucky as you.  Everyone suffers and takes bullying differently.  I'm a fairly strong person and I refuse therapy out of the stigma and serious family problems it would give me.

As I mentioned before, some of my friends had therapy and it was not of their own volition.  They could have lost their lives.  Society should provide resources.

&gt;It's okay to be gay, lesbian, non binary, that's not other people's business, but don't like make it official like a song or something.

It's very difficult to ""not make my sexuality official.""  I can't marry a woman and be happy with it.  But a large chunk of the population still wishes I would be stoned for marrying a man.

Until we achieve equal rights and basic human levels of respect from society, my sexuality will be official.

&gt;Anyways all I'm trying to say is that if you don't want to be called names, don't make your life official. This isn't only meant for all of you but for all the other clichés. Have a nice day and Happy New Year.

This is how I see this conclusion:

*All I'm saying is that if you don't want to be discriminated against or bullied, lie about who you are.  Be a fake person and never live your life.  Follow society like a good little sheep and never step out of line.  You're overblowing your struggles.*

I don't know if you are LGBT or have had any similar kind of struggle.  Maybe you have, maybe you haven't.  But that doesn't change the fact that being LGBT is not widely accepted in the world

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","&gt;Yes it does, if you read anything relating to Star Wars they had rules in place for hyperspace so as to prevent this

I""ve read a lot of Star Wars books and played the old West End RPG and have never seen anything saying they had rules against this.

Can you present some proof that they had rules against this?

In SWTOR the Star Wars MMO you even come across a planet using a Mass Driver ie Launching asteroids into Hyperspace to destroy their enemies.   It is stopped.

&gt;just imagine what an x wing would do. Nothing can survive a light speed ram.

Yeah if this wasn't a movie you would be right.  But if you want to bring real world physics into there can't be a giant space slug in space.  Han and Leia can't walk out into the vaccum of space wearing only breathing masks and talk about how much moisture there is.

You are trying to cherry pick here.  If you want to bring in real world physics and apply them to Star Wars then none of it would be real.   If you want to go by Star Wars rules and the canon it has set up then Hyperspace ramming works.

I'm looking over your discussion you have had here with other people and it's interesting that when you are faced with evidence from the movies even from the Original Trilogy you just shake your head and say that's not possible.

What you are doing is the definition of conformation bias.  It's clear you don't like TLJ and have decided that even when presented with proof that it doesn't break lore you are willing to ignore the lore just to keep your opinion.

You dont' have to like The Last Jedi, but to hate it because you think it broke Star Wars canon is just silly.   This is like hating McDonalds food because you think the McDonalds arch is blue instead of gold.",1640995311

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;Every ""experience"" belongs to somebody. It makes no sense to speak of just ""experience"" absent a subject.

Or some thing, don't forget. Trees, plants, non-human consciousnesses etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The brain is the lump of grey matter inside your skull. If you want to know more, pick up a neuroscience or a psychology text. Your ignorance is not an argument, Jeff.  
For the purposes of this argument, physical can be defined as ""made of ordinary matter"", ie atoms.

Does this imply that consciousness is physical, made up of atoms? If so, why can we not locate where it is? The father of psychology, William James, spoke about the cosmic consciousness. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The first is that we are currently able to scan people's brains to such a degree that we should be able to replicate them. We aren't even close to being able to do this. So concluding that physicalism is false is quitting way too early. It would be like abandoning early efforts in computing because they weren't able to run Crysis

Agreed, we're still wayyyy far off from being able to do anything like that, so it's equally a mistake to conclude physicalism is true. Best we can say is ""we don't know"". 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This would only follow if I was somehow able to ""simulate"" an entire other person's brain in my brain. But humans clearly don't have the cognitive capacity for this, or heck, even to hold a single brain-state of another person in our own.

We live in a world of paradoxes, a primary one in this discussion being that we use our own brains to try to understand our own brains. Some people may draw more conclusions than they should from the fact that humans have limited cognitive capacity, yet it's still very important to always acknowledge our limited capacity. William James talked about ""ineffability"" which is the product of our limited brains (consciousnesses?) and limited language.",1640995311

&gt; I thought this video was really interesting and informative, but there was a lot of misunderstandings.

&gt; First: Scott Joplin and Duke Ellington are western composers. I have no idea how you could possibly claim they aren't, or that they don't fit neatly within western music theory. Schenkarian Analysis absolutely applies to them.

&gt; He puts them in comparison to bach, beethoven, and mozart, and implies this is about race. It's about time, not race (after all, he could have thrown up pictures of Bartok, Stravinsky, John Cage, and they're all white men too). Bach Beethoven and Mozart are all early composers who did simpler harmony in their music. So we learn simple stuff before we get to newer, more complex things. This way we learn the sort of evolution of western music theory over the years as part of music theory. Maybe that's not the best way to learn it practically, and maybe we can do it better. But there is pedagogical logic there. And not recognizing that logic is not helpful to his point.

&gt; Second, when western people in western circles talk about music theory, they're talking about western music theory. If someone's like ""hey what are some ways to learn music theory"", and you give people a primer on indian classical, gamelan theory, and chinese opera and they're just going to be like ""yea this isn't what I'm looking for."" This is a fair assumption in western circles. This is not actually an interesting point, and he makes a such a big deal out of it.

&gt; Third, claiming that western music theory is ethnocentric is... rather strange, isn't it? Like is he going to go to a european history class and whine about how it's all about white people? I think he would have a stronger point if maybe he talked about how it's German-centric or Eastern-European-centric, ignoring Italian, French, Spanish theories and such. Maybe that doesn't fit in a video about white supremacy, but he doesn't seem to have an issue bringing up things about class and gender here.

&gt; Fourth, he seems to mix up American and European quite a bit here, which is why we generally talk about ""western"" music theory. Like he'll say ""European music"" and then talk about Americans.

&gt; Fifth, he talks about how music theory is used to declare certain things genius and amazing. This may be the way certain theorists or hack article writers thought about things, but this is not the way music theory is taught. I personally have never seen a theory teacher talk about showing genius through theory. The usefulness of music theory is the ability to accurately describe the music. I've learned music theory from various teachers, and none of them have ever claimed that you can show music is good or bad based on it. It is purely descriptive.

&gt; In the sense of being descriptive, this is why we are taught it's objectivity. The reality is that it is more-or-less objective within the model of western music theory. But that's fine, because that's what we are talking about. It's not as if people are being taught to do Schenkarian Analysis on Chinese Opera, because that would be stupid.

&gt; Sixth, the primer on Schenker was kind of insane. Like a lot of laymen have not heard of Schenker. You can't just talk about how he's a nazi piece of shit, all of music theory is based on it, and therefore music theory is white supremacist. At the very least, he needs to give a better description of Schenkarian Analysis as to why we use it. There have been plenty of music theorists over the years and a lot have come up with their own western music theories and their own notations. We use Schenker because it's one of the best tools on how to visualize the way we hear layers in the melodies and harmonies in music.

&gt; Seventh, there is western theory of rhythm. I do think there is a huge overemphasis on harmony in western music theory, but there is western theory of rhythm too.",1640995315

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Aqui no Rio têm uns ônibus chamados BRT, onde dá pra entrar e sair por sua porta traseira. Eu, sozinho, ia saltar naquele ponto, tava esperando colado na porta. Umas 30 cabeças apareceram pra entrar. Esperaram ou deixaram eu sair? Não, vieram na covardia e na bestialidade me empurrando pra dentro e a porta ficou toda congestionada. O ônibus tava quase vazio, era óbvio que eu ia saltar ali.

Nos Metrôs é parecido. Esperam o povo sair e deixam o centro da porta liberado enquanto esperam nas laterais? Não, competem com quem sai pelo centro e fica aquela sacanagem na meiuca, ruim pra sair e pra entrar.

Acaba em ambos os casos demorando significantemente mais tempo e sendo bruto, desrespeitoso, incivilizado.

Either way though my point is that it's naive at best to pretend that Defi solves any of the flaws in these systems...  Defi as it exists right now is rich people not wanting to sell their assets that they expect to grow in value long term, so they put them up as collateral so they can borrow against them.

Best part about the whole thing, because it's a loan it isn't income.

I guess my point is, if your really happy about the benefits of Defi, you probably don't care about your credit score because your doing just fine anyways.

Defi is not helping a struggling mother convince a perspective landlord they will be able to pay rent next month... at least not any more than a bank statement with the same amount of collateral will. To borrow your example its not going to help you negotiate a new job, and you likely wouldn't want to use it if it could, as crypto is far from private and giving a list of your exact assets on the blockchain might make it harder to negotiate a higher salary.

Defi is actually very limited when it comes to what it can do... its great for people who are already vested in crypto who want to borrow against those assets to either invest in other perspective projects (leverage), or to live life... but pretty much every project that tries to add real world assets into the mix tends to hit a brick wall.",1640995316

"news","t5_2qh3l","Ohh please, you are so full of shit. 

It's not even remotely the same well.  Also, good AI programmers on games are almost never in the same league as ML developers and researchers working on real self driving.  They are still using a lot of the same hack techniques that have been used for 20 years to make scripted AI sequences.  Almost no one in games is using ML even at a basic level for something like cars in games.

As always, your lack of understanding of the differences is beyond laughable.

You also once again fail to understand how ML works and how it makes decisions relative to humans.  I will take a trained AI any day over a human when it comes to trying to avoid a deadly accident. 

You talk about the common scenario of a driver cutting someone off and possibly resulting in an accident.  In this scenario a human is almost always surprised and needs to make a split decision with limited or no data.  On the other end, even the shitty AI in my Tesla without the FSD computer power on autopilot has regularly slowed down and backed off when it noticed a driver doing something that may result in them jumping in front of me that I couldn't even see.  Thereby it avoided even getting into a situation where a decision had to be made in the first place.

Your inability or lack of desire to acknowledge that computers can avoid scenarios before they need a life or death decision to be made is one of the many reasons why you are failing here.

The other is Dunning-Krueger.",1640995317

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I think I see where you’re coming from and I think it’s a fair question of “how much is enough for it to count?”. I personally always try to buy what’s being harvested locally to reduce supply chain issues, etc. But I think your question is (rightfully) asking about the larger movement in theory, which I can’t speak to as I’m not the spokesperson for veganism but this is how I see it, at least.

It’s true that we (humans) could improve pretty much every aspect of our food production systems, but the massive global demand for food raises a lot of challenges. So short of killing off half the planet or completely restructuring our global economy and food production, I believe the single best thing you can do to prevent the external costs of large-scale agriculture is to live a vegan lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. If someone says they are concerned about the effects of large-scale agriculture, but continues to consume animal products then they’re just logically and/or morally inconsistent. 

In summary: veganism is the easiest and most effective thing you can do every day to solve/alleviate the problems you’re concerned about, short of collecting the infinity stones. Being conscious of these issues and putting in effort to still support the part of agriculture that is objectively the most harmful when you could (in almost every case) easily not, is what makes me rank vegetarians as lower than carnists on my morality scale™️.",1640995317

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 35 letters.**

"adventofcode","t5_3b3wa","[check my solution](https://github.com/Fadi88/AoC/blob/master/2021/day19/code.py)  


the idea here is you dont need to do all possible combinations of rotation and check.  
you simply get rotation invariant property (the absolute distance in between each point in every scanner) and if two points in two scanners have at least 11 common distances we know that those 2 points match.  


The next step is to get the center of gravity of 1st scanner and 2nd scanner and shift everything to it, which will result in something like p\_x\_s\_y (a,b,c) and p\_z\_s\_t(-b,a,-c) for example because the rotations are 90 degrees   
from that, we can deduce that this is the rotation formula, apply that to all points in s\_t   
then the difference in 3 directions after rotation (dx,dy,dz) is basically the translation between two scanners s\_y and s\_t and also the relative location between the two sensors (needed for step 2)",1640995319

There are no recommended settings other than to go with whatever you like. What looks best in your eyes is the best choice unless you use it for work that requires accurate settings, the you should go for the sRGB mode.

Also for the overdrive - setting 3 is the best for everything. 

HDMI and Displayyport doesn't matter. If you use the cable included with the monitor and HDMI with the Nvidia RTX 3000 series or AMD RX 6000 series then your should be able to get the best experience as those video cards only support HDMI 2.1 (4K at 120hz). If you wish to get the best experience with consoles, use the HDMI cable.

Only use display cable if you have an older gen PC Video card :)

I guess my issue is knowing what to eat that still allows me to feel healthy. I have tried calorie counting but have been unable to stick with it so far. 

I climb 2-3 times a week and don’t think I could physically do more than that right now.

Got them for 50$ (as a pair) brand new off amazon way back in the day, the old green-light style rather than these new orange ones that I hear keep breaking on everyone.  Mine are still in great shape, eventually had to snip the wires for the LED lights since they bug the hell out of me, but they're accurate and have never failed on me.  


It blows my mind that just in the past few years the price of gaming peripherals has more than quadrupled all around.  These joysticks that I essentially got for 25$ each are now nearly 100$ a piece.  ""better"" joysticks can run up to 500-600$ each.  Side consoles, yokes, etc. are all just as expensive.  


I don't know what caused the huge increase, but I get the feeling demand went up and supply went down from 2019-current and the industry manufacturers just never could keep up.  With covid lockdowns it seems a lot more people are getting into flight sims, not just SC but MSFS/Xplane/Etc., and these simpit setups have become crazy popular.",1640995321

Edit: Since /u/krautbammer asked...

Alabama only scored 27 points, and our Heisman-winning QB threw for just 181 yards (easily a season low) and his fourth-lowest completion percentage.  Our stud wide receiving got held to 62 yards receiving with no touchdowns.  We played most of the game with a back-up RG.  We were -1 in the turnover margin.

And we won by 21 points.

Brian Robinson had a career-high 204 rushing yards on 7.8 yards per carry as the team rushed for a season-high 301 yards.  Ja'Corey Brooks stepped up with John Metchie hurt, hauling in 4 catches for 66 yards and 1 TD.  Slade Bolden had 3 receptions for 31 yards, one going for a first down on third down, the other being a touchdown.  Jahleel Billingsley and Cameron Latu each had a catch, the former for a first down the latter for a touchdown.  

Meanwhile, the defense was dominant.  Cincinnati was averaging 39.2 points/game, 9th in the country.  We kept them out of the endzone and held them to 6 points, 3 in each half.  They had just 218 yards, a season-low.  We got 6 sacks and 8 TFL.  Desmond Ridder completed just 53% of his passes (season-low) for 144 yards (second-lowest of the season) with a 90.9 passer rating (season-low).  We had 6 PBUs.

It wasn’t a very sexy game, but that was a dominant win against - as much shit I gave them for playing a crap schedule - a good team.",1640995321

But that nothing to do with getting better... 

Our conditions may not ""get better"" but we as people will. Our lives will. The impact we have on others will.

Similar to how Jimi Hendrix learned to play a guitar upside down because he was left handed, you will learn to live the ADHD way.  

Run a bath, eat some good food, verbally congratulate yourself for being so well-liked by a company that they offered to interview you for another position (im a recruitment consultant so i appreciate more than most how rare that is). Promise yourself that if you do have ADHD that you will take full accountability and be your number 1 advocate. 

Do that and you'll be better than you've been. 

Trust me. 

It sucks that you didnt get the job but to be honest, youre clearly going through a tough time. No matter how much you hide it, that is going to seep through in your interviews. The more you try to resist the pain your feeling, the more you will dampen the glow of your talent. 

Just give yourself a minute to sit back, compose yourself and work from the outside in. 

It will help, i promise. And look, if you need to chat I'm here. As i said, im a recruitment consultant and i work in a veeeery competitive market. Im happy to offer advice if needed.",1640995324

Lots of people with schizophrenia have auditory and visual hallucinations that seem 100% real. Would you say that the medical explanation for them is wrong too?

It's just so much more difficult to believe than the medical explanation for sleep paralysis.",1640995324

"lyftdrivers","t5_30lxq","As an experienced passenger and driver on both platforms, maybe some of this will help:

If one shows drivers significantly closer to you than the other, choose the one which has closer drivers. Drivers really prefer driving less to get to you because the trip to you and the trip from you to the next ride are entirely uncompensated unless we cancel you.

If it’s all the same, use Lyft. Set up Delta or Hilton rewards earning, and back it with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and you’re getting quite a bit back. Lyft Pink adds discounts, also.

I generally find Lyft drivers to be better than Uber drivers, but this can be really hit or miss.

The BEST would be to look for alternative rideshare services — Empower has been mentioned recently, your area might have something similar which is based on fair compensation.

When prices are surging, use Uber. Drivers get their pay scaled based on demand, Lyft drivers do not. If a $50 ride is $200, and either driver normally makes $20 on the ride, the Lyft driver is going to still make $20 at a 4.0 surge typically, while the Uber driver is going to make $80. If there’s a substantial price disparity, book the cheaper one.

With airports in particular, Lyft and Uber do weird pricing things. Look closely at the prices for premium products. I’ve seen Lyft X rides that cost more than the Lyft Lux Black XL. Take the better product every time— if you need to expense it, grab a screenshot to show it was a reasonable decision.

I’m never driving anything under XL and Lux at the airport, but I’m always going to handle your luggage. I insist on it, frankly, and while I’m happy you appreciate the service, I prefer my immaculate and very expensive SUV not be damaged.

I appreciate that you tip — as a driver, I’d have to unmatch you by rating you 3* or less (ride profitability determines my ratings, primarily) from Lyft every time and Uber most of the time if you did not. 

Business rides— my company allows me to tip 20% on every ride, and I do so religiously. Personal rides— 20% is a good baseline, but I will go slightly higher or lower (say a range of 15% to 50%) based on the service element and how much I’d like to see that driver again. The lower tips are going to those I have to 3* or below, which again will unmatch you from seeing that driver ever again.

In practice, within the US, 90% of my rides end up on Lyft. 

If you want to assure higher levels of service, ultimately you’ll need to take higher level service rides. If service is super important because I have a client or girlfriend with me, I’m booking a Lyft Black or Lyft Black XL (Lyft allows non livery drivers on their platform, and they are far less jaded and more likely to be driving something better than a several year old base trim Suburban). During Covid, my company tolerates me taking XL or Black XL for every ride. When Covid is peaking, I’m either renting a car or taking Black XL every time. Lux is typically closer to Black, but XL is typically closer to Regular rideshare.",1640995324

"EtsySellers","t5_2wthr","Hi there! The jewelry market is highly saturated on Etsy. Unfortunately, believing in yourself (while important for your state or mind in retail) is not enough to guarantee success on Etsy. The list of things you will need to do to make your first sales can be somewhat daunting and seem endless, but once you get into the rhythm of how to create a listing that sells, you will find success.

The most important things to consider before you list anything: 

1. Photos must be clear, comprehensive, and comparable to similar bestselling items on Etsy. Photos must also clearly show the size of the object as well as all relavent angles. This will ensure you are able to compete from the start.

2. The item description must be comprehensive and answer most if not all potential buyers' questions while considering legibility, brevity of language, and buyer encouragement.

3. Multi-word tags are crucial. A tag such as ""bracelet"" is poor. ""Beaded bracelet"" is more specific, but might not be how people word their searches. To catch potential buyers in search, you will need to optimize your tags for what people are searching for when people are searching for a product similar to yours. Erank is a good tool for this. Without this step, you probably won't make any sales.

4. Pricing, shipping, and fees are important to consider. I have never bought a physical product for $5 on Etsy, especially not jewelry. Value based pricing is important. You should consider the value of your product to your customer rather than how much work or effort you need to make it. First-Class USPS shipping costs a minimum of $3. That's 60% of your product price. Want to offer free shipping? Now you're giving Etsy your money to sell products at a loss. Calculate how much material and time costs are for you, and make sure that after all fees and costs are considered, you are still turning a profit.",1640995325

In Dr. Patterson’s theory, monocytes were shown to contain Spike. Monocytes can have any number of antigens inside because their job is to eat antigens. 

Monocytes aren’t being destroyed because of low CCL4. 

Whether the monocytes contain Spike and/or the ACE2 occupying imposter, they’re still irritating the endothelium and the mode of destruction (in the absence of adequate CCL4) would be the same, i.e. break the fractalkine bond between the monocytes and the endothelium.

It doesn’t sound like your SO has any plans to stop what he’s doing, and you can’t live like that. It’s not fair to you or your children. I was previously married and not happy, but always felt guilty for leaving for fear of what it would do to my child to have to split time between his parents now and never have us together again. Take it from me, you just have to leave if you’re not happy. Children adapt, especially the younger they are. Your SO sounds like a very selfish man, and you deserve better than that. You deserve someone that will adore your baby body and tell you how beautiful you are. I have that now so I know there are men out there that don’t feel the same way as your husband.

YouTube is both helpful, yet can be discouraging because solutions seem so simple, but I fail to fully execute them.

Progress takes a frustrating amount of time in frustratingly small chunks, but when you compare things month to month, you can see more differences in progress. 

I know I’ve also hurt myself by trying to change too much at once versus trying to tackle my game one step at a time. Trying to change my footwork, grip, and follow through all at one turned my form into a sloppy mess rather than helping it. 

I’ve been trying to develop my forehand and I still will throw every other one on a hard anhyzer into the ground.

Stupid means your brain doesn't work. Ignorant means you do not know needed information.

You are not educated enough to understand what people are saying. You don't have the foundation of understanding of things like economic history and economic legislation and income inequality and the effects of citizens united and the reality of what our country is.

You're making a personal argument without the ability to compare your circumstances to others because you only know your circumstances and these aren't common sense things these are things we didn't know until people studied it.

That's why I and possibly others are frustrated with you. You're not an idiot. You're just like a decade behind in the education needed to participate in a discussion that crosses multiple academic disciplines",1640995327

He goes on to talk about it like he’s explaining it to someone that’s never heard of it. I still don’t know.

I do know that a lot of people play a victim role as a grift and they know exactly what they’re doing. I’d call that narcissistic maybe but I wouldn’t say they’re NPD. These people remind of the guy wearing a barrel and who hits himself on the head with pan at the medieval fair. They’re putting on a show for attention. 

The irony in creating a new construct for people that create new disorders is like I’m watching the Onion. I don’t know if this video is a troll post but I’ll have a laugh when I see someone use interpersonal victimhood construct disorder.

Beaming specials to death still requires a bit of time, and if you get interrupted while doing it, you have to start all over. Same with bolt staff. Coruscation on the other hand, is instantaneous damage. It trades range for this, but of course if it didn't it would be OP. Also, beam staff isn't higher elite dps than corus, and it's only better monster damage on BW. But in any case, do you exclusively play Sienna with bolt and beam because the others are bad at sniping? That's just sad.

&gt; It's better to kill a special before it even gets to your group than being able to kill it quickly when it is in melee range

Right, but that's just not always an option. In fact, it's the situations where that's not an option that will more often result in wipes. If you can see the special coming and still get wiped, you need to work on your positioning.",1640995331

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","It's important to emphasize that the differences are getting lessened as time goes on. 

In general tho, revolvers are more reliable with different types of ammo. 

Semi-auto pistols rely on the power of a shot to cycle reliably. If you're firing a lighter load, it can cause stoppages, and some bullet shapes don't feed reliably in some semi-auto actions. 

Revolvers are also a bit simpler to operate. No safety, no magazine catches, no slide stops, etc. Reloading may be slower, but that's a trade off

They can also handle larger types of ammo. A .44 magnum would take a pretty bulky semi-auto pistol to fire. A revolver in this case is easier to deal with.

Over all, I'd say a revolver is a pretty reliable self-defense sidearm.",1640995331

Ronaldo offers you a goal in most games although your teams suffers a bit due his lack of defensive efforts.

If you are mid tier team why wouldn't you take those odds where you win/draw most games(since you score atleast 1 goal) against lower tier teams and only lose to top 4-5 teams. Where ending up 6-7 is an achievement in itself. 

If on the other hand, you want to challenge for the title you cannot afford a draw. Look at chelsea and liverpool, they are both almost out of the race because they lost/drew their last 3 games giving man city the space to run with the title.",1640995331

My entire post WAS applying the IRL rules, and why he would skate around them if he DID exist.  Then i went the extra mile to say that the reason the IRL rules arent designed to expose a Bullseye is because people like Bullseye do not and have never existed

"superman","t5_2qrwe","That was a great comic, wasn't it? But it is ambiguous if Barry let him win.

The extent to which Flash might have gone easy on Superman is called into question by that series' juxtaposition with Superman's more famous response to the question of if Batman could beat him. Superman says he'd let Batman win, because it would mean a lot to him. In proximity to such a claim, isn't it logical that, especially with Luthor's pride and an orphanage at stake, Flash might think the same way as Superman does?

Superman says, ""I ran faster than he did,"" as the only explanation. Not that he ran faster than Flash could. And unlike some of the other races I described above, this one was explicitly for the cameras- it was important that Superman be *seen* to outrace Flash.

So while that comic is truly phenomenal, I don't know if I consider it the best example of a race where Superman beats Flash.",1640995331

Unfortunately, sometimes enemy combatants will either hide among civilians or else use civilians in some of their operations, either as human shields or suicide bombers or bio warfare etc. So in those cases civilians have to be engaged (hopefully non-lethally) in order to figure out who's who. This happened back in Vietnam, but the media skewed and twisted the story into US Marines just senselessly killing people en masse. The reality is that US forces were continually being killed by Viet Cong and also Vietnamese civilians, so we had to engage both.

He’s said that he found the question invasive and so gave a sarcastic response… which is what went viral.

**AITA for taking a lot of free samples because I was hungry and they didnt give a limit on how many you could take?**

I was at the mall yesterday and in front of this food market there was a lady giving out free samples of this snack. So I took one and it was really good, but the snack was quite expensive and I'm poor asf. At that point I was already walking away but a few mins later I decided to go back to get another sample.

I took another piece off the little plate. Then I saw that no one was behind me, so I took a few more, and the lady became annoyed and said that I shouldn't take too many. The thing is, they can't possibly be running out since they refill the plate constantly with more pieces. And no one was behind me. I said that well you don't have a limit on how many I could take, and you're obviously not running out any time, and I'm not hogging since no one is lining up behind  me, so what's the problem here. I took the rest and she said that she's not going to serve me anymore if I come back and I think that's bs given that this defeats the point of FREE samples

As I have said, because of the words you use and how you talk about it, it is clear you want it not to exist.

&gt;I'm sorry that you're too naive to understand the gravitas of exploitation and abuse present in the porn industry and sex industry overall.

And how have you come to that conclusion? because I don't think ""most"" women are trafficked or abused? because you haven't proven that.

&gt;I'm unsure why you are so adamant about defending it and that's probably something you should reflect over yourself

See more shaming language showing you think its something unethical.

&gt;It's a generally known fact that the majority of women in the sex industry are mistreated.

Is it? where is the evidence for that? (and don't quote that BS website again)

&gt;The very fact that one of the articles posits the question of whether there even is such a thing as 'ethical porn' should give you some idea of what the actual situation is.

By a website that thinks its an unethical thing and wants it gone and so will post articles that agree with their own views (confirmation bias)

&gt;You still haven't provided any evidence to support your claims.

I don't need to your the one adamant that ""most"" women are effected and are yet to provide any evidence.

Consider giving yourself a break and just trying to enjoy little things. I’m not saying it will cure your depression or any of your other mental illnesses, but if you plan on staying alive a little longer you might as well get some enjoyment out of it!

I’m literally in the same boat down to my age lol so I understand where you are coming from. I’m sorry some people on the internet don’t sympathize with your situation, but regardless of anyone’s opinion on it just remember it IS valid. 

Obviously it isn’t easy to continue participating in the rats race when you have extra weight on your shoulders, so maybe consider not putting any extra weight on them by having this expectation of doing something “important” with your life 

Idk, I’m just sharing thoughts that have come up in my own inner dialogue when I think about similar topics. Honestly the only things me alive right now are my boyfriend and some video games I’ve always wanted to play :) 

It’s crazy to think about the fact that for some of us years of therapy, tons of support, and several rounds of many different antidepressants don’t make a difference. In a way your post made me feel seen and less alone. Even if it was just momentary, I want to reciprocate that by reminding you that you don’t have to do anything extraordinary to make your life count.

At my price point of C$1,500 or thereabouts, I either get a mirrorless camera with no lens, plus an adapter -- at which point I have to attach my old lenses on the camera, and it isn't significantly lighter than my old camera anyways -- and the sensor is the same APS-C, 20,9 Mpx sensor that I would get in the D7500. Or I get the D7500 kitted out with its 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6g VR lens. And the battery life is still amazing. So I don't see why I would want to go mirrorless really.",1640995334

Let’s recap some playoff results:

- 2019, Notre Dame. #3 seed. Only managed 3 points against 2nd seed Clemson. Game lost.

- 2018, Clemson. #1 seed. Only managed 6 points against 4th seed Alabama. Game lost.

- 2017, Washington. #4 seed. Only managed 7 points against 1st seed Alabama. Game lost.

- 2017, Ohio State. #3 seed. Put up a whopping ZERO, I repeat ZERO points against 2nd seed Clemson. Game lost. ZERO POINTS.

- 2016, Michigan State. #3 seed. Put up ZERO points against 2nd seed Alabama. Game lost.

Cincinnati ABSOLUTELY belonged in the playoff this year and put up a very respectable showing against the greatest football dynasty of all time. They also gave up WAY LESS points to Alabama than a certain SEC school this year who shall remain nameless.

If you’re gonna try and argue that Cincinnati didn’t belong because of the loss today and that this result should eliminate G5 schools going forward, you’re trash and your opinion is trash because facts.

Congratulations to Cincinnati on a hell of an amazing season!

That is all.

"AirForceRecruits","t5_2q94jn","It depends on you, how close you are to family, financial situation, willingness to travel, and flexibility on life plans. If haven't done a tech job yet, family will struggle to cover your living expenses, taking big college loans, etc military is definitely worth it. Because you get paid, live on your own, and any college and training you may need is covered. Not to mention medical and such. 

But if you get a good scholarship, family can cover your living expenses, etc and not doing big loans things change alot. Then you may not need it, but it may still be useful. 

I joined after my associates because I looked at my goals and job requirements. I was looking at least a year of student loans for a cheap college after parents stop covering, a degree, and no experience so would have to do entry level jobs for $50k-$60k income in California where that really does not go far. I mean an apartment alone before utilities would be $18k+ without roommates. So just living and taxes would take 2/3 of income depending on insurance and such if I wanted to move out quickly. Then not exactly able to get a nice vehicle, travel, invest, etc. 

To me the 4 years able to move out, free training, free college, live experience, live somewhere new, free insurance, discounted tickets, TSP matching, etc all added up really well to get me started. I just got out and landed a six figure job with a defense contractor even though I haven't finished my bachelors yet. I also was able to switch to the ANG for Cyber Warfare and I get differential pay. So once you add salary, ANG training, GI Bill, etc I'm looking to make $170k total next year. Only debt is my truck I've been making extra payments on, and looking to buy a house by myself in a year. So for me I say it worked out pretty damn well. 

I'm just sharing my success as an example that it can really help and take you far. I didn't make amazing money will in, but it helped me get me experience and resume looking really good and skipping helpdesk, only a technican for a little bit, then straight to network engineer. I think it really helped me fast track my goals alot. 

You need to look at your personal situation and see if it makes sense. What does each path loom like it will take you? How long could each one potentially take? Which one is more financially viable? What happens if plans you have go to hell, do you have a backup? If you graduate college but struggle to find a job what do you do? 

Also you can always just join the ANG to get that training, drill paycheck, access to cheap insurance, discounts on alot of stuff, then it will help cover college and certs. Only downside is you don't get the GI bill immediately, but it won't delay you continuing college for as long. 

There are alot of possible paths. You can always read through questions and answers here to understand things better, one of the many military blogs, discord groups, or if you're curious about my path and have more general questions I can dm you my discord. Hopefully you figure out your plan, it can be stressful with all the uncertainty.",1640995335

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 2000 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 2000 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 1900. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/elliot_3472/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

There have been a lot of posts with the term: `fireworks`, therefore, to prevent the sub getting stale, we've added the word to the ban list (which is not publically available).


### **Please do not post again by trying to subvert Automoderator by changing or removing a word. It may lead to an automatic ban (as per Rule 1)**

We recommend giving the rules another close read, and **only message the moderators** if you think your problem doesn't breach any rules, isn't topical (so everyone isn't complaining about it, and therefore all getting removed), or isn't a possibly banned topic (these should be fairly obvious if you think about it).

The rules, and auto-removals are in place to stop the sub getting bombarded with the same problem from too many people.

Often your problem may seem to be specific, but it'll contain a term that makes it generic.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;...rather than some omnipotent spaceghost. 

I enjoy a good discussion, and as the scientist God created me, I look for objective inquiry on the path to a truth. I draw the line at condescension though. Religion completely aside - if you have a bias in attaining the truth, then you're doing it wrong. 

&gt; I don't see any actual evidence of a god in your anecdote.

This is case in point. In scientific inquiry, anecdotal evidence is still objectively considered (within reason of course). Some of the most profoundly useful medicines, for instance, started with something along the lines of “I tell you what, ever since I’ve been drinking that Willow bark tea, my head aches are gone!” or “Ever since I washed my hands between child births – my patient’s death rates have drastically decreased”. 

Rather than stay in a potential comfort zone, a true scientist or truth seeker would explore the veracity of even anecdotal claims (especially when in the billions), and be wholly prepared and committed to accept any truth that challenges their existing world paradigm. 

And therein usually lies the rub for most in the 21st century living in developed countries. Using the true-world examples above as a metaphor – washing your hands and finding out about a thing called germs, or drinking the tea to find it does in fact relieve pain and inflammation; or turning off all judgment and potentially making yourself incredibly vulnerable a Higher Presence – will result in an incredibly inconvenient truth to your current lifestyle. 

It is therefore, *so* much easier to default to a path of least resistance – the personal attack. I.e. if the other person is automatically regarding as a ‘nut job’ or just plain ‘stupid’ they simply can’t be right and therefore there is no point even trying to wash my hands, or drink the tea etc. 

The scary part is (if you believe it) it’s all part of the plan though…",1640995337

for a little reminder:

-the arabs enslaved far more people than the slave owners in america have.
-china is actively colonizing Carribean and African countries (I forget the term but its through economic basis and all that shit, not what usually comes to mind when you think of colonization).

1. Accurately recounting the events of the story and your own words
2. Proving and understanding of the relationship of events from the story using references and logic.

High school book reports don't simply retell the story; they provide a summary as a part of explaining why the story is being told.

You can't just make up why the story is being told you have to extract that from the story.  

You can't say that the fox and the grapes has a moral about how we should all learn to love little gray men.  Even if you can recount the events that occur in the Fox and the grapes you cannot link those to little gray men.

The problem of reading in is that it cannot be proved.

We have a couple people in this forum that read in and that's all they do; when asked for proof they choke and they start calling people names.

The entire New Age movement especially that subset of it called perennialism is an exercise in reading in that cannot justify itself.  And once one person has permission to read in then everybody has permission to read in and you end up with a community where everybody thinks that the fox and the grapes is about something different and no one can challenge anyone and it's a little gray aliens all the way down.

The reality is nobody wants that.  It doesn't produce anything interesting.  It's not discussable.  And it inherently allows people to justify not thinking and remaining mired in their own biased fantasies.

Zen Masters are fantasy wreckers.  The subsets lots of people, even people who contribute regularly to this sub.  The solution of these sorts of people is to read into Zen stuff that isn't there so they can go back to their biased fantasies.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Welcome to Magic!

&gt;I've no idea how to start, do I just buy more cards?

Cards, maybe. Boosters, less likely (they aren't for getting cards, they are for things instead).

First off, stop buying things on a whim (there are enough things to buy, if and when the time is right). Then...

Start by downloading Magic Arena to learn the basics and get a feel for the game. It's free; available on PC, Mac, Android and iOS; and has a good tutorial. 

Complete the Color Challenges, Google ""Free Magic Arena Codes"" and redeem them all, join r/MagicArena 

If you are learning with a friend or partner you can get the Arena Starter Set which includes two ready made beginner friendly decks designed to be played against eachother and a pair of codes so you can both redeem the decks on Arena too. (If you are learning on your own don't worry, the Arena tutorial will be fine)

Once you've gotten to grips with the game you can use the Wizards Store and Event Locator to find your FLGS(s) and hopefully they will have some social media pages that will put you in touch with your local scene. Alternatively, you can try public libraries, community centres, universities and comic book stores etc. Failing that you can play via webcam - there are Discord servers etc.
Once you've found a playgroup you need to find out how they play (which Formats and how competitively). 

Then you need to set a budget and decide which Format(s) you want to play. Broadly speaking Magic is divided into two branches: Constructed (where you build your deck in advance from the cards you own and bring it with you) and Limited (where you open packs during the event and build your deck on the spot from the cards you get). Each branch is further divided into different Formats, for example: Constructed includes Standard, Modern, Pauper and Commander etc; while Limited includes Draft and Sealed etc. Each Format has its own rules which determine things like which sets you can use, how many packs you open, which cards are banned and how you build your deck etc.

If you want to play Constructed you will need cards, so you should *buy cards* - the exact ones you need (either individually as singles or as part of a preconstructed product that happens to contain enough cards you need to make it worth the price). Start with a Format-legal decklist (either one you have written from scratch or a netdeck/precon, or a blend of both) and then work out the best way to get the cards on it. Don't just rip open boosters in a vain attempt to randomly happen to get the cards you need though - that isn't what they are for. 

If you want to get started with a ready made Constructed Deck, then for Standard you could look into a Challenger Deck, or for Commander you could try a Commander precon. These are playable straight out of the box (at FNM level competition or casual game nights respectively) but will still have room for improvement/customisation. If playing Standard be mindful of the fact that it just Rotated however (which means not all cards in the Challenger Decks will be legal any more).

If you want to play Limited you will need packs - specifically Draft Boosters, so that is what you should get (either individually (more expensive) or in a Booster Box, Bundle or Pre-Release Kit, or included in your entry fee into an event - check with your event organiser). If an event is advertised as ""Phantom"" or ""Cube"" then all the packs are provided but the organiser keeps the cards at the end (you may need to contribute to the prize pool or pay a small table fee etc).

You may find that a blended approach is best since the cards you get from playing Limited can be used/sold/traded to improve your Constructed decks. 

There are a number of other Booster Packs available (Set, Collector, Theme), but since none of these are for playing Limited with *or* for getting cards for Constructed you shouldn't worry about them.  
FYI Set Boosters are for quick adrenaline hits (like lottery scratch cards), Collector Boosters are for getting rid of money quickly (a ""treat"" for those that have more than they know what to do with) and Theme Boosters are for extracting money from new players that don't know better (or their well meaning relatives). 

However you decide to play you should protect your cards (if they become scuffed or otherwise damaged they will lose value and may even become ""marked"" and unplayable). Use sleeves and deck boxes for your decks, binders for your trades and boxes to store the cards you aren't using. A playmat is good too as it will protect your cards from any cleaning chemicals that are sprayed on playing surfaces etc. 

I hope that answers all your questions (while helping you avoid the common new player pitfalls). Let us know if there is anything else you need to know.",1640995339

I'm saying that driving is better, if in the US, for these trips. I actually live in the suburbs of DC, and use the only high speed rail in the US to get to the Baltimore airport, but only if I'm already in or going to the city itself. Like I said, that's rather rare because of the sprawl makes the actual city only cover like 10% of the metro in both population or land.

In China, they DO have security at the entrance of the station. Sure you don't need it, but you're making it seem like China doesn't have it.

With regards to the 1, 3 and 4, yes it's the same with planes but different from driving.

Finally, if you live in Chicago, your metro is better than all but probably two or three US cities, making your situation an exception rather than a rule.",1640995339

We bought a lot of our design and research from third party Dutch semi company. Apple uses same Dutch manufacturer, and one in Taiwan for their phone processor. The chip package design have many aspects stolen. Similar to when Samsung first mastered through silicon vias, which as quickly copied by everyone. Through this process of intel stealing tsv, they made many improvements and now is pushing for omnidirectional full stack integration of system on chip. This 3d packaging was further copied and improved upon. When I was doing my PhD, the only financial support some our projects could find were from Saudi Arabia. Obviously they owned the data after, is this also stealing?

I'm pretty sure I'm more attuned to their effectiveness and how hard it is to stay on top of arrows than you. They aren't a big deal. In fact I can honestly say I've never run out of them, never had to specifically grind for them, and have full voidbent and two crafted 600gs weapons (meaning I'm not behind everyone else because I have to spend time grinding for arrows). 

* The bow and musket are not for someone who doesn't know how to manage their resource requirement.
*  I'm 100% okay with them weirdly being the only weapons that have that requirement. 
* I'd rather the Ice Staff and Fire Staff require way more mana, making them practically require resources to use, then remove ammunition. 
* I like when different items, armors, classes, specs, whatever, all have different advantages or disadvantages, this can include gold cost.

Many addicts have several months of feeling depressed or bored until things stabliize

you are tapping out happy chemicals with drugs, so of course you never feel happy without them.

those who self medicate have higher levels of depression.  Many use weed thinking it helps them and its not until they give it up for months that they realized it was causing the issues.

If more Americans can see what our tax dollars are supporting, maybe it will make a difference in future votes. 

The irony is that had we elected a Jewish president (Bernie), we would have had a better chance at not contributing as much to the destruction in Palestine.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","I dont think anything she said is unfair from her perspective but I also get it from AEW's perspective. At the end of the day they can try to be nice and equal to everyone but the reality is that it can't be that. The people who by default got to the top at the start of AEW earned it by years of grinding in other promotions. It's not unfair that they therefore came to top slots. Same for the people who got signed after.  
  
It's not a situation where you get signed and now It's AEW are gonna make me a star. That's not the business the company are really in. If you look at everyone pushed in AEW they all do some kind of vlog or twitch or wrote a book or just SOMETHING to make them stand out beyond ""I'm a wrestler and I wrestle"". If you don't have that DIY spirit in AEW you aren't gonna do well. Which makes sense since the whole company is founded on that DIY spirit. Bet on your yourself. Go All In/All Out. Go Double or Nothing. It's all over the marketing and the ethos of the company.   
  
I see a lot of people say ""why would any wrestler sign to WWE"" but honestly if you're not sure about your character or direction and just kinda want someone to ""make you a star"", WWE is a much better option than AEW and I dont mean that as any kind of back handed compliment. But if you sign to AEW you really need to have that drive of ""the grind isn't over because I got signed"". You have to have ideas, you gotta pitch, you gotta do things to stand out. It's like a musician signing to a major label. Some people think ""the label signed me, now they'll make me the next Beyoncè"" and 9/10 that's just not how it works. You gotta grind twice as hard at that point. And it won't work for everybody. But again, AEW is a lotto ticket where once they sign you it's a guarantee you'll be a star and It's also not ""first come first served I signed here before X therefore I get first dibs on a push before X"".",1640995342

By creating an amendment to the constitution (highest source of law in the Iand) it would supercede any decisions made by the US Supreme Court or any other judiciary authority. That's why I said an amendment not a standard federal statute or law.",1640995343

Atheists are ignorant, at least you’re trying to ask the good questions, but (and I mean this as no offense and I don’t wanna be rude at all) but as soon as you ask about reducing/oxidizing I know you don’t really know much other than a quick google search of biology. That’s not meant to be a shot, again you are asking great questions. But I’d recommend trying to visualize what I’m saying and ask for further explanation when something doesn’t make sense or is complicated.

It’s fair to call proteins books, because each enzymatic protein has to be written a exact way in order for it to have a function. Proteins have a various amount of usages in the cell, but for the sake of simplicity I’ve focused on the enzymatic one… I.e make the cell function. 

We can discuss the Bible another time… but you’ve got to consider all things together.
Science as we know it shows it’s not possible to make biopolymers through natural processes that exhibit earth conditions and 2) to sort through all 20^20 amino acid sequences to find the enzymatic proteins would take trillions (I think it was upwards of ten trillion years)

Universe is only supposed to be 13.7


The history on Jesus  is significant Bc we have many sources showing Jesus lived, was crucified for making god claims, empty tomb, and his disciples were willing to die Bc they had an experience seeing the resurrected Christ.

The Saul to Paul conversion is unexplainable.
Saul murdered Christians, he was a famous Jew documented for senticing Christina’s to death for simply being Christians….. he also is one of the worlds smartest men (having the equivalent of two phds) well according to Sauk he met Jesus …. Then he ends up writing most of the Bible and dying for his faith in the resurrected Christ.

Is he crazy?

What about James the brother of Jesus. Didn’t believe until he sees Christ risen.

These aren’t just biblical inferences, these are historical claims, studied just as any other ancient writings would be.",1640995344

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Even in a place like Russia people can actually ask other people what their views are of other people.

And people have been doing that for a long time. Right now, Putin's popularity is very low compared to previous surveys. In fact the only time Putin's popularity has been this low in the past was when he first took over, in 2005 when their were a number of high profile terrorist attacks, and in 2013 about 6 months before Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed the region of Crimea. Though it is worth pointing out that he is still considered somewhat popular overall, but disapproval is up.

As for does it even really matter, it matters a lot in both Russia and China. In Russia, Putin isn't absolute ruler. There is a large administrator and ruling class that would be putting pressure on Putin if large scale unrest were to occur. Why do you think Putin was so desperate to deal with the Alexei Navalny situation. His approval tanked pretty sharply after that whole situation, but it did steady at its current level. At a certain point approval turns to disapproval, which turns into dissent and a direct threat to the ruling class.

In China's case, it is very similar. The CCP have long feared unrest leading to their ousting. It has happened to countless Chinese dynasties over the centuries. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be willing to wage a war to an extent if it meant keeping power. But they have a limit and unrest ultimately weakens the state to internal and external threats. 

Democracy didn't evolve because someone had a moral change of heart. It evolved because it has been seen as the most stable form of government we currently know of in almost every successful country. There is a heck of a lot more to it all. But particularly in cases where an auth state relies somewhat on global economies - and both Russia and China do heavily - it is impossible to maintain standards with significant unrest. It is also much harder to try close pandora's box once it is open. Most of the autocrats in Russia and China have enjoyed the fruits of economic growth within their countries. If they had the choice to move towards western democracy and maintain their wealth and status or North Korean style poverty and maintain or even gain absolute authority, they are more than likely to choose the former.",1640995344

That said, in post-Halo 3-canon, a person is a reclaimer if they were born with a Forerunner geas. All of the S-IIs had a geas iirc, and also all of the S-III Cat IIs (Noble Team is Cat II, meaning that they held all the genetic markers that were required to be selected for the S-II program, but were ultimately chosen for the S-III program because they weren't born yet.)

Flu has an R number about 1.6-1.8

Delta was similar to that

Omicron is something like a 3.5

Which looks like twice as bad, but that multiplies every generation. 

So if flu starts with 10 people, after 4 generations it’s now infecting about 100

Omicron would be infecting 1500

Plus they think omicron reproduces really fast so might get another generation or more done in the same time which would put it up to 5000 / 20,000

Edit: someone pointed out these R rates for covid are the for ‘with restrictions’ so it’d be even worse if we weren’t vaccinated / had no masks etc. See comments below for just how mega-screwed we’d be!",1640995346

"ControlProblem","t5_39qub","Hello Niplav!

You definitely can ask me a question, but whether I'm ""on the hook"" or not is up to me, isn't it ;-) Well, your question is great, so I'm happy to answer it this pretty New Year's Eve of 2021.

I do believe you have misunderstood my views, haha. But I would never hold it against you because (1) I haven't really put in the time and effort needed to deeply clarify them by comparing and contrasting them to existing views, and (2) they are complicated and based on both esoteric theoretical considerations as well as a wide experience base I don't believe many have access to :P 

Anyhow, here is nothing...

&gt; In a video (I think it's on whether digital computers can be conscious), you allude to hypercomputation via field computing to be underlying consciousness (perhaps à la Penrose). 

I should clarify here. I (a) do think we should think in terms of hypercomputation, in the sense of moving past Turing Machines abstractions as well as Von Neumann Computing. Then, (b) I also think that one of the key ingredients for the ""secret sauce"" behind the computational benefits of consciousness is field computing where, in particular, the way in which physical fields ""act all at once in a massive parallel fashion"" enables ""holistic behavior"" like finding the resonant modes of shapes at [wave propagation] speeds. 

&gt; Elsewhere (unfortunately, I don't remember where), iirc, you endorse something like ultrafinitism. But these two views seem to clash: if hypercomputation is physically possible, then can't infinities be instantiated physically?

But (c) I categorically do not endorse the view that the computational benefits of the fields of physics stems from their infinitesimal nature! For instance, in [A Big State-Space of Consciousness](https://qualiacomputing.com/2020/01/18/a-big-state-space-of-consciousness/) I say:

&gt; But what if reality is continuous? Doesn’t that entail an infinite state-space?

&gt; I do not think that the discrete/continuous distinction meaningfully impacts the size of the state-space of consciousness. The reason is that at some point of degree of similarity between experiences you get “just noticeable differences” (JNDs). Even with the tiniest hint of true continuity in consciousness, the state-space would be infinite as a result. But the vast majority of those differences won’t matter: they can be swept under the rug to an extent because they can’t actually be “distinguished from the inside”. To make a good discrete approximation of the state-space, we would just need to divide the state-space into regions of equal area such that their diameter is a JND.

In the context of hyper-computation, the benefits to be sought and found result from the energy, space, and time complexity advantages that come from directly interfacing with reality as it is without an intermediary layer of discretization and virtualization for running programs. Not from any kind of ""infinite computation"" thanks the the continuity of the fields of physics (if they are indeed continuous!).

In particular, I think that we need to rethink the very meaning of ""computation"" to go beyond discrete operations that go from a discrete input to a discrete output. In particular, the ""being"" of the matter will ultimately come down the the ""bound states"" (such as entire moments of experience) that implement the computations. A digital computer is, at no point, actually integrating the 1s and 0s into bound states with more than one bit of information. But topological pockets of the fields of physics do have a natural boundary around them; their resonant modes are ""discrete-like"" and thus computationally useful for digital-like computation. At the deepest level, though, they could certainly break down into Plank-length pieces - no problem. All that matters for their computational properties is that they behave like (approximately) continuous fields at the right scale and at the right level of abstraction.

I'll also mention that IIT is interesting precisely because it revisit the concept of ""information"" by reconceptualizing it in terms of ""intrinsic states"" as opposed to merely in terms of laws for message-passing operations between systems as with Shannon's conception. In turn, just as IIT does for information, I think that we ought to revisit the meaning of ""computation"" so that it involves ""bound states"" with more than one bit of information that can combine and modify one another in both parallel and sequential fashion in non-trivial ways. This, of course, won't be ""visible"" if one merely conceptualizes the range of possible computations in terms of how discrete inputs get transformed into discrete outputs. You need to realize that reality is ""made"" of multi-bit bound states and that ""being"" relates to those states and not to the high-level programs they implicitly instantiate.

Hope that helps!

It is very improbable to improve a human. While a virus is randomly mutated and most changes to its genetic make no changes to the human, a human is also randomly mutated and so we are more likely to improve upon ourselves than a virus is to improve upon us.

The more aggressively a virus multiplies, the more it hurts the host. Viruses evolve to balance this. Something like herpes does almost nothing to the host, and is successful because of this. Something like the cold multiplies aggressively and this keeps it spreading. The most aggressive viruses tend to kill their hosts before spreading and so evolution avoids them.",1640995348

https://youtu.be/OMRyrKDXNG4  
For the full description, please visit:-

Hi Brethren,  
HAPPY NEW YEAR IN GOSPEL, DELIVERED BY THE ANOINTED CHRISTS = SATGURUS JESUS AND HIS SECOND COMING NANAK.  
Youtube Video:- https://youtu.be/OMRyrKDXNG4  
The reason for Christ Jesus to appear was that the Jews outwardly of appearances, the FAKE proclaiming themselves to be the Chosen People of demiurge Yahweh who brought Abram of the Semitic race, a mix of the Negro and Aryan, who hated none but loved all from the Iraq area to the Middle East to establish an ideal society and he was given the Promised Land as the Garden of Eden. They were living in the company of their creator demiurge Lord of the Nature Yahweh and for his faith, he was named ""Abraham"". Now, so far the generation of Abraham, an ideal Adam and Sarah, an ideal Eve, were faithful ""Salt of Abraham"", an honest and truthful as Joseph of the twelve sons of Jacob was, they enjoyed the best fruit of the Garden of Eden but as soon as they became unfaithful and Saltless people as the Eleven crook liars and murderers were who wanted to kill the Nathanael like true Israelite with no duplicity Joseph was but the Saltless brethren sold the faithful Salt of the Earth Joseph as a slave to the faithful to Abraham Salt of the Earth Egyptians of Ishmael, the Elder son of Abraham, there he was honoured among them and was given the highest position of honour among them whilst the unfaithful to Abraham liars and murderer sons were rejected by the Nobel Man Abraham to whom the Promised Land belonged and such Saltless super bastards unfaithful to Abraham and Yahweh people – John 8v44, the Tares Matt 13v24-30 that are being bundled up in Israel for the Final Burning in the ensuing ATOMIC WAR expected on 14/05/2023 when Israel is 75 years old - had no place in Adam to inherit and live. Yahweh was also not happy either and no rain or crops for them to eat. All these natural disasters that are taking place in the world are a punishment to the cruel people who have committed atrocities against childlike innocent people. No such natural disasters among the faithful tribal sons of Adam living in the African and Brazilian jungles. Then, they had to leave the Promised Land for Egypt where they started to misuse their spiritual talents with evil spirits and ended up as slaves to the Salt of the Earth Egyptians where Salt of Abraham Joseph had become the ruler. In other words, the faithful to Abraham and Yahweh Nobel people of Joseph, the Samaritans were honoured anywhere they went whilst the clever crook generations of the Eleven Patriarchs were hated and killed in holocausts by the tribal sons of Man. Thus, when the English were English and not Conservative or Labour, they killed the bloodsucking cheating Jews outwardly and not the good Samaritans, the Salt of Nobel Abraham. John, the Baptist, the last Prophet Elijah, the Cornerstone of the Temple was ousted out by the greedy Rabbis dressed in silken clothes and Christ Jesus exposed their hypocrisy and they killed Him. Angel Stephen, ..  
Greatest Blasphemers and Killers Blair and Bush being considered by Anti-Christ Bishops for Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel Peace Prize should rather go to Assange and the Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi who threw both his shoes at the hypocrite Bush in Iraq.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","&gt;You know that there are multiple companies that dont abuse animals in their life before getting butchered... Right?

Cruelty to animals, also called animal abuse, animal neglect or animal cruelty, is the infliction by omission (neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for entertainment; cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as zoosadism.

 ancom is a contradiction in terms. these phrases were created by think tanks to confuse.. let's not fall for it.

Well maybe it's really impossible for proteins to form on their own as you claim, but if it is possible there's no reason it would require DNA and not some other chemical reaction. 

Regarding DNA as far as I understand the ""read"" is itself a chemical reaction, so saying there's no reason for it being as it is, is a bit absurd imo. The reason anything biological happens **is** chemistry. 

It seems to me a bit like saying that there's no particular reason 1 is the first number, while it's not untrue in a sense, it's also true that one is the first number because there has to be a first because that's how enumeration works.",1640995350

"AskBlackGirls","t5_2i1kc0","I don't think I agree on either points.  But I can see why you would get that impression.

If you look at the most wealthy men, you  dont see many with with wives that are overweight.  Plenty of them have plain wives, but they're usually still physically fit or skinny (Bezos ex wife for instance).  So Im not sure white men really prioritize faces over bodies.

On the flip side, black men seem to prioritize a woman's racial make up / skin tone / hair type over a pretty face and often times a nice body as well.

At the end of the day what men prefer the most seems to align with whatever their culture of men will collectively pedestalize them for. 

In most white circles (at least in the US), the men seem to prioritize things that are easily attained by women (like hair color and weight).  In PoC cultures, the men seem to prioritize more immutable qualities (hair type, skin tone, and sometimes unnatural body shapes). But thats not to say white men don't engage in things like colorism.",1640995350

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I’m sure you absolutely can tell when your body has a change in what you’re eating. Our microbiome notices change instantly, but also takes a few weeks to catch up to get the right bacteria to properly digest new foods. 

I also feel different that i did 3 years go. For the better, for sure, as my inflammatory markers and LDL are just automatically reduced when eating plant based. But I’ve had some blood work come back in the last year that showed i was lacking a few things. My HDL was a smidge low and i happened to be deficient in Vit E. I got more exercise for my HDL, and added sunflower seeds to my salads and grain bowls for vitamin e. 3 months later all looked well. 

It’s not harder to get the things you mentioned on a plant based diet. Protein deficiency in “developed” nations is not a problem. Almost everyone is WAY over the limit to an unhealthy degree, and even the average vegan consumes 70% more than the minimum requirement. Ask anybody who works at a blood lab lol. 

Statistically, the average vegan is deficient in: 

• Calcium 
• Iodine
• b12.  


The average person eating an omnivorous diet is deficient in:

 • calcium 
• iodine
• fiber
• folate
• magnesium
• vitamin c
• vitamin e


Veganism is not a health fad, it’s just avoiding animal cruelty as much as possible. So people fuck it up all the time JUST like they do with omnivorous diets. Anyone can easily correct all of these  deficiencies on either diet by paying better attention. 

Also worth noting that only 3% of Americans get their recommended fiber intake. Caloric density certainly doesn’t help that at all. Eating a variety of plants is necessary in ANY diet. 

Veganism can be as unhealthy or as healthy as you want it to be. (Aka don’t forget to take your b12 vitamin or eat fortified foods) So it actually can fill that void if you just log your food into cronometer every once in a while and adjust accordingly.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","I think the most likely is a refresh of the current SE with 5G and A15, no other changes. It’s the cheapest option, parts are readily available, and it offers enough differentiation in the lineup. Which leads to my main point on why I think it’s just a refresh:

The main reason why I don’t think we’ll see a Xr style SE is because there is no device to fill that $499 gap that the 11 currently holds - it wouldn’t make sense to update the SE to the Xr style body and have an outdated device with better cameras (11 would have LTE and an A13). If the SE takes on the Zr body, Apple will clearly kill the 11, but nothing is there to fill the gap. 

I think the iPhone 12 Mini will become a future SE model, but not for 3-4 more years. The way I see the SE lineup over the next few years:

2022: 

-	Updated SE using the same (iPhone 8) body with 5G and A15

2023: 

-	No new SE; stays the same at $399
-	11 is still offered at $499
-	iPhone 12 Mini and 12 discontinued
-	iPhone 13 and 13 Mini moves down to occupy the $599/$699 space. 
-	iPhone 14 series starts at $749 ($50 increase compared to the iPhone 13)
-	This allows the new 14 Max to start at $849, giving Apple an extra $50 for this slot in the lineup, which will arguably be the most popular model in Fall 2023

2024: 

-	New SE: Xr/11 body becomes the new SE at $399. 
-	13 Mini goes to $499
-	13 goes to $599
-	14 goes to $699
-	14 Max goes to $799
-	15 series follows the same pricing pattern as 2023

2025:

-	No new SE; stays Xr/11 body style 
-	13 Mini stays at $499, 13 goes away
-	too many years ahead to predict what will happen to the rest of the line 

2026:

-	New SE using the 13 Mini body",1640995351

So if one experiences symptoms, which could be basic flu, he/she is presumed positive.   No need for PCR test confirmation, there would be no need for contact tracing neither as they require the feed from PCR testing.  
I am in agreement that if testing results dont come back in a timely manner, it would not be very useful.

I like how you also include that tipping is a way to avoid paying fair taxes and allows you to lie about your real income, getting on social programs that are allocated for people not making enough to get by. 

You also seem to think that paying a living wage means tipping would disappear - aside from a few select countries, tipping is still common for exceptional service. And just an fyi not all waitstaff are waitresses, so I don't know why you insist on gendering the entire profession. 

You claim increasing wages will lead to faster automation - well we are in the middle of a massive ""labor"" shortage, wheres the sped up automation?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When people apologize to you, do you think they’ve degraded themselves? 

I wasn’t diagnosed until my mid to late 30’s. At 25 I was still in the thick of being defensive and wanting everything to be fair. Other people hurt me so why should I care if I hurt other people? But it absolutely does not “solidify” past a certain age. Anyone can go through therapy and work on themselves at any age and make changes. And learn.

No one is talking about giving people a pass for their wrongs against you. It’s about acknowledging your trauma and consciously working on your own emotions and actions as a result. Something you can start doing today instead of defaulting to defensiveness. Trauma isn’t stopping your from that. You are in charge of you and *you* are stopping you from that. 

When I get defensive now and want to instinctively skirt responsibility for that, I can stop and acknowledge how that is how I would have reacted before out of pain. And then I can consciously decide how I want to move forward in *this entirely new situation.* It usually involves taking a second to self reflect, forgiving myself for making a mistake, and reminding myself that I wasn’t raised in a household where I could safely make mistakes without judgement. And then reminding myself that making a mistake doesn’t ruin anything or define me. And then I am usually able to say to the person, “I’m sorry, I did this thing. I reacted without thinking. Can you forgive me?” People who are emotionally mature will recognize that and forgive you and move on. No one is degraded. We are all just living honestly and openly.

I really, really think you should consider talking to a professional about this kind of stuff. A solid breakthrough with a therapist after being diagnosed with adhd and anxiety completely changed my life and all my future relationships.

Good luck to you! Life can be a long journey and we are not cast to a role that can never change!",1640995353

1) As shown in the video, when I bend the high B string, it moves over the fret 0 and makes a clinking sound. It also seems to move around in its slot in the black plastic part (apologies for my lacking vocabulary). I play in my room at low volume so I can hear the clinking sound while I play, and I can also feel the string ""jumping"" under my finger when it goes back. In place after a bend. How can I fix this? 

2) On the high E string, when bending the 17th fret, the sound dies out when I reach about one tone up. It does not seem to do this on any other fret, not on any other string on the 17th fret. Should I simply adjust the action or is there an issue with the fret? 

Thanks for the help!
Other than those two problems, the guitar plays great and sounds great. I hope I can fix this stuff myself. I've never adjusted a guitar myself and know virtually nothing on the subject or hardware in general so explain to me like I'm 5 :)",1640995355

I have 6.5 full-time staff, which equates to 260 hours/week (@ 40 hours/week). My extra work is an ~8% increase in total labor that nets a ~20% increase in firm revenue, and a 50% increase in personal work hours that nets a ~100% increase in personal take-home pay, both of which are quite efficient.",1640995355

No, I'm not. I'm talking about value in the most basic sense; the value which derives simply from human perception. I'm not sure how they're using it, which is why I asked them.

&gt;They're both legitimate uses of the word, things just fell apart because the particular use of the word as it pertains to this conversation wasn't clearly defined. The way I see it you're actually both right, you're just talking about two different things. You making an exact copy of my invented widget doesn't interfere with my ability to use it and so it is not devalued as a widget, but the existence of additional copies of my invented widget does devalue it when I go to sell it because now the supply of said widget has increased.

What I’m thinking is sand down what can be sanded and cut out whats too far gone and weld new sheet metal on. Then use rust neutralizer and rust oleum paint to cover it maybe even use truck bed liner over that as the final layer. Could anyone who has restored their trunk give me any insight. Also side question does the hole where the antenna is screwed in let water in because water still leaks in and I know its not the seals because I already replaced those and tested it.

Is this her own hands? It's a bit weird to describe her own hands like this. It makes it sound like they are someone else's hands, or that the hands are clawing at the dirt of their own volition.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Her magic was manifesting, the buzzing in her fingertips grew as she tossed each stone out of the way.

Consider swapping this around. Show me the magic manifesting first, and then clarify what is happening. Something like:

&gt;The buzzing in her fingertips grew as she tossed each stone out of the way—her magic was manifesting.

You might not even need to clarify the magic-manifesting part.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It allowed her to move freely around the castle grounds but it was enchanted to stay on her body so her mother would know exactly where she was, always.

Is another example of where you could better show this. Rather than telling us what would happen, consider just having it happen instead. For example, you could have her walk around, and then the shackles vibrate as she begins to leave.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt;The entire business plan of silicon Valley is to spunk money on loss-making businesses until they reach a monopoly position and can start monetising.

Until they stabilize into a market position where they can sustain large profit margins.

Welcome to the very fundamental basic mechanics of capitalism. This same thing applies to factories. They're ridiculously expensive to build, have relatively low marginal costs, and can make very high cashflow. Or ... they can bankrupt you. 

You let smart people who know what they're doing sink absolute tons of their own money into things that might not work out for the 2% chance (literally 2% of silicon valley companies make it past series A, literally less than 1% make an exit) you make a few billion instead. It's informed and highly calculated gambling, but with large positive consequences for consumers, workers, and investors. 

You can't tax the upside at 20% vat, 30% profit tax, and 40% dividend/capital gains tax, and expect the odds to remain the same. You're skewing the expected value of an investment heavily into the loss side.",1640995359

The O5 X-Men showed up in 2012 and left in 2018, again, about a year and a half. How is a year and a half not a long time for characters to be time displaced and stuck in the present?

The test isn't 'hard' for most candidates, something like high 90% pass. 

So if the test has a 90% pass rate, is it doing its job?

Also, if math is so important, why isn't it a requirement in teachers college? Why have someone go through 6 years of university, potentially never taking math, and then have them do a math test?

I teach tech, so I I teach a lot of students who struggle with math, I obviously know the value of math coming from trades.

We have a meta, yes. But I feel like individual assessment of characters and team overviews should matter more than putting them in lists that barely separates them in clauses.

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","&gt;Are you really trying to compare this to literally sending someone to neuronist and using nazarick resources for personal feelings? Ainz out of all beings in nazarick is most strict regarding how resources were used prior to volume 14. Even if he dishes out a harsh death himself, he would never expend nazarick resources for absolutely no gain.

I'm not the one comparing, mate, you're the one who brings it up. Imagine if Clementine wasn't someone so unpleasant. Like say, Foresight. Besides, torturing a couple of humans hardly counts as a resource drain. Even if it is for some reason, well, he's the Supreme Being. If anyone can waste resources it's him. Really that whole rule applies only to the NPCs anyway. Ainz may or may not follow it according to his whims and what he thinks is best. That's always been the case. Like I said, he's pragmatic, but not completely without emotions. He's still human deep down despite how much anyone said otherwise. We are never purely logical or pragmatic alone

&gt;This time, he not only expended nazarick resources, but he also pursued a plan that made everyone their enemy and actively work against them when their original logical plan was to simply show their might through justified means and maintain as much peaceful diplomatic relations as possible. They literally through this whole plan out the window simply because one guy annoyed them.

Uh huh, name an enemy they've made due to this event besides the Theocracy and Argland who have been against him from the start purely based on what he is. It was never a question of who would let them get away with this, it's a question of who could stop them. And in this case those two thinks they can. The rest are either already a part of his country or too scared shitless to do anything otherwise. Really this whole line of reasoning is ridiculous. No one else besides those two is fucking suicidal enough to jump Naz at this point. It's just what it is. Besides it's not entirely a waste. The NPCs learn a couple of new battle tricks.

People like Lucha Bros, part of another minority, are top Guys because they were doing great, as wrestler not as representative of their race, the same is for people like Shida.


And for the ""not everyone wante to write their ideas""
I think that in modern wrestling writing and building characters is part of the job, in Indies you need to do that, and I think there's nothing wrong from AEW to put over people that actually can help theirselves getting over. If you need a lot of writers to be a pro wrestler maybe you should try harder.

It sounds like you haven't started your training yet so here for what its worth is a few morsels of advice if you want to progress quickly:

1. Download [LiveATC.net](https://LiveATC.net) and start listening to the KLGB tower frequency as much as you can.  Learn the ebb and flow and rhythm of radio communications because in this L.A. airspace, its fast paced in the extreme very often.
2. Grab any course on the PPL and start working your way through it on your own. Sporty's and King are a good place to start.  The more material you can digest on your own, the better and to be honest, none of it is rocket science.
3. Go meet the CFI's and find out what their plans are.  Many CFIs are teaching only until they have the requirements to go elsewhere. (Airline, Cargo, Charter etc).  I have seen students show up one day only to be told ""Sorry but your instructor just left for Skywest"".  Unfortunately that happens all too often.
4. 40 hours is the barebones minimum which the FAA requires and they haven't updated it since roughly 1940.  The national average is somewhere between 65-75 hours and you are going to be training in some of the busiest airspace in the world.
5. Have fun!  Its getting to play with airplanes.  You get out what you put in.

Good luck and enjoy.  I don't think he will do anything non Cirrus but down in Carlsbad is a great guy by the name of Chuck Cali.  Chuck is old school and probably forgotten more about flying and aviation than most of us who are flying now can remember.

Option A, the sale model, the developer secures full financing, builds a condo, walks away with a 25 million dollar profit before the drywallers and trim carpenters even walk on site.


Option B, the developer secures financing, but takes a lot longer to do so, as they can't take presale deposits. Where building A takes less than a year to build, building B takes three times as long, contractors have issues getting paid, compromises are made, you end up with a lower quality build. Maybe the company goes bankrupt and the project changes hands before completion. Finally, three years later, the building is complete, but there are major issues already, yet in a hot rental market they have no trouble finding tenants. Maybe the developer walks away with a 10 million dollar profit after selling the property to an income trust, maybe they realize 25 million dollars worth of rental income over the next 30 years.",1640995361

I have never touched any music gear ever. Home audio, yes. Music making, no. So, when I had a chance to buy a few things, I decided why not.

Total was US$1,500.
I don’t have any software or DAW.
My music tastes are all over the place from Death/Black Metal to Power Electronics, ‘80s Goth to Harsh Noise, Witch House to Death Industrial, Techno to IDM.
After learning basic operations, I’m wondering if all of these can be hooked up together and if so, how? Best way to utilize each piece? Anything redundant and/or anything I need? (Besides talent)

For the bootstrap, Taurine uses procursus while unc0ver uses elecubratus. Procursus is a decentralized bootstrap that anybody can fork for their own jailbreak. It provided up to date packages, for example procursus has APT 2.3.7 while elecubratus has APT 1.8.2.2-1.

I was pulling myself away but felt sorry for them as they couldn’t get home for Christmas so I started speaking to them again. They made a point they were spending time with their neighbour and I didn’t think anything of it, I was glad they weren’t alone (I had travelled to a different part of the country). They started messing me about again and I got fed up again until they started phoning me multiple times on my birthday (in January). I eventually caved and spoke them start of February where they said that I should protect myself from them, that they never came to my place because “I was so close yet so far away” (I always went to theirs), that they had started seeing their neighbour and that I should go out with a mutual friend of ours. There was other stuff but I won’t go into it but it took
me a month after to realise the truth of the 8 year relationship. All the triangulation, future faking, lying, not having the time. It was all one sided.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","I'm gonna stand in front of the shitstorm that usually comes with this topic, but I think it's useless to bring a fully dedicated healer to normal dungeons, heck even a hybring healer/DPS is enough for majority of base game vet dungeons. Since I play healers too I experienced so bad DPS that I had to do something and bring some damage to the group, mostly dropping my helaer sets and bring DPS sets to compensate the low damage. Buffing 2 low cp low DPS DDS won't make a difference, the group benefits more if you do your 20-30k while still healing the group with the AoE heals.

Of course for harder dungeons I always bring the full healer builds, but in case of ridiculously low DPS I'll just leave. When I play healer I want the tank to have a taunt slotted and don't die/run around so I can do my thing peacefully. Also I like to help in pulls and I want the group to stay together so we can make some very nice bursts.

As a tank I just want a few things from the healer: a constant 1-2k hps under me, sometimes a negative effect remover, and the most important is sustain help because on bosses that suck either my magica or stamina I will struggle with sustain. These can be done by abilities only. Just throw shards or orbs from time to time, that helps a lot. Same goes for the group stacking, easier to do the pulls together. (Especially since the patch, pulls feel very lackluster, idk why)

If the healer also deals damage while doing basic healer things it's good. If it's a dedicated helaer with all the buffs, also good. As long as the DDs can do their job.",1640995368

Google Translate: 
&gt; During engagements outside of visual range, the American Raptors have not even deigned to light their radars, remaining invisible to RBE2_and the Spectra of the Rafale while locating precisely of the French hunter, thus securing their AMRAAM shots at safe distance.

&gt; At least twice, the F-22A also ""rolled up"" with the Rafale in close combat, ensuring each time a ""gun kill"" without much difficulty.

EDIT: [Here's an account from a parliamentary interview with an Australian pilot who flew his F-15D against the Raptor during a training exercise.](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22committees/commjnt/fb49a6a2-5080-4c72-a379-e4fd10cc710a/0002%22) Much like the French account the Aussie says that his modern air superiority fighter could not even detect the F-22's presence or targeting solution, resulting in lopsided victories for the Americans.",1640995368

There were instructions which were fairly basic - put this strip here, put that one there and conceal the wires with bricks and then at the end of the build it just said join the battery box to the connector panel and the other wires to the connector panel. Not very detailed instructions or pictures. 

It only came with the battery box and only a single expansion board. They are a fresh pack of batteries and I think the box is working because it gets warm as does the wire the coming out of it. None of the wires plugged into the expansion board gets warm. I have tried one of the lights which is on the outside (wrapped around a Xmas tree) in each port and no light. I think I'm plugging them in correctly as they only insert one way. They don't push aĺl the way down. Is that right?

I'll need to get another lighting kit to do some testing. Lesson learned to test the lighting prebuild :) This is my first time trying to use lights.",1640995369

Você provavelmente precisaria grudar em algum professor que já participou de projetos com investimentos pra ter um direcionamento melhor (digo isso pois é exatamente o que está acontecendo comigo). Creio que além disso, você também vai ter mais proximidade com a área trabalhando em bancos.

Não é conselho nem nada, mas o pessoal da engenharia aqui do meu campus é bem mais engajado com essa área e até tem competições voltadas pra isso(se quiser pesquisar, dá uma googlada em EESC finance pra entender mais o rolê deles).",1640995369

"DankMemesFromSite19","t5_3k4sh","**Thank you for your submission, unfortunately it has been removed for the following reason:**

___
[](#lock)

An image must be created specifically to be an SCP meme and it must work specifically as an SCP meme even if its title were to be taken away. Because without that requirement, people make lots of low effort posts by just finding an SCP-ish image online, not modifying it at all and adding a joke title to it. Such posts are legitimate jokes and some are very good, but because it doesn't take much effort to create them, people can make many more such posts and it floods the subreddit. Usually, having more content is good, but as a result of this, memes that people actually photoshopped or drew have a hard time getting noticed in an overwhelming flood of such simpler posts. Considering that there are thousands of SCPs covering all sorts of things, the subreddit would be completely overrun with such posts, and before this rule - it used to be. [[More Details]](https://redd.it/c3zy0f).



___
👨‍⚖️ [`r/DankMemesFromSite19 RULES` Rule 1](/r/DankMemesFromSite19/about/rules)
&gt;All posts must be original SCP memes.
&gt; 
&gt; -   All posts on this subreddit must be related to the SCP Foundation, its articles, its community, or events surrounding it. Anything unrelated to SCP (or something which is but is not a meme) will be removed. ""OC SCPs"" that are not published on the Wiki do not count.

Practical advise: talk to people and ask questions, focus on being smooth, predictable, and comfortable your first day, and DO NOT get into your own head about “holding people up”. Ride your own ride. Bring lots of water and shade (you’re in the UK so I’m not sure that’s a big deal over the pond), and just chill.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","The numbers are certainly small on their own, but they become amplified under conditions of gerrymander and substitution. 

So, if one voter leaves and someone of the opposing party arrives, there's a net margin change of two votes - double.

Further, while overall in a state, the gerrymander might look like 1.5:1 in favor of the gerrymander, at a district level, that might be 2:1 or more in some districts.

So, in swinging districts, a single voter coming in to replace a covid death might have four times the voting weight of others.

As for age demographics, people tend to get more conservative as they age. For example,  baby boomers were all for free love, anti-war and anti-establishment, as well as supporting civil rights changes. In other words, huge numbers of Bernie Sanders. . Today, many of those are now mad uncles getting drunk at family gatherings mouthing off at the ""youf of today"". Very few are still Bernies.

  * Chase Freedom Flex—5% quarter rotational categories, 7.5 equivalent when transferring points to Reserve card and redeemed for travel. I have multiple of these when I product change cards after I collected their sign up bonuses. So depending on the category for the quarter I can create a lot of spend for the category and collect $75 in value per card per quarter. And these are worth more when transferring to Reserve.
  * Chase Freedom Unlimited—1.5% all purchased, 2.25 equivalent via Reserve+travel. This is my main card I use if the transaction’s category doesn’t fit with the other cards.
  * Any of the Chase Ink business cards if you have a business. Lots of points to be made here and funnel these to Reserve for more value.

"nova","t5_2riyy","Hi u/amalagg, medical doctor here.

If you are triple vaxxed and experience a breakthrough infection, then there's a couple things worth mentioning.

First, good on you for choosing to protect yourself the best way humanly possible from death and ICU stay / intubation due to COVID-19 by getting vaccinated. Good on you also for reducing the chances of spreading covid on to others.

Your chances of needing to go to the hospital with triple vaccine status are low, but if it does happen, here is what to do:

1) If you feel symptoms of anything flu or cold related, get yourself tested right away. There are two different types of tests: a rapid test where they swab your nose and test for virus, and a PCR test that takes a day or two. The rapid test is unfortunately only abt 60% sensitive, so it can miss infections. It is however 99.9% specific, so if you get a positive result, you definitely have COVID. If you get a negative result, go home and isolate for a few days. If you continue to feel bad or develop any classic COVID symptoms like loss of taste/smell, go get tested again.

The other type of test is a PCR genetic test that is insanely sensitive and specific, so that is the gold standard that will tell you if you have COVID-19 or not.

2) In-home Care: You start here, and it consists of:
A) **Calling your primary care doctor**--they will then get you connected w medications shown to be effective in treating COVID-19, if available. (Note: NOT ivermectin.)

B) **Regular flu-like illness care**--lots of fluids, calories as tolerated, and sleep. 

C) **Oxygen monitoring**. I recommend obtaining an blood oxygen monitor / pulse oximeter from your nearest pharmacy. They cost around $10. Use this to monitor your resting oxygen levels. If your oxygen dips below 90%, that is when you go to the hospital. If above 90% while resting, continue to fight it out at home unless otherwise advised by your doctor who is more knowledgeable about your individual health status at baseline. *I am an internet stranger physician who has never examined you and who does not know your medical history and thus my words are general population advice geared towards the average and otherwise healthy adult.*

D) Proning. For whatever reason, patients fare better, get out of the hospital sooner, and have lower likelihood of death and/or ICU care escalation if they **lay on their stomachs as much as humanly possible**. In the hospital we recommend 18 hours daily. On. Your. Stomach. I've seen this work.

Those are my main recommendations I give to my patients.

Best of luck. I hope you get yourself vaccinated. I hope you don't get infected, nor require hospitalization.",1640995372

it's ridiculous that the council has their minds changed by an impassioned speech. can you imagine that happening irl? putin convinced to stop pursuing ukraine because some 20 year old said so? the council have no real motivations that make sense. if zaun is an industrial base then they'd need one hell of an economic incentive to give it up

I know it’s nothing new. Go back to the earliest societies and the wealthy wore jewellery or other status symbols. But the wealth divide is so extreme now and I feel there’s no way to justify it. 

Another recent gross example is Salt Bae and his stupid restaurant where he puts gold on steak to charge a ridiculous amount. Gold is clearly not something tasty we should be eating. It’s just pure ornament to give a reason to push the price to more ridiculous levels. 

In fact when it comes to ultra expensive dishes that’s when you see some real ridiculous shenanigans to increase the price. Michelin starred tasting menus are not enough (where at least you can somewhat justify the price given the skill and artistry involved). Now they have to cover food with gold or insane amounts of truffle to get the price as sky high as possible

"PlayAvengers","t5_1276pu","Sure, though it has been a while since i went through reassemble. Dodging will be key. One key mechanic to the game is what's called Dodge Cancelling. Normally when you're attacking, you have to wait for the attack animation to finish before you attack again. Dodging is different though, it can be done at nearly any time, though hulk can't do it while jumping so keep that to a minimum. If you see that red attack indicator, dodge immediately, you'll cancel out of your attack animation and should avoid the hit. Additionally, all heroic attacks give you Invincibility Frames. Basically, you can't be hit while your heroic animations are going off. Once your heroics are primed, wait for something you don't think you can dodge and use a heroic instead. The hit should pass straight through you, while abomb eats a big attack to the face. It's a far more skill based game than i was expecting when i picked it up, honestly. I thought it'd be prettier ultimate alliance, but what i got instead was almost multiplayer arkham asylum (the combat at least) cranked up to 11. I adore it, but it takes a bit to get used to the twitchiness.",1640995373

How you go about solving this is up to you, be it toys, sex buddies or just getting over things for the sake of people you love. You guys need to find a compromise that doesn't force the other to do what they are not comfortable with. If you cannot It's perfectly valid to break up and just be friends.

Then afterwards you stay at home and never go out anywhere or try to meet new people. You've closed off any avenue for your magick to actually work. The limited amount of energy you sent out might've increased the chances you'll run into the person you are looking for, or may have made you seem more attractive had you met the person, or made you more confident thus more likely to succeed when asking the person out. BUT if you do you a spell and don't go outside, what's your magick supposed to do? Break your door down? It's unlikely you raised enough energy to physically manifest your dream date to knock on your door begging for a date.

They're just so easy and the market is saturated.  My friend has Klipsch towers and I have Kef LS50'S.  The Kef have a flatter response and are super hard to drive--I've swapped out half a dozen amps trying to pair them correctly.  The listening experience is very different.

"godot","t5_2znmk","As I mentioned I was in the industry (not games, programming), since a while.

But I used to live in Europe, now I live in South America where demand and offer are on another level, and not in a positive way. Ended up working as a freelancer, from home, even before the pandemic. But since I live here, things have never been easy on that standpoint.

Now, after almost 10 years here, I'm getting some attention from recruiters, I have no idea why. Things are going well anyhow, I'm getting more jobs from international customers (I use mainly Fiverr) and generally better paid than local ones.

I believe that you can achieve that, find a job as a programmer, maybe it's better if you don't look in the game industry tho, normal programming is better paid and easier.

My advice is that once you ""know kungfu"", I mean, how to think as a programmer, you could learn any other language, and then learn how to use ""frameworks"", meaning libraries that allow you to do things faster, for example if you learn html+css+javascript you can learn react, angular, jquery and many other libraries to allow you to do certain tasks easier, or just because a very specific library requires that.

I am self-taught in everything I know (I spent lots of $$ in my first serious course and learned almost nothing, then I kept doing that but spending much less thanks to coursera and edx, useful for your CV I guess). And I think that's my (and probably many other's) superpower, I can learn new stuff alone just looking at the code, googling some documentation or stackexchange and understand how to adapt to my own needs almost, without needing to CTRL+C, CTRL+V (XD).

You could start creating something for youself, dunno, like a website in react. Or a mobile app using xamarin (C#). Personally I'm getting a lot of work with Drupal, themes, modules, a mix of the 2.",1640995374

A lot of people will say nothing bad can ever happen to you since they believe that you can't be forced and if something does happen some even blame the victim saying they wanted it deep down.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Dungeons: 5-man, spread from levels 30-80 (but you have an advantage if you're level 80), with story modes and harder explorable modes. You need to finish the story mode to be able to open explorable mode, but you can still join if someone else opens it. Officially abandoned. Can be pugged, but groups vary significantly dependent on experience so make sure you join the right ones.

&amp;nbsp;

All other modes are designed for level 80 characters.

&amp;nbsp;

Fractals: 5-man Mini dungeons available at multiple difficulty levels (tiers 1-4). Three of the fractals also have a challenge mode version which is much harder. Higher tiers are gated by the need for Agony Resistance, which (with some exceptions) can only be applied to ascended gear. Higher tiers are modified by ""instabilities"" that change daily. Fractals are the only content which *require* ascended gear, though it's good to have regardless. We got a fractal (with CM) not that long ago, but we don't know if more are coming. Easy to pug.

&amp;nbsp;

Strikes: 10-man, mostly single boss encounters (with two less-popular, and longer, event-style strikes). Intended to be an introduction to raid content. There will be a new set of these (with challenge modes) coming with the expansion. Simple to pug the easier ones.

&amp;nbsp;

Raids: 10-man content made of a mixture of event-style encounters and bosses. Most pug groups require experienced players, but there are a wide range of training guilds to get you started. Some specific masteries are required for some raids. Doubtful whether they will ever add any more.",1640995375

"MephHeads","t5_3jr4a","I filled my jars to different capacities, and didn't observe any difference in drying speed. What drives how I pack the jars is now my desire to not smash the nugs up. I started by basically making desiccant/flower lasagna, but the result was a lot of flattened buds. Now I do smaller jars for the popcorn and line the bottom/sides of the jar then fill them so that there's only the weight of nugs pressing down on the flowers. I take the large colas and keep them standing on their stems in the jars (chopped to the max size the jar can fit) with the desiccant packs between the colas. **So, long story short, you nailed it. Loose pack. Maximize surface area exposed to air for both buds and packs.**  

&gt; Also, I have a scale that has the capacity but not the needed accuracy. So rather than looking for the diminishing weight loss as an indicator of 'finishing' I thought I'd look at overall weight loss, I think 20%of original wet weight is what was mentioned in another of your threads. Thoughts on this?

On when drying is done ... this is still more an art than a science IMO, but yes ... the standard stopping point is when you're @ between [15-25% of the original wet weight](https://www.reddit.com/r/MephHeads/comments/hjgwxe/how_much_dry_weight_do_you_usually_get_based_on/). However, with the Govee devices in your jars, you have an even better mechanism! The measured RH in the jar tells you the water activity level of the contents of the jar, and water activity level is actually what we want to pay attention to. Most people will stop their drying at between 58-62% RH/water activity. So, just keep an eye on the RH measured in the jar. It will stay pegged at a max value for a while (~3-5days) and then it'll creep down to the RH that the desiccant packs can maintain (&lt;40%). At that point, the drying rate is really slowed down, and you can start removing the desiccant packs. You won't be done drying, but from this point on to get an accurate RH/water activity level you will need to remove the desiccant packs and wait for the jars to stabilize (~2-4hrs). 

At the end of the day, though, drying is a process and I would encourage you to mess around and find the process that works best for your environment. Some people think that bringing the water levels down slowly over 2 weeks produces the best results, while others swear that using a fast drier like the MyHerbNow machine produces results just as good. I suspect that there are multiple competing processes going on simultaneously while you dry, and so the drying curve you produce basically picks some of these processes to favor, and we just don't know what those processes are, at what water activity and temps they operate, and which ones are good for the smoke quality. One thing I know for sure, different molds require [different levels of water activity](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOLp9GBAEb3SrV8wP9dXZHDL6619zuYMCgTWkb5a2gI/edit?usp=sharing), and getting under 75% will eliminate most types of mold, so right now I recommend you crash down to 75% RH as quickly as possible, and then if you want to extend drying time, go for it (remove desiccant packs, for example) knowing that you're mostly safe from ruining your batch. Drying in the fridge changes the equation (you can stand more water for longer), but in general getting to 75% will all but guarantee success. 

Lastly, fridge drying has produced my most flavorful smoke, but it also seems to be harsh when it's fresh our of the fridge. I've found (and this is totally anecdotal) that taking nugs I want to smoke out of the fridge the night before and keeping them at room temp in their own jar makes the smoke smoother. When my nugs last longer than 6 mos, I find they don't need any time at room temp (and again, my heavy smoker friends say they're the best they've had in terms of flavor and potency).",1640995377

Perhaps you should put your bare nipple on the pavement and use that as a thermostat? Or your tongue? Perhaps spread your cheeks and try to get your asshole as close to it as possible? 

You will find that what feels hot to your asshole isn't what feels hot to the palm of your hand, and that won't be what feels hot to the soles of your feet.

And all of those things won't necessarily feel hot to the purpose-evolved durable dog pads that they walk on all day and night on all sorts of terrain of varying temperatures. There's no equivalency between the palm of your hand and dog pads, there's no 'common sense' that dictates 'hot to hand = hot to dog' that survives even basic investigation. 

What hurts your dog's paws will absolutely hurt your hand, but the other way around isn't necessarily true. You're better off putting the sole of your foot on the pavement, but even that isn't a direct comparison unless you habitually walk around with bare feet

Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?   
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich

Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont   
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?   
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich    
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons    
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons    
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont     
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All     
Darum schickte ein General    
'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher    
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär'    
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont     

Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger     
Jeder war ein großer Krieger     
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk    
Das gab ein großes Feuerwerk    
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft    
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht

Dabei schoss man am Horizont    
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister    
Streichholz und Benzinkanister   
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute    
Witterten schon fette Beute    
Riefen: ""Krieg!"" und wollten Macht    
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht    
Dass es einmal so weit kommt

Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons    
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons    
Neunundneunzig Luftballons    

Neunundneunzig Jahre Krieg    
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger     
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr     
Und auch keine Düsenflieger    
Heute zieh' ich meine Runden    
Seh' die Welt in Trümmern liegen

"aoe2","t5_2sg7u","I'm not saying it should compete Crossbows, even with 6 range they lose. The thing is- how badly they lose. Their current state is an exclusive role- countering only Eagles and Huskarls. Besides that you better make Crossbows.

One more thing, ""Anti-infantry is their whole thing"" is a wrong perspective,conceptually in AOE this sentence applies ONLY to trash units, aka Halbs and Skirms, ALL other units in the game have multiple dimensions. 

For example Condotiero isn't just an Anti-Gunpowder unit, it doesn't end there, it's an instant Elite infantry Unit. Superior than most non-Elite infantry counterparts.
Or even Kamayuks, they're not just good vs. Cavalry, their secondary aspect is the mass-abuse factor, they do absurdly well vs most infantry units.
And one more example just to be sure you understand my point about these principles in AOE, Camel Archers aren't just good against CA type units, they shred pretty much anything, and with their unique tech they become one of the most gold efficient units in the game.",1640995379

"looper","t5_2ukgb","Uh huh. Did you actually read what you wrote? 

The Rainmaker can ""make"" double loops happen? That's just you making up stuff.  

And, even if he can make a double loop happen, he'd need to control the people in the past so that:

* no one kills Old Joe -- not just the diner, but at anytime... again, lots of people looking for him...
* no one captures Young Joe before he can... kill himself (and Old Joe) in the cornfield -- lots of chances for Young Joe to get caught and/or killed...
* make sure Old Joe does the 'gold back spin thing' and not die... 
* and.... make Young Joe and his Mom fall in love... well, I guess that doesn't need to happen, but make sure Young Joe find him to protect him... 

This is some literal God level control of people, time, and places. 

If, as you say, the ""second loop version of Cid"" needs to live so he can become the Rainmaker... well, how did the ""first loop version of Cid"" (who presumable does NOT become the Rainmaker??) know this and make the second loop happen?  First version Cid ""knew"" things that hadn't happened... well, literally DID NOT happen in the first loop. 

If you'd like time travel stories that are, at least, internally consistent watch the series Dark, the movie Primer, or Twelve Monkeys. Hell, even the ""back to the future"" movies are more consistent than Looper.

As for tactical combat, may I offer something that actually does seem like a forgotten gem? The game is Jagged Alliance 2. You might get shot to pieces. But in case you don't, I think the 1.13 project may *still* be going on. I lost touch with it a *long* while back, because I suck at video games, but it just might scratch the itch.

2. Not against the law to ask someone finds votes you believe are missing.  Seriously  why do you think that would be against the law?

3. It is against st the law to start a riot, but Trump didn't start a riot. He planned and called for a peaceful protest.  A riot broke out but you don't go to jail for the actions of others if you don't call for them to break the law.

4. Yes it literally  does matter which is why he hasn't been and won't be charged with a crime

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","Copy and pasted for you(yall learn yourselves) Definitely NO. It would starve from hunger of weapons, trade, monetary finance, UN vetoes, media propaganda, etc.

The USA has been the biggest financier for Israel since the 1950s, taking this role from Israel’s “mother-in-law”: UK.

Without support from the USA mainly, and UK formerly, Israel would not have existed basically. The Jewish settlers would not have come to Palestine at the late 19th century, without finance from the USA and UK’s tycoons. The UK has supported the Jewish settlements in Palestine since the late 1880s and passed many laws to allow the Zionists expand their settlements. Also, the Zionists entirely depended on the UK to fund the mass killings and war of independence, in 1948.

However, after 1948, the UK, leaving the role to the USA, decided to leave the mess it created in the Middle East after more than 70 years of colonization in that area.

Since that, the USA has very much took care of its 52th state. And has supported it pretty much more than the UK ever done.

Militarily, Israel has been entirely equipped by the USA since the second half of the past century. The USA equipped Israel better than any country in the Middle East. No war Israel entered and could have won without the USA.

Economically, Israel is heavily dependent on the funds it receives from the tycoons, the Jewish and non-Jewish organizations in the USA. American trade shapes a big part of the Israeli economy.

It’s a really big issue, however, in a nutshell, without the USA, Israel will literally be crushed.",1640995381

When we start using the new clinic, I will ask for an extensive eye exam.  He has a slightly entropian lid on his right upper lid(I think that was the eye in the picture), and we need to have that addressed, too. But now I think about it, this was one of the issues address in one of the summer visits.  That eye got weepy, the vet mentioned the entropian, and gave us drops to give him.  And everything seemed to clear up.  But that is also about the time that his eyes started getting really cloudy.  I don't know what the drops were, I would need to dig through those records again to find out.  But I was refilling his rimadyl on chewy when the drops came up as a suggestion, and I thought it might help with the cloudiness.

I was worried about a cancerous tumor, and was so relieved that it was just a lipoma that I didn't even think about asking anything other than ""You sure?"".  But I worry that it could become cancerous at a later date.  Something else to ask at his next visit.

And I so appreciate the info about the kidneys and diet.  I might ask the new vet if they can put him on something like lisinopril to try and preserve his kidneys.

Thank you so much again.  &lt;3",1640995382

Right, but that's importantly different than the previous claim, that ""If A is larger than B, we ought to believe it."" 

This says that *the fact itself*, A being larger than B, is sufficient for us being obliged to believe A is larger than B. But it clearly isn't sufficient, because the mere fact that a claim is true doesn't tell us anything about its epistemic status (as justified or not).

In fact, if the implication held, it would basically mean we're obliged to believe everything which is the case, regardless of whether we have evidence or justification for believing it. That's not just wrong, it's pretty clearly absurd.

The title is a bit harsher than the situation....I hope! 

Basically my partner and I are planning to have a kid and as I'm keen to experience carrying a child, this is not a cheap process due to us being a lesbian couple.  
That's fine though, we have accepted it and have been planning/saving for this for several years. 

So onto the situation, I have recently changed jobs and will be working for a call centre for a well known bank. I was late to one of our training sessions one day because of an appointment and so as the conversation  came up, I mentioned that my partner and I were going through fertility treatment. A well meaning colleague then said that she felt it was ridiculous that we should pay for any part of the process. I then said while I wish it wasn't such a burden, I'm glad with the NHS (Scotland) some of it is covered and to be honest if we can't afford this we should probably think twice about having kids as if you choose to have kids I personally don't think you should expect someone else to provide them. 
I did say this to colleague who I know has 2 kids from a previous marriage who then married a man who also had a 2 kids from a previous and then they had 2 more kids. She works part time and he is on disability for stress...while I did not mean my comment to judge anyone directly, she has not spoken to me directly since, it's  been 2 weeks...AITA for indirectly judging my colleague?

Because you've been brainwashed by meritocratic ideas that only the best of the best is worthy? And that's why reviewers don't give average scores, because it makes people like you incredibly upset.

Fairly certain almost all of those games have a score above 80, and all of them are slightly to moderately above average in terms of quality, all the ones I've played from that list I would give a 3 or 3.5 at best. *Fallen Order* is the only one kind of snuffed, and I think that's because it set itself up to be compared to both *Dark Souls* and *Uncharted* and came back lacking in people's eyes for not doing the best of both worlds. 

Where we're probably not seeing eye to eye is that I think &lt;20 games in existence deserve a 5/5 probably. The bell curve for average in games is much lower than other media, and few games are flawless. Compared to film, literature, and television, games just haven't had much time to evolve and are much more complicated, and most of the best games I've ever played are rife with obvious major flaws. The simpler a game is, the more likely it is to not be deeply flawed, but most of the games people love most are insanely complicated and have a good chunk of stupid bullshit.",1640995384

Once you do have your own space though, I find that a simple ""Have I used or thought about this object in the past year"" to be a good barometer. Anything that fails that simple test gets donated or tossed. Photo albums and other items with sentimental value get a pass, but that's a dangerous road because you have to decide for yourself what truly has sentimental value, and what's just an obsolete relic of a bygone age.

With that said, I have a cardboard box just rammed with PS2 games I will probably never play again that I can't bring myself to get rid of, so...",1640995384

As the paragraph in this study states adapting to smaller fat sources leads to a new dominant hominem. Maybe you're too dumb to understand the connection though.

&gt;The worldwide association of H. erectus with elephants is well documented and so is the preference of humans for fat as a source of energy. We show that rather than a matter of preference, H. erectus in the Levant was dependent on both elephants and fat for his survival. **The disappearance of elephants from the Levant some 400 kyr ago coincides with the appearance of a new and innovative local cultural complex** – the Levantine Acheulo-Yabrudian and, as is evident from teeth recently found in the Acheulo-Yabrudian 400-200 kyr site of Qesem Cave, **the replacement of H. erectus by a new hominin**. We employ a bio-energetic model to present a hypothesis **that the disappearance of the elephants, which created a need to hunt an increased number of smaller and faster animals while maintaining an adequate fat content in the diet, was the evolutionary drive behind the emergence of the lighter, more agile, and cognitively capable hominins.** Qesem Cave thus provides a rare opportunity to study the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of our post-erectus ancestors, the fat hunters.

Currently watching DD S3.  No fucking way Cox is going to be able to Carry a solo film like RDJ, Paul Rudd or Chadwick Boseman.  He just doesn’t have the charisma of those guys, and neither does Brie Larson, though she does appear to be working on it.

Go watch some videos on how much people can change, Duane Johnson comes to mind, for putting a little effort into understanding how to present the best version of themselves.  It really shows through offscreen but I’d say it also translates to better on screen performances as well.

I would also add that Cox’ acting strengths lie in the dramatic beaten down scenes so any DD film playing to his strengths would need to be exceptionally dark and that’s not yet something I convinced Disney is going to allow.  Hence why I think he lacks the skills to carry a traditional MCU film, even though it works fine on a dark TV show.",1640995386

I do use the Erebus's ability to inflict damage without exposing the robot. In some instances, I have targeted enemy robots with extremely low health and destroyed them with just one ability discharge.  
I cannot tell you which is superior, however, in Champion League, the Fafnir is used extensively. I'm certainly not in champion league but as Adrian Chong suggested, work towards those robots(and weapons) that are currently used in Champion League.

First two plots have case numbers on a linear scale, next two plots are exactly the
same but with case numbers on a log scale.

First (and third) plot show an exponential trendline, second (and fourth) are SIR
models that assume 20% of infections will be detected via testing.

Expected case numbers if the current  trend continues:

    day  cases  68% range
    ---------------------
    Sun:   539    435—648
    Mon:   650    521—790
    Tue:   781    619—958
    Wed:   937   737—1158
    Thu:  1116   868—1391
    Fri:  1322  1015—1662
    Sat:  1556  1182—1966

The current doubling time is
3.2 days.

Usual disclaimer about trendlines:

&gt; The plotted exponential trendlines in the above plots are simple extrapolations of
&gt; what will happen if Reff remains at its current value. the SIR model projection,
&gt; although it accounts for the effect of increasing immunity, still assumes that
&gt; Reff otherwise remains constant.
&gt; 
&gt; This does not take into account that things are in a state of flux. If
&gt; restrictions are tightened, the virus should have fewer opportunities for spread,
&gt; and Reff will decrease. If restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact
&gt; tracing may suppress spread to a greater or lesser degree over time. The above
&gt; plots specifically showing the effect of population immunity do take into account
&gt; a reduction in Reff as immunity due to infections increases, but ignores any other
&gt; possible future changes in Reff.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people
&gt; each infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of Reff to vary
&gt; randomly in time. As such the projections should be taken with a grain of salt—it
&gt; is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.

From what you've said in the comments, it's clear safety is a concern. Take precautions to shield your address and contact information from his parents. Safety is another reason I recommend not engaging with the wife, not be even letting her know your plan to return the gold. You're correct that any communication with her is essentially communication with him. Good luck!

"LightNovels","t5_2sloz","&gt;Type the [REC] tag in the beginning title for posts that are asking for novel recommendations.

Light Novel recommendation request posts require the **[REC] tag in the beginning of the title.** (With brackets) Please do read over the submission guidelines more carefully in the future. Please note that Tags do not equal Flairs. Title Tags are pieces of information you type into the title of the post while our Automod looks for posts with specific tags and assigns flairs appropriately. 

**General tips for Recommendation Request Posts:**

* If you have an MAL/MU/Etc list of Light Novels you've read, please include it so people aren't just recommending you series you've already read.
* Explain what about the series you've read that you liked. (Without Spoilers) It'll help people find series with similar styles and themes.
* Don't slander series. If you don't like a series, it's fine to say that you don't like it. But if you start bashing a bunch of series, why would people want to recommend you something? 

If you're new to the medium and looking to start reading as a beginner, please keep the following in mind. As the industry grows and new series are introduced all the time, there's never a truly unifying ""good beginner series."" The common sentiment is that if you're new to Light Novels by way of another medium like anime or manga, your best bet when starting is to find some series with adaptations you already enjoy and to check if their source material has been licensed/translated. Light Novels aren't a stylistic genre so asking for what are good light novels for beginners will range widely based on the person and their taste. It's akin to asking the /r/Books ""What are some good books for beginners?""",1640995388

&gt;. You use French people flippantly, but considering how much of history is filled with violence and discrimination on the basis of nationality (see discrimination in Asian countries 

I'm not using french people flippantly. I'm asking you if you think hatred of French people in particular necessitates hatred of the entire white race. Words have definitions.


&gt;They don't have to if both are illegal immigrants. 

You can't tell if someone is undocumented by looking at them either, hence the racism


&gt;And people of noncolor like white people. It's used towards all types of people who are part of groups that commit crimes. 

Not typically, no


&gt;Take it up with Chris Rock.

Chris Rock, known arbiter of truth of all things black.


&gt;I did no such thing. You did

Yes, only because you said it first and I wanted to clarify


&gt;we shouldn't call people colonizers for being born in a place they had no choice in. 

You're making yet another false equivalence. 


&gt;Again, this applies to PoC as well. This makes them colonizers too. Which proves my point that the tiktok i mentioned earlier shows that people use colonizer to refer to race and not the actual action of colonization. 

In certain circumstances sure, that doesn't disprove the point that white people are vastly more likely to engage in colonization while people of color are typically victims of it. Thanks for proving my point and stating that it isn't a racial slur though.


&gt;Have you tried just not calling people racial slurs and using words like ""counter-revolutionary"" and ""worm?""

Once again, its not a racial term. Gusano doesn't apply to all Latinos, nor does it attempt to. Nor has it historically ever been.


&gt;Also, unless you are Cuban yourself, this rhetoric is just a form of cultural appropriation and imperialism towards Cuban culture. 

""Saying a word"" isn't cultural appropriation. Castro calling someone a name isn't a part of Hispanic or Cuban culture. You even making this statement is indicative that all your statements have been in bad faith


&gt;Are you okay? How does this logically counter my argument?

Because you said that the term was racist because it wasn't in English. I gave you two examples of words that were and weren't racist and were and were not English. It directly invalidates your point.


&gt;If you're having a conversation and you're pulling words like that purely because of their German ancestory that you don't hold, then yeah I would consider that a racial slur

I'm pulling words that aren't in English, because you stated that non English insults are racist.


&gt;Have you ever just considered not appropriating other languages for your own self interest in insulting others?

Have you considered engaging in good faith?",1640995389

Zoey in ROTI had a really good arc where she started out shy and deciding to be compassionate and nice since she figured that was a good way to make friends, however by the end when the competition started getting rough and Scott started antagonising her she realised that she had inadvertently made herself super weak and put herself in this vulnerable position for terrible things to happen to her, and as a result becomes Commando Zoey. However, in the next episode she realised that that’s just not who she is and decides to be true to herself and save Cam over finishing the challenge. As a result she is eliminated but leaves true to who she is and has a stronger sense of identity and a reaffirmation of how important of a quality empathy is to her.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","A hulking man made his way into a nondescript diner, sidling through a door not designed for people quite his size.

*Annie's Diner*.  To all appearances a perfectly normal place to grab a bite for anyone who found themselves in the quietest borough of the city.

In actuality it was a neutral meeting place for heroes, villains, mercenaries and vigilantes.

The zero-tolerance no-fighting policy of the establishment was enforced by the proprietor herself, known as Uncanny Annie to those who patronized the restaurant for reasons other than dining.  It was an impressive feat given that the city boasted superhumans in a higher concentration - and of a higher caliber - than any other city on this side of the country.

Keeping the exact specs of one's powers under wraps was standard practice for supers, but Annie raised it to an art form.  No one - not the villains who were her most enthusiastic customers, nor the heroes who were her most grudging - knew how she visited such swift and final punishment on those who used her space as a way to ambush their enemies.

Which made it the perfect place for the man, Hector, to hold this meeting, given that the person he'd come to see had both a reason and the skill to attempt such an ambush.

Behind the counter, a pale, gaunt woman nodded unnecessarily toward the only occupied booth in the place.  She then disappeared into the kitchen to give her patrons their privacy, though Hector seemed to feel the ghost of her regard skittering over him in her wake anyway.

'*Uncanny' is just about right,* he thought to himself.  He put her out of his mind and made his way to the booth.

Every step made the stone in his chest heavier.  But he took each step, as he must, until he stood beside the booth and its occupants.

On one side sat two mercenaries, both familiar from various assignments.  Toggle and Gazelle Gambit.  Bodyguards in a place where bodyguards weren't needed.  They wouldn't do anything to Hector, were even now vacating their seats to take up positions at other corners of the diner per a silent signal from the remaining individual.  A tacit message that Hector was not to be trusted, Annie's rules or not.

""May I?""  Hector asked, gesturing to the empty seat.

The slight figure looked up at him silently, face still but with eyes set in a flensing gaze, then lifted a hand, half invitation, half command.

Hector sat.  The gravity of the moment was strained by his almost comical struggle to squeeze tree-trunk thighs between bench and table.  His shoulders nearly spanned the width of the booth that had easily accommodated both mercenaries.

""Thank you for meeting with me, Spoke.""

Spoke said nothing in reply.

""Did you see the press conference?""

Spoke raised an eyebrow.  A lauded superhero voluntarily resigning - and explicitly stating his own distrust of his restraint as the reason for that resignation - was unmissably high-profile news. The least plugged-in person on the planet saw that press conference.  For a villainous super-inventor whose specialties handily encompassed cutting-edge surveillance technology to miss it was beyond laughable.

Doubly so if said villainous super-inventor had recently been on the receiving end of the decidedly unrestrained thrashing that was the impetus for that resignation in the first place.

""Right.  Well I... I wanted to restate it all in person.  I was wrong.  Not just about thinking you were the one who... who...""

Hector trailed off, looking down and away as he tried to tamp down the energy unspooling inside him in response to his fury, his frustration.

His helplessness.

White light limned his body for a moment, and he would have floated a few inches from the bench if he weren't wedged so firmly in the seat; the table did groan slightly against the pressure of his levitating form.  Tables away, Toggle stiffened and glanced at the kitchen area where Annie was still sequestered, no doubt wondering if activating his power-cancelling field constituted a breach of her rules.

Hector gained control of his power and his voice after a moment, glancing back to Spoke who took in the display with no apparent reaction besides a slight crease in his brow.

""I don't mean thinking you were the one who attacked my home, my family.  Even without that you were fair game as far as pursuing you goes.  I'm here to apologize, but that doesn't mean I have to mince words.  You are a villain.  You are a criminal, a murderer, and a terrorist.""

He paused, glaring across the table now as if daring Spoke to deny any of it.  Spoke had instead schooled his features back to total impassivity.  Only the slightest tilt to his head to indicate attention, nothing more that would validate the hero's evaluation.  Hector sighed slightly and continued.

""You're all of those things, but you're also a person, and a citizen of this city.  I swore to uphold justice.  Swore it to everyone in this city, and if I meant it only for people who don't commit crimes or don't have records or... or any other broken metric like that then... Then it wouldn't be justice.  Rights aren't inviolable if people pick and choose.

When I... when I found you, when we fought, that was fair.  But then I had you, got you away from your tech and your traps.  You were at my mercy and I just... forgot.  Forgot I could and should hand you over to the authorities.  Forgot I was there to bring you to justice, not to get revenge or to... to torture you.""

Hector paused, gathering himself.  Spoke's mask of calm was shaky: small twitches, the bulge of a clenched jaw, lips pressed to whiteness.  Across the room, Toggle was rapt.  Gazelle Gambit was looking at Hector with unreserved hatred.

He'd given a loftier version of all this at the press conference, written mostly by PR experts whose excessive spin he'd excised in favor more from-the-heart adlibs during the actual speech - when it was too late for them to protest.  It was hard to say when he'd been addressing a crowd mostly comprised of supporters.  They gave him something to work with at least, even if it was mostly varying degrees of dismay.

Sitting across from the man he'd last seen bloodied, battered - *maimed* even - at Hector's own hands, though?  Sitting across from that mask that may have passed for the affectation of a mysterious villain but was just as likely a cover for genuine, acute fear towards an assailant?  It was different, and much harder than he'd expected.

""My head was full of images of blood.  Seeing my wife and my boy in *our home* that I thought you'd made into a *deathtrap*.  It was violating to a degree I didn't know I could feel, shook me like I didn't know I could be shaken.  Didn't know what was up, what was down.  Didn't care about what was right or wrong.  I chose the name Beacon because I wanted to be someone other supers could model themselves after.  An example that people with different abilities shouldn't be held to different standards.

Villain or not, I wronged you.  I broke my oath to you to uphold justice, whether or not you value that justice, because you deserve it either way.  Because you're a person.  And, on top of it all: the fact that I know now that you never lifted a finger against my family.  So, Spoke.

I am sorry.""

For a long time, Spoke said nothing in response to the hero's apology.  Toggle frowned thoughtfully, seeming to chew on the words to see how much sincerity he could taste in them; Gazelle Gambit looked disgusted.  Uncanny Annie had reappeared, leaning against the kitchen's door frame, eyeing the pair with a speculative expression.  Sensing or anticipating an attack from Spoke?

But no, Spoke continued to sit and stare.  Then he lifted his hands, slowly, and with the only real emotion he'd allowed his face to express - a dagger-sharp smirk - he began to clap.  He let the sound hang in the air long enough for everyone to appreciate the drama of the gesture.  Then Spoke spoke.

""I really believe you believe all that, Beacon.""

Each state has it's own sales tax requirements, provisions, etc., as do some counties and cities. Sales tax can be a nightmare for online sellers. 

Not knowing where you will sell (some may be out state), the best advice is to talk with a professional one on one who has experience in sales tax. As you sell items, keep track of the states and amounts and research each sales tax law, or do this in advance if you know you will sell into select states. 

In order to record sales tax in the state, you will need to register in the respective states where you have nexus and meet the threshold for filing, so a professional from the get go will help you remain compliant. There are also online services that can help outside of Amazon.",1640995391

Hi Brethren,  
HAPPY NEW YEAR IN GOSPEL, DELIVERED BY THE ANOINTED CHRISTS = SATGURUS JESUS AND HIS SECOND COMING NANAK.  
Youtube Video:- https://youtu.be/OMRyrKDXNG4  
The reason for Christ Jesus to appear was that the Jews outwardly of appearances, the FAKE proclaiming themselves to be the Chosen People of demiurge Yahweh who brought Abram of the Semitic race, a mix of the Negro and Aryan, who hated none but loved all from the Iraq area to the Middle East to establish an ideal society and he was given the Promised Land as the Garden of Eden. They were living in the company of their creator demiurge Lord of the Nature Yahweh and for his faith, he was named ""Abraham"". Now, so far the generation of Abraham, an ideal Adam and Sarah, an ideal Eve, were faithful ""Salt of Abraham"", an honest and truthful as Joseph of the twelve sons of Jacob was, they enjoyed the best fruit of the Garden of Eden but as soon as they became unfaithful and Saltless people as the Eleven crook liars and murderers were who wanted to kill the Nathanael like true Israelite with no duplicity Joseph was but the Saltless brethren sold the faithful Salt of the Earth Joseph as a slave to the faithful to Abraham Salt of the Earth Egyptians of Ishmael, the Elder son of Abraham, there he was honoured among them and was given the highest position of honour among them whilst the unfaithful to Abraham liars and murderer sons were rejected by the Nobel Man Abraham to whom the Promised Land belonged and such Saltless super bastards unfaithful to Abraham and Yahweh people – John 8v44, the Tares Matt 13v24-30 that are being bundled up in Israel for the Final Burning in the ensuing ATOMIC WAR expected on 14/05/2023 when Israel is 75 years old - had no place in Adam to inherit and live. Yahweh was also not happy either and no rain or crops for them to eat. All these natural disasters that are taking place in the world are a punishment to the cruel people who have committed atrocities against childlike innocent people. No such natural disasters among the faithful tribal sons of Adam living in the African and Brazilian jungles. Then, they had to leave the Promised Land for Egypt where they started to misuse their spiritual talents with evil spirits and ended up as slaves to the Salt of the Earth Egyptians where Salt of Abraham Joseph had become the ruler. In other words, the faithful to Abraham and Yahweh Nobel people of Joseph, the Samaritans were honoured anywhere they went whilst the clever crook generations of the Eleven Patriarchs were hated and killed in holocausts by the tribal sons of Man. Thus, when the English were English and not Conservative or Labour, they killed the bloodsucking cheating Jews outwardly and not the good Samaritans, the Salt of Nobel Abraham. John, the Baptist, the last Prophet Elijah, the Cornerstone of the Temple was ousted out by the greedy Rabbis dressed in silken clothes and Christ Jesus exposed their hypocrisy and they killed Him.

There’s definitely a point of diminishing returns, I probably wouldn’t use Fuenteseca, though maybe I would at least once for trying. Still, cocktails often cover the flaws of the base spirit, but very simple cocktails like sours and old fashioned will really be elevated by a better base spirit. It’s good to have a well, I use Tapatio blanco as mine, but there’s definitely a difference worth exploring imo. Tapatio añejo margs are insanely tasty, everybody should have one.",1640995394

I’d say my tactics were successful in that way. I did other things like cook and bake for her too. She appreciated that as she was big on cooking and baking.

Double edged sword. Some women love the chase/to be chased. Some women don’t. Personally - I’m more into the type who don’t. So this is a filter in itself. I told other women I was interested in and they were like, “oh, yeah, this doesn’t work for me.” (Various reasons - not because they found me unattractive - just wasn’t going to be a good match)

Oh - I would say the woman I was married to was more of the type who likes the chase a bit too. She’s very flirtatious and all that and likes feeling like she has some sexual power over men.

Respirators protect the wearer from inhaling droplets and aerosols, as well as protecting people around the wearer. Fit is still important; a well-fitting cloth mask could offer better protection than an ill-fitting respirator according to Theresa Tam.

Governments have been hesitant to discuss the airborne nature of the virus but scientists seem to recognize that it is airborne. That means that ventilation and aerosol transmission also plays a role - on top of transmission through droplets.

All this is to say that cloth masks are still very useful for preventing droplet transmission in general, and public health guidelines generally recommend wearing at least some form of cloth mask. But respirators offer protection against aerosols whereas cloth masks do not.

See the [Government of Canada's](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/types-masks-respirators.html) advice on choosing a mask for more information.",1640995395

Once I invested the relatively small amount of time at a dummy to make the rotation second-nature, that's when the class ""clicked"" and the rest is history.

All that is to say, sometimes you don't just fall into a class right away and know how it'll really feel for you once its full kit opens up. Give it some time if you think you like the foundation.

"LightNovels","t5_2sloz","&gt;Type the [REC] tag in the beginning title for posts that are asking for novel recommendations.

Light Novel recommendation request posts require the **[REC] tag in the beginning of the title.** (With brackets) Please do read over the submission guidelines more carefully in the future. Please note that Tags do not equal Flairs. Title Tags are pieces of information you type into the title of the post while our Automod looks for posts with specific tags and assigns flairs appropriately. 

**General tips for Recommendation Request Posts:**

* If you have an MAL/MU/Etc list of Light Novels you've read, please include it so people aren't just recommending you series you've already read.
* Explain what about the series you've read that you liked. (Without Spoilers) It'll help people find series with similar styles and themes.
* Don't slander series. If you don't like a series, it's fine to say that you don't like it. But if you start bashing a bunch of series, why would people want to recommend you something? 

If you're new to the medium and looking to start reading as a beginner, please keep the following in mind. As the industry grows and new series are introduced all the time, there's never a truly unifying ""good beginner series."" The common sentiment is that if you're new to Light Novels by way of another medium like anime or manga, your best bet when starting is to find some series with adaptations you already enjoy and to check if their source material has been licensed/translated. Light Novels aren't a stylistic genre so asking for what are good light novels for beginners will range widely based on the person and their taste. It's akin to asking the /r/Books ""What are some good books for beginners?""",1640995396

I think the side plot that really throws people off is Luv (Jared Leto's replicant) because her behavior is a bit contradictory. She wants Replicants to be equal to humanity just like the rest, but she's apparently a bit more ""successful"" as far as Leto's attempt at creating Replicants that can't disobey him. The best she can do is malicious compliance, or at least hating humans as much as possible while still doing her job, so she usually just seems angry as hell. She also seems to be *jealous* of Rachel for being capable of having children. I think she's a really interesting character, but there's no ""this is who she is"" moment so people didn't know what to think of her.

Actually, I think the whole ""Replicants that obey"" thing is the aspect it never explains well enough. Clearly Leto's character actually did make Replicants that obey him, but it's a powerful psychological drive or something, because ultimately Replicants are just humans made of slightly different stuff. The movie shows Replicants (including K) struggling against that to varying degrees but it might rely too heavily on subtle acting and implication for it to even be considered a solid plot point.",1640995397

I have used implements where 4 plates loaded on is roughly as easy as 135 on a bar and others where 2 45's is heavier than 265.

You would have to have the length of the implement, the weight of the implement and the distance from the lever point to be able to calculate the weight of your Viking press. 

If you have a scale that can handle it you can stand on the scale with the weight in your hands and subtract your body weight. You can do it with it empty to get your empty implement weight, then put a plate on to see what % of that weight is in your hands and go from there. That is the ""easiest"" way to do it.

You're unlikely to be able to translate the weight you performed on your implement to whatever the contest implement is, so you'd be best to go to where the promoter trains and try it there.",1640995398

Is it possible that you've experienced exclusively bad GMs with poor reasons for disallowing aliens? Sure. Is it not just as possible that said GMs have experienced exclusively bad players who play terrible alien characters? Also yes.

Personally, I allow aliens when running the actual Traveller universe. In non-TU games, it depends on the setting. In the setting I'm currently running across three campaigns, Aslan and Vargr are allowed, along with a handful of other races not from the Traveller setting. *However,* the area of space they're in is human-dominated, and the alien players know to expect to be treated as outsiders when visiting worlds with less cosmopolitan populations.",1640995398

"spacex","t5_2srow","&gt; We need global and standard system for satellite operators to share future \_\_planned\_\_ orbits maneuvers (and probably current orbit data).

This type of sharing &amp; planning is already performed by the 18 SPSC.

https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa-spacex_starlink_agreement_final.pdf

&gt;The standard Conjunction Assessment (CA) process used by NASA and other operators is based on
services provided by the U.S. Air Force 18th Space Control Squadron (18 SPCS) at Vandenberg Air
Force Base. Users send predicted trajectory information through a file exchange website, Space-
Track.org, as **ephemeris files that contain modelling of future planned maneuvers** to 18 SPCS. 18 SPCS
then screens that trajectory data against the space object catalog that they maintain, as well as against the
orbit trajectory information that they produce themselves for the spacecraft based on tracking data from
their Space Surveillance Network (SSN), which does not contain planned maneuvers. Results from **both**
screenings are sent in the form of a set of Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs) to the Owner/Operator
(O/O), who performs a risk assessment, determines the need for a mitigation maneuver, and executes such
a maneuver if needed.

Unless you're just objecting that 18 SPSC is a US entity, not an international one?

No, the *real* problem is that Starlink has an autonomous collision avoidance system (ironically this is [exactly the solution the ESA, another Starlink critic, has been pushing for](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/09/Predicted_near_miss_between_Aeolus_and_Starlink_44)), so coordination is needed to avoid *both* satellites maneuvering simultaneously.

Right now the agreement is that Starlink *will* maneuver to avoid collisions, and NASA assets *won't*. Easy peasy.",1640995398

"CompetitiveHalo","t5_2usxt","Aim assist is strong etc.. but people are not even considering a change to bullet magnetism.

The reason why aim assist can be as consistent as it is is because it allows players to constantly be inside of the bulletmag radius, but rarely dead on target.

Not even the top players manage to be dead on target at all times but they still manage to hit more shots on average (also allows lesser aimers to simply outgun them at times)..  reason why we miss on MnK is because we simply can't be as close as consistently, but when we do hit we are more than likely dead on target (i.e  making small micro adjustments to hit,  more or less what happens in most other games). 

Bridge the gap by making the bulletmag smaller and forcing people to be more accurate on the player model itself.. i suspect it won't be as much of a change  for kbm players but will force controller to be a little more on point without actually changing the  rotational aim assist itself (which imho is what most controller players are crying about not wanting it removed etc).",1640995398

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","Well, the main use of loops, as I explained, is usually for the side effects. Loops are not used to process values and return something -&gt; returning is done by expression evaluation or functions, which perform it.

If you're trying to make sense of putting a loop in a variable, then because they're used for side effects you can either:

- save them like process objects, delaying their execution until a certain point
- use them as listener objects, where they can execute the next iteration upon some event
- use them as generator objects, where you both control when the next execution is run as well as potentially capture whatever the loop may yield

&gt; What would this syntax mean?

Place whatever your loop is in x and get its last member. Now, there might be some step in-between (ex. in Python you'd probably need to enclose it in a list or tuple since iterators are not indexable), but the main thing you're doing is you're resolving your expression to the last yield value instead of a generator, listener, process or whatever.

As for what `yield` should mean, well, what it means in most languages - produce a value when one needs to be consumed. It's like a `return` but it doesn't exit the current context, rather waits for the next time a value needs to be consumed.",1640995399

It was just loud and exciting, race cars crashed all the time but drivers always walked away. Then when the ambulance showed up and the medics ran out on the track I got a little worried. Then the Medics stopped rushing and my dad told me that was a really bad sign. After a few minutes of the crowd being silent, they announced that the driver had passed away and the rest of the racing that day would be cancelled. It really shook me and I stopped wanting to go to races for a couple years. I couldn’t stay away from racing though but came back with a new appreciation for all the safety efforts.

It even got to the point that a white expat got a Taiwanese-American deported because she didn't like the viewpoint that he expressed. Meanwhile, that expat was given a slot in a prestigious newspaper. 

Secondly, the number one point that could result in a ragnarok-like war between China and the USA is Taiwan. Such a war would be an utter disaster for *all* asians in the United States. Increased tensions because of Taiwan is already a significant problem for all Asians.

Compromising women’s rights, for example, is directly harming someone else and their autonomy. Living a green and vegetarian (or vegan!) lifestyle is great on the individual level and I agree with others that it’s a good thing to put pressure on the meat industry. 

Shaming others for not living a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle or for not being able to do it for other reasons (health, dietary, financial) is not cool. I think recycling or composting would be a more relevant comparison? Most people have the means and/or capacity to do them and it would benefit the environment, but it hasn’t become mainstreamed in society as much as it probably should be. 

I live off of a plant-based diet too. I do it for moral reasons too as well as for sustainable living, so I totally get the stance John has on this. Even though I have a similar lifestyle / perspective about animal’s rights and saving the planet, what I found condescending was how it was written.

The way he phrased his caption specifically (not the carousel post which I agreed with) talks down to the reader. You can’t gatekeep “caring about animals” and “saving the planet” when these issues require a collective effort to shift towards a greener future. 

A glance at their social media tells me that Katie has repeatedly worn and advertised products bought from unsustainable/unethical brands (Victoria’s Secret, Shein) and John has numerous examples of “unsustainable living” on his social media, notably in his many airplane-related ventures, constant use of non-green motorcycles, and advertising food from unethical brands, as well. 

If he isn’t going to live fully sustainably and ethically to “save the world and care for animals”, it’s a bit hypocritical to criticize that in other people, going so far as to imply that you *don’t* care about animals or the planet if you’re not vegetarian. Does he think the same of his own carbon footprint? The clothes he buys, the unsustainable brands he advertises? 

By jokingly (?) calling vegetarianism a trigger for non-vegetarians and following it with the sentence in question, it also reads like John is making fun of people who aren’t vegetarian, and he is also implying that *not* being vegetarian means that you don’t care about the planet or about animals.

I think promoting vegetarianism is great, especially for someone with as much visibility as him. But telling people “hey, you’re a shitty, uncaring person if you’re *not* vegetarian” isn’t productive and essentially just insults the people he’s trying to reach.

While it’s always the default pattern, it will deviate if there is back filling on a lane. So the right and left belts will alternate between the two output belts, unless it detects there is nowhere to output on either output belt, in which case both input belts take turns on the single open output belt. I was also wondering if it was a graphic thing, but unfortunately can’t mess with it at the moment, Ive been reminiscing on factorio and posted an older video. 

Ive been thinking about how it would work in the way the graphics look and assuming they are somehow wrong and I honestly can’t say I understand it.

I do remember that when there is no middle splitter and just a filter what I ended up with was engines just swapping with wood for a S/E cycle. For some reason having that second splitter allows it to become a S/E/E cycle, which really doesn’t make sense if it’s actually doing what it shows graphically since it would be the same pathing as just having two splitters so should still be just a S/E cycle.",1640995401

"gog","t5_2sj1u","well, the arguments for owning a game are never about the breaking of the EULA (as in, owning the *proprietary work* itself, such as the code, characters, designs, etc). It's simply about being able to keep a copy that you bought.

It's like books. Yes, I **own** the book I bought. I do **not** own the story of said book. And, if you've got 5 people, and 3 of them have a copy of Harry Potter for example, those 3 people **own** the book (again not the story), but, the second either of the other 2 attempt to take it, it becomes a theft of something that is **legally owned** by another person.

The issue with the DRM isn't that people are simply ""licensing"" the game, it's the fact that at any point, the company can deny your ownership of such a product at any point they wish, with or without notice.

If I write and sell a book, I want people to buy it. Do whatever you want with it, burn it, read it, make crafts, launch it to the moon, idc, so long as I'm getting paid for the copy you grabbed. But, at no point can I ever go ""oh, I've changed my mind, and book one of this trilogy is not as profitable as the other 2, so, I'm re-taking all copies of the 1st book in the series to be dealt with at my discretion"".

And, once you realize, that's *literally* what the software industry is pulling (not just games), you can see how ridiculously stupid it all is.

People's arguments for owning a game, is simply that they want to keep a copy for themselves, without being viewed as thieves by default, simply because something like, less than 5% of the population wants to pirate it. Companies are literally spending tons more money attempting to make it ""fool proof"" for hackers/crackers/pirates, than they're losing from people doing that in the first place. It's literally a losing battle. I respect it's protection early on in development and release, cause we'd rather not have a 1980s Gaming Crash repeat, but, the ""always online DRM"", is the stupidest thing on the planet, no matter who you are.",1640995401

"wow","t5_2qio8","Like many others have said, there is no point in this. Even if this does exist, this'll just lead to more elitism and toxicity. Healing is a two way street. Theres avoidable and unavoidable damage intake. The better the group is at avoidable stuff (dodgable,interruptable etc.) and putting up defensives for unavoidables the more time the healer can spend globals on dps.

This'll counteract your argument on the healers side. If the group is good, you'll barely even heal besides the tank and will spend more time doing damage thus your HPS will fall. If a dps spends time kiting, on Ice Block because he stole threat, turtling because healer cant keep up doesn't mean he contributed less because the others can't contribute enough to enable him to keep DPSing.

There's tons of factor to know if everyone is ""contributing"". If you pug a lot, first 2 trash pulls and one boss should be enough to gauge the group's capability. If they aint interrupting, casting CCs, healing, defensives or DPSing enough will show in the first 5 minutes. And do note, these are all available in details already.",1640995401

At the start I had the higher income and more savings, but as my partners career progressed and she got a few overseas opportunities she quickly over took me. Have you considered his future earning potential and any other mitigating factors (do you want/have kids, how secure is your employment etc)

I'd ask myself one question first. If I or my partner were to lose their job, would the other person be happy and able to support my half of the commitment, and how long for. 

Without getting too personal, if you have concerns about fairness before jumping in, is it really what you want? If owning your own place is a shared goal, then financially as a partnership you are better off going all in and paying that commitment down as quickly as you can. If this doesnt feel right to you id suggest that maybe now isn't the right time in your relationship. 

If you want to keep everything 50/50 for ease and fairness, you could consider getting your lending options based on his salary, and double it to give your total lending amount. (This would also mean with your higher income you could comfortably make repayments if you had any unexpected expenses etc) 

With an offset account you could keep your extra savings aside in case the relationship goes south, but also have it working for you.",1640995402

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","So when I play with first timers I sometimes do build them premade characters... 

HOWEVER I always at least give them a choice between a few diverse options, because it is super important that they feel excited to play as their character. 

I think ideally, it is best to walk new players through building their own character but sometimes that just isn't practical due to a lack of prep time or me not personally knowing and being in direct contact with all the new players.

If your wife still has an interest in playing, I would suggest having her tell the DM that she want's to build her own character next time. This will require putting some work into it on her own time but should excite the DM.

I think most Dm's would love to have their players make up new characters, it's just that sometimes we assume new players won't want to do all of that research and rule learning...   

In conclusion, finding the level of prep that everyone wants to engage at is super important and can be hard. I would assume that they probably do want your wife to have fun playing with them but they just don't understand that they have pigeon held her with the premade character. It  really was probably given to her purely for the purpose of accessibility but just doesn't spark her interest enough to be enjoyable. Much love!",1640995402

this is my third-longest tenure of having quit smoking (13 months, 9 months, 109 days*, 4 weeks, 3 weeks). but I have confidence that this will be the one that works. all quitting attempts followed the cold-turkey principle.

see, this time I didn't chuck away my cigarettes. i kept them as they were for about 6-7 weeks. i had my last opened pack on the dining table less than 5m away at all times. i had my insurance-against-lockdown cache stashed away untouched.

if i had wanted to, i could have lit up within 10 seconds. but I held back and fought through the temptation in lighting that next cigarette. this time, i attacked my craving directly instead of simply getting rid of the enablers.

it's worked so far. apart from some dreams about smoking (each accompanied with a pang about breaking the streak) and cravings after stressful work calls, i believe I'm completely smoke-free.

yes, the proof of the pudding will be how things stand this time next year. but I'm quietly confident.

all the best for your quitting journey.",1640995402

"IAmTheMainCharacter","t5_4dh289","I mean, yeah, Spain did their fair share of slavery, but the story is not quite like that. ""Negro"" in Spanish was simply used to describe black people, it didn't have any connotation that the ""negro"" you were talking about was a slave or even inferior. Racism of course existed as much in Spain and Portugal as it did in the rest of Europe, but it wasn't tied to that word.

It were English speaking people the ones that tarnished it, and it's not hard to see why. It wasn't really considered offensive on its adoption. It was only in the 50s and 60s that black people started to dislike the term. And it's obvious why: unlike in Spanish, ""negro"" in English exists only to refer to black people, it's not a term used for anything else. And to top it off it is a term used by white people to refer to them. In a sense, it's weird that the Anglos tried so hard to avoid using their words to refer to black people, instead resorting to words like ""negro"" or the infamous n-word.

And here's the point: while ""negro"" existed in Spanish and referred to black people too, it was the Anglos with their usage the ones that made it offensive in their language. It is weird, to say the least, to have Americans now (whatever their race) demand that Spanish people change a basic word of their language because they fucked it up, when it is not and has never been offensive by itself in Spanish.",1640995403

It makes no difference to her situation (unless she is currently paying most of the bills or something like that) You divorce, and it’s protected. It’s a major red flag that she is upset about this. I went through the whole trust thing with my ex-fiancé. It’s never about the money… Until it’s about the money.

She should be supporting you through the grieving process, not concerned about the money.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","OK stop.  This place is having  full on circle jerk over an article praising the ***political messaging*** of a politician.  Polls do NOT inform us of best medical practices.  We've seen lots of GOP Governors get high praise for ignoring the virus in their state and even promoting false treatment options.  We don't celebrate their approaches.  Why would *anyone* decide to celebrate this? 

Polis' argument repeats the same failing at the center of so many dumb ass arguments from the right: it reframes a pandemic as a personal health issue rather than a public health issue.  Of course people that do not wish to be responsible prefer thinking of themselves solely at the expense of others.  That's not a revelation here.  

From the beginning of the pandemic, our public health measures have NOT been focused on protecting you personally from getting sick, let alone ""inconvenienced"".  Instead the *singular* focus has been on slowing the rate of transmission to prevent our healthcare systems from being overloaded.  A goal we've repeatedly failed and Polis' ""return to normalcy"" approach completely ignores.  

Colorado - like most states - considers any positivity rate in testing above 5% as ""uncontrolled spread"" and acknowledges at above that rate, a substantial portion of cases are being missed.  Seven days ago the State's positivity rate stood a little over 7%.  As of yesterday the positivity rate was over 23%.  Hospitalizations - which have lagged positivity spikes by several weeks - were already in Colorado's ""red zone"" when Polis made this dumbass proclamation.  They've risen sharply since, and with the absolute explosion of positive cases, hospitals know they are nowhere near the peak of the burden about to be put on them.

When hospitals get overwhelmed, they cannot give best treatment to their patients.  Not just COVID patients.  ***Everyone in medical need suffers as a result of the strain on hospital staffs and other resources.*** ICU nurses normally charged with the care of 1-2 patients at a time now become responsible for 3, 4, or even more.  ""Elective"" procedures are put on hold, even though many absolutely are required for the long term health of the patient.  Care quality suffers.  Care providers get overworked.  Some break down.  Others quit or take leave to protect themselves from a complete breakdown.  Now we have fewer care professionals to tackle the even larger wave that follows.  And we've been doing that to them for nearly two fucking years.

So by all means, jerk off about polling that reinforces your priors.  This is a very young, male bubble, so it isn't surprising that any narrative that centers around you personally over thinking about the larger picture is going to appeal here.  It's very on brand.  But no, mainstream Dems aren't ""living in fear"" by continuing to focus on the data that matters over the short term opinions of a self-absorbed mob.  And I'm sorry, but messaging a ""return to normalcy"" in the face of the situation our hospitals both in Colorado and nationally are facing isn't based.  It's deluded, and it will only prolong our suffering and kill more people needlessly.  A virus doesn't respond to your opinion of it.

The evidence-based way to respond to a pandemic is to let the data determine your actions.  Not your feelings.",1640995403

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","The Forgetting Moon by far, and I'm saying that as someone who loved The Faithful and the Fallen. Durfee is a hidden gem and book two, The Blackest Heart, is one of the best books I've ever read. 

Durfee has better prose, more interesting characters (although Gwynne has more likeable ones), and much better world building. To me, the Banished lands felt very empty, and all the different nations were just copy paste of the same culture.

Gwynne is probably the best action writer there is. I don't love action scenes but Gwynne has the ability to put you right in the thick of it. Action is not Durfee's strength, but he handles it well and he keeps these scenes short, which I liked.

Now the best thing about Durfee and The Forgetting Moon was how f-ing brutal it was! This is definitely R rated fantasy, completely different to The Faithful and the Fallen, which I consider to be very PG-13. The violence in The Forgetting Moon is very gory.",1640995403

She's still been doing okay overnight -- eating twice overnight and sleeping the rest of the time. This is the most important thing for my sanity, so I'm not too upset... and I know I should be glad that she's eating, because she's still so lightweight, and any sign of growth is good.

But the frequent feeds are taking their toll on *me.* Around mid-afternoon I start feeling like she's sucking out my life force along with my breast milk. I'm running ragged.

Then if she’s indeed neurodivergent and she’s researched the neurodivergent community then she has got to understand that not everyone is the same. Even within the same neurodivergence (autism for instance) there’s differences between individuals. I can’t stand fireworks but I know autistic people who actually enjoy them (it’s a different experience for everyone). And every neurodivergent person who has done research about neurodivergence should be aware and considerate about this.

Your feelings are valid even if other people don’t experience it the same way.

Maybe try sending her some educational pdfs or posts or whatever you find that can express that neurodivergence is different for everyone. Maybe talk to her about it if you have the chance.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Even IF they went tempest cleric and maximized lightning damage would it be that big of a deal? I mean assassin rogue when built right can do 8 auto crits in a turn at 600'.  Personally I'd make it a half feat.

Elemental manipulation:
*prerequisite: spellcasting*

When you take this feat you may add 1 to your intelligence,  wisdom, or charisma

When you choose this feat you can pick 1 elemental damage type from fire, cold, acid, poison, lightning, and thunder.  When you cast a spell of a different damage type than your chosen one you may switch it to your chosen type.

You may select a different damage type everytime you take this feat.


Alternatively you could do it like this ""you may spend a bonus action and every spell you cast until the beginning of your next turn deals damage of the chosen type""

Both ways require an investment of a feat and if you still think its too strong make it use up some of their action economy.  Regardless how you do it I highly doubt you'll run into anything thats gonna break your game",1640995404

"StarTrekDiscovery","t5_3fl43","I see both sides. 

I see Zora as an immature life form that is still learning. I remember other Star Treks dealing with different cultural differences that lead people to being seemingly insubordinate. 

Like the blue guy from TNG, the one who didn’t alert the crew of his findings because he wasn’t finished with them.

I think at the end they perfectly handled it. Because Zora isn’t exactly an AI, because her intelligence developed organically within the Discovery rather than being artificially created.

I do think that jumping Zora straight into a specialist position is a bit odd. I’d have liked them do a middle ground where Zora leaves discovery in a different form and attends Starfleet Academy to learn the proper dos and don’ts of being a member of Starfleet, and allow her eye level experience with other life forms.",1640995404

I do go back in my own games too and see if I missed any obvious tactics.. honestly, it doesn’t happen much (as in, at least not as obvious as in most of the puzzles)- maybe it’s because I play longer time controls. More often my post-game analysis suggests that I missed a positional move (which might be obvious to higher rated players but I totally missed) which would leave in a better position to exploit tactics. Like, I miss the 1 or 2 moves _before_ the potential tactics sequence, if that makes sense. If this makes any sense, and you have any ideas on how to work on this, I’d love to hear it!

"WoT","t5_2rdg1","Thank you for the clarification.

However, I still think you are incorrect in stating that ""no ethno-cultural consistency"" is an exaggerated or twisted statement.

From the cultures portrayed in season 1 I don't think any of them had a hard ethnic background and association. And therefore, solely based on what we saw, a general statement like absolutely no ethno-cultural continuity is accurate.

The shinarans are not asian. The two rivers folk are completely diverse, so no ethnic majority really emerges. And tar valon is portrayed as being just as, if not more diverse than the two rivers, so it is hard to generalize an ethnic background there as well.

My question to you would be, ""if no ethnic consistency"" is a far fetched statement, then what is an example of ethno-cultural consistency in WoT season 1?

The only ones I can kind of think of are the Seanchan and maybe Aiel, but we've seen so little of them that I would't really feel comfortable making that argument just based off of the 8 episodes. Who knows, just because the three Aiel we see are gingers, does not mean they all will be. They are just three, too few to judge an entire culture. And viewers really wouldn't pick up on that either.

Also you may argue that the lore of WoT does not require a hard ethnic association, in the nations portrayed, judging by the links you provided, but that still does not disprove my statement that there is no ethno-cultural consistency, rather it reinforces it.",1640995406

**Title:**  [AP Statistics Homework Help:Transforming and Combining Probability Distributions (Please!!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/rt6rbe/ap_statistics_homework_helptransforming_and/)

 **Full text:** 

 Hello!! I'm so stuck on this assignment does anyone know how to solve this problem? If possible could you explain it to me! I'm a 9th grader taking a college class and need the extra boost with this problem. Thank you so much!! :D

&amp;#x200B;

Use the following information for problems 3, 4, and 5.

Sean’s Auto Dealership makes most of its profit selling used cars. Depending on availability and time, the dealership will sell between 2 and 6 cars per day.  The following model shows the probability of *X*, the number of cars sold by the dealership on a randomly chosen day.

|X|2|3|4|5|6|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P(X)|0.15|0.20|0.30|0.25|0.10|

Question 3: Suppose that each used car sells for $3000 of profit on average. Define *M* as the amount of profit that the dealership makes on used cars for a randomly selected day. What is the mean of *M?*

Question 4: A business wishes to contract with Sean’s Auto Dealership and purchase 2 used vehicles every day for the next month. If we define *C* as the number of used cars sold during a randomly selected day this month, then what is the standard deviation of *C*?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Let me know if you need more information to help me with this problem!

"nashville","t5_2qimh","The Amazon driver came by with the waxed jute I ordered (good for starting fires), I grabbed it and went inside.   Ten minutes later I poked my head out and saw his headlights pointing at me, perpendicular to my driveway.  I didn't think Amazon/Uber drivers were the kind to hang around, so I went out side to check on him.

Apparently he backed up too far and his rear wheels started going down an incline, stranding his car.   And since I'm hard of hearing, he'd spent those ten minutes furiously flooring his FWD Sentra and digging the front end of his car down into the gravel.  By the time I got outside, there was about an inch of clearance under the car.

After about an hour of trying to pull him back up the incline (Sentra doesn't have a front tow hook, that's a *really* great design...) and getting nothing but filthy, I talked to him and told him we could either a) wait for a big tow truck or b) I could pull him *down* the incline and let him drive through my yard to the driveway.   He chose b because he told me no one else was coming.

I finally freed him about 5 minutes ago, and he drove away as fast as his tires could spin.   Now I'm hoping my yard won't look like a warzone come daylight given how muddy it was before all this happened.

It keeps life interesting, I guess.   Hopefully no more Amazon deliveries tonight...",1640995407

Next things next:

I don’t know if *Harmonica Andromeda* and *The Lion Across the Field* thematically connect too much. It’s the same artist so, naturally, some of the same story-telling format and sounds are used

Compared to *The Lion Across The Field*, *Harmonica Andromeda* felt a bit… cheaper… at times? 

*Lion Across the Field* had a breadth of sounds &amp; styles as well and a little bit of flash, but at the end of the day, each song was a piece of music. Love it or hate it, each song gave me something to love or hate

*Harmonica Andromeda* almost relied on gimmicks at times and lost sight of the music. Yes, KSHMR certainly picked up a ton of new tricks and nifty tools in the five year gap, but some of the underlying ideas in the music weren’t as well-written

I’m arguably the biggest KSHMR fan on the planet, so I love both works immensely. They’re both intricate Titans of projects.

It also seems weird to me that in 2022 we still hold so sacred the 200-year-old ability to deliver a piece of paper to remote locations when we have fantistic technology that can deliver the same information for nearly zero cost. It is a constitutionally granted power, but I think by the end of our lifetimes it will be so clearly obsolete that public opinion will turn against its necessity. 

Defense is necessary but could easily be about 1/3 of what we spend today. We should close our hundreds of foreign military bases and stop trying to police the world. The department of defense should be held accountable for losing money as well, but I pretty much expect embezzlement when you hand a giant organization that cannot go bankrupt large sums of cash.

In that case, you offer incentives to work, if we're still doing a Market economy, that would be money to be spent on luxuries and entertainment, and wages for that work would fall wherever is necessary to get people to do necessary work.


Generally speaking in experiments in which people have their basic necessities met for free, they usually keep working anyway, so there's some expectation that regardless, most people would continue to be productive.

I showered, dressed, and made it to morning formation EXACTLY on time. It turns out beforehand my buddies were passing around pics of me.

Definitely not the best though. If there's only one MK game you can put on this list, it definitely shouldn't be 11. I'm surprised they did put it.

I think most people, ign included, said it was a great game, but didn't quite live up to the hype. 

Meanwhile, that hype was created entirely by MKX, which a lot regard as the best MK and even best fighting game ever. I'm not sure if I agree with that, but it is pretty damn high up there. I just don't follow the thought process behind putting MK11 on this list first.",1640995410

I'm getting separated. The last year has been very rough mentally. My husband and I have constant arguments and fights (not physical). I'm always being criticised and he has a condescending attitude toward me even among co-wokers (we work together).

He feels very uncomfortable with me having male friends. In the summer I befriended a male coworker and he lost it. He told me I couldn't talk to my friend and his controlling behavior got worse than before. He gets suspicous if he can't read my phone messages.

He expected sex every 48 hours and even though i didn't have to, he would feel rejected and he would get into a bad mood and push me away and he becomes really cold. Sometimes it turns into another arugment.

I will also mention that he cheated on me twice, once while I was home with a new baby.

His behavior has gotten bad enough that I wanted him to get therapy and medication. He initially refused but eventually agreed because he realized he had a problem. He seemed to be improving but he still has episodes.

I decided I wanted to separate from him because even though he's shown progress, I don't believe the relationship will ever get better without falling into the same behaviours.

The problem I have is that we have 2 young kids. I am worried about traumatizing my children. I am currently not living at the house and I have no access to my children. I'm worried that they will suffer because I am not present at home while I'm looing for a place to live (I can't have my kids where I am now). I'm currently staying with a friend who's helping me.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to go back home to attempt to fix the relationship for my kids sake.

&gt;!. Yae has met Scaramouche back in the past before he turned evil. She probably knows more about him than we do and might have predicted he would have betrayed the Fatui, or maybe knows that he'll eventually do the right thing in the end.!&lt;",1640995410

I just think it will become very important to forgive people for their remarks in a world where privacy is being eroded.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","A family member caught covid from a vaccinated friend along with other unvaccinated friends they all got it at varying times.

Vaccinated friend caught from vaccinated coworker. Returned negative test 5 days after contact. Started displaying symptoms 3 days after negative test &amp; returned a positive test.
Unvaccinated friend 1 displayed symptoms the next day.   Unvaccinated friend 2 started displaying symptoms 2 days later. Unvaccinated friend 3 started displaying symptoms 5 days later.  All had the exact same symptoms at the same degree. Vaccinated didn’t get it any less than unvaccinated &amp; unvaccinated didn’t get it any worse than vaccinated.

They’re now saying it can take up to 14days,  it the latest bs is you need to be in close proximity of the person for a minimum 4hrs despite it being highly contagious. Vaccinated no longer have to isolate after contact until they start displaying symptoms. Vaxed to get tested ASAP &amp; only need to again if they display symptoms. Can leave isolation after 5 days of displaying symptoms. Unvaccinated need to isolate immediately for a minimum of 14 days after contact. Unvaxed must get tested ASAP, 3days after contact, 5 days after contact, if they start displaying symptoms, 14days after contact &amp; if still no symptoms or negative results returned on all tests they need to further test 3 days after the 14days &amp; if the test is negative may leave isolation. If displaying symptoms then they must isolate a further 14days from the start of symptoms &amp; return at least 2 negative tests 3 &amp; 5 days after the 14days before leaving isolation.

Yet it’s the unvaxed spreading it 🤷🏼‍♀️

QLD Australia had a little over 1k cases in a total period of 2yrs. They opened their borders to the vaccinated only, banned all unvaccinated from restaurants, cafes, pubs, clubs, cinemas, sporting events etc. only allowed to do essential shopping &amp; services. Yet cases have now risen to 11k in 2 weeks. Majority of cases starting in businesses that only allow fully vaxed staff &amp; patrons. Yet again it’s the unvaxed causing the spread 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦‍♀️",1640995410

"vanderpumprules","t5_302zw","was listening to an old podcast with ariana and tom guest starring, and they talked about their days working at villa blanca -

sandoval said that there was this one playlist of lvp's called the ""saint-tropez"" playlist. it played what he deemed 'depressing music,' such as ex: ""father figure"" by george michael, ""tears in heaven"" by eric clapton and ""heartbreak hotel"" by whitney houston/kelly price/faith evans. the same songs would play over and over again. he'd try to change the music, but lisa would come back and say ""oh no, what happened! put the saint-tropez playlist!""

he got so exasperated with the regular music playlist (he mimic'ed faith evans' wail at the end of ""heartbreak hotel"" in particular), so much so that he made an entire fake yelp account just so that he could 'anonymously' complain about the kind of *depressing* music that was played at villa blanca.

All the major tech publishers (O’Reilly, Pact, Apress, Manning, Springer) have some fantastic introductory books to choose from. 

And if your library doesn’t have anything, ask if you can suggest that they buy some. Seriously, most libraries do allow people to suggest purchases and they’ll get them, but you typically have to give them specific titles. Although sometimes they will purchase books and eBooks on a suggested subject area - it’s just a little more risky that you might not get what you need if the person selecting the books isn’t familiar with the topic.",1640995411
