We thankfully have Brands who isn‚Äôt going to sell a player 5 minutes after the first interested team comes in, in the middle of the season mind you. 

I understand he wants to go. And he probably will, this summer. Players sign these guaranteed contracts and, as we have seen with about half our shit fucking payroll currently, still get paid regardless of their form. So, is it fair to the team to expect them to pay the shit players and let the good ones go as soon as a better prom date comes along? No.

1) give us a real bid
2) give us more than 5 minutes to replace him

Those are the 2 criteria and we currently have none of them met.

We‚Äôre never going to get a solid game if people rage before they know anything concrete about the final product.

eg in Finland they started an open-dialogue approach (which doesn't use any drugs) which has almost eliminated ""schizophrenia"" among people using this approach:

**Robert Whitaker:**  (Harvard Medical School director of publications.)

- ""They're down to 2 cases per 100,000.  A 90% decline in schizophrenia.  Their first episode cases aren't chronic."" 

-- https://youtu.be/aBjIvnRFja4?t=102

And in Europe there's a therapy (without drugs) where 80% of people called ""schizophrenic"" recover as long as those people have resources,  but if they're drugged (without therapy and help) the recovery rate drops to 5%.:

-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts17LI77BUo


&gt; they told us they didn't think they could restrain themselves from the thoughts they were having about hurting family members. 

There's polling showing that people who hear voices are far more common then people realize, but most of them don't say anything because 1) the voices aren't negative but in fact fairly positive, and 2) they don't want to get labelled 'schizophrenic.'

Of people who report really negative voices they have often gone through some trauma, especially childhood trauma:

**Trauma:**

- ‚ÄúThe findings are consistent with the thesis that trauma could have a causal association with psychotic experiences,‚Äù the team of researchers, from the University of Bristol Medical School wrote.""

-- https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/11/researchers-suggest-traumatic-experience-may-cause-psychotic-symptoms/

- ""Eighty-three percent of the participants with psychotic experiences at the age of 18 reported exposure to trauma...   Having experienced three or more types of trauma between birth and 17 was associated with a 4.7 fold increase in the odds of having a psychotic experience""

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; Broadly speaking I would say just because things like meaning and morality are imaginary/subjective (exist dependent on a mind), that doesn't mean they don't exist (because they clearly exist in the mind). It just means there isn't some objective/real (existing independent of the mind) source for those concepts. Unlike something like gravity which does appear to be objective and real.

I followed you till you asserted gravity is real - what do you mean? There is a thing that we generally experience that pulls stuff towards other stuff? Ok, that's probably real, every experiment done so far suggests that it is and that might be enough to go on. 

On the other hand, gravity is also a kind of meaning we put on our experience. We feel/observe things pulling together, we call it gravity. In that sense, it's subjective, and although you can make noises (ie talk) and draw images (ie write) to communicate your experience of it to me, how the hell do I know... and so I slip into solipsism.

I want out of it! The answer can't just be, there is no answer, forgetabout it, because that like saying, god is, and you can't understand him - that is, it's lazy and unsatisfying... But I don't know the answer.

"tolkienfans","t5_2r6jm","Neither is correct. Whenever you see an umlaut/diaeresis above a vowel in a sequence of two vowels next to each other, it means you're supposed to pronounce the vowels as separate syllables (the reverse is true as well; if neither of the vowels in a sequence of two vowels has an umlaut/diaeresis, you're supposed to pronounce the vowels together in a single syllable). Thus *F√´anor* is pronounced ***feh-ah-nor*** (**[Ààf…õ.an…îr]** in IPA, not [Ààfe…™.an…îr]).

Edit: For context, just listen to [Tolkien reciting the *Nam√°ri√´* poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6de_SbVUVfA). And here's [another recording of Tolkien reciting the *Nam√°ri√´*] (https://www.jrrvf.com/glaemscrafu/audio/tolkien/mp3/namarie.mp3), except much slower and clearer. You'll notice that all instances of **√´** are pronounced as […õ], not [e…™] and pronounced distinctly separate from any vowels next to it (most notably in the case of the word *Oioloss****√´o***).

And for more context, Tolkien states that it's usually ***√©*** and ***√≥*** that are pronounced in the typical English manner, but is also regarded as incorrect pronunciations in-universe:

&gt;A fairly widespread pronunciation of long *√©* and *√≥* as *ei* and *ou*, more or less as in English *say no*, both in Westron and in the rendering of Quenya names by Westron speakers, is shown by spellings such as *ei*, *ou* (or their equivalents in the contemporary scripts). But such pronunciations were regarded as incorrect or rustic. They were naturally usual in the Shire. Those therefore who pronounce *y√©ni √∫n√≥time* 'long-years innumerable', as is natural in English (sc. more or less as *yainy oonoatimy)* will err little more than Bilbo, Meriadoc, or Peregrin. Frodo is said to have shown great 'skill with foreign sounds'. 

And for even more reference, here are how all the vowels in Quenya are pronounced:

Vowel | IPA
:-: | :-:
√° | [a:]
√© |[e:]
√≠ | [i:]
√≥ | [o:]
√∫ | [u:]
a | [a]
e | […õ]
i | [i]
o | […î]

Say what you want about the Crystals, but at least they gave you credit in regards to how loyal you are when it comes to playing the game. Limiting what said credit can be used on doesn't just devaluate the in-game currency, it makes people less interested in playing it in general.

If the Bonus Crystals essentially become worthless, fewer people will keep logging in every day to get them. And if they're not logging in as often, they're probably not playing as often, and chances are that they'll also become less and less interested in the game itself, which will lead to a decrease in the number of purchases as well.

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","From the photo posted earlier, it looks like you want to sing and play guitar at the same time.

Unless you have a very loud (I mean really loud) voice, it would be a better balance to use a condenser mic on both vocals and guitar.  

To help get the best sound on each source, you want to avoid bleed - e.g. vocal on the guitar mic, guitar on the vocal mic.  I'd recommend the following:

Use a small diaphragm (tighter pickup pattern) condenser mic on the guitar, line the AT Pro 37 for @$170.  https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Pro37--audio-technica-pro-37-small-diaphragm-condenser-microphone

Use a large diaphragm condenser on your voice, they will pick up more detail and you'll sound better.

BUT, you are not obligated to be in his house and subject to the whims of a nasty little mutant rodent. The first time your friend told you he wasn't going to put the dog outside, was the last you should've asked. You should have simply stood up and calmly stated you were leaving because the dog was being very intrusive and irritating and you don't want to put up with it.

That speaks louder to dog people than swearing at them. Calmly asserting you will not tolerate their animal and they will find themselves isolated because of it. Your friend has a right to do as he pleases on his property. But if you don't like the way he runs his house, then you don't need to go over. If he wants to choose a gross little chihuahua over your friendship then good riddance to bad rubbish. I am not friends with people who prefer their animals over me.",1548979211

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","I don't really see how gender criticism and asexuality connects. I'm part of both groups and I was never confused about my sexuality, it's just men are not my type and neither are women. Asexuality is simply about not feeling sexual attraction towards anyone. It's not harmful, but I'm sure if I tried to force myself to become straight it would have a quite harmful effect on me.

I agree that there are a lot of young women who only use the asexuality label because they are too afraid in this oversexualised world and I do understand it. It can be an easy escape from this porn and sex obsessed world. So many girls (mostly young teenagers) say that they are asexual because they don't agree with the hook-up culture or they actually want an emotional connection before a physical one or they are just sick of how sexualized they are by the media nowadays. They completely refuse to acknowledge their sexuality instead of learning about it. Being this completely ""innocent"" asexual person and not giving a crap about all that sexual stuff you hear and experience can be a liberating feeling but it is a lie. Being asexual cannot save you from the world and seeing how oversexualised everything is is just depressing and traumatising because you don't get this whole thing.

I know that it sounds like gatekeeping but real asexuals do exist, but I think before someone identifies with it they should really examine the underlying reasons why they believe they are one. I feel like people throw around the asexual label too easily. Just because it didn't fit you it doesn't mean it's a lie. 

I'm curious what you think about it.

This based off of speculation from a screenshot that had no real money conversions, and the poster just assumed it. Quite literally unfounded. This thread does a good job of [debunking this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/ajkhk0/spoilers_lets_have_an_adult_conversation_about/). I hate it when people call fake news on shit they don't like, but this is actually fake news. While it could be something that happens, bioware, the actual devs, have repeatedly said is not decided. They've talked several times about their design choices around this, and that the underpinning philosophy from bioware is that you shouldn't miss out because you aren't spending money. Feel free to check twitter accounts, as a few different bioware leads have talked about this. That being said, at this point the only real facts we have is that it's unknown.

&gt; It's so sad to see how many people are missing Warframe

I'm not playing this or that in leau of another game. I can play both. I like warframe, and I enjoyed what I played of Anthem. Moreover, many people will play both. Waframe costs me, in principle, nothing to play. And guess what? If someone plays anthem, and it flops, but they like the idea, they'll likely get directed to Waframe. This isn't a zero-sum game.

&gt; they're praising Anthem for things Warframe have for eternity

They can have similar features. They straddle similar genres, and it doesn't take from either to use good ideas both have. No one would get anywhere if every idea had to be wholly unique. Just like Anthem has some features warframe has, warframe could learn a thing or two from anthem too. The priming system is fun, flight feels excellent in anthem. Anthem could really use some of warframe's speed in movement.

And the way it works is different than stated. Its purpose is to conserve core body heat and the way this is achieved is by the artery and vein in the limb running together, in opposite directions.

So the foot actually remains colder in order to preserve core temperature.

We see a similar principle of countercurrent flow elsewhere in biology, such as fish gills and bird lungs (part of why bird lungs are more efficient than mammals) to maximize oxygen exchange with the environment, and in the kidney both to conserve water and electrolytes in the Loop of Henle, and also in the vasa recta to regulate renal medullary pH and oxygen levels.

Unions gain power from the federal government, are you against that? Are you against social security? Are you against a federal government which has done a bang up job of taking care of our monetary supply? Are you against the overwhelming and gigantic reduction in global warfare that the US is responsible for? 

It's not that I'm not critical of elements of it, but we can't have the great things without some problems. These days if we don't have a federal government, we would have insanely powerful corporate entities that would basically be their own governments and it would be so much worse than the current problems. We need to steer this boat, not just fantasize about the boat we wish we could build.

I think switching from the current welfare model to a disbursement model is the best direction we can streer the federal government in. Local areas could supplement the federal disbursement with their own solutions. I think reduction in complexity for federal systems is a good direction, and I think that when you place more resources in the hands of the people, you have small errors which individuals learn from, and not these catastrophic errors that people get angry about.

Ultimately most people don't want to think about this. We are weird. Most people want to have a good day at work, feel proud of what they did, go home and relax with their friends and family. They want simple, reliable, reasonable amounts of luxury and respite. Disbursements do that. Convincing the government that you aught to qualify for this help or that is shitty, stressful and wasteful. Making sure rock bottom is livable, and making sure everyone is handed that, and leaving everything past that up to the individuals is the least amount of federal activity that we will likely ever be able to sell. Shutting it down isn't going to happen easily.

This really lines up with my experience of wolves.  I once had a roommate who got a half wolf-dog (even though it was illegal - I moved out before too long).  That dog was always watching and learning.  Always testing to see how much it could get away with.  It's eyes didn't look like any dog I ever saw before.  You could tell it was smart.

And today I started googling wolf attacks and all the articles I found said the same thing.  Yes, few confirmed kills.  But how many people just vanish?  How many people do they try to attack only to be repelled?  

Have you seen how large Grey Wolves are?  Just imagine running into one of those on the trail.

Also, other sources describe wolves in the same way, like this article:

https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/he-was-testing-humans-as-potential-prey-why-canadas-richest-uranium-mining-region-is-haunted-by-wolves

How many laws have been changed on the premise of ""if we can save just one life""?  The wolf is literally an Apex predator. People will die, but how many?  Once we populate them, we can't just take that back.

"ww2","t5_2s8su","I think it would be fair to interject here with some scholarship into the matter. First of all, the usage of soldiers of African ancestry in the several branches of the Wehrmacht should not take away from the fact that Nazi Germany was a fanatically racist and genocidal state. There are many who uses images like these of soldiers from Free Arabian Legion to make weak arguments in favor of Nazi Germany, often portraying them as willing to fight against the 'real enemy': Communism.

Historical research tells us differently. It puts it within the context of German efforts to incite revolt in French and British colonial territories. In German Prisoner of War camps, which had hundreds of colonial soldiers from North and West Africa, Muslim soldiers were repeatedly bombarded with German propaganda. The goals were, as Dr. Raffael Scheck writes in *French Colonial Soldiers in German Captivity during World War II* (Cambridge University Press, 2014):

&gt; After the German victory in the West in 1940, the interest of Germany in winning military bases in North Africa ‚Äì for a future war with the United States ‚Äì and submarine bases in West Africa were important considerations for pro-Islamic propaganda. Hitler made the first of several unsuccessful requests for bases in French Morocco and in Dakar just three weeks after the armistice. Later on, the hope of undermining the British position in Egypt and in the Middle East became the paramount interest, as German troops were fighting in North Africa and hoping for the support of Arab nationalists. Interest in acquiring a colonial empire in West and Central Africa was also important. Although Hitler himself prioritized a colonial empire in Eastern Europe, several German agencies had detailed plans for colonial acquisitions in Africa centered on, but not limited to, the former German colonies.

In the context of the North African campaigns, it made sense therefore to recruit soldiers from the local peoples in a hope that they could be portrayed as the vanguard of a ""free"" North Africa (hence the name ""Free Arabian Legion"", free implying throwing off the yokes of colonial powers). The recruitment of soldiers from French and British colonies therefore had a pragmatic element to it. It was contradictory to Nazi German ideals and should be seen in this context.

How they were treated and seen by German soldiers is a different question altogether, and one that doesn't seem to have an easy answer. Presumably, they were treated as child-like curiosities, but I've not found much scholarship into these soldiers in particular.

With that said, we should not forget one thing: Afro-German soldiers. There has been an African presence in Germany since the 17th century (and before), and this population grew larger with the acquisition of African colonies by Imperial Germany in the late 19th century. During the Nazi period, there were several Afro-Germans who left due to the intense racism and prejudice that they experience there, despite having fought for Imperial Germany in the First World War. However, those who had been born during the late 1910s and 1920s remained and some ended up being drafted in the Wehrmacht.

Let's take the example of Hans Hauck. Hans Hauck was a young Afro-German man who had been forcibly sterilized by the Nazi regime. In 1942, Hauck was drafted in the Heer.  

From an interview with Hauck:

&gt; HH: I was conscripted at nineteen, like everyone else.

&gt; TC: Conscripted? What is conscripted?

&gt; HH: Conscripted. That means for the army, drafted into the
army. It‚Äôs called conscription.

&gt; TC: That was at nineteen. That was two years after you were
sterilized?

&gt; HH: That was two years, yeah, after I was. . . . I wasn‚Äôt quite seventeen, I was sixteen when I was sterilized. And at conscription, 1939‚Äîit‚Äôs called conscription into military service‚ÄîI was unworthy for service.

&gt; TC: ‚ÄúUnworthy‚Äù?

&gt; HH: Yes. I was allowed to work, but back then I wasn‚Äôt allowed to become a soldier. Only in the course of the war, in 1941 they got looser. And in 1942, I was called up with my own permission. It depended, I could have then said, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want me, and now I don‚Äôt want you.‚Äù But then I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here today. It‚Äôs that simple. We‚Äôve got examples of that. A mate that I was sterilized with, he never came back. He got sent to a camp. And I went because I saw it as a chance. It was the first time that I was treated the same as others. Because the other ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù German boys, my mates, my schoolmates, they were called up, too. And I wanted that, and then I was called up. And then I was quite conscious of my fate, that I had a chance, 50‚Äì50. Either I survive it, or I don‚Äôt. And I survived.

It was a pragmatic choice to draft someone like Hauck, but for Hauck, it was an opportunity like nothing before: For once, just by being drafted, he'd by treated as a German man equal to everyone else. 

&gt; HH: I was drafted and became a soldier, and in 1945, I was taken prisoner. I was wounded five times. I was home twice, on leave and when I was wounded. And in ‚Äô45, in January, I was taken prisoner by the Russians.

&gt; TC: How long were you a prisoner?

&gt; HH: Until 23 April 1949. . . . I can‚Äôt really describe what it was like being a prisoner. Imprisonment isn‚Äôt easy‚Äîeveryone knew that ‚Äî But I was treated more humanely by the Russians than I ever was by my own countrymen.

&gt; TC: In what way?

&gt; HH: In what way? Because no one made a big deal about my heritage
there.

&gt; TC: And the other German soldiers, did they notice this? That you were treated differently?

&gt; HH: I wasn‚Äôt treated differently.

&gt; TC: Just more humanely?

&gt; HH: I was treated just like the other Germans. Just they didn‚Äôt make any distinctions. My own Fatherland didn‚Äôt do that. It discriminated against me. Only as a soldier did it treat me as an equal.

&gt; TC: And did you have the feeling during your time as a soldier that you were really accepted?

&gt; HH: In the army, you didn‚Äôt notice any difference.

&gt; TC: In spite of your ‚Äî

&gt; HH: I made private first class after the first five months‚Äîthat means I was promoted. You didn‚Äôt notice any discrimination in the army. There were many army of officers who didn‚Äôt agree with the system and didn‚Äôt say anything. But you noticed that. In the army they didn‚Äôt discriminate against me.

As Tina M. Campt (who was in the interviewer) points out in her book *Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich* (University of Michigan Press, 2005), Hauck makes a very firm and paradoxical separation between Nazi German society (who discriminated) versus the Heer (who didn't). The reason for this is that in the Heer, he could finally claim his German masculinity through his role as a soldier. In the end, it was a question of identity. Other Afro-German soldiers were allowed to leave Soviet camps early, in Hauck's retelling. However, Hauck remained. Why? As Hauck himself explained: ""But I didn‚Äôt have
such a standpoint. I needed a position for myself. Not for
the Russians‚Äîto get home. I needed it for myself, personally‚Äî‚Äú
Who/What am I?‚Äù I never listened to [the soldiers]. I‚Äôm German and was so, contrary to what Hitler thought, or the Nazis. I‚Äôm German, even [in Russia]. I didn‚Äôt want anything more. . . . I‚Äôm not saying that those comrades who did it were wrong. They were right. They got home sooner. But they had never experienced that inner conflict like I had.""

Hans Hauck was indeed German, contrary to the fact that the Nazis didn't want to see him as such, and although it's fair to say that he wasn't the only one to experience an inner conflict about identity, his paradoxical participation as a German soldier in the Eastern front needs to be considered out of his own, personal and subjective experience. The matter of black soldiers in German uniform remains, therefore, a complex question.

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","They are so far divorced from at least the American guidelines that it's hard to believe they're from the same world. 

Literally the top recommendation is:

""Enjoy your meals.""

They also recommend:

""Take advantage of your dietary culture and local food products, while incorporating new and different dishes.""

All of this advises against food trends, and there has never been a ""low fat craze"" in Japan. So likewise there was never a replacement with low fat food with lots of added sugars. (Japanese people tend to eat quite little fat though, but make very little to no difference between saturated and non-saturated fat.)

Apart from that, the guidelines do not include the type of lobbying from big dairy to drink lots of milk (calcium can come from vegetables as is guided here), however they do have some things from big rice, which is questionable. 
And above all fruit is really not a mainstay of the diet, but is seen as candy, which you also get out of the guidelines.

...

&gt;The episode has plenty of precedent for Trump. Trump has claimed that he never said Mexico would cut a check for the border wall, but he has. He has claimed he didn‚Äôt say many other things for which there is video.

&gt;And these officials have disagreed with Trump many times before, most notably on Russian interference in the 2016 election and the killing of Washington Post Global Opinions columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

&gt;In the majority of places public urination doesn't require you to register as a sex offender, indecent exposure does though. It's really rare for someone who truly just had to piss to actually be charged and convicted of indecent exposure instead of or in addition to public urination. Not saying it's never happened (which is bad) but it's definitely not as common as you would think for how often it's brought up in these situations. Lots of times weirdos jerking it in public will claim they were ""just peeing"" when they weren't.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Marie kondo is this Japanese woman who is the author of a book called:‚Äù the life changing magic of tidying up‚Äù.  The book is for those who are stressed out over having a messy house or feel too lazy to clean or don‚Äôt know how to tidy up in an effective manner. 

Her book though is more philosophical and somewhat spiritual and goes past just cleaning. She talks about how when you keep a place clean it also can help you organize your life as a whole, and makes you feel much better. She has a famous quote that says: if you pick something up and it doesn‚Äôt spark joy then you should throw it out. This can be applied to more than just cleaning your house. 

It‚Äôs a very wholesome book and has helped many people in different ways. She has a netflix show too called: tidying up with marie kondo. Where she teaches other families whose houses are in disorder her personal methods and thoughts about cleaning up. One interesting aspect is that she doesn‚Äôt judge someone for what sparks them joy and decide to keep. She also helps the family work together as a family too.  It‚Äôs a heartwarming show.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","The hinges are called barrel hinges.

When I used them, I aligned them by making a center depression on the base where the hinge would go. I placed a BB (small metal ball) in the depression and taped it down. Then aligned the lid on top so it was even all the way around, then pressed down hard to leave a depression on the lid.  I now had 4 points to center the drill bit for perfectly aligned hinges.  Here's a harmonica box I made using the barrel hinges:

Advocating obesity means you are telling women, in our modern times, that they have no choice.

That this is beautiful.

That they should be embracing a lifestyle that restricts their options, that debilitates them and puts limits on their mobility.

One that puts them in CONSTANT DISCOMFORT and frequent exhaustion when they perform moderate physical acts.

That the possibility of being unnecessarily bedbound and completely dependent is okay

I work from home so I could easily sleep til 7:45, roll out of bed, and walk to the desk. It was tough the first couple weeks. But after that it became routine and I love my 6:30 class so that‚Äôs a great motivator. Somethings that helped:

- Get my clothes out and ready to go before I go to bed 
- Set a back up alarm 5 mins after the first alarm so I don‚Äôt turn the first one off and go back to sleep 
- Remind myself that if I just get out of bed, I‚Äôll be more awake and less mad about waking up at 5:40
- Remind myself how much better my day is when I workout in the morning 
- Turn on the bed side lamp when the second alarm goes off. This also triggers my dog to jump on the bed and come cuddle with me/ lick my face which definitely wakes me up 
- If I do consider going back to sleep, I‚Äôll remind myself that there‚Äôs people who have had less sleep than me that got up earlier than me and already did their workout for the day. And I need to quit being lazy or else I‚Äôll be fat forever. A little self-neging does help lol.

"Drizzt","t5_2sklw","Like I actually stumbled upon this and love to weigh in.

I don't want to seem combative but I will go point-by-point on it because that's the easiest way for me to participate in discussions:

\-He is the best fighter

While not an unfair assumption to make, it's not accurate. In Salvatore's own writing (I assume by first six novels you mean chronologically because icr the publication order) Drizzt isn't necessarily unchangeable. He never truly bests Zaknafein, dead or alive, and Artemis Entreri is only bested by luck or a sliver of skill difference. And if we want to talk about pound for pound a human in his 20s (early 30s?) being able to keep up with an elf who has had decades (centuries in original writings because Drizzt didn't have an established date of birth yet and was said to be around 140, but was later retconned with Salvator's weird interpretation of elven aging) of experience and training more than him is WAY impressive.

I know the title says only the first six books, but Drizzt is REPEATEDLY engaged in duels that challenge him throughout the series after Icewind Dale, and if you want to go external of the writings to the rest of the FR, Gareth Dragonsbane exists who is likely a better swordsman than even Zak during AD&amp;D, by those rules. And I hate to be that guy because game =/= novel but it's a fun comparison to draw, but there are higher level fighters in even The North at any given time. And then there's the essay that Ed Greenwood wrote on the subject of the realm's best swordfighters in the year 1375 Dale Reckoning that, if I remember correctly, placed him at like 6th at the time? And 1375 is some ten years following the Icewind Dale trilogy. Fun note, that's not accounting for sword users with more than two arms, and almost everyone ahead of him was at least half elf, if not human. But of course that's Ed's opinion on the matter, but he'd also know best. And I mean, who knows, he might ACTUALLY be the best by the current realm time, but that gets into spoiler territory.

The lore of him being the realm's greatest swordsman is pretty much a commonfolk thing that adds to his myth and mystery, it serves as something to get his foot in the door in human society, more than an actual measure of his mettle as a warrior.

\-He has not lost once since Homeland

I guess it depends on how you define losing. He DOES get blind-sided by the mind-flayers, although that was hardly ""fair"" it's still losing. He didn't beat Zak's wraith, and it took the wraith committing suicide because of Zaknafein's influence to get him and his pals out of that tight spot. Entreri and Drizzt experienced a draw in Streams of Silver, but I guess that's more not-winning than losing, but Artemis had gotten what he wanted, and Drizzt failed as a hero in that regard, so I'll count it as a loss, though not a ""dueling"" loss. Any future examples or arguments would be spoilers.

(Fun non-spoiler there is a canonical ""no answer"" to a duel with a noble that Salvatore is deliciously devious in giving ambiguity regarding the real answer of who won)

\-He knows magic

Flaw of the setting, all Drow know magic, Drizzt simply has less magic than a mage, even in the Underdark he only had a few spells, and as the series draws on his ability in magic IS reeled back (justified by sun exposure but it's to match the games' change in mechanics regarding Drow magic) to make it work. All Drow were mini-mages, and the spells Drizzt has only are as great as they are because he knows how to use them creatively.

\-He is loved by everyone (only friends because racism)

Well I certainly HOPE his friends would like him lol. Jokes aside, he has enemies who he has met personally, Jarlaxle finds him charming but doesn't like Drizzt all that much. It's just hard to hate someone so pure and thoughtful once you meet them face-to-face. Trust me, I know.

\-Deep and Depressing Backstory

Most D&amp;D PCs do, there's a meme about it. Well-adjusted people with happy childhoods rarely go out on adventures to slay dragons and save the world, having a mildly inconvenient background is like one of the prerequisites to being interesting enough to care about in writing. Even in the call to action, and otherwise happy character can become more depressed.

Drizzt just has an especially fucked up back story, which leads to readers becoming more enthralled with him. It makes us want to cheer for him more because he's come so far.

\-You can't not like him because of his pitiful situation of no one else not liking him.

I feel like I addressed this one, but I'm anal-retentive about these kinds of list things lol.

\-He is wise, intelligent, strong, dextrous, and charismatic.

Another commenter put it beautifully already, and people point out that as you go on this gets fixed, but I'm going to put another gamer spin on this because why not?

Drizzt is of above-average strength, we never see him accomplish huge impressive feats of strength like others, and Wulfgar was established as canonically stronger than him in the first book, because Drizzt DID admit that he isn't really strong enough to make a warhammer suit his fighting style.

Drizzt is wise because of his experiences, but he always has something to learn, in Icewind Dale he is ""default"" wise, but we see him learn many of these hard lessons that gets him there in the Dark Elf trilogy, and we see him continue to learn after.

The intelligence point is fair, but try living for decades with a mind that wants to learn, and try NOT being at least somewhat intelligent. 

The Dexterous point is supported by a natural proclivity that elves in that setting share, a natural talent that he possesses (somewhat inherited from his father given Zak's call to demand he be trained as a warrior and proving it through the coins) and then again DECADES of training/combat honing this dexterity and agility. If there were ever a thing that he would be justified at being good at, it's Dexterity.

Charisma is one I'll concede, he is VERY personable for someone who spends decades at a time in isolation, and before that was either constantly being abused, attempted-assassinated, or sternly taught swordplay. He shouldn't have natural charismatic skills, but to be fair, people still find charm in that ""brooding loner"" thing that he does, and I think his charisma comes more from his being a kind of person that others are attracted to, than anything of his own. Otherwise his best-kept friendship is one that started as a shaky alliance  that improved to a practical brotherhood over at least a decade.

To defend his BEING charismatic, I think a perpetual asshole wouldn't survive as a Drow on the surface, especially a Drow outcast. Jarlaxle is like IN with the Drow, and he still needs a sly tongue to survive the surface.

A quick reference, here are Drizzt's numeric stats during 2nd edition, I couldn't find 1st edition stat blocks just a level and god of worship:

 STR 13  
DEX 20  
CON 15  
INT 17  
WIS 17  
CHA 14 

My description might have been colored by knowing these already, but I feel like for a rolled character he did SUPER well, but I would probably allow my player to run such a character, simply because these are still not in that ""specialized"" level in most places. He still can't break down doors, he's not learned enough in magic to do much about my magical issues, and the high specialization that other PCs will usually have to fill his roles. Drizzt is a character that's suitable for high-challenge games, and Salvatore seems to understand that well enough to give him high-challenge adventures.

Animals, objects, flowers, babies all need to be referred to by the proper terms, they even have separate 'The's'. Think 'Le/La Los/Las or the case in Arabic El or El with a silent L. 

Yes, even the word YOU is gendered in plenty of languages.

'Those two cats are eating their food' is different than 'The cat is eating her food' than 'The cat is eating his food' and 'The cats are eating their food' and are the plural cats females, males or a mixed group???

So telling me to say *'they'*, which again, is a very English concept because *they* in say Italian/Spanish/Arabic/French also depends on if its feminine plural or masculine plural, are we talking about a group of feminine nouns or masculine nouns? A pair of old women or a group of male cats or a bunch of feminine-noun'd tables?

&amp;#x200B;

So, despite their complications, I have no interest in changing any language to appease the First World whining of an ignorant white girl

&gt; Democratic state lawmakers in New Jersey aren&amp;#039;t done seeking President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s tax returns.

&gt; Some members of the state Legislature have revived legislation that would require candidates for president and vice president to disclose their tax returns from the previous five years to appear on the ballot in the Garden State.

&gt; A Democratic congressman from New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-8th Dist., is leading a similar effort in Washington to force Trump&amp;#039;s tax returns to become public.

Why do people have such a hard time with this? And also, why does Trump need all these meetings and back room deals? They‚Äôve already got a pipeline to Russia don‚Äôt they? 

Why did Veselnistkya lie about her meeting? Why did she meet with fusion GPS the day before and after she had that meeting? Why did Loretta Lynch give her a special visa into the country? 
Why did Don Jr show the world his emails? Because it‚Äôs NOT ILLEGAL. It‚Äôs not illegal to know Russian people. It‚Äôs not illegal to meet with them. It‚Äôs not even illegal to oppo research from Russian! Isn‚Äôt that right Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton?
But because the media has turned it *into* a crime for Donald Trump, I‚Äôm not surprised his team hasn‚Äôt been forthcoming about every Russian they‚Äôve ever shared a room with when the press turns drinking a White Russian into a media event. 

Ok so how about you answer a single fucking question I asked now huh? Why does every single ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù trumps supposed to be involved with have something to do with our intelligence agencies, Hillary Clinton, or the Obama administration? Why didn‚Äôt Comey tell Congress about his spying operation for 9 months? Why did Mike Rogers snub Obama and what did he tell Trump?

**CBOE Re-Applies With US SEC to List Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange‚Äôs (CBOE), along with investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX, has re-applied with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a rule change to list a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
VanEck digital asset strategy director Gabor Gurbacs announced the public filing on Jan. 31.
&gt;
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt;CBOE had initially withdrawn its request for a rule change to list a Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 23. A CBOE spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the decision to withdraw its request was the result of the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period approached. Some legal experts noted at the time that the SEC was operating on a limited basis due the shutdown, which was the result of a political impasse over a proposed wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border.
&gt;
&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt;ETFs are securities that track a basket of assets proportionately represented in the fund‚Äôs shares. They are seen by some as a potential step forward for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a regulated and passive investment instrument.

"ketogains","t5_2v5mu","I've posted this a couple times before so glad I've saved it haha

Personally, and with hindsight to guide me, I would not have done the 5x5 program for more than 6 months, I really stayed on longer than I was seeing gains and kept trying to grind it out, and got frustrated not knowing the point at which I should switch. That and, deadlifting only once per week and for only 5 reps at that is dumb, and there is little accessory work added to the 5x5 programs I've seen (not that it is required, but some accessory work can certainly help improve weaknesses on main lifts, i.e., my bench stalled for a while but then blew up once I added close grip bench and additional triceps isolation work). I also somewhat regret not switching to a program involving pull-ups/chin-ups sooner.

Is that a reason to not do SL5x5? idk, my prerogative now is why spend time on a suboptimal beginner program if there are better ones out there that will progress you to more advanced programs/get better progress faster? I'm sure some/many will disagree. This is just my perspective based on my own experiences and sources like  https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_why_are_stronglifts_and_starting_strength_not_in_the_wiki.3F  which lay things out in a manner that makes sense to me and I agree with. 

As for recommendations, I recommend the Phrak variant of the Greyskull Linear Progression program (GSLP) linked here for a few months before moving to something with more accessories to target the weak points in the main lifts and get them stronger: https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/recommended_routines

I'm not saying Phrak/GSLP is amazing or ideal forever, it's very similar to SL, but the as-many-reps-as-possible (AMRAP) sets provide an alternate good way to make progress at times you can't increase weight; if you can increase volume, it's basically just as good. 

Realistically if you're brand new to lifting, any non-fucking-around program is good as long as it's not such a stupid thing that it won't hurt you, it's more a question of ""is this a good use of time compared to a different program"" and frankly I think something that says doing more than 1x5 deadlifts is bad and provides no arms/upper body accessories isn't really that.

I think the PGC moving the date forward in which non residents can apply for doe tags is a very good example of the preference that people who hunt from deer camps get. 

Another great example is the removal of the camp roster that used to be required for party hunting. Now large groups are much harder to hold accountable for issues like trespassing and tag sharing.

    Chris	Hockey	         5 

X-axis would be name and y-axis would be time, and category would be sport. I've tried using a stacked bar graph, but the problem is that I want to conserve the order of when each played the sport, and not aggregate the time for each. The total time playing sports is also important which is why I chose a stacked bar chart

I want to visualize what sport each person played, how long they played it, and see in what order they played each.

They also saw how inept, dishonest, and inefficient the business culture was, with terrible wait to get into the Olympic venue followed by an absolute miserable offering of watered-down beer and horrendous hot dogs at high price, large restrictions on bringing in food. When they went outside, they found themselves smack in the middle of nowhere, the nearest shops offering puzzling food often in Korean-only menus, credit card signs in the window despite not having POS systems and only taking cash, an incredible lack of English or tolerance for people who don't understand Korean customs like the one dish per person rule, inconsistencies on when to pay for food. Not the mention the clusterfuck that was the KTX ticket system and the inaccessibility of Pyongchang despite the obviously large volume influx of tourists.

The contrasted Japan is accessible, above all else, because the Japanese government promotes areas that support international tourism. Tokyo and Kyoto are the biggest recipients of tourists, with an adequate amount of English signage, but what stands out is how much the people in areas with a lesser influx still adjust their expectations to meet tourist needs, instead of demanding the reverse. I was impressed with the hospitality when I went to Hokkaido, a distant destination with a very low foreign population and English level, where consistent and polite service workers did their best to make visiting skiiers and snowboarders feel welcome. Until Korean service can adopt the mantra ""service workers aren't always right,"" they're going to have trouble pulling international tourism in. For now, the biggest draw is Seoul, to KPop-obsessed youth and Chinese shoppers who would rather spend less than they would in Tokyo. Korea barely registers as a cultural destination. And yet, Seoul service workers seem to have the idea of ""we're not here for you, you're here for us,"" with the antagonistic culture of Myeongdong, the rapidly decreasing quality of clubs, and a culture of people who, despite largely migrating from all over Korea, seem to be perpetually exhausted with the arrival of international residents and tourists.",1548979228

"Kenshi","t5_2td4i","- Go with the start recommend by the game.

- For lore, I recommend visiting the Great Library of Black Scratch. You can acquire the location of Black Scratch (a neutral faction town) by buying the map with its location. Or you could find it through exploration, though that may be a bit difficult as the map is quite vast, and the town is located a bit out of the way.

- There are many unique characters whom you can recruit in bars or wandering around town. Each has a unique backstory, dialogue lines, and some are even specific to another unique character you may have recruited. This is also a great way of revealing lore. Skeletons are very knowledgeable in the history of the world, and may initiate dialogues related to lore. My main character is a Skeleton and occasionally talks about the history of the area our something else when travelling with the band.

- Mining copper or scavenging the fields of battle is a viable way to keep money in your pocket when you start out. A trader's backpack can stack most items in it.

- Running away from danger and sneaking are good survival tactics.

- A polearm is a good beginners weapon. It's a weapon in the Polearms weapon class, and has armour penetration and damage vs animals modifiers.

- I don't recommend building your own settlement until you have researched level 3 technology, and a band of at least 5 capable fighters who can comfortably stand their ground against dust bandits. You can purchase a house in a town with enough power and reach/craft there until then. I recommend the town of Squin.

- What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

&amp;nbsp;

**Controls**

- Holding Ctrl and moving the mouse allows you to rotate the camera around. 

- 1-0 keys switch between characters. Double-tapping the number key locks the camera on the character assigned to that number according to the order in the squad.

- Tab switches between squads.

- Space-bar pauses/resumes the game.

- F2, F3, F4 to switch between normal game speed and increased speed.

- Shift+right clicking an action usually adds that action to the jobs list.

- If you ever find your characters having trouble finding a way to an object, try pressing Ctrl+Shift+F11. It rebuilds the navmesh. Shift+F12 opens the editor, and the ""Fix Stuff"" button can help resolve other issues.",1548979229

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","OP please read this!

I know you came here for help on your relationship but honestly, I would like to agree with others on here and repeat that it sounds like your husband is suffering from massive clinical depression.

From this post, the signs I can see are indecisiveness, irritability, self-isolation and dissociation. [Here's] (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/clinical-depression/symptoms/) a full list to see if you can spot anymore.

You say he's not usually like this or aggressive in his attitude. You say he looked away with tears in his eyes'. These are signs he's overloaded and unable to deal with what's going on around him. He's hearing it in your voice that you think he's pathetic and it's probably reiterating what his inner monologue is telling him, that he's pathetic and useless.

I'm not saying it's your place to get him help or fix him or even stand by him while he deals with this because it isn't. If you want out, then fair enough. But it honestly sounds like at this point being a divorc√©e is just as likely as being a widow by his own hand.

I would assume you're in the US, so maybe someone could link the suicide prevention hotline for there, but in the UK it's 116123. Or he can message me on here if all else fails.

Please, please, please OP even if you have given up hope on repairing your relationship, if you even care for him a little, ask him if he's been feeling depressed. Ask him if he finds the money/job stuff overwhelming. Ask him if he's been contemplating suicide. Get him to get help!",1548979230

I'll presume you agree we have more control over what *we* do than what *other* people do. So let's recap. 

Everybody agrees that China does bad things. 

Everybody agrees we should call China on their shit and pressure them, to the extent we can, to not do bad things. 

Everybody agrees the US has some responsibility in this issue. 

Everybody agrees the US can more effectively change our own actions, to rectify the parts of the problems that we have control over, than we can effectively force others to change.

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;We have seen conservatives over the course of many years raise this kind of issue around abortions later in pregnancy and what this is, is a red-herring. This is about distracting from the actual contents of the bill. This is distracting from the idea that pregnant people have the autonomy to make decisions for themselves,&amp;quot; Nash added.

&gt; This isn&amp;#039;t the first time conservatives manufactured a controversy about &amp;quot;Infanticide.&amp;quot; In 2013, conservatives blasted Planned Parenthood officials for supporting &amp;quot;The right to post-birth abortion.&amp;quot; Like in Tran&amp;#039;s case, a Planned Parenthood official was asked to comment about a highly unlikely, hypothetical situation: &amp;quot;If a baby is born on a table as a result of a botched abortion, what would Planned Parenthood want to have happen to that child that is struggling for life?&amp;quot;.

&gt; First off, most abortions take place early in pregnancy, and just over 1 percent of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later.

You didn't include the entire quote and are mischaracterizing what the OP was saying. I would assume you did this on accident but you need to be careful with your reading comprehension. OP is saying that their parents were not well off enough for OP to have benefited from them, or his immediate family with savings accounts before he entered his working life.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents opened a bank account for me and allowed me to do chores around the house in exchange for money, they forced me to save half of it, which was nice because I was a dumb child and wanted all sorts of stuff, but when I turned 16 it meant there was enough in the account to buy a crappy car. Whether my parents could afford to pay me for chores, and also whether they could afford to pay for certain necessities was outside of my control. And so I was lucky that I had that savings account, and also lucky that my parents paid for my clothes, food, and other necessary expenses so that the money I made from chores could go towards things like a bike, a scooter, a PS2, a small TV for my room, etc. And then at 16 could go towards my first car which I then used to get to a real job.

&amp;#x200B;

You could say his parents did not plan or did not have the income to enact such plans, which would be true. But that too is outside of OP's control as children have no say in who their parents will be. It's perfectly fair for him to say this was a matter of luck for him. Because it was.",1548979232

&gt;&gt; Aunque los sicilianos estaban acostumbrados a ser gobernados por extranjeros, la llegada de los [franceses](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia ""Francia"") les irrit√≥.
&gt;
&gt;El rey [angevino](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_de_Anjou-Sicilia ""Casa de Anjou-Sicilia"") instaur√≥ un gobierno tir√°nico y estableci√≥ una elevad√≠sima presi√≥n fiscal.
&gt;
&gt;Pero lo que m√°s resentimiento causaba hacia los [franceses](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia ""Francia"") era su actitud arrogante y desp√≥tica.
&gt;
&gt;Probablemente los exiliados sicilianos comenzaran pronto a conspirar con los aragoneses para recuperar el trono de [Sicilia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilia ""Sicilia"") bas√°ndose en los derechos de Constanza.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; La versi√≥n tradicional sit√∫a la chispa que encendi√≥ la revuelta en la [iglesia del Esp√≠riu Santo de Palermo](https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iglesia_del_Esp%C3%ADriu_Santo_(Palermo\)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 ""Iglesia del Esp√≠riu Santo (Palermo) (a√∫n no redactado)""), en la que se festejaba el [lunes de Pascua](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunes_de_Pascua ""Lunes de Pascua"") y numerosos habitantes de la ciudad se hab√≠an reunido para asistir a los oficios vespertinos.
&gt;
&gt;En la plaza, junto al templo, los fieles esperaban la hora de iniciar las v√≠speras cuando lleg√≥ un grupo de [franceses](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia ""Francia"") borrachos.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Una vez hubieron conseguido su independencia, los sicilianos pretendieron establecer un gobierno [republicano](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rep%C3%BAblica ""Rep√∫blica""), organizado en [comunas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comuna ""Comuna""), o en ciudades libres inspiradas en el modelo de la [Italia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia ""Italia"") central y septentrional.

"deadcells","t5_3cwrt","+1 to this, I think a kind of overlooked change has been that they locked upgrading ++/S forge to 1BC/2BC. However the extra stats from these items make a HUGE difference at the start of the run especially (for example there‚Äôs two scrolls in the first biome. If you have two items with stat bonuses, you‚Äôre essentially starting at the same strength before scrolls as you would have leaving the level.) I think this has a giant impact on how tanky enemies feel and I also think it‚Äôs something veteran players might not appreciate since in 1.0 you could farm/ unlock the forge on 0BC (I think, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). I went through farming ++ forge on 1BC and the difference in strength at the beginning/ throughout is really noticeable and makes the game a lot more enjoyable. 

Also personal 2¬¢, melee is pretty good. The hammer you said sucks is actually really strong and got enormously buffed in 1.1. You just have to play more carefully and not just spam attacks. Give survival builds a shot - there‚Äôs some great melee choices (broadsword, nutcracker, lance, war spear) and necromancy/ blind faith are pretty good once you hit like 15-16 survival.",1548979233

If they really wanted to make that how you should feel they wouldn't have done something as goofy as bubbles, it was a poor choice that undercut the drama of the moment. It also highlighted the main problem with Infinity War which is that character growth and development doesn't matter at all, and your only way to win is to physically overpower your enemy, otherwise your screwed. There's merit to be had in a villain that is an unstoppable force that overwhelms the heroes and makes them and the audience feel hopeless. Thanos did that in that scene and in the opening when he killed Loki. However, that is only good if it propels the heroes to grow beyond who they are now and develop as people, leading them to finally win. That bubble gag cuts away from that. Starlord has finally managed to try and do something he couldn't before, sacrifice someone he loves and let go for the sake of something bigger than himself - which he didn't do for his Mum. But instead of letting that resolve and linger, allowing him to gain resolve to be stronger and to grow, it becomes a joke. We should be saying oh damn he did all that for nothing but instead its made to be a haha moment because of how absurd it is to have the gun shoorlt bubbles. Literally any other way that wasn't a joke would've made that scene much better and actually have impact but Marvel refuses to do so an turns it all into a gag.",1548979234

&gt; Particularly gruesome and troubling events can harm a character‚Äôs resolve, which is damaged by fear or mentally destabilising effects in exactly the same way as lifeblood damage is cause by physical effects, except that this damage is recorded on a separate resolve track and its associated critical resolve track of 5 boxes.

I don't feel like I should reproduce the rest of the rules here, but I'll say that there's support for 3 different kinds of resolve damage depending on the source / depth of the shock so a cat scare doesn't have the same degree of damage as watching your mom being devoured by a hellworm or whatever.",1548979234

Have you considered that the Powell/FiDi area you're talking about is much more like Chinatown and Metro Center than it is like Madame's Organ or Georgetown?  I mean, Georgetown is practically not DC anymore, it purposefully doesn't have transit linkups to keep people out. lol

Why this scares me as an Employment Specialist = the amt of paper in-front of you is more of a distraction (looking for that answer you forgot), rather than a benefit.  In an interview you should review your industry / profession, compile a list of anticipated questions, and then keep your examples in responses to roughly 5 detailed scenario's you will refer back to.  If you bring a portfolio to show them examples of said scenario; even better (or on Skype digital files you can share with your interviewer).  I can also image the god awful eye contact one would project when trying to scan all the information in front of you on 8 pieces of paper.  

As a Headhunter, I'm basically interviewing a person who doesn't have faith in themselves, and doesn't have the ability to talk off the hip.  Think about the most valuable people at your organization, they don't need to reference material they know material and automatically know the solution.

"Drizzt","t5_2sklw","(Had to add this separately because the post was JUST too long)

&amp;#x200B;

\-The last item that's really long so here's an abridged thing but basically being challenged by the narrative

You may be interpreting the scene differently from me. I had the distinct impression that they were very much ALL having a hard time in the moors, he DOES have like a good 3 levels on the nearest-approaching ally at the time (iirc Bruenor was level 8 to Drizzt's level 10 at the time, and in second ed Drizzt is 16 to Bruenor's 13) so it makes sense that (at the time I feel like Salvatore wrote more with actual Dungeons and Dragons mechanics in mind than actual book logic) Drizzt would be able to fight for much longer and take more hits, as well as generally handle the threat better. I feel like Drizzt was very stretched thin there because much like you, he was worried for Regis and them too. Drizzt alone? He's a ranger back when rangers were extra badass, he probably could have survived the troll moors alone. Drizzt with his loved ones? Losing someone was a very likely looming threat.

And even without that, there was still a consistent pattern of Drizzt being challenged in encounters that were certainly quick, but still held up as challenges, such as his battle with Ertu, and his and Wulfgar's killing of Icingdeth. And of course Salvatore hit gold when he introduced Artemis to the mix.

I think the challenge to Drizzt in the narrative is there, it's just sometimes hard to see because of the scope of the things that he's doing. It's like in Two Towers when you watch the battles, it's so easy to watch Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn beating on orcs that you think for a second you're winning, before you realize it's an actual siege and there's struggle going on external to their killing. It's all contextual, and Salvatore DOES grow as an author to make that context more apparent as TSR loosened their grips on his world and books having to so strictly conform to game rules (especially with WoTC's acquisition when he was able to just not pay attention to them, I direct you to the fact that he couldn't make Cadderly a monk because they didn't exist in the second edition of the game at the moment that Salvatore wanted to write a monk).",1548979239

I trust the swedish sources over here. Tim's parents said he ""had enough"". And that's what every newspaper reported.

If Tim had written a suicide note, that means he suffered from severe depression. Worse than anyone thought. As we see in his final photos, Tim look unhealthy. He looks like he hasn't eaten for days. Something we also witnessed in the documentary. Tim also lost interest in what he used to love - music. If something was keeping him alive and going, it was music. But at some point even that didn't mean anything.

As we see in the documentary, Tim hated the tour life in his final years. He quit touring. The evidence is right in front of us. Tim suffered from severe depression. He was a shy guy that never really enjoyed all the attention. That's why I think he decided to leave a note which probably explains to his parents that no one can ever know the exact cause of death. As I said, Tim was shy, a guy with zero interest in fame. Music was his passion and it just faded. It sucks.

I am swedish and understand my people. Tim was a regular swede. We're pretty secluded here. We enjoy privacy. I'm just speculating... but it could mean something.",1548979239

*****
&gt; Warren&amp;#039;s proposal would levy an annual 2 percent tax on wealth over $50 million, with the rate rising to 3 percent on wealth over $1 billion.

&gt; While politically active wealth dynasties such as the Walton, Koch and Mars families have seen their wealth skyrocket by over 6,000 percent in recent decades, median American wealth is on the decline - and 1 in 5 of us now has zero or even negative wealth.

&gt; Like a century ago, today&amp;#039;s extreme wealth inequality requires a direct tax on wealth.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","The point is that parents shape the way we think and act. A person growing up with abusive parents has a higher chance to be abusive himself because it is what he is used to, he never learned how to deal with things the ""normal"" way. 

Obviously in the end every person makes the decision to act how they act, but how they came to the decision and what they think is acceptable is in part shaped by parents (or other people around them).

Saying ""oh that guy should just stop throwing tantrums"" is about as helpful as saying ""that depressed person should just go outside, meet some people and have fun"".

I also think it is interesting that you just assume he knows in that very moment that what he is doing is stupid and wrong. Why would any person ever do something that in their own head is the 100% wrong thing to do? In the exact moment you do something don't you always feel justified for at least a short time? The realisation of what you were doing often comes afterwards, when the emotions died down and you get to actually think about it.

I know my comparison to depression is a bit off, but when we talk about

&gt;And yet you still have to make a choice.

it is very fitting in my opinion. From my personal experience I know that not getting up and lying in bed until 2 pm is not healthy and good, that ignoring the work I should have done a week ago is shitty for everyone who depends on it. I might go to sleep thinking ""tomorrow I get up early and do shit instead of lying in bed lethargically!"" but chances are I just wake up and feel like shit and don't do anything anyway. I can look ahead and know what I should do, I can look back and know what I should have done but in the now I feel justified to make the ""wrong"" decision somehow anyway.

Yes I make that decision but I really don't feel in control and I feel like the very same thing can be applied to people with temper / violence problems. And just like depression it might be also have a lot to do with those stupid chemicals in your brain and just like for depression therapy is very helpful.

Gameplay affecting options, only purchasable through free currency. They might apply the same ideology to any new javelins. Purchase with Coin only. Or they might go the route of Coin and Shards, but the free option would still be there (for dedicated players).

Formally, speciation requires reproductive isolation. That is, what was once a single, interbreeding population becomes separated and then genetic changes accumulate in the separate groups that make it impossible for them to reproduce together. Humans have not yet been in that scenario. Radiations out of Africa were not that long ago and humans have been on the move and interbreeding with the populations they meet since forever. I agree with you that seems unlikely on Earth; even in an apocalypse back to the Stone Age scenario with only a handful of scattered groups of a few hundred left in the world we probably would either die out or re-encounter one another before becoming reproductively isolated. It seems to be our nature to wander the globe asking one another ""u fuk?"" I think the most likely scenario for you to be wrong would be if some of us permanently left Earth.

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","You're misunderstanding my point.  My point isn't that the system is perfect right now, it's that you should give it time for the rough spots to be smoothed out before calling it a disaster.

&gt; Word on the street is that the flak cloud system can be avoided by good CV players, meaning i am just as screwed post patch as i was pre patch if i was singled out. And on top the changes to the AA system make it even harder to meaningful spec for it and eliminate the planes.

And if you're a good BB player, you can still tangle with destroyers up close in a brawl and come out on top even without a secondary build.  I don't see why skilled CV players shouldn't fare better against you than poor ones.  Moreover, while flak can be avoided, there is still a DoT that affects planes as long as they attack you.  Buffing the constant aura in exchange for lowering flak damage would make solo air defense more reliable against skilled players, sure, but a few numbers being out of line doesn't make the system as a whole a failed concept.

&gt; The infinte planes also make sure that a CV stays a threat no matter how long into the game. Pre patch a CV that was wasteful in the first strikes would have been punished by being deplaned and thus neutralized as a threat. Now this is no longer the case.

I would agree this is a problem if WG didn't also significantly buff the HP of AA guns and secondaries.  Main turrets and torpedo tubes are also not commonly-lost, especially if you invest in their survivability.  Your capability to fend off a carrier doesn't depreciate nearly as much as it used to, so I don't see why you think it's fair that CVs should still pay just as much for attacking you as they did prior to the rework.  Balancing plane resupply rates and penalties to increase the effects of attrition might be in order, but again, that's not a problem with the concepts of the system, just the details.

&gt; they can strike until the last minute and never have to worry about being useless for the last 5 min if they stubbornly destroyed a AA spec ship early on that downed a lot of their planes.

Same thing I said above.  Why shouldn't they be able to keep attacking you when your ability to repel them doesn't deteriorate as much?  Especially when each attack doesn't have the potential to be fatal regardless of your health pool?

&gt; Not to mention that Air Superiority CVs like the Saipan got massively shafted as their no longer is a Air Superiority and the new MM is now the broken Tier VIII, meaning even if i wanted to use the new system i end up in the worst MM tier and have to face Tier X.

WG reworked every premium CV from the ground up.  *Saipan* is the second-best if not best of the T8 premiums right now, because now she has T10 planes without suffering from her old drawback of a smaller hangar reserve.  I will grant you that CV uptiering is still an issue, and it will always be because of how widely-varied AA performance is, but the unlimited reserves and ability to dodge the worst of enemy AA has alleviated those pains to a great extent.  Perhaps too much, given what's happening to DDs right now, but that's a matter of tweaking AA damage values.",1548979250

I'm saying frugality nets you more than extra income, and it's also easier to make the most of what you have vs what you don't have. If you aren't frugal and earn 200k, you might blow all of it every year and live paycheck to paycheck. HCOL area, expensive house, taste, hobbies. Now let's say you earn 200k, but you're saving 50% because you are living extraordinarily below your means.


Extra income is awesome. Don't get me wrong, the number will increase much faster if you are earning more. But, I'd venture to say most millionaires are frugal.",1548979251

Whenever I play a new-world race, I play them on the Vortex campaign for the sake of turn timers, and frankly the lack of need for factions on the far side of the globe. The reality is, when I'm playing certain OW factions, I never have any substantial  interaction with the NW unless I make it happen. Exceptions happen of course, I've had elves come and burn my peasant hovels in Bretonnia games. I hate how close Ulthuan is.

I miss the more focused campaign of WH1, Mortal Empires is absolutely sprawling and I can't fathom how much worse it'll be when we have a super-mega map including the Darklands &amp; Mountains of Mourn. Or, hell, even Cathay. Crazy!

Really though, the best solution would be for them to work on the campaign map, get the turn times down lower, get it to *run* better; the battles run smoother than the campaign!

Taking two or maybe three community college classes on software development and developing software as a group would be great, if somewhat rather time-consuming.  

The PMP approach (which I believe is pretty Waterfall based) is kinda out of vogue for most, but not all technology projects.  

A book on the CompTIA A+ cert would help build vocabulary. Actually completing the cert is optional though, so feel free to buy a used certification guide for cheap.  

&gt; Is transitioning to the IT field (where I feel many more higher paying jobs are available) something that is possible as a Project Manager without much technical IT experience?  

Yes, but don't expect it to be easy or rapid.  

You are useless without a nerd vocabulary.  

Amazon has a Cloud Introductory training class and certification that is free and takes about 10 hours to complete.

"batman","t5_2qqt8","I would like to see a movie that focuses on Gotham City and how it‚Äôs characters are products of its influence, with Batman interacting with the different types of characters that inhabit it. I would like to see Batman already established with a couple of rogues already aquatinted with him in some way to let them serve as supporting characters. I think Batman should have some sort of Arsenal in his possession but nothing too crazy. I think he should have some form of Batmobile (the protagonist‚Äôs cars are often staples in film noir) and I think a small cache of gadgets utilized in his detective work but nothing too crazy.

I don‚Äôt want to see Leto‚Äôs Joker in it, or any other Joker for that matter (he‚Äôs a little overrated right now and there are too many Jokers right now) but I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to the Joker‚Äôs existence being referenced. I just don‚Äôt want to see him as the main villain because it‚Äôs already been done countless times. 

The Riddler has always been my favorite Batman villain and I actually think he would be perfect for the noir/detective driven storyline that Reeves has claimed to be aiming for. I also feel like a villain like the Riddler is extremely relevant in the age of computers, cyber security, and information. I would like the Riddler to be similar to the way Scott Snyder portrayed him in Zero Year where he has attributes that are similar to Bruce‚Äôs (if you pay attention they establish that both Edward and Bruce were inspired by Zorro and in their own way are disgusted by the lack of order in Gotham City. The Riddler represents the horrors of not being able to solve the problems we will be forced to confront in the future, something we can‚Äôt simply destroy with conventional weapons but instead must be defeated with pragmatism and creativity. For this to work, it would require an actor that can capture Riddler‚Äôs personality as a menacing intellect, similar to Christoph Waltz‚Äôs character in Inglorious Basterds (I do not support all the Johnny Depp/Neil Patrick Harris/David Tennant castings at all).

I also don‚Äôt think it should have the ‚ÄúBat family‚Äù but I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to Barbara being a character that offers her technological expertise in some way akin to her abilities as Oracle. I would also like to see characters such as Harvey Dent, Falcone, Oswald Cobblepott, and Selina Kyle in minor supporting roles to establish the existence of Gotham‚Äôs underground. 

With all this being said, I also wouldn‚Äôt mind a ‚ÄúCourt if Owls‚Äù storyline either and tbh, I feel like this might be a direction Matt Reeves might go with since it has not been done yet and would liberate Matt Reeves from having to worry about his story being compared to any Joker films.

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","1: Skyrim isn't limited to 3.1 GB of VRAM. It never was. It's essentially unlimited. There was a brief time where classic was limited to 4GB due to a bug in Windows 10 and Windows 8. This was fixed in Windows 10.

2: Skyrim itself had a period where it was limited to 3.1 GB of system memory. This was patched in 1.1? 1.2? A long time ago. As a 32-bit application, it's limited to 4GB normally. 

ENBoost creates new processes that effectively provide extra memory to Skyrim, giving it no hard upper limit as far as I know. 

Having the ENB Binaries (ENBoost) properly configured is *critical* with any classic setup, for performance stability and otherwise. The STEP site will explain how to do so.

"ps3homebrew","t5_2s9jx","Nope. Modding on a PS3 is virtually impossible for two reasons. The game in question has to have the same or similar system and file structure as its PC counterpart for the sake of compatibility with PC mods, and the hardware itself is a big limiter since it has nowhere near the same amount of power as a PC and uses its own processor that is different from what's in a PC. Because of this, you get very little headroom for running extras, it will probably fail due to a lack of compatibility, and you will have to directly modify the game files every single time that you want to change something.

However, there are exceptions. Creation Engine games use a simple package structure on all systems with mere tuning differences in most cases, hence why Skyrim mods are a thing. There are the VERY rare instances where someone made a mod for a game specifically for the PS3, but they often fade into obscurity or are hosted on very shady sites.

Point is, no. Even on Skyrim, loading mods will crash your game inside of an hour, assmuing that you went through the headache of dissecting the disc image, replacing and backing up individual files and packages, repacking the image, then loading that back on the console.",1548979257

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","Keep in mind that labor share of income (or the part of it that matters at least) is still overestimated. John Smith:

&gt; One factor causing labor‚Äôs share of income to be overestimated and the steepness of its decline to be underestimated are the super-wages, bonuses, stock options, and other benefits paid to employers and managers that are falsely counted as labor income.^(1) The ¬£2.7 million lump sum and ¬£703,000 annual pension (later reduced to ¬£342,500) received by Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin upon his retirement in January 2009 is counted toward labor‚Äôs share of GDP. This payoff became notorious a few weeks later, when the UK government covered ¬£24 billion losses by his bank, the largest loss in UK corporate history. [...]

&gt; Another distortion arises from the method of accounting for the income received by self-employed workers and by family members. [...] In a revealing study, Michael Elsby, Bart Hobijn, and Ay≈üeg√ºl ≈ûahƒ±n report that in the United States‚Äîand, by implication elsewhere in other imperialist countries‚Äîthis arbitrary treatment of self-employed income seriously impairs calculations of the decline of labor‚Äôs share. Elsby et al.‚Äôs research is especially important because they reveal how headline figures on labor‚Äôs share of national income (or of GDP, which amounts to the same thing), which are already dramatic enough, greatly underestimate the true extent of its decline. [...] ^(2)

Bonus memes:

&gt; Reducing [Unit Labor Cost] and increasing competitiveness is a central aim of employers and governments alike, and this is achieved when the productivity of labor rises faster than the wage paid to labor, or when it falls slower. Jesus Felipe, a researcher at the Asian Development Bank, has made the extremely important point that *unit labor cost is just a different way of expressing labor‚Äôs share of GDP*, or, in his words, ‚Äúin standard analyses, an economy is deemed more competitive the lower its ULC is. **The flip side of this line of reasoning is that an economy is more competitive the lower its labor share is, *ceteris paribus*. Hence, a great deal of policies to lower ULCs are, effectively, policies to lower the share of labor in income.**‚Äù^(3) In a paper with Utsav Kumar, Jesus Felipe adds, ‚ÄúUnit labor costs calculated with aggregate data are no more than the economy‚Äôs labor share in total output multiplied by a price effect.‚Äù^(4)

and

&gt; [T]he ILO found that **countries with high trade-union density experience a slower decline in labor‚Äôs share, but a decline nonetheless**: ‚ÄúIn countries where collective bargaining covered more than 30 percent of employees, any additional 1 percent of economic growth was accompanied by a 0.87 percent growth in wages, compared with only 0.65 percent wage growth in countries with lower coverage ‚Ä¶ our analysis shows that collective bargaining contributed to lower overall wage inequality.‚Äù^(5) **But there is a price to pay: union organization might result in a larger share, but of a smaller pie**, as the ILO‚Äôs Nomaan Majid has found: ‚ÄúIn developing economies ‚Ä¶ greater bargaining rights in parts of the organized economy may ‚Ä¶ constitute investment disincentives,‚Äù resulting in lower GDP growth and therefore a ‚Äúdepressing impact on the wages of all workers taken together. This finding seems to be valid in both the developing and the developed economies.‚Äù^(6) **The conclusion that workers and their trade unions should draw from this is that the fall in labor‚Äôs share that is so characteristic of the neoliberal era was not dreamed up by devilish capitalist politicians, nor is it merely the result of a particular type of capitalism that can be changed like a suit of clothes. It is the result of systemic contradictions, and the efforts of capitalists and their captive governments to resolve them by increasing their exploitation of living labor and nature. This trend cannot be resisted without challenging capitalism itself. So long as trade unions restrict themselves to seeking to protect workers‚Äô conditions within capitalism, they will not only fail, they will become part of the problem, as the logic of protectionism and nationalism leads to xenophobia, the construction of razor-wire borders to keep migrant workers out, and ultimately to fascism and the destruction of independent union organizations.**

"pittsburgh","t5_2qhrn","FWIW -- I have, but I'm not in Pittsburgh right now.

I've used Instacart and I currently use Shipt. Of the two, I prefer Shipt.

At least where I live, Instacart wins for having more stores available.  Here, they have about 10, including one of the mega-pet stores. 

Shipt, again where I live, only has two stores available: one of the big grocery stores and Target, who bought the company.

 I found Instacart difficult to deal with. Their website can be frustrating and confusing -- try to figure out how to obtain a regular membership. I had trouble communicating with the shoppers, who (optionally) can be told to contact when an item is unavailable, and rarely did.  Contacting the main company customer service was difficult, too, as they preferred email and would auto-send canned responses that never answered my actual question.

On the other hand, I've had little problems with Shipt. Most of the Shipt shoppers have been great about communicating while shopping and are willing to make a pile of suggestions if something is unavailable. All of my customer service requests have been done over real time chat and things fixed right away. 

That's just my opinion. If Shipt isn't in your area right now, you may be 'stuck' with Instacart. IIRC both have a trial period, first month free and such. Beware of Instacart's, though. I paid for a second month because if you don't cancel before the end of the trial, they start billing you.

"AnthemTheGame","t5_3lspr","Ranger is the best aoe imo. Yes there combo effect is single target but most of their detonators are aoe. So if you are aoe detonating and getting that nice spike damage on everything that could be huge. 

While yes there is a threshold, between the exponential colossus aoe detonation and linear ranger detonation but the radius between the grenade and high impact mortar are almost equal. So unless there‚Äôs a high density of enemies for a colossus  to hit with the small single mortar which I haven‚Äôt personally seen more than 5-6 (rarely only can think of adds in the tyrant fight) while 3-4 seem like the most frequent I‚Äôm thinking the ranger combo might come out ahead. 

Ranger 3 targets combo‚Äôd 3 strong spikes 4 targets 4 spikes

Colossus 3 Targets combo‚Äôd 9 bursts. 4 targets 16 bursts 

So the question remains at what point / enemy count does the colossus over take the ranger.

Also another thing to factor in is the blast radius of the colossus combo and the secondary uncombo‚Äôd targets it could potentially effect. 

While on the other hand the ranger ultimate can combo off a lot of targets that are spread out. 

And lastly how often can each combo, what range can they combo and how many targets can they consistently combo. 

My thinking will be for add control obviously colossus will come out ahead, however adds are just for padding and in a council fight ( 2-5 target boss fight) I think the ranger will come out ahead.

______________________________________ 

**Q:** Also what is up with Jana Duggar? Is there talk amongst the ATI about why she seems so sad and is still unmarried?

**A:** The talk is that she has a ""rebellious spirit"" she is kind of one of the ""bad"" Duggars in that she has asked questions about their beliefs. I think that she is unhappy and does not know what to do because everything she's ever known isn't working.
______________________________________________
**Q:** Do you think JimBob is keeping all the 19kac $$? Jana is over 18, and she and her sisters authored a book. You spoke earlier about keeping your money separate from your dad. Do you think the Duggar adult kids have access to their money or no?

**A:** I don't know if Mr. Jim Bob is keeping the money. Hes not an evil supervillian he means well he's just VERY misled

I don't know for sure but in most cases the possessions and money and such are controlled by the father until they get married when they're controlled by the husband. Also keep in mind that girls like Jana have no real life skills outside of being a housewife. Even if she has financial independence there's not much she could do with it.
______________________________________________
**Q:** What are some rules your parents have for you that you find to be ridiculous?

**A:** Hmmm this could be a very long list I'll just name the ones off the top of my head. I'm not allowed to watch any movies or read books with any sort of cuss words or violence or sex in them. (I've never watched a pg-13 movie.) No masturbating. Period. I'm only allowed to use the computer if the family's looking over my shoulder. (I am breaking that right now.) On Sundays we are not allowed to talk about or do anything that doesn't involve the bible or God in some way. This was one that was recently changed but I was told no dating unless it's the woman I'm going to marry and I can support a wife. Also if I do have a girlfriend no physical contact. Maybe hand holding but that would be pushing it if it was prolonged too much. That's just the ones off the top of my head although there are many more
_________________________________________

From the FJ thread, someone copied the answer I read about Jana being an engineer. This is what he said when someone asked for what rebellious things Jana did: 

&gt; I know the biggest one was that she wanted to be an engineer or something and live in a big city like new York but that was shut down quickly.

Q: What type of things have the Duggars done to ""tame"" her ""rebellious spirit""? In one of your responses you mention that you are told not to talk/interact/make eye contact with someone who is being rebellious until they are fixed....did the duggars do that with Jana?

&gt;  They have done the regular shunning and probably made her memorize verses and work on ATI cirriculum on why she is bad for not agreeing with everything.
&gt; 
&gt; If they did that I was never told about it but I do know she talked about how she had been through sin of lust but had learned that she needed to have Jesus as her boyfriend until she found a husband.",1548979260

Honestly I don't have a lot of trust in Team 5 on this sort of thing. Is it quite possible what they say is true and odd/even cost had nothing to do with it? Yes. Does that seem likely to me, given the severity of the nerf when compared to previous nerfs, and Team 5's sketchy record in the past on issues of fudging the truth a bit for the sake of PR? No.

I would accept that Equality was nerfed for reasons that weren't *mainly* odd/even related, but the idea that odd/even costs were not factored into the nerf *at all*? lol, no. It's been pointed out already that 3 mana equality would probably be crazy in Odd Pally, Blizzard 100% knew that when calculating this nerf, and 2 mana is an extreme nerf for that effect.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","Maybe not blood libel as he was head of the military but definitely singling out and demonizing Israel. You could say this about literally any high ranking nato officer or any other country with aggressive neighbors.

Yes Israeli military members attacked areas that had civilian and children populations which lead to casualties. However, anti zionists (who are just thinly veiled anti semites) conveniently forget that hamas, which literally put weapons caches under hospitals and preschools, tell the citizens to stay in the place where the attack will happen. Everyone knows where the attack will happen.

For example, in operation protective edge in 2014, there were 4 kids killed on the beach of Gaza. Immediately afterwards reporters flooded the beach. How did they know that the attack would happen, or that it was over? The Israelis literally dropped thousands of leaflets announcing the time and place of the attack. The foreign reporters could see the kids playing on the beach. They let the kids die so they could tell a story or how evil Israel is.

It's time we became more educated, time to be more vigilant. Allowing news stories like these to reach the masses only give groups like hamas more power to perpetuate the problem. Anyone who truly claimed to be working for the sake of the Palestinians wouldn't support such an oppressive regime that literally uses its citizens as human shields",1548979263

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Sex carries the risk of pregnancy. 

If you consent to sex then you consent to the risks involved.

You think this is a debate over abortion rights‚Äî**it‚Äôs not.**

It‚Äôs about the fact that when a woman makes the choice to have sex, she accepts the risk of pregnancy. It‚Äôs that simple. Having an abortion does not change the fact that she consented to the risk of pregnancy.  Keep in mind that conception is primary biological function of sex. Whether you like it or not, that is a fact. We like to pretend we have full control of our reproduction, but we don‚Äôt. No form of birth control or contraception is 100% effective. 

The abortion argument is about whether a pregnant woman has the right to terminate the life of her fetus.

&gt;It means that your stance against abortion isn't fueled by compassion for the fetus, or because you believe it deserves a life, but fueled by the desire to punish women for their actions, and force consequences on them. 

Here you go flinging poo again. As I said above this conversation isn‚Äôt even about abortion rights. But you can shut the hell up with your bullshit baseless accusations about me.",1548979264

While it is indeed unrealistic to think we can discuss the film without reference to its writer/director, a bit less venom and name-calling from some of us would be an improvement.  I'd like to say, ""don't make it about his personality at all, make it about his work,"" but I don't think you can completely separate the two.  So how about, ""Let's focus on those aspects that might actually be relevant to whatever the hell happened with TLJ""?  

So, *Annie Hall*.  Very good film, nothing wrong with admiring it.  I do myself.  However, I think this is another bit of evidence for my theory that Rian Johnson was not even remotely interested in making a ""Star Wars"" film, and probably accepted the gig only because it was too big a chance to turn down.  Besides, having ""it broke so many rules"" as your number one reason for liking *any* film is a pretty superficial and simplistic take in itself- but one that does seem very characteristic of Johnson's mindset.",1548979264

&gt; Facebook said Thursday it took down hundreds of &amp;quot;Inauthentic&amp;quot; accounts from Iran that were part of a vast manipulation campaign operating in more than 20 countries, including Israel.

&gt; The pages were part of a campaign to promote Iranian interests in various countries by creating fake identities of residents of those nations, according to a statement by Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy at Facebook.

&gt; The operators &amp;quot;Typically represented themselves as locals, often using fake accounts, and posted news stories on current events,&amp;quot; including &amp;quot;Commentary that repurposed Iranian state media&amp;#039;s reporting on topics like Israel-Palestine relations and the conflicts in Syria and Yemen,&amp;quot; Gleicher said.

I‚Äôm just here to have fun and talk about Trek with other people that want to have fun and talking about Trek. Sometimes serious conversations do come up though. Anyway, with a friendly tone in mind, on to my reply....

I understand that when you are consuming a product that someone else is creating, you‚Äôre going to get some lessons on what they feel is important. Unless you‚Äôre reading a technical manual, you‚Äôre going to have those elements woven into the story and the characters. 

I can enjoy it for the elements that I find appealing and I don‚Äôt let something that I don‚Äôt agree with ruin my experience. I think Star Trek does a great job of telling a great story. I think the writers do a great job of exploring social issues as well. Even if they take a side I don‚Äôt agree with, it doesn‚Äôt ruin the story. 

I haven‚Äôt seen anything I find offensive or am uncomfortable with in Trek, and yeah, sometimes they have episodes that make me think outside of the experience that I turned the show on for. Just as a general blanket statement, if I‚Äôm watching something for entertainment value, that‚Äôs all I really want to get.  But that‚Äôs not how the work works. That‚Äôs not how TV works. Every show tackles tough issues at one point or the other.  But, I don‚Äôt need a TV show for affirmation for my beliefs or to be a platform for what I find important. I live my life in a way that hopefully promotes my values.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","I don't know if they'd be able to use the same version of hp that we do, because I think that, particularly with the variation of rolled hit points between similar creatures, if you ignore the average value (1d8-2 for a toad, for instance, rather than always using the average of 2.) I do think that using fall damage would be a great way to come up with a metric though, since it would be more easily replicated by other experimenters than getting someone to, say, attack a toad. So I did some wild math that may or may not be correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using randomly generated numbers and an embarrassing excel doc:

100% of toads, even very, very, wildly lucky ones, will die or be disabled when dropped from 60 feet

About 55% of toads will die/be disabled when dropped from only 10 feet. 

Something like 97.5% of toads will die/be disabled when dropped 30 feet. Almost none survive a 40 foot drop. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, a Golorian scientist might say that a good metric for hp is to determine how many feet of fall damage it takes to kill a creature within a 5% margin of error. A toad has a unit of hp that can be reliably reduced to 0 or negative by a 30 foot fall. So they could measure hp in units of toads. (1 toad = feet of fall damage it takes to kill 95% or more of a creature on average/ 30 feet). They could just repeatedly drop creatures off of a 30ft tall tower to avoid the max fall damage cap. Though they‚Äôd have to do something to disable flying monsters, monsters w/ fast healing, etc... And they‚Äôd probably have a nightmare of a time capturing and repeatedly dropping 200 or so tarrasques to get an accurate toad measurement on them. ",1548979268

Memes that can be considered lightly/lazily fried may be removed. You shouldn't just add a few filters of noise. This is /r/DeepFriedMemes, not r/sauteedmemes. We shouldn't have to say this since it's so obvious but completely raw memes are not allowed either.

Unsure why your meme is considered underfried / lazily fried? Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFriedMemes/comments/8ido71/psa_what_is_frying_and_what_is_not/) to understand why

10) Edgy memes are not allowed and will be removed. There are very obvious lines that shouldn't be crossed. This includes (but is not limited to) jokes about pedophilia/child exploitation, rape, incest, terrorist attacks, school shootings, sexual assault, and bombings. Don't make memes out of tragic events on the day it happens, have some respect.

Mods reserve themselves the right to remove/approve content they want even if it doesn't explicitly break/conform to a rule.

Pre-dominant chords -- well, ii and IV specifically -- going to the tonic have a feeling of moving backwards; they're kind of falling back to the tonic rather than resolving up to it.  Honestly, I don't know where the line is drawn between plagal and authentic.  bVII - I is not plagal, but IV - I and ii - I is.  Whatever chord actually needs to have *directionality* to the tonic *and* it has to be at the cadence, so something like bVI - I isn't a dominant-tonic relationship, but maybe it's plagal at a cadence?  Then there's the cto7; I'm not sure where that fits in.  But the bVII specifically, and the bII in phrgian modes (and as a tritone sub in jazz-influenced music), are used as dominant equivalents.  You can even have weirder dominant-type chords, like the viiob8.  That's a great one.",1548979271

"JustNoSO","t5_3982d","I went through your post history. Your MIL badmouths you behind his back and he believes her is read of shutting her down. He prioritizes her over you all the time **but he wouldn‚Äôt allow you to visit your family back home for more than a week!!!** And now it‚Äôs okay for your MIL to stay for however long she wants, but he is being rude to your family and fighting with you so that they don‚Äôt stay for more than two weeks.

You are in an abusive relationship it seems. At the very least your husband is extremely controlling and he destroys your self esteem. Please stop trying for a baby with him because that will keep you from moving home with your family when you finally find the courage to leave him. Or if you want to stay in the US even if you divorce him, it will keep you tied to this horrible guy and his mother forever. 
If you have a kid with him and stay with him, imagine what this child‚Äôs life will be like. You will take his or her chance at the best childhood by staying with him because he is a controlling asshole that oppresses his or her mummy. The kids will see that and learn that this is normal behavior. For your child, you are perfect. So if that‚Äôs the way perfect people treat their partner/let themselves be treated by their partner, it must be the way to be, right? You will model your child an extremely unhealthy relationship. 

OP it‚Äôs painfully obvious that you have very low self esteem. The way your husband treats you shows that he has no respect for you and you just take it. Last time his mother overstayed her welcome you left and went to a hotel *and he didn‚Äôt care!* So you just came back! And now you are afraid to leave because deep down you know he won‚Äôt send his mother home, he won‚Äôt change, he won‚Äôt even care very much. Is that the kind of marriage you want to be in? Do you feel like you are somehow broken and you won‚Äôt find someone else if you leave him? Does he sometimes make little subtle or not-so-subtle hints that you are somehow inferior and should be grateful that he ‚Äûputs up with‚Äú you? 
**You don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like this.** You deserve a partner who wants to know your opinion, who loves and respects you, who cares about you. You are worthy of respect. You have value. ",1548979278

"urbanplanning","t5_2qhp7","As a resident of Portland for the last 19 years, I would have to vote Smart Growth.  Our lovely city certainly has affordability issues, but not much moreso than every large city on the west coast.  The urban growth boundary is one of the things that keeps this city so connected to the surrounding natural areas.  Much like Boulder Colorado has a mountain range limiting development to the west of town, or San Francisco has water on three sides, our growth boundary replaces natural barriers with one that is artificial. 

Yes, developers of sprawl have said that it limits development opportunity.  I would argue that development and redevelopment needs to be done differently here than in places where housing developments happen.  It needs to be denser.  This allows for much greater efficiency for mass transit and infrastructure.

Again, we aren't perfect, but if you took away our UGB all of those great natural resources outside of town would disappear in a heartbeat.  When the UGB gets pushed, it is crazy to see how fast that land disappears under a swatch of single family homes.  ",1548979279

If I go to max a throwaway knight real quick, with no event I can get 5-7 def for a life but during an event with life, it can be 2 life for 8. 

Also I should add that during these events, high value items prices can fluctuate. I saw some very insane deals bc of life inflation during the last tomb event. People buying decas for upwards of 12 life whereas normally its 8-10",1548979279

You're thinking about this wrong: Why is toxic to have to add a chalice to your deck to stop Yubel when, to stop Kaoa'ki, it's adding ""common"" things that you may not even draw and get otk'd anyway? Yubel, at least, allows for some input you know how to play around it. Most common decks carry an out to Yubel, this is why Yubel isn't hailed to be the tier zero deck you make it out to be(And if you think it's hard to miss timing, you have more troubles than dealing with Yubel). You pop the forms on your terms, not their terms, it's actually quite simple.


Also even if this *Was* the case, you should totally be punished for preparing for common decks. This is how other decks bread and butter: they deviate from the norm. Sea Stealth? You bet. Geargia? Haha yeah! Wildheart anti meta? Literally in the name! Toons? Toons...Eh.

You can't prepare for everything, nor should deck be able to prepare for everything. It's a sign of poor balance when you can. There are always going to be decks that capitalize on what other decks are running as techs in order to slide through the cracks. Something should not be nerfed because you find it annoying, especially when it isn't even menacing the highest tiers of the game. ",1548979281

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","How many Supreme Court Justices do you think Trump will end up nominating?

We are already at two, which is tremendous. Do you think ole Ruthie will live to see February? Previous diagnoses of colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, now two separate nodes on the lung? Two nodes suggest type IV cancer that has metastasized from another source to the lungs. Tragically, I hear she has contracted pneumonia and is fighting for her life as she cancels all upcoming events. That would make three.

Sotomayor is 64, and the life expectancy of a woman with type I diabetes is 67. Again, how much longer will she be fit to serve? That brings us to four, and also results in the removal of two of the most sickeningly liberal justices.

When Trump wins again in 2020 after Pelosi and the dems fail to do anything at all, Clarence Thomas will step down to ensure Trump selects another likeminded, strict constitutionalist. That brings us to five. At minimum, Trump will get one more, but there is a chance that five of the nine highest judges of the land will be handpicked to MAGA. These are lifetime appointments, so Trump's influence will be felt in DC for the next two to three decades. This doesn't even take into account the fact that he is confirming federal judges at an unprecedented rate. Who controls judicial confirmations? Trump's GOP Senate.

So allow me to give you a sneak peak of how all this will play out. Trump will draft any and every executive order (or declare an emergency for the wall) he wants, allowing him to legislate without Congress (just like obama did!). The left will bitch and moan about this authoritarianism, the media will melt down, and the Executive Orders will eventually end up before the newly conservative Supreme Court.

I'm not quite sure what you think you're trying to prove by saying ""they could totally ignore the fans so we should be grateful for whatever we get,"" but it implies that your opinion of the gang isn't incredibly high if that's the standard you set for them.

It's also basically the exact opposite of what Andrew posted in his response to the thread, and I hope the wave of ""y'all are entitled"" posters isn't indicative of a toxic faction within WHM fandom.

What everyone needs to be reminded of is that this wasn't a zero-sum game - the ""pro-podders"" (such as we are) wanted everyone to be able to enjoy the content (whether visually or aurally), while the ""pro-YouTubers"" seem to take a specific pleasure in telling the podders to sit and spin. One side wanted everyone to be able to access content that - until recently - has been available to all. The other didn't. That's the long and short of it.

&gt; but perhaps a bit more politeness - and a bit more perspective- might be more how things should proceed when they do things you don't like

The main thread was incredibly polite and forward-thinking, especially compared to the average level of discourse on the internet. Not much if any profanity, no ad-hominems, reasonable debate. Everyone likes the show, everyone likes the guys, and even if Eric's reputation has perhaps taken a bit of a hit, we are concerned for and supportive of him.

The narrative that people weren't polite or whatever is a false one by any reasonable measuring stick. In the end, you are right - they could close this subreddit, close the Facebook page, and make the Twitter account an announcement-only feed. Instead they interact with fans, answer questions, trade jokes, and - \*gasp* - take feedback! Just like many popular podcasts out there.

That's just how it is these days, and the best podcast communities out there either have fans who understand the balance needed when interacting with the creators, or they're so big that there are several layers of moderation between the hosts and the fans. Maybe WHM will reach the latter one day, maybe not, but anyone arguing that yesterday's thread was anything other than a successful example of community engagement is fueling a false narrative.",1548979284

Lineman does put great importance on holding to particular limits and does not tolerate therapy interfering behavior in the slightest, but attempting to cause an uproar if someone is seconds late to a session and general shaming doesn‚Äôt align. Yes it is important to take treatment seriously, yes it is important to be on time and take the steps so that is possible, and I would expect tardiness to be addressed if it was say 5 minutes or more late, but seconds to a minute is a stretch. 

In regard to the shaming and devaluing aspect, that sounds incongruent to DBT as there is an emphasis on invalidating environments and situations being one of the factors leading to BPD in the first place. Therefore, a devaluing therapeutic environment doesn‚Äôt mesh with me. There are amazing therapists out there, some downright awful ones who are even terrible people, and everything in between. My take is that this is an example of one that, at minimum, doesn‚Äôt act in concordance to the model and expectations. As you even said she didn‚Äôt pay attention to your SI even though that is of number one importance.

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","I'm MtF but I had super oily skin and specially face that I really had to be vigilant with pre-HRT. I can help with prevention maybe.

For face: If you sweat or your face gets oily, you should wash or at least wipe as soon as possible. When you wash, make sure you use a male face wash because women ones can be too mild. That was a major thing in my case and I guess you may not have as much of a hangup as me. Afterwards, use a good, water-based moisturiser because otherwise your face can dry up and ironically get oily again. For this same reason, don't wash too many times each day. For me, my minimum was twice per day and max was thrice. Also, make sure you change/wash your pillow cases and bedding often if your face touches them, and avoid silk.

For body: Again, if you sweat or work out a lot, you'd ideally not want to spend a long time without showering. Again, get a soap and moisturiser that is appropriate for your skin to not leave it too dry or oily. And exfoliating is useful too to keep pores unclogged.

And not touching, squeezing, or playing with pimples no matter how tempting is what's best for my skin to minimise scars and discoloration.


Edit: If it's serious, you'd be better off seeing a skin specialist and using medicine but those practices are good to do if you don't to help prevent or reduce acne in anybody's case.",1548979288

This was from the excerpt about Henry's interrogation after the MCI:

""The man had been almost incoherent, so shaken that he could not give straight answers. He sounded as if he were lying, and to most people, that was proof enough."" (Off-topic, but that also describes Phone Guy's mannerisms, and it was once theorized he was lying and was the murderer in the games.)

The fact that he beat Boyega's character but not Rey makes it even worse, as Boyega's character is, in canon, a very skilled fighter.

- Please show the part where she actually received training. You can't, because she never did. That was kinda the whole point with Luke. If the honor guard are anything like Palpatines, which considering the First Order is Empire remnants, they should be, they are trained specifically to tackle force users. At bare minimum they should have significantly more cqc skills than someone who has never had any training ever. Since it's a ""principle"" in every star wars, can you point to where Luke beat Palpatine's honor guard?

- Ah, so it's acceptable for a man to struggle.

- Yet she beat the honor guard and denied Kylo. She kept both her arms, and snoke is dead. Pretty much a win for her.

Do you try new foods and cuisines? Do you watch new TV shows and movies? Ever go to a museum to check out work by a new artist? Go to a music festival and hear a new band - or even a first act at a concert? I think that chip on your shoulder is so big that it is blocking your hearing. This ""jazz appeals to white privilege"" is JUST NOT TRUE. If it is all about money, yeah, people with no money are stuck with radio mostly. But that just proves this point: jazz fell out of favor when rock-and-roll became big, and now with the fracturing of entertainment channels, there are no universal channels like radio of the past that have a big, diverse audience to promote more varied musical formats - they just push popular music based on tight musical demographics. Jazz just doesn't get enough exposure, nor does classical, nor poetry ... . MSM is fixated on what the youngest generation is listening to - popular musicians like Kanye, Beyonc√©, etc. It creates a feedback loop: people aren't listening to jazz because they are not hearing jazz anywhere. The good news is that some musicians are breaking through in small ways, like Kamasi, Esperanza, Glasper, Thundercat, etc., and that may bring more young listeners (of all classes, races, IQs, and genders) to jazz - without knowing Miles, Coltrane, or Bird. I saw Kamasi open for Sylvan Esso! Most of those young people had NO idea about traditional jazz. Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube, etc., make hearing something new as easy as a click (if you can afford the equipment to hear it). **The main problem is making people aware it is all there a click away.**

"legaladviceofftopic","t5_3b5at","You'd have to look at the [specific laws](https://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/laws-protect-pets-severe-weather) in a particular city or state, as they're usually a bit more nuanced. 

For example, [Pennsylvania's law](https://www.animallaw.info/statute/pa-cruelty-%C2%A7-5536-tethering-unattended-dog) is about a ""rebuttable presumption that a dog has not been the subject of neglect"" that doesn't apply if you tether a dog outside below freezing. And it says it doesn't prohibit ""Tethering a hunting, sporting or sledding dog breed where tethering is integral to the training, conditioning or purpose of the dog."" So you wouldn't be breaking the law if the animal wasn't being abused or neglected, and demonstrating that the animal is healthy and suited to that weather could qualify.

[In New Jersey](https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S2000/1640_R4.HTM), it's illegal to expose a dog to adverse environmental conditions (as defined), ""unless the animal has continuous access to proper shelter"" (again, as defined). So give the dogs access to shelter if they want it.

Other jurisdictions have laws that require the dog be brought inside in cold weather, except where an adult is visually watching the dog. So no legal problem there if you're watching your dog and paying attention to any signs of cold. 

The details would depend on the specific dogs-in-cold-temperatures law wherever you are, if there is one. Of course, there are always general animal cruelty laws, which would apply if the dog is being harmed.",1548979292

I have a small amount of crypto locked up on QCX also so I share your pain and frustration as to what is going on.  As far as I know no bank [so far] has allowed QCX to deposit and access the funds released from the court that were previously being illegally held by CIBC for a significant length of time.

QCX gave an update today about current proceedings:

‚ÄúDear Customers,

An application for creditor protection in accordance with the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) was filed today in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court to allow us the opportunity to address the significant financial issues that have affected our ability to serve our customers. The Court is being asked at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday February 5 to appoint a monitor, Ernst &amp; Young Inc., as an independent third party to oversee these proceedings.

For the past weeks, we have worked extensively to address our liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallets, and that are required to satisfy customer cryptocurrency balances on deposit, as well as sourcing a financial institution to accept the bank drafts that are to be transferred to us. Unfortunately, these efforts have not been successful. Further updates will be issued after the hearing.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","No. I don‚Äôt think it can be saved after TLJ. I thought the force awakens was great it felt like a new hope and got me excited to see the sequel trilogy characters and the original trilogy characters I wish they held off on killing Han a bit longer but whatever. 

I thought hux would be a strong leader like tarkin and that he‚Äôd be serious and not someone to mess with but within the first 10 minutes of TLJ he‚Äôs turned into a whining coward that prank call bit with Poe was just awful him in a tiny x wing just fucking up that big star destroyer with ease and the first order not doing anything that was really bad also his scene at the end when he copies kylos order they completely ruined his character in my opinion I could never see him as a leader after that. 

After TFA a lot of people thought snoke would be plageus because Disney claimed that this trilogy would be the bridge to all 3 and snoke being plageus would have been insane fans would have went nuts but instead he‚Äôs a nobody they give us no backstory and he‚Äôs left cut in half with his tongue out looking ridiculous what a waste of Andy serkis having him sit in a chair the entire time and what a fucking waste of going to get the guys from the raid to be the knights of ren and completely ignoring them in TLJ I was so hype to see the knights of ren and Kylo fighting a badass fully powered luke and luke holds all of them off but nope we don‚Äôt even see a lightsaber fight THE ENTIRE FUCKING MOVIE like is it not Star Wars wtf? we just see luke with a stick getting beat by Rey. They ruined the chance at force ghost in my opinion they could have aged ewan a bit and shown him in TLJ fans would have went bonkers Hayden ewan and yoda force ghosts would have been crazy and got everyone hype for his obi won solo movie if that‚Äôs even being made anymore. Kylo says ‚Äúshow me again‚Äù when he‚Äôs talking to the helmet I think jj definitely had Hayden‚Äôs force ghost in mind maybe we‚Äôll see in episode 9. And now onto episode 9. After TLJ Kylo can‚Äôt be redeemed or there will be no villains they killed snoke and hux isn‚Äôt a threat so it‚Äôs already ruined from the start for me because I have a feeling Kylo will be redeemed even after he killed Han which is dumb after he killed Han he should have been clearly full dark side give him yellow eyes and everything. But idk I could go on and on but really all I have to say is TLJ didn‚Äôt feel like Star Wars at all rian johnson ruined it they should have let him do the entire trilogy or something because TLJ seems like it just contradicts everything in TFA and I bet 9 will do the same to TLJ and ignore money lol Star Wars is going to make money no matter what so that argument is just silly but they‚Äôd make a hell of a lot more money if people were actually happy I don‚Äôt know anyone truly hype for 9 like people were for TFA or TLJ",1548979293

"geopolitics","t5_2qhnn","This thread is going to be a shitshow, but I'll give it a go. Bear in mind my bias, as I think Open Borders is a good idea and support it as a policy position.

I would argue Open Borders would be an enormous economic boon. You will likely see other commenters claim the influx of immigrants will strain the welfare system, but the fact is illegal immigrants cannot draw welfare. ([Source](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/)) It must be noted, however, they do not pay income taxes, only sales and property in many cases, but this is of limited effect due to 2 of the biggest destination states in the South for immigration, namely Texas and Florida, do not have State Income Taxes. I suspect any Open Border scenario would likely place a similar but harsher restriction on immigrant welfare benefits that currently exist for legal immigrants, at least for a while.

There would be an increased strain on local schools, as many of these children would likely be poorly educated, but education is largely funded through sales and property taxes, ([Source](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cma.asp)) so this extra cost would likely be enormously overshadowed by increased revenues, as what usually occurs with a population boom. I would argue the middle class would likely see less benefits than the upper class who would benefit more from cheaper labor, than the middle class benefits from cheaper food, textiles, infrastructure building costs as most immigrants choose these industries to work in. ([Source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/16/immigrants-dont-make-up-a-majority-of-workers-in-any-u-s-industry/))

Overall though, it would take time to adjust, and the economic prosperity that would come forth from a significant increase in productive, tax paying citizens would be long term. The only major concern would be the rate of incoming persons which could overwhelm communities, but given the sheer size of the United States, I also believe this could easily be mitigated.",1548979295

It would be cool too see if you played up the transition shade a bit more, but that could be a personal preference!

Re the inner corner, I have a thought that might not be useful- I notice this sort of thing happens to me when I use primer and don‚Äôt let it dry all the way or dust it with powder before applying shadow. Shadow tends to adhere oddly, particularly as my eye moves and I manipulate the skin around it. 

It also happens if my eye isn‚Äôt perfectly relaxed when I apply shadow to the inner corner - The way the eyeshadow looks ‚Äúpatchy‚Äù  was as though your inner eye was scrunched and you applied shadow on top of it, creating those little lines.

It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre planning a life together, but as a married dad, I agree with everyone else here. Do *not* co-sign on anything with him. Houses, cars, weddings, kids, anything until he proves he can get his ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù under control.

Sounds like he has a lot of growing-up left to do, and if you‚Äôre not careful, you will be getting some hard lessons too. 

Ok, I‚Äôve said my piece.  Now, how to fix it: it sounds like you‚Äôre good with money. Work together with him to develop a budget to pay it down/off. See if he agrees willingly or puts up roadblocks. If he agrees, check on the follow through. If so, great. If not, his priorities aren‚Äôt you and you should seriously rethink things before you even seriously consider marriage, kids, etc.

For what it‚Äôs worth, my wife is 35, I‚Äôm 45 and we just had a beautiful little child. Where a lot of other people in our prenatal class were young couples worried about money and such, we own 3 properties and each make 6 figure salaries so money is no concern for us, even living in BC, and there is little financial burden raising a child.

Hold on‚Äîis this document *only one page long??* This is his entire framework for immigration reform? It‚Äôs a little vague, isn‚Äôt it?
- - -

BORDER SECURITY: Securing the Southern and Northern border of the United States takes a
combination of physical infrastructure, technology, personnel, resources, authorities, and the ability
to close legal loopholes that are exploited by smugglers, traffickers, cartels, criminals and terrorists. *(So we‚Äôre securing the northern border of the US now, too? Are we building two walls? Which loopholes are exploited, and by how many ‚Äúsmugglers, traffickers, cartels, criminals and terrorists‚Äù? What kind of ‚Äúpersonnel, resources, and authorities‚Äù are necessary?)*

The Department of Homeland Security must have the tools to deter illegal immigration; the
ability to remove individuals who illegally enter the United States; and the vital authorities
necessary to protect national security. These measures below are the minimum tools necessary to mitigate the rapidly growing surge
of illegal immigration. *(This is fake news. Illegal immigration is trending down, not up.)*

‚Ä¢ $25 billion trust fund for the border wall system, ports of entry/exit, and northern border
improvements and enhancements. *(What happened to $5 billion? And what would this money specifically do?)*

‚Ä¢ Close crippling personnel deficiencies by appropriating additional funds to hire new DHS
personnel, ICE attorneys, immigration judges, prosecutors and other law enforcement
professionals. *(How many new personnel, attorneys, judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement professionals? How many are we deficient by?)*

‚Ä¢ Hiring and pay reforms to ensure the recruitment and retention of critically-needed
personnel. *(Reforms to what aspects of hiring and pay, and how did those aspects impede the recruitment and retention of personnel? Is this just a way of saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna pay border control officers more‚Äù?)*

‚Ä¢ Deter illegal entry by ending dangerous statutorily-imposed catch-and-release and by
closing legal loopholes that have eroded our ability to secure the immigration system and
protect public safety. *(Which legal loopholes? Does this mean ‚Äúcatch-and-release‚Äù is one of these dangerous legal loopholes? How does Trump plan to hold all of the immigrants we were releasing with court dates before?)*

‚Ä¢ Ensure the detention and removal of criminal aliens, gang members, violent offenders,
and aggravated felons. *(What about asylum seekers? Where are we detaining all of these people, and for how long? How are we detaining them?)*

‚Ä¢ Ensure the prompt removal of illegal border-crossers regardless of country of origin. *(What does ‚Äúremoval‚Äù mean? Deportation? Isn‚Äôt there a whole legal process for deportation? Especially if the border crossers invoke asylum?)*

‚Ä¢ Deter visa overstays with expedited removal. *(How are we going to find and remove these people, though? It‚Äôs nice to say ‚Äúwe gonna deal with visa overstays‚Äù but this isn‚Äôt a plan, it‚Äôs a list of things he‚Äôd like to happen.)*

‚Ä¢ Ensure synthetic drugs (fentanyl) are prevented from entering the country. *(How are we going to prevent this? It‚Äôs nice to say ‚Äúwe will prevent fentanyl from crossing‚Äù, but how?)*

‚Ä¢ Institute immigration court reforms to improve efficiency and prevent fraud and abuse. *(What reforms? What ‚Äúfraud and abuse‚Äù?)*

DACA LEGALIZATION: Provide legal status for DACA recipients and other DACA-eligible illegal
immigrants, adjusting the time-frame to encompass a total population of approximately 1.8 million
individuals. *(What happened to ‚Äúno amnesty ever‚Äù? I thought the most current plan did NOT include DACA.)*

‚Ä¢ 10-12 year path to citizenship, with requirements for work, education and good moral character. *(How does this compare to our current system?)*

‚Ä¢ Clear eligibility requirements to mitigate fraud. *(I just need more clarity on this point altogether. Does this mean it makes it more clear who is and isn‚Äôt eligible to immigrate here, to prevent people from committing fraud to come here? I have no context for what this problem is or what the solution is.)*

‚Ä¢ Status is subject to revocation for criminal conduct or public safety and national security
concerns, public charge, fraud, etc. *(Wait‚Äîis this before or after they‚Äôve come to the US?)*

PROTECT THE NUCLEAR FAMILY: Protect the nuclear family by emphasizing close familial
relationships. *(I really don‚Äôt see the point in legislating ‚Äúemphasizing close familial relationships‚Äù at all. By ‚Äúnuclear family‚Äù, do they mean two parents with kids, or do they mean a husband and wife with kids? Would two husbands with kids be considered a nuclear family? Would a single father be considered a nuclear family? Why is this immigration reform?)*

‚Ä¢ Promote nuclear family migration by limiting family sponsorships to spouses and minor children
only (for both Citizens and LPRs), ending extended-family chain migration. *(I disagree with the black-and-white language in this law regarding ‚Äúlimiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children only‚Äù, because black and white language with no nuance only results in strife down the line in my opinion, but I‚Äôm not necessarily opposed to developing out this reform in principle because I recognize the point.)*

‚Ä¢ Apply these changes prospectively, not retroactively, by processing the ‚Äúbacklog.‚Äù *(I was gonna say ‚Äògood‚Äô and just move on, but actually I‚Äôm unclear on what this means. What does ‚Äúprocessing the backlog‚Äù entail, if not applying the legislation retroactively?)*

ELIMINATE LOTTERY AND REPURPOSE VISAS: The Visa Lottery selects individuals at random
to come to the United States without consideration of skills, merit or public safety. *(On paper I agree with the idea of merit-based immigration but in practice I prefer the idea that anybody could go through a swift process to become an American‚Äînot that we have a swift process now.)*

‚Ä¢ This program is riddled with fraud and abuse and does not serve the national interest. *(I need more context about this than this.)*

‚Ä¢ Eliminate lottery and reallocate the visas to reduce the family-based ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù and high-skilled
employment ‚Äúbacklog.‚Äù *(So, it *is* retroactive, after all. People whose families qualify to come to America now shouldn‚Äôt lose that qualification if/when these new laws come into place. Just make it so after January 1 every new person applying has the new laws apply to them? This is Trump saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre taking away your family‚Äôs right to immigrate here because they don‚Äôt deserve it, these smarter people do‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt good policy imo.)*

I didn't get bored riding 'across the map from mission to mission' because that was the time I went on my own adventures, exploring and hunting, taking in one of the most beautiful game worlds I've played in. I never fast travelled once. In all honesty, it doesn't take that long to traverse anyway, and the journey has plenty of things to indulge in if you want to. I hear a lot of people wanting bigger open world games to play in, of course thats pointless if they are empty, so this is what we are gonna get as games get bigger, Rdr2 never felt empty to me, unless the landscape demanded it. A good example is Dying Light 2, the original was massive, and the new game will dwarf it, games are gonna get bigger, with a lot more traveling involved, can't have it both ways. 

I agree that the game isn't difficult, but neither was GTAV, the emphasis is more on fun, it doesn't sound like you're having much, but you can't like every game. There's plenty of games that can offer you more of a challenge if that's what you need, or you can try to implement some of your own ways to make it more difficult maybe.

The lightning represents nature taking the path of least resistance to occupy the lowest energy form. 

The spiral represents time, and the eye is the present and how it is observed from a single point.

The spiral leading up to the eye wasn‚Äôt intentional, but looks just like the eye of Horus or Ra from ancient Egypt. 

Looking backwards time is a single spiral moving inward, infinite yet confined. 

Looking forward the spiral continues, yet there are infinite paths, each new path formed as a result of free will.

I was really thinking about whether or not free will is an illusion, just because we feel like we could have made a different decision after the fact, even though only one path has ever been taken leading up to the present moment.

The Act does not state what a serious injury is. Having regard to the Article 8 right to a private life, and the requirement for any interference with that right to be proportionate and necessary, the threshold for prosecuting section 63(7)(b) cases should be a high one.

All our guidelines are based on both the best evidence and research we have from the suicide intervention field about what's helpful and harmful, and years worth of feedback from our community. 

What sometimes confuses and surprises people who make posts of this nature is that the feedback they get on their post is often quite different from the actual impact it has. The OP tends to hear disproportionately from people who either liked the post, or feel like they ought to have been helped by it even though they weren't or feel worse afterwards, and we as mods hear from the bravest of the people harmed by it. 

This can be particularly dangerous because frequently people will see well-intentioned but misguided help and feel like there's something wrong with themselves for not being helped by it - even though it's extremely common not to be helped by content of this nature and the problem is with the misguided strategy of the ""helper""! - and end up upvoting or praising the person for their good intentions while feeling even more alone on the inside.",1548979302

Piers Brosnan was the last good Bond, and even then Goldeneye was really the last good Bond movie, because the filmmakers were devoted to the source material. Instead of rejecting Bond's past and trying to move on with a whole new character, they centered the story around it. Bond was called ""a dinosaur"", a relic of the Cold War that didn't have a place in the information age, but Bond had one last battle with Soviet superscience and WW2 era grudges, done with a classic style and panache that modern moviemakers just can't embrace (because they're afraid of Austin Powers jokes).

Another time was when he was saying that he‚Äôd spoken to other inmates convicted of crimes he compared to his own and they all had in common an addiction to pornography.  So what?  They probably had all kinds of things in common. And many of those things they probably also had in common with people who don‚Äôt get off on hurting people, including porn addiction.

As for the Fuel Rod, eh yea I kinda get your point.

I‚Äôm sure they considered options for enemies other than Hunters carrying that or using the old style self destructing one.

I don‚Äôt know why the past is a useful guide for today without reconstructing the exigencies. Shit, look at the exemption rate doubling under Obama‚Äôs presidency, even with a super dem majority.  Hell, one year they repealed the estate tax, so the government got nothing from an estate.

Back to your point, ‚Äúwhy is this $3.5M ‚Äòtax free‚Äô‚Äù it‚Äôs not tax free. It‚Äôs been taxed at least once, probably many more times. This money didn‚Äôt suddenly appear without the government already taxing it. 

Moreover, the exemption doesn‚Äôt just cover a vault of money that Scrooge McDuck swims through. More often than not, this inheritance can come in the form of a business, and if you‚Äôre forced to liquidate a $2M business because there‚Äôs no cash or a life insurance can‚Äôt cover the cut the government wants, it is disconcerting and stressful for business employees, etc.

Also, as a guy who considers himself fun, I can turn a lot of interactions with women into ‚Äúa good time‚Äù by controlling the frame with my humor my point of view. 

It‚Äôs like a big game, and they LOVE it. 

I also tend get really bored hearing about some of the surface level shit girls talk about, so I stay away from it. Either I stay out of the conversation or I ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a random situation that is fun for me. 

When they open up really they can tell you all sorts of fun shit. That‚Äôs the key.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Customers,
&gt; 
&gt; An application for creditor protection in accordance with the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) was filed today in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court to allow us the opportunity to address the significant financial issues that have affected our ability to serve our customers. The Court is being asked at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday February 5 to appoint a monitor, Ernst &amp; Young Inc., as an independent third party to oversee these proceedings.
&gt; 
&gt; For the past weeks, we have worked extensively to address our liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallets, and that are required to satisfy customer cryptocurrency balances on deposit, as well as sourcing a financial institution to accept the bank drafts that are to be transferred to us.

I recommend that someone with skin in this game who also has the brains, time and money use a chain analysis tool like https://crystalblockchain.com/ to track down the cold wallets to ensure they have not or do not move. If the crypto cold wallet funds have moved after the date of death (December 9th) of Mr Cotten, then the crypto funds have either been hacked or been moved by the directors of QuadrigaCX (and is contrary to what they are claiming here), or another party. This could be a key piece to any lawsuit.

Also be sure to look for QuadrigaCX/Quadriga Fintech Solutions/0894750 B.C. Ltd   to be listed here in the coming week(s) to confirm that they have filed for creditor protection: https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/h_br02281.html

Good luck everyone. ",1548979309

Bro how can you say that when you're telling people that he can't leave the US without threat of assassination. This is not even true, he can't leave the US because he doesn't have a valid passport, since Turkey cancelled his. Even if he had a valid passport, he would have to stay away from middle eastern and european land, or places with muslim tension, not the whole world.  Of course he can leave the US without people trying to assassinate him; how do you think he plays against the Raptors in Canada? You can travel to other countries for work and he chooses to go to Canada despite it being international travel. If he had a valid passport, do you really think a Turkish spy is going to blend in when he's visiting Japan? You act like there are Turkish assassins planted in every country and are just waiting for him to land.

And you can't know how this alternate you would have been equipped to take advantage of opportunity when and if it presented itself. Because this wouldn't be you as you are now. This would be a different you. You'd have been shaped by a lifetime of experiences that you can't ever possible even imagine. Yeah, assuming your alternate self has the same parents as your actual self, you'd probably have a lot of the same personality traits that brought you some success in Indonesia. But those traits would have likely been expressed differently.

Maybe you'd have found success. Who knows? Maybe the American you is hittin the road in his  Alfa Romeo as we speak. Just him and a babe. You like babes, OP? Or maybe not. Maybe his parents died when he was a kid and he just aged out of the foster care system. Maybe he's a little more worried about where he's gonna sleep tonight than what tech nerds he should network to get his career off the ground. Maybe he's thinking that he'd have been luckier if he'd been born in Indonesia where the rent is cheap and the beer ain't awful.

Whatever he's doing, he certainly would have had a different life than yours. And maybe there are factors in your life right now that shaped you into the kind of person who, I assume, knows how to apply themselves and how to take advantage of an opportunity when you see one. Maybe there's some cultural factors. Maybe your education. Maybe it was just having the right people in your life who either taught or inspired you to drive to success.

Slap that on a DD or CL/CA and generally you'll have decently respectable AA without having to invest much else and the dispersion loss is mostly negligible for most of those ships aswell and its not like they need turret rotation or whatever else instead.  

BFT is a pretty safe pick up on a lot of ships.  SI or DE might give more value based on the ship but BFT can put in work.  

If you really want to go hard you can take Manual AA.  

Thats the ""7 points"" but really just one of those skills with the AA mod above and you'll be doing more than enough AA to matter for most ships.  When you consider a lot of mid tiered ships literally have 1-2 flak puffs for some auras literally doubling that or more with the AA mod is HUGE in terms of damage output/potential.  

You can still use manual AA to decent effect even without the skill, yes its better with the skill but it still functions without it.  BFT mostly counters a CV taking the amor skill and is less about actually getting more raw output its both the AA and CV throwing away 3 points to equalize.  

That said unless you are something completely absurd like a Minotaur (which has OP AA atm) you are still going to get some plane damage, but its about making the CV move their planes more (to reduce accuracy) and lose planes so that instead of 4 strikes from a squad it might only be 2-3 strikes from that squad.
Against less than good CV players your flak will just demolish squads like it was a Minotaur without having to be one.  

Real talk just the AA mod on its own is a huge AA increase.  Once things settle down and you get maybe one CV a game just the mod should be enough unless you have value from BFT naturally anyhow (secondary build, DD gunboat, etc) and only taking Manual AA if you are particularly dedicated to the role for whatever reason.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Oh hi guys.

Crossposting my thoughts on BNHA Season 3, since I just submitted it over on the other thread.

Finished [Boku no Hero Academia Season 3.](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36456/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season)

Most of what I said the other day still applies. I'd link that but Reddit doesn't like me right now and won't let me use my overview page.

[Edit thanks reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ajizp4/casual_discussion_fridays_week_of_january_25_2019/efbo4mc/)

Overall this season was just more of the same, in both a good and a bad way.

The show has a serious lack of interesting antagonists, which *really* hurts the villain focused arcs. They're all bland, and they hide their motivations behind so much smoke and mirrors that it's hard to even care about what they're plotting. 

We get occasional vague bits of their clandestine meetings but no real glimpse at what their endgame really is. Their one big plot this season was [Spoilers](/s ""kidnapping Bakugo and they saved him almost immediately. I guess the shit with getting some of Deku's blood is going to play into them trying to give everybody One For All or some bullshit, but they really should throw a bone to the audience and give them a sneak peek"")

The recap footage is a pain, and I'm gonna keep complaining about it because they keep doing it. 

The amount of reintroduction, reiteration, and repeat information is insane. It's bad enough we get splash text with character names 60 episodes into a (very simple to understand) series, but we also get them on every eye catch, and the first three minutes of every episode is wasted on showing us what happened last episode.

Those are my two biggest bones to pick with BNHA, and it constantly drags down the otherwise enjoyable character interactions and fun kinetic action sequences.

It ended in a weird spot, with 2 or so episodes left after they completed the license exam thingy.

As far as positives go, still easy fun popcorn entertainment. For me it's the junk food of anime, and of all the things that could fill that role, I'm glad it's this show. 

Straightforward earnest shounen is always going to be entertaining, I just wish this show could measure up to battle shounen's best. Right now it's not quite there.

6/10 (which is a good score)

Looking forward to watching the movie.",1548979314

City staff isn't making a recommendation as to whether they think it's a good idea. They're making a recommendation on whether it conforms with policy. 

Do I wish they made a different decision based on how I'd read provincial policy? Sure! But I don't think this is an indication that staff is deciding for anything other than reasoned decisions based on the direction they receive from elected officials (as they should).",1548979314
"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","Weird flex, but ok.

Robotech was 3 unrelated anime kluged together, and it was bad compared to the source material.

The Warhammer, Marauder, Stinger, Wasp, Crusader, Ostscout, Otsol, Archer, Rifleman, and Longbow (I think that‚Äôs all of them) originally came from the Super Dimension Fortress Macross, which was used to make the first arc (of 3) of Robotech.

Which would be fine, if harmony gold weren‚Äôt such a litigious wastebin of human filth.

I may have come into battletech at the tail end in the early-mid 90‚Äôs, but I still remember, fondly, some of those Unseen designs. Forgive me for only having 2-3 years of knowledge, considering I was all of 9 years old in 1995, when MechWarrior 2 dropped (which marked my entry to Battletech). I‚Äôm so sorry that I couldn‚Äôt have firsthand knowledge of the before time of a franchise which is, literally, only as old as I am, but I have been a lifelong fan.

I‚Äôve done my research. Don‚Äôt pull that AlphaNerd bullshit on me. Especially over a comment which was obviously supposed to be (sort of, I do think that Robotech is trash, when compared with SDF Macross and Genesis Climber Mospeada, on their own) tongue in cheek.

Also, I don‚Äôt forgive your spelling errors, drunk or not, spellcheck and autocorrect exist. Those are tools you can use to not look like a moron, you should use them.",1548979314

L tyrosine- Precursor to dopamine and noradrenaline. Can maybe help with energy if you're chronically stressed (which leads to depletion of l tyrosine) but l tyrosine supplementation is a very ineffective way of increasing dopamine.

"vim","t5_2qhqx","&gt; So `cd fli&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;CR&gt;` might do what you want, but it can also get you nowhere. You can never be sure unless you know exactly what is in your current folder.

How so? Do you press `&lt;CR&gt;` without reviewing the completion suggestions?

&gt; If you put that in your bashrc or profile then you will also have the same choice of project folders from every single folder, so when your in your travel folder and want flight folder you will also get the choice of going to flink.

Yes, the whole point of `$CDPATH` is that it completely flattens the path to each and every often-visited directory. Every interesting directory on your system is effectively a subdirectory of the current directory. Just like symbol-based navigation in text editors and IDEs, `$CDPATH` allows users to only ever think about the target itself, not the path to the target. This is *incredibly* liberating and empowering.

&gt; This isn't that bad, but also if your not careful and remember all the folders in your project folder you might suddenly end up in your project folder flight or similar ( use `cd -` to get back).

No, because a) there's bash completion so I usually get a chance to evaluate my choices before pressing `&lt;CR&gt;`, b) I'm relatively careful, and c) the distance to the target directory is always the same, which happens to be the shortest possible.

&gt; So if your in a folder that might have a folder that is named the same as a project folder you won't end up back in the project that you want to.

Hypothetically? Yes. Actually? It never happens.

&gt; I guess maybe if it is just for your programming folder it is fine. But imagine going exploring in the system with this. You don't know what is actually in this folder vs if your going back to your project folder. Or in your case your parent folder as well.

&gt; If your only in your project folder it is probably fine, but any other time I wouldn't use it.

Here is my actual value:

    CDPATH=./:~/:~/Sync/:~/Documents/:~/Documents/EMPLOYER/:~/.vim/:../:../../

where `~/Documents/EMPLOYER/` is the equivalent of your `~/projects`.

I've used that feature for years, all the time, everywhere. And it has been an absolute dream from day one. Watching the few of my coworkers who haven't introduced it in their workflow already, move around in their shell is a deeply frustrating experience.

&gt; I would consider using `project=/home/plitter86/projects`, then you can just do `$pro&lt;Tab&gt;f&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;CR&gt;`, it is reliable and your only getting the completions that you want.

I only get the completions I want with `$CDPATH`, and I never have to tell my computer more than the absolute minimum, or deal with superfluous abstractions.",1548979317

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","I agree that astrophysics is a very tricky science, but highly debatable quotes like the one below are strewn throughout your comment:

&gt; Every test we've tried at LHC and everywhere else for that matter has fully and completely supported the standard model of particle physics.

That's just wrong. There are almost 10 standing particle physics anomalies that are unexplained within the Standard Model, such as B and D meson decays, muon g-2, the upward decays seen by ANITA, the absence of a neutron EDM, the recent results by MiniBooNE, and several reactor neutrino experiments.

&gt; For instance, Just this month we learned that ""dark energy"" models have failed a key predictive test of the concept that photon redshift is actually related to expansion:

Having just looked at that paper, it appears that some very noisy data (it literally is a cloud of points) suggests that the amount of acceleration might change over time. Attempts to measure cosmic acceleration precisely are generally unreliable, and I'm not sure how long this result will stick around. Even if it does, it does not overturn dark energy as much as ask for a slight refinement of the model. I think you're exaggerating how earth-shattering this is supposed to be.

I don't have time to look at the rest of the gish gallop, but I don't like the ""astronomers discovered &lt;blah&gt; was wrong"" wording. This really means ""one guy published a paper that disagrees with others"". It says nothing about whether the result actually holds up. There are crazy wrong things that ""physicists have discovered"" being promoted here every day.

&gt; Dark matter ""tests"" of every kind have failed to detect any stable form of exotic matter, not just at LHC, but everywhere else as well.

Sure, but that might be just because all of those tests only looked at the simplest possible kind of dark matter, a single WIMP. There are lots of possibilities. Is it not worth even considering a second one?

&gt; As it stands however, it could easily be that the standard model of particle physics, the most extensively tested model in the history of physics is in fact correct, and the LCDM cosmology model is simply incorrect.

No, quantum electrodynamics is the best tested model in history. Notwithstanding all the anomalies hanging around, the error bars on a lot of SM predictions, especially ones involving the Higgs, are on the order of 10% or worse. It ain't exactly precision science yet. We would need more energy to actually check.

&gt; We could easily spend tens of billions of dollars on a new accelerator and find nothing new at all.

Nobody knows. All I know is, if we don't ever look, we are _guaranteed_ to find nothing new at all.",1548979318

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I personally dislike the idea of having voicechat in League unless you're in a premade group. Especially in ranked as you'd be somewhat forced into it if you want to have the ""highest chance at victory"". A organized team that communicates will always win compared to the one that just decides to opt out, if they both have equal skill. Introducing it, would force competitive players like myself into it and it would just create an unenjoyable experience for me.



If I'm a jungle main, I don't want to hear the 13 reasons why I should gank for the CC'less toplaner who is pushing the wave and who's opponent has all sums. I also don't want to hear about the 50 shades of ""how I could've played that game better by playing around x lane or just smited the 50/50 baron better"". I'd rather just get spampinged once and that's it. If it bothers me, I mute whoever is typing without putting myself and my team at a disadvantage. Because voice chat is so much more impactful, that won't be possible. 



Furthermore, while this might work fine and dandy in NA, in EUW I better brush up on my French, German, Polish etc. etc. etc. I'm already happy enough when my laners understand the simple ""please ward here"" followed by a ping. Language barriers are too great and not having someone on your team that participates again puts your team at a overall disadvantage. 



Overall, I agree that games with voice are more fun, however, they can also be more negative if you aren't somehow connected to the people beforehand and the fact that it would become a requirement in ranked, makes it something I would dread to be introduced to league in the future.

&gt; The Alan Parsons Project was a British rock group active from 1975 until 1990, founded by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson both from London, England. The group is based on a number of regular group members such as Stuart Elliot and Ian Bairnson, complemented with varying lead vocals such as Colin Blunstone (the Zombies), Chris Rainbow and Gary Brooker (Procol Harum).  The group is well known for its concept albums, which cover themes such as Edgar Allan Poe, Gaudi, and Freud. 

&gt; Eric Woolfson wrote most of the music and lyrics while Alan Parsons overviewed the production process. Prior to starting his Project, Parsons worked as an engineer with names such as the Beatles(Abbey Road, the Get Back roofttop concert) and Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother).

&gt; Since the 1990s Alan Parsons has been performing live shows, touring all over the world, but without Eric Woolfson. Read more on Last.fm.

"slayone","t5_3exas","**On chests:** I really like the idea of chests and not knowing what you're going to get. However, they're rewarded so frequently I have 600 bronze and 500 silver chests I will never open because they got too backed up and I'm lazy. The allure of what prizes could be inside them also isn't very much, because I could just buy/level the skin with gold instead of opening them. Others have mentioned before having a **chest conversion system** (X bronze for 1 silver chest, Y silver for one gold, etc). I think this is a great way to reduce the chest bloat I have, but the rates would have to be high enough that I wouldn't end up with an unreasonable amount of high level chests.

&amp;#x200B;

I think chests would benefit from having more in them- like **alternate color versions** of skins (green or purple Mohawk instead of red, shibu inu Doggo instead of white, etc). The user could then choose which variation they want to use when they select that skin in the menu. I think this would give people more of a customization option when choosing a skin. I would be happy to make some alternative looks for the skins I've made.

&amp;#x200B;

Say instead of the current 4, there were 2 different kinds of chests- ones that awarded skins, ones that rewarded alternate color skins. Instead of getting a chest each time you end 5+ min a game, you could have a slight chance of getting one, to avoid bloat. They could also be awarded for leveling up (but unless awarded retroactively on release like gems, that would be more unfair to people who are a high level and wouldn't gain them as fast as someone who isn't).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**On buying skins:** I think it would be a cool idea to have a rotating ""limited edition"" skin that would cost more than others to buy, but also otherwise not be available until it rotates back in. It gives more incentive to buy it, and people would like collecting them more. With the increase in user-submitted skins lately, the new submissions could be what are included there, so they're new to everyone. Alternative colors of skins could also be something to put up for limited purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

**Random but related:** Quests. I think introducing long-term quests with higher reward would be neat. These would be always available, not rotating daily like the smaller quests. Going off of the above, say a quest that's more complicated, requires a higher number of kills, etc, could reward a certain exclusive skin or alternate. *Get a multikill and unlock the 'xyz skin'.* This would give players a more long-term goal to work towards with a cool guaranteed reward.

&amp;#x200B;

\-

I'm mostly just brainstorming ideas here, nothing I've thought about too seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I think finding something, like alternative colors, that was less easily obtainable (for example, only in specific chests or LE sale) would put the collectability back in skins.

3 fans can help but are not necessarily better.

Basicly you have for normal gpu's 2 most important parts. The fans and the heatsink. (Additional thermal paste, thermal pads,...)

The heat sink consists of heat pipes and fins. Heat pipes should be build the way that they spread the heat balanced to the fins. The fins should have a big surface area to deliver the best cooling.

The fans push air through the heatsink, which cools it down. It's possible that a 2 fan design pushes the same amount of air like a 3 fan design. It depends how big they are and how fast they are spinning. In general 3 fans tend to be more  quite, but that doesn't have to be the case.

If the heatsink is bad the fans have to compensate it, which leads to a higher fan speed and more noise. Doesn't matter how many fans.

I have a msi rtx 2070 amor (overclocked it). It has a 2 fan design and runs mostly at 61-65 degrees while gaming and never saw a higher temp than 71 degrees. (Non oc the max temp is 64-65 degrees while gaming in different reviews) I have the fan speed at auto, since I just can't hear the fans I see no point to customize it. The 2 fans are 100mm wide. The card is pretty big itself and offers a big heatsink.

The point is 2070's with 3 fans don't run cooler or quiter than my card with a 2 fan design.",1548979321

Your own thoughts are your worst enemy. You constantly feel worthless and alone. He needs you to show him what he means to you, that he‚Äôs not worthless, and that you‚Äôll stick with him through it. It sounds like your demeanor, rather than lifting him up, is dragging him deeper into a pit. 

I don‚Äôt expect you to know what depression is like as someone that has clearly never experienced it, but if you love him and value your marriage, you need to do better. Do some research, be kind. Don‚Äôt give him shitty financial ultimatums that he clearly can‚Äôt fulfill. And don‚Äôt expect him to get better in leaps and bounds.

(2) Suggest that you know someone who is genuinely interested, but do NOT volunteer your friend‚Äôs contact details without his/her permission. That‚Äôs just plain unethical. Take down the salesperson‚Äôs contacts instead. Refrain from volunteering your own. *(A mistake I made trying to get them off my back)* **‚ÄúIf I come across anyone who is interested, I‚Äôll know who to send him/her to. Thanks for letting me know.‚Äù**

(3) You might be fearful of losing a friend for refusing their sales pitch or saying no too often, but it was impolite of your friend to exploit your friendship for their profit in the first place. If the sales pressure continues, I don‚Äôt see why you don‚Äôt have any less right to be just as aggressive in your response. **Repeated firm no‚Äôs and** **‚ÄúLook, I love you mate, but I‚Äôm uncomfortable with this topic. Can we talk about something else now, please? That would be fantastic, thanks.‚Äù**

(4) Make it about YOUR stand on this, not theirs. **‚ÄúI‚Äôm not accusing this of being a scam, or a cult, I‚Äôm just genuinely not interested.‚Äù**

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","I didn't mean to imply that I disagreed with the economic theory regarding rents - I don't doubt that it is correct (at least for the idealized systems we're discussing).

Rather, I'm addressing the perceived morality of extracting rents.  Let's say all land was leased from a king, who implemented a perfect Georgist tax.  I offer to pay a large amount of money (which I earned) for a unique, permanent and tax-free grant of land.  The king, being benevolent, determines that the amount I am offering is high enough that the country is better off accepting my offer.  Then I sit back as the rent pours in.

It's true that the scenario above is less than fully efficient: I no longer do productive work, and the king doesn't collect taxes from my land which could have been used for the good of the realm.  But I don't think my income would be ""unearned"", ""unfair"", ""parasitic"", etc.  I earned my monopoly of my land by paying more for it than what its efficient Georgist taxation in perpetuity was worth.",1548979330

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Sometimes when I am really struggling with my identity in Christ I just have to watch one of his videos again for that little reboot.  :)  He really is an amazing example of how knowing who we really are in Jesus changes everything!  I will step in and out of that place though.  I allow men around me to influence me too much, trusting in what man says more than what God says.  Generally I can let things slide, but when it is a leader or person I love speaking negative things then I take those things to heart and it can become my identity if I allow it.  So we must battle words spoken over us, and line them up with what Jesus says and reject them if they don't line up.

But walking by faith is an adventure!  As someone who has had the Holy Spirit ask some crazy things of my husband and me (just felt like Jesus told us to pay a single mom's rent for a few months yesterday) it can be really incredible when we see the fruit of obedience, but kind of crazy too when we are asked to do something that is risky.  I was laughing yesterday because we have barely any money in our main bank account at all when this young single mom called me out of the blue crying out for some help.  My husband did have a job interview later that day which I was super excited about because he has been volunteering for a non-profit for 8 months now without any pay. We have an investment we can sell, but the price is low.  But then what was Jesus telling us to do?  If we are really walking by faith we just give if Jesus says to give.  My husband and I prayed and then felt led to give her even more than she was specifically asking for.  The word we gave to her yesterday when we met with her was that Jesus wanted  her to take a deep breath with this gift and realize that He is for her and increase her faith in just trusting in Him as He is providing, but she was going to be tested to see if she would use it for her needs and not her wants.  She seemed to accept that and was just thankful for this.  I knew this young mom was struggling already but hadn't felt like I should intervene, but when she called to see if she knew any organizations who offered assistance to women in her situation I felt like God was nudging me to just ""do unto others as we would have them do unto you"" and it also says to ""give to anyone who asks.""  But this was another little stretch of our faith.  But the good news is my husband was offered the job.  Not sure when he will start it, as they haven't given the formal offer yet and they need to background checks and so on.  But God is faithful.

"dot","t5_2rkcn","Cool. Glad I understand your vision, and yes that would be amazing. Is it on the dev roadmap for the Substrate/Polkadot/Web3 team to create the Imaginarium?

- and speaking of the Substrate/Polkadot/Web3 roadmap, what's the difference between things that are funded/developed by the web3 foundation and things funded/developed by Polkadot/Parity?

Short of new names, I think the first step to make the distinction clearer would be to talk about Substrate Parachains and Polkadot Relaychains. 

- A Substrate blockchain != Substrate Parachain, but where it's being discussed in that context it would be helpful to make that distinction. 
- When talking about the relaychain it would be make it more clear to say the Polkadot Relaychain (because atm there's no ""other"" relaychain out there other than Polkadot). 

Having browsed through most of the documentation and blog posts this week, that distinction is not made clearly. There's a lot of new terminology for someone coming from the Ethereum ecosystem, and as is they kind of blend together. Often there's references to relaychains and parachains, but without the additional context provided by saying ""Polkadot Relaychain"" and ""Substrate Parachain"". This would help to distinguish between the high level Polkadot protocol that connects things and the more individual Substrate chains that are things. ",1548979336

No se si ""alienta"", pero se puede ver que la justicia (y el publico en general) cae mas duro sobre la mujer que mata a un tipo que sobre el tipo que mata a una mujer. El ejemplo mas claro que te puedo dar sin googlear es con la pibita esta que mato el portero. Del portero solamente se que era portero y se llamaba mangieri o algo asi, y de la pibita se sabia casi toda la historia de la vida.  
Lo mismo con la reversa de ese caso, no tengo ni idea de como se llamaba el flaco asesinado por Nahir Galarza, pero de la hija de puta esa se sigue hablando hasta hoy. La condenaron en 2 o 3 meses, salieron fotos y videos de ella culeando, hasta creo que alguien escribio un libro de ella.  
A lo que voy es, no se si el sistema heteropatriarcal fomenta el femicidio, pero seguro seguro que lo muestra como moneda corriente con intenciones de des-sensibilizar o normalizarlo, mientras que la otra cara de la misma moneda la trata como supernoticion megamagico.  

&gt;Los consideran una problem√°tica digna de tratamiento especial?   

yyy masomenos, la unica cagada es que esta lleno de imbeciles que usan mal el termino. Mataron a una piba en un robo? **AAHHH FEMICIDIO**. No hermano, la mataron sin importar si era mina, tipo o helicoptero de ataque. Ahora, matan a una minita al grito de **PUTA DE MIERDA ANDA A LAVAR LOS PLATOS FEMINAZI ABORTERA** yyyyyyy que te parece cornudo? la mataron por ser mujer.

While yes there was a time and sadly still to this day to some degree, the notion that having black features is bad. Im not disputing that at all. 

But at the same time, at the end of the day, what is the difference between one group saying you cant do this because the color of your skin? In present time or 50 years ago? Obviously very different situations but at the end of the day, if that statement is being made....

I think one part of the problem with people having an actual conversation about this, is that people who do not give a fuck about what color of skin someone is, and those we shall call slightly racist, have kinda the same stance but for different reasons. 

You have the, let's call them rednecks, who believe they should because they are white and believe they can do whatever they want because it's their country. Then you have the other side who believe race is literally nothing more than your skin adapting to the sun intake of your ancestors, and that through out history the world has been build on the borrowing/adapting/stealing/trading of ideas.

I think its obviously a complex issue, and intent can easily get muddy.",1548979340

A new HC might be willing to take that ""risk"" because perhaps he has seen what the rest of us has seen?  That this guy wasn't good enough to keep the other guy from losing his job.  

There is a possibility that people outside of this organization don't see Dalton the way we do.  And if he is going to build his own team with his own identity, he might want to start at the most important position on the team, knowing he isn't going to be expected to win the SB in his first year as coach or probably even his second or third.

This isn't Lewis trying to save his job, drafting that ""one"" guy that is going to help this team make a deep playoff run. This franchise went out of their way to hire a young guy with no ties to this franchise.  Perhaps that means they are open to not doing business as usual?

How many more years are we going to draft around Dalton thinking that is all we need to do?  

I could be dead wrong, but I wouldn't consider myself stunned if the new coach isn't as in to Dalton as we are.

I also wouldn't be stunned to see them try to get draft compensation from someone who might be.

So drinking socially and smoking socially are already not equivalent.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","You've summoned the [advice page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/advice) for `!Sidebar`. In short, **beauty is in the eye of the beholder**. What's beautiful for one person may not necessarily be pleasing to another. To quote the sidebar:

&gt; DataIsBeautiful is for visualizations that effectively convey information. Aesthetics are an important part of information visualization, but pretty pictures are not the aim of this subreddit.

The mods' jobs is to enforce basic standards and transparent data. In the case one visual is ""ugly"", we encourage [remixing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_remixing) to your liking.

**Is there something you can do to influence quality content?** Yes! There is!  
In increasing orders of complexity:

 * Vote on content. Seriously.
 * Go to /r/dataisbeautiful/new and vote on content. Seriously. [The first 10 votes on a reddit thread count equally as much as the following 100](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f), so your vote counts more if you vote early.
 * Start posting good content that you would like to see. There is an endless supply of good visuals, and they don't have to be your OC as long as you're [linking to the original source](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources). ([This site comes to mind](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?action=index&amp;award=2017&amp;controller=showcase&amp;page=1&amp;pcategory=long-list&amp;type=awards) if you want to dig in and start a daily morning post.)
 * [Remix this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_remixing). We mandate `[OC]` authors to list the source of the data they used for a reason: so **you can make it better if you want.**
 * Start working on your own `[OC]` content that you would like to showcase. A starting point, [We have a monthly battle](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/825mg6/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_march_2018/) that we give gold for. Alternatively, you can grab data from /r/DataVizRequests and /r/DataSets and get your hands dirty.
 * Provide to the mod team an objective, specific, measurable, and realistic metric with which to better modify our content standards. I have to warn you that some of our team is **very** stubborn.
 
 We hope this summon helped in determining what /r/dataisbeautiful all about.

And I would argue that teaching students WHY things work instead of a simple process (which is how math has been taught for a LONG time by a LOT of people in the U.S) will, in fact, produce better results.

We have recently added the useful feature of Title Flair! You can set this manually by clicking Flair under your post once you have submitted your post, but if you missed it in the rules there is a much better way that will automatically flair your post!   

To do this simply add what your post is about in brackets before your title. For example for a Build Log you can type [Build Log] before your post so that it looks like this; [Build Log]My new awesome build!, and the bot will automatically set your flair to Build Log! This works for Build Log, Build Showcase, News, Hardware News, Hardware Release, Discussion, and Miscellaneous!

Also remember that this is a place for discussing and sharing our love of Gaming Computers! This is NOT the place for help building or determining what parts you should buy, that is better suited for /r/buildapc or /r/techsupport respectivly. Thank you again!

How would that be better? In the latter alternative you have a choice whether you want to give them any money or not. Which you don't have in the first?? Not to talk about the fact that you don't give the whales the ability to fund the games future development either.

&gt;Ultimately, I‚Äôd like all content, cosmetics included, past the $60 entry fee, to be free, but I know I won‚Äôt get that.

The thing about free cosmetics is that they are shit and that they don't frequently get updated. I have yet to see a game with entirely free cosmetics that comes close to the quality of customization of some of the bigger games with MTX have. If companies are incentivized by money to produce cosmetics the results will be much higher than if they were just trying to fill a cosmetic quota in their game.

Well sure. But thats only one facet. 

Allowing anyone to vote also seems like a good way for specific interests to manipulate a large and poorly educated segment of the population to vote against rheir interests. I mean isnt that the typical mode of thought for Republican voters? That they're all manipulated by big oil and fear mongering?

May has her redlines and is always trying to appease hardliners in her party, while Corbyn never commits to any defined position and is an eurosceptic ‚Äì Labour as opposition has been lacking, to say the least.

For myself, the app is only for ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù adding a transaction as I complete it, such as the grocery store. Second, there is definitely a learning curve to it. The site will learn your habits as you use it, for example when you enter a regularly-used Payee, it will automatically assign it to the category for which you use that payee most. I.E: Kroger will be automatically imported to the grocery category after a couple of transactions. I will admit that the auto import feature is somewhat buggy for me as well, so as a result I only use it to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù things I might miss. I try to enter all transactions myself in real time so I always know what I have.

"chile","t5_2rer8","I'm sick of the ""Chilean Spanish is so difficult"". If you barely speak Spanish it makes no difference because you'll learn it here and also Chileans have a serious ""cultural cringe"" so they like to talk shit about themselves. 

Now here's the thing: If you come just for tourism it doesn't matter if you don't speak the language. If you are staying for work, even if only for a short period you have two options: You learn the language and live like a normal person or you try to stay in an English speaking bubble where you limit your life to work and the ""expat community"". 

Spanish is a language that doesn't vary that much as other languages from country to country in terms of grammar and stuff like that. The only differences you'll come across will be words (slang but also some normal words i.e. a fruit is called X in Mexico and Y in Chile) and pronunciation but keep in mind that people (if minimally educated) will tell that you are not a local and speak more slowly so you can understand. Things like voseo chileno are relevant but you need to know that when you already speak Spanish and it looks like you're not there yet (so it's not gonna be a problem when you learn it here). 

I can't speak much about culture because I never lived in the US and I might make wrong assumptions. 

EDIT: The ""Chilean Spanish is so difficult"" argument can be used as an excuse to be afraid of learning Spanish and it's really bad for foreigners (Chileans won't care but you won't have a normal life in the country). That's why I think it's a bad idea to keep on spreading that myth.  ",1548979362

Next round Ruby and Maria will be close but I think Ruby finally gaining momentum this volume will give her the win, Yang and Blake will be a hilarious thing to happen and I don't know who would win but the coin says Yang, Weiss will put Pyrrha's winning streak to a stop, and the drunk bird better beat the ice cream.

Ruby versus Yang hmm... I think the bees will bring half of their ship to victory, and for the fun of it Qrow's development this volume beats Weiss's.

For music I'd pick the Beyerdynamic, but the AKG is possibly the better choice for gaming. While both have a nice and wide soundstage, the DT 770 is more bassy which could cause explosions to drown out details such as footsteps. The vibes are good for immersion though ;-)

Comfort is good for both, but the DT 770 is 10% lighter and more sturdily built. 

Apparently the 250 ohm version of the DT 770 is more neutral than the 80 ohm, but both are known for their v-shaped sound (i.e. boosted bass and treble). And just to keep things interesting, you get the DT 770 250 ohm in two flavours:

* ""Pro"" with a coiled cable and 3.5N clamping force
* ""Edition"" with a straight cable and 2.8N clamp

The ""Edition"" feels like it may fall off my head if I lean back, while I can head-bang a bit with the ""Pro"" on.

the size of the device, hose, and finally the way the centrifugal fan that generates the airstream works, are all limiting factors that make for rapidly deminishing returns when putting stronger motors in.

If you look for example workshop vacuum cleaners or industrial appliances, they all have larger or much larger sizes of hoses/airducts, larger fan assemblies, etc., so these can actually make use of more power.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Knowing how to use and manipulate units mathematically is different than having a real world sense of them.  I can do the math to convert miles to km and km to cm, but it's difficult for me to conceive of how far 200 km is since I've never used it to measure distance in every day life.  I've always used miles for long distance, so 200 miles gives me an immediate sense of distance, say for a driving trip.

It's hard for me to picture someone 210 cm tall and 81 kg, but I get an immediate sense of the size of the person when described as 6'1"" and 180 lbs.",1548979366

"Undertale","t5_2xdht","I'd be delighted to discuss further! I have studied this game with a fervour that would terrify the sane, and sometimes all that means is that I overlook the obvious. 

Killing Asriel is the *culmination* of the Genocide route, I'd say. The monumental conclusion it's all been building to. LOVE is fundamentally a measure of one's ability to distance themselves, according to Sans, which in turn can become a source of power, for one willing to use it that way. The *instant* you kill Asriel, Chara is done. They appear, and say directly ""There is nothing left for us here."" I don't think they could have killed him if they weren't LV 20, and I think there's a reason as soon as he's gone they can destroy the *entire world* in one blow. Because they *still* cared about him, and once he's gone they don't care about anything, anymore. He was their last link, and that means afterwards their LV's practically infinite. Some people point to how gruesome his death was as proof they hated him. I say, if they hated him, he'd have died in one hit, like so many other bosses. 

The human+monster versus monster+human thing is possible, we don't know. Nothing says one way or the other, really. I'll try to give it more thought.

But Narra-Chara! That I can talk about. Obvious point first: in Genocide, white text at a certain mirror says ""It's me, Chara."" In Pacifist, white text at the *same* mirror says ""It's you!"" and later ""Still just you, Frisk."" Why think it's a different person talking? I'm not talking about some obscure chain of reasoning, I'm just saying to me it's the straightforward *default* assumption, before looking at any particular narration, that the narrator is always the same person. 

Especially if you accept, as I feel you have to, that Frisk and Chara share *some* sort of connection on Pacifist, enough for you to hear their dying moments on your game overs, to hear Asgore pushing them forward if you try to stay with Toriel, and to hear Asriel's first meeting with them when you're momentarily unconscious after a fall. Enough for it to be their name on the save file and for Flowey to say explicitly say *they* helped fight against him, even after he knows the difference between them and Frisk. 

Does that at least start to make it seem a little plausible, on the big picture scale? I've intentionally avoided going into the thousand specific ""loose bits of narration"" that point that direction if you add them all up, since you objected to those, but I've got them if you want them.

...On the ""influenced"" subject, I'll be actually brief, for once. I'm not suggesting mind control, just being a regular ol' good/bad influence, kid-to-kid. On Genocide, they explicitly say they woke up confused until your guidance helped them. I figure the same thing happened on every route. They're confused and probably angry and the last thing they remember is pain and dying (twice!) and everything going wrong, and then you show them, without even meaning to, how either *they* were wrong to have tried to force Asriel to kill, or *Asriel* was weak for not sticking to the plan, because in this world it's kill or be killed.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","2 Rabbis don‚Äôt make a consensus particularly in the modern era when even the Israeli Rabbinate can‚Äôt agree on things like which Orthodox Rabbis outside of Israel are doing conversions properly.  Yes, Maimonides said some harsh things about Christianity while being more conciliatory about Islam. Yes, Graetz does criticize the Rabbis in some areas of Eastern Europe for being too harsh in their VERBAL ( all you said was attacks which is dangerously vague in this medium) attacks on Eastern European Christians but also goes out of his way to point out that it was defensive in nature since, during those periods of time. Jews were being stripped of their property rights, herded into specific areas of settlement, and killed, tortured, and raped in systematic pogroms. The hatred wasn‚Äôt cultivated by the theology it was cultivated by atmosphere of death and violence that the Cossacks imposed on the Jews. The theology was simply a very poor coping mechanism. 
My own beliefs about the Amalekites and whether or not the story is allegorical or not are irrelevant. First, nowhere in the quite extensive historical record is there any mention of a people called the Amalekites. Would I condone the outright massacre of an entire people today? Absolutely not! As far as my own education; 12 years of Orthodox study, a BA in Jewish History and a PhD in Medieval Jewish Studies should be sufficient for your purposes.

"beer","t5_2qhg1","Let‚Äôs compare him to Rodgers. In what aspect of the position is Brady definitively better than Rodgers? The two are roughly equivalent when it comes to accuracy, mental aspects (reading coverages, processing the field, manipulating defenses, etc.), pocket presence, and clutch performance. Rodgers is a lot more mobile and has the stronger arm. The only arguments for Brady over Rodgers are that Brady has done it for a longer time and has had more Super Bowls. That he‚Äôs done it longer remains to be seen as Rodgers could perform at a high level for just as long. With regards to having more playoff success, that‚Äôs in large part due to situation. He has a coach who is the GOAT, has played in a better system, and he gets what are practically automatic playoff berths every year because their divisional opponents are the Bills, Jets, and Miami, all of which have been garbage for almost the entirety of Brady‚Äôs career. You can‚Äôt tell me that if you put Rodgers in NE, that they wouldn‚Äôt be a better team. Rodgers has carried GB. The Packers went 3-7 without Rodgers, whereas, the Patriots are 13-6 without Brady. Most of those games came in 2008 where the Patriots went 11-5 under Cassel who went on to prove that he‚Äôs a garbage QB when not on the Pats. New England does just fine without Brady while Green Bay falls apart without Rodgers. 

That‚Äôs the rationale for Brady not being the GOAT. Not only is he not the GOAT, he isn‚Äôt even the best contemporary QB.",1548979367

"RoastMe","t5_37xo2","I‚Äôve given this advice to some of my students, friends and family who have struggled with depression and I‚Äôm hoping it will help you my friend. 

To conquer depression one technique is to attain the realization that depression and anxiety are essentially deeply rooted in negative thoughts. This type of self inflicted suffering can be avoided if we simply become more aware of exactly where our mind is in the here and now. 

It‚Äôs good to recognize that If we are suffering something from our past we are only suffering our memory of the past. If we are suffering something that may come in the future we are only suffering our assumptions about the future. 

If we instead try to be intensely present and aware of the here and now- just this moment we can experience freedom from many of the thoughts that cause suffering. When we become truly present to simply what is around us now (the tree, the rock, a bird, a flower) thoughts and assumptions will begin to naturally subside because we move out of the mind and into just being present in the moment. 

Our lives are happening only the here and now- just one moment into the next. The essence of who we really are is in the moment. When we delve into the past or future we lose touch with this essence and ultimately lose touch with our life.  

Negative thoughts and assumptions are serving and feeding what we call the False Sense of Self. This False Self doesn‚Äôt want us to be present in the moment it wants us continually thinking about the self and it‚Äôs past and future so that we miss out on the here and now- this moment. 

Remember all we really are is the moment but it gets taken away from us by the False Self. This False Self is who we believe we are and that this is how others perceive us. But the truth is we do not truly know how others perceive us it‚Äôs just that we believe we know. Even if someone tells us what they think of us we still do not know if this is the truth or if this will change tomorrow, next week or next year. 

When negative thoughts and assumptions arise use them as a signal to try becoming more present of the moment by taking a deep breath inward and experiencing the vast inner space within. Then exhale and let these thoughts and emotions flow away from this inner space like water flowing down a  fast moving river. Thoughts and emotions should naturally flow freely- it‚Äôs when they bottle up that they can become a problem. 
Hope this helps.

Definitely don't make flash cards for every verb in multiple tenses. That way lies madness. There are so many possible combinations of conjugations, you'd end up with hundreds of cards for each verb. It might well be a good idea to have a variety of conjugations on your flashcards in general, though, if you're using full sentence flashcards with cloze deletion; I don't have that kind of card, so I'll leave further discussion of that to someone else who does.

  **Invoke the word** *autocorrect* and most people will think immediately of its hiccups‚Äîthe sort of hysterical, impossible errors one finds collected on sites like Damn You Autocorrect. But despite the inadvertent hilarity, the real marvel of our mobile text-correction systems is how astoundingly good they are. It's not too much of an exaggeration to call autocorrect the overlooked underwriter of our era of mobile prolixity. Without it, we wouldn't be able to compose windy love letters from stadium bleachers, write novels on subway commutes, or dash off breakup texts while in line at the post office. Without it, we probably couldn't even have phones that look anything like the ingots we tickle‚Äîthe whole notion of touchscreen typing, where our podgy physical fingers are expected to land with precision on tiny virtual keys, is viable only when we have some serious software to tidy up after us. Because we know autocorrect is there as brace and cushion, we're free to write with increased abandon, at times and in places where writing would otherwise be impossible. Thanks to autocorrect, the gap between whim and word is narrower than it's ever been, and our world is awash in easily rendered thought.

 As someone who typed the entire first draft of his book on a phone, I want to shake the hand of the person responsible for this heedlessness, to meet the man who taught machines to draw sense from our maniacal tapping. I find him in a drably pastel conference room at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Dean Hachamovitch‚Äîinventor on the patent for autocorrect and the closest thing it has to an individual creator‚Äîreaches across the table to introduce himself.

 ‚ÄúDean,‚Äù I say.

 ‚ÄúGabriel,‚Äù he says.

 ‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù He frowns. Then he smiles and adds: ‚ÄúAutocorrect.‚Äù Apparently his brain, long trained for efficiency, replaces implausible terms with likelier alternatives.

 Hachamovitch, now a vice president at Microsoft and head of data science for the entire corporation, is a likable and modest man. He freely concedes that he types *teh* as much as anyone. (Almost certainly he does not often type *hte*. As researchers have discovered, initial-letter transposition is a much rarer error.) The day I meet him he has dark circles under his eyes and short bangs that look self-cut, and his skin looks as though it has struggled valiantly to draw whatever vitamin D it can from his cinema display. He's clearly swamped, but autocorrect is close enough to his heart that he is happy to take the time to talk about it.

  When Hachamovitch first joined Microsoft, he was given a job on the Word team. This was back in the early '90s. Word processing was at a crossroads, split into factions. On one side were the people who wanted adornments and frills‚Äîimproved desktop publishing, color separation, and the like. On the other side was the functionality gang, with whom Hachamovitch threw in his lot. This camp simply wanted to help people get out of their own way. As Hachamovitch saw it, the main thing that people do on a word processor is type‚Äîand typing, in his estimation, is a matter of ‚Äúa little bit of creativity and a whole lot of scutwork.‚Äù He could improve the typing experience by delivering us from scut. His aim was to make our typing sleek and invisible, smooth as speaking from a teleprompter.

 The notion of autocorrect was born when Hachamovitch began thinking about a functionality that already existed in Word. Thanks to Charles Simonyi, the longtime Microsoft executive widely recognized as the father of graphical word processing, Word had a ‚Äúglossary‚Äù that could be used as a sort of auto-expander. You could set up a string of words‚Äîlike *insert logo*‚Äîwhich, when typed and followed by a press of the F3 button, would get replaced by a JPEG of your company's logo. Hachamovitch realized that this glossary could be used far more aggressively to correct common mistakes. He drew up a little code that would allow you to press the left arrow and F3 at any time and immediately replace *teh* with *the*. His aha moment came when he realized that, because English words are space-delimited, the space bar itself could trigger the replacement, to make correction ‚Ä¶ automatic! Hachamovitch drew up a list of common errors, and over the next years he and his team went on to solve many of the thorniest. *Seperate* would automatically change to *separate*. Accidental cap locks would adjust immediately (making *dEAR grEG* into *Dear Greg*). One Microsoft manager dubbed them the Department of Stupid PC Tricks.

 MICROSOFT WORD COULDN'T VERY WELL GO AROUND RECOMMENDING THE CORRECT SPELLING OF *MOTHREFUKCER*.

 **It wasn't long** before the team realized that autocorrect could also be used toward less productive‚Äîbut more delightful‚Äîends. One day Hachamovitch went into his boss's machine and changed the autocorrect dictionary so that any time he typed *Dean* it was automatically changed to the name of his coworker Mike, and vice versa. (His boss kept both his computer and office locked after that.) Children were even quicker to grasp the comedic ramifications of the new tool. After Hachamovitch went to speak to his daughter's third-grade class, he got emails from parents that read along the lines of ‚ÄúThank you for coming to talk to my daughter's class, but whenever I try to type her name I find it automatically transforms itself into ‚ÄòThe pretty princess.‚Äô‚Äù

 Hachamovitch and his team couldn't get carried away with the pranks, though, because they were still hammering out the feature's basic functionality. The two-letter-caps substitution (*THis* to *This*) was scheduled to go live in Word 6, but it immediately posed the problem of how to handle exceptions (like *CDs*). What they needed, they realized‚Äînot just for this type of exception but for all of them‚Äîwas a master list, a kind of artisanal concordance. The task fell to Hachamovitch's intern, Christopher Thorpe, a 19-year-old on leave from Harvard. Thorpe wrote a script that compiled all the manual entries that Microsoft employees had made to their custom dictionaries‚Äîwords the built-in dictionary hadn't recognized but that were judged by users to be legitimate. Thorpe gave the list a quick edit and then gathered the remaining entries into a corpus. It began with such words as *abuzz* and *acidhead*. That prospectus became a database of the additional words that Word should find legit. In later Word releases, another list itemized changes that ought to be made to problematic homophone phrases. Word should always, for example, change *elude to* to *allude to*, and *could of been* to *could have been*.

 For our meeting, Hachamovitch dug up a stack of historical documents like that list, files that had languished for 20 years in office moves, making their way eventually to his basement. He clearly takes a marmish pride in the artifacts, patting a shrink-wrapped Word 95 box and turning it over to point out where it touted the great triumph of autocorrect. He flipped open a perfect-bound manuscript to a page he'd marked, with a table that showed when they added *judgement* as a correctible error. That one, he explained, was a very common misspelling, now eradicated like smallpox.

 On the subject of judgment, though, it became clear even in those early days that a sort of editorial consciousness was at work in Word's spell-check and autocorrect systems. *Judgement*, for example, isn't a misspelling‚Äîjust about every dictionary lists it as an acceptable alternative. But autocorrect tends to enforce primary spellings in all circumstances. On idiom, some of its calls seemed fairly clear-cut: *gorilla warfare* became *guerrilla warfare*, for example, even though a wildlife biologist might find that an inconvenient assumption. But some of the calls were quite tricky, and one of the trickiest involved the issue of obscenity. On one hand, Word didn't want to seem priggish; on the other, it couldn't very well go around recommending the correct spelling of *mothrefukcer*. Microsoft was sensitive to these issues. The solution lay in expanding one of spell-check's most special lists, bearing the understated title: ‚ÄúWords which should neither be flagged nor suggested.‚Äù

  I called up Thorpe, who now runs a Boston-based startup called Philo, to ask him how the idea for the list came about. An inspiration, as he recalls it, was a certain Microsoft user named Bill Vignola. One day Vignola sent Bill Gates an email. (Thorpe couldn't recall who Bill Vignola was or what he did.) Whenever Bill Vignola typed his own name in MS Word, the email to Gates explained, it was automatically changed to *Bill Vaginal*. Presumably Vignola caught this sometimes, but not always, and no doubt this serious man was sad to come across like a character in a Thomas Pynchon novel. His email made it down the chain of command to Thorpe. And Bill Vaginal wasn't the only complainant: As Thorpe recalls, Goldman Sachs was mad that Word was always turning it into *Goddamn Sachs*.

 Thorpe went through the dictionary and took out all the words marked as ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù Then he threw in a few anatomical terms for good measure. The resulting list ran to hundreds of entries:

 anally, asshole, battle-axe, battleaxe, bimbo, booger, boogers, butthead, Butthead ‚Ä¶

 With these sorts of master lists in place‚Äîthe corrections, the exceptions, and the to-be-primly-ignored‚Äîthe joists of autocorrect, then still a subdomain of spell-check, were in place for the early releases of Word. Microsoft's dominance at the time ensured that autocorrect became globally ubiquito",1548979370

"JustNoSO","t5_3982d","Hi OP. I work in a Specialty Pharmacy. I just wanted to let you know there are many resources for MS. I think the medication you are referring to is Glatiramer, the generic form of Copaxone. 

The manufacturer of Glatiramer offers something called Mylan MS Advocate. It‚Äôs a program that offers support, nurses, financial assistance, etc. 
Your doctor should know something about this. There is a start form they can fill out that gets you set up with the WhisperJect AutoInjector as well as an option for a home nurse to come out to your house and give you injection training. You can ask your doctor about this or even google Mylan MS Advocate if you are not able to get in touch with your doctor right away. 

Mylan also offers a copay savings card that is automatically applied to the prescription claim when the pharmacy submits it, but it‚Äôs only available if you have commercial insurance (as opposed to government funded insurance such as Medicare, Medicaid, or TriCare). That copay card has a max funding of $9,000/year, so maybe that‚Äôs what your wife was referring to? But even if you maxed out the funds on the copay card, there are a number of foundations/grants for MS to help with the costs of treatment. 

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm overstepping, I just know how complicated and frustrating navigating insurance is for specialty medications. MS has a lot of good treatment options now for not only slowing the progression, but also for treating the associated symptoms. 

I don‚Äôt have any suggestions for your difficulties with your wife right now, but I just want you to know that you aren‚Äôt alone.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

Because Manamorphose is an instant, it can be cast between resolutions of Seasons Past and repeatedly recurred (Seasons Past doesn't target, so Manamorphose doesn't need to be in the graveyard until each SP resolves), which would have generated ludicrous amounts of mana and card draw. Also works with Dramatic Reversal to generate lots of mana without the card draw.

In addition, after the first SP copy resolves, he can Force of Will the original SP, and then use the next SP copy to get back the original SP to hand. So, with DR + Seasons Past + Force of Will, that's effectively infinite mana and infinite storm. At some point before you're actually infinite, cast Manamorphose to draw your deck, and then do whatever you want.

Ultimately doesn't really matter, but I like finding odd combos in what otherwise seem to be non-deterministic ""loops"".",1548979371

"OOTP","t5_2sf6w","My org has 155 players in it and I manage it all myself. I generally just check on them every month or so. For each team I'll view ""All batters"" and sort by OPS+ and if there are people with a monster OPS+ for their position and a good amount of at bats, I'll check the team above them to see if anyone at their position is struggling, then I'll demote that person and promote the other guy to his spot. Vice versa if I happen to notice anybody is struggling, I'll see if there's a person in the league below them who could move up to their spot.

Then I do the same for pitchers by sorting by ERA+ and seeing if anyone is really doing well or struggling and they've had a good enough sample size of IP. 

Of course ERA+ and OPS+ aren't the only things I look at. A 1B with an OPS+ of 115 is less likely to get a call up than a CF with the same OPS+. They're just the quickest way to sort out who's generally succeeding, who's generally struggling, and who is holding their own.

Same thing with injuries, if somebody gets hurt I'll look at the team below them and see who is most ready to replace them, then I have to find somebody in the league below THAT to replace THAT guy, etc. If my organization is REALLY riddled with injuries, my lowest team can tend to get pretty depleted, midway through the season, so I'll just go to the FA screen and sign a few minor league contracts to fill roster spots if necessary

My eyes were open and I could see, but ""I"" was not present to interpret the colors into meaningful images.  There were just general dark and light patterns.

I was with friends when we started to trip but I wandered off and was alone when the ego death struck.  I was in Joshua Tree so the desert setting definitely intensified the experience.

Cops aren't legally obligated to save you. Not because of some messed up evil thing, it's to protect them from being sued by someone who was hurt while the cop was in the general vicinity. I would argue against this but cops are not superhuman.

Point being, this just looks to protect women and doctors who make the tough call in case something terrible happens and they have to abort. So they can't be charged like some middle east countries do.

3. BIAB absobtion is roughly 0.125 qts/lb no-squeeze, 0.1 qts/lb light squeeze, and 0.08 qts/lb heavy squeeze. 
4. Your wort will shrink 4% as it cools from boiling to pitching temp. 
4. Use you accurate measurement tool to measure your boil volume at start and at least every 10 minutes so you can adjust the boil vigor to achieve the exact target post-boil volume.

"MHOC","t5_31ykc","Mr. Deputy Speaker,

I would like to agree with the sentiment proposed by my honorable friend/u/WillShakespeare99 with regards to the major issue that is homelessness.

As much as many members here will debate the effects of various solutions on a party-line basis, as much as we will all argue about which solution from which party or which ideology would best take people out of the horrific state of homelessness, I hope that we would look at uniting together, as a nation, and fighting for an independent commission to look into this matter, much like what was proposed by my right honorable friend /u/Tommy1Boys. We will not all agree on the solutions that this commission comes up with, but we must all recognize that homelessness is a serious matter that must be tackled by **ALL** the parties in parliament, not just a small coalition, and as such, we must look to unite as many parties together behind the common-sense solution of an independent commission, and its proposed solutions, to the highest extent possible.

However, beyond that, I would advise my fellow members of this house, not to come to rash conclusions or ""easy"" solutions for this matter. There is no truly simple answer for such a complicated and multi-faceted problem, and suggesting that one approach could end this issue, is not just irresponsible, but outright reckless. We need to recognize that getting people out of homelessness requires a long term plan with numerous steps and solutions, which need to be agreed to in a bipartisan manner so as to make sure these solutions are stable and long-lasting.

Once again, I would like to thank the right honorable member for bringing up the point, and I would like to thank all the other members who have contributed to this vital discussion. I look forward to seeing more being done on this issue in the days and weeks to come. ",1548979375

Since everyone is yelling at me to talk to a lawyer I'm going to call one tomorrow just because, but its not something that helps me right now.

Basically I was driving a standing life in reverse (a common and expected practice). I realized I was headed towards a guardrail and so took my foot off the deadman's switch and pushed the joystick forward. The momentum shift pulled my leg out of the lift and my foot got wedged between the floor of the lift and the guardrail. I got caught there because the emergency brake had engaged on contact (which is why I had removed my foot from the deadman's switch, it just didnt engage in time). The resulting injury was a nondisplaced closed fracture of the second metatarsel which took two months to heal and I still walk with a limp. 

On my last visit my doctor said I could probably go back but I could also get another few weeks to heal up if I wanted. In my eagerness to return to work (I had lost all my overtime possibility when put on light duty) I said I thought I'd be fine and so he released me, and they ended my assignment as soon as they found out I was released.

A few bad results? Weve been struggling since November. January may be over but its not getting any easier.

This happens when you lose the previous game and *leave the match before the ""division down"" screen*. When you won the next match, you didn't gain enough Skill Rating to stay in that division.

*****

**More in-depth explanation**

Normally, at the end of the match, the game shows you a visualization of you rank movement. If you go division up, it shows division up. If you go division down, division down. However, it's possible to leave a match before you see that animation. Since the information didn't get shown to you, there was no possibility for the game to show you you went division down. 

However, after the following match, if you still are one division lower than you were before it then displays the animation it should have displayed.

&amp;nbsp; 

**TL;DR:** You went division/tier down the match before, the game just couldn't inform you

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Hey, you aren't alone! This is actually pretty common, and it's fixable in lots of cases! So, you have some pretty clear causes and that isn't complicated. You don't mention what exactly causes the resentment or the anger. If they are valid concerns and causes, that's a great starting point! If they are intangible, we may need to drill down to clarify.

&amp;nbsp;

So, the fist question, so you want to fix this, or have you outgrown the relationship? You have grown up and matured in the intervening eight years, does this relationship reflect the kind of bond you want to have at this stage of your life? Is this worth saving? If no, end it and move on, that's ok! If you want to continue with the same partner, that's totally fine too, and you can take constructive steps to address your half of any issue. Then you can see if he is open to making some adjustments.

&amp;nbsp;

It sounds like you aren't at the breaking point yet, which can be a blessing and a curse. If you were ready to walk, things can be clearer. But being invested can be helpful too, since you are likely to still be able to empathize with your SO.

Nope. The hallows are in the Tale Of The Three Brothers. I'm thinking of The Warlock's Hairy Heart.

&gt;  Canonically, out of the hole order, only he, Snape, Harry, know Occulmency

You have no idea whether that's true hardly anyone ever talks with Harry about Occlumency, so we don't know who else might be aware of it.

&gt; People would be scared and try to flee. Besides, no way can they ever be on a level to be able to keep Voldemort/Dumbledore out

Yeah, that's right, run from the guy who told you there are people who can read your mind and then promised you to teach you how to defend yourself. I seriously doubt people would actually be that dumb.

&gt; You are missing the most important thing. Nobody knows about it.

Well, someone knew enough about it to write a fucking book about it. And we know about at least three different people who learned about and then mastered both Occlumency and Legilimency probably independently of each other so it can't be that well hidden of a secret.

&gt; And that's the way it should be. If someone learns there's a method to defend against mind reading, naturally he will research it as well. The less people know about occulmency, the less people know about Legilimency. 

No because even a single person capable of untold damage using legilimency if no one knows to watch out for or defend against it. 

If no one in the ministry knew Occlumency, a single Legilismens could topple and take over Fudge's entire government in a matter of months just by digging out the right secrets from the right people and using or revealing them at the right time.

Keeping the art a complete secret would eventually almost definitely end in total disaster. It would be much smarter to just break the power of Legilimency by just teaching everyone how to defend themselves enough to at least recognize an intrusion.",1548979379

add a few of past distance characters all while giving a few flashbacks into the old movies.

Use lots of action, and try new fresh cast

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","Your concern is valid, yet simply misplaced imo: showmatch was not about winning per se, but about showing a superhuman sc2 capability, which sadly wasn't there. Why? Simply because the team failed to stop the AI from getting its advantage the easiest way possible.

The thing is even a rather stupid... I mean ""strategically impaired""  AI could win a game with 2000 EAPM, multiple points of view and absolute precision. And if 2000 EAPM would not win it a game, you could always allow AI to make 10000 apm... There was never a question whether an AI could win by playing quicker... It's basically a typical way of making standard human-made bots challenging.

The Deepmind team knew that perfecty and chose to block this path. But, not being sc2 players, they missed several things and AI erfectively hacked the constraints.

Consequently, the game devolved into micro-contest and bots were not showing anything spectacular otherwise: game-winning micro is much easier to acquire than strategic thinking. 

I was effectively salivating about AI droping all the cool strategic thinking the Deepmind's creations were showing in Chess and Go games. Yet, there were next to none: supermicroing was too easy. (I'd even say TLO's opponents were more interesting strategically: better AIs lost some of the creativity along the way)

"FolkPunk","t5_2shm1","/u/tom-dooley does an outstanding write-up on this record in his IG, [@folkpunkarchivist](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtUE9Nsg2ej/)

&gt; In honor of the great new interview by Alec of A Fistful of Vinyl with Eric Mueller of Pirate Press Records, I wanted to talk briefly about the record that overlaps folkpunk and Pirate Press: The famous 8"" Mischief Brew/Andrew Jackson Jihad split.

&gt; The first notable thing about this record should be obvious: it is the only concrete connection between two of folkpunk's most well-known acts that existed in completely different spheres due to their geography.

&gt; The second fascinating thing about this release is the mechanics of the record itself. There is one song per side (Punx Win and If Jeff Swiney Had a Hammer), but both sides are cut with concentric grooves; basically, each side was cut with both an electric and acoustic version of the song with the grooves of each version running alongside eachother so depending on where you drop the needle (of if you bump your table), you get a different version!

  **Invoke the word** *autocorrect* and most people will think immediately of its hiccups‚Äîthe sort of hysterical, impossible errors one finds collected on sites like Damn You Autocorrect. But despite the inadvertent hilarity, the real marvel of our mobile text-correction systems is how astoundingly good they are. It's not too much of an exaggeration to call autocorrect the overlooked underwriter of our era of mobile prolixity. Without it, we wouldn't be able to compose windy love letters from stadium bleachers, write novels on subway commutes, or dash off breakup texts while in line at the post office. Without it, we probably couldn't even have phones that look anything like the ingots we tickle‚Äîthe whole notion of touchscreen typing, where our podgy physical fingers are expected to land with precision on tiny virtual keys, is viable only when we have some serious software to tidy up after us. Because we know autocorrect is there as brace and cushion, we're free to write with increased abandon, at times and in places where writing would otherwise be impossible. Thanks to autocorrect, the gap between whim and word is narrower than it's ever been, and our world is awash in easily rendered thought.

 As someone who typed the entire first draft of his book on a phone, I want to shake the hand of the person responsible for this heedlessness, to meet the man who taught machines to draw sense from our maniacal tapping. I find him in a drably pastel conference room at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Dean Hachamovitch‚Äîinventor on the patent for autocorrect and the closest thing it has to an individual creator‚Äîreaches across the table to introduce himself.

 ‚ÄúDean,‚Äù I say.

 ‚ÄúGabriel,‚Äù he says.

 ‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù He frowns. Then he smiles and adds: ‚ÄúAutocorrect.‚Äù Apparently his brain, long trained for efficiency, replaces implausible terms with likelier alternatives.

 Hachamovitch, now a vice president at Microsoft and head of data science for the entire corporation, is a likable and modest man. He freely concedes that he types *teh* as much as anyone. (Almost certainly he does not often type *hte*. As researchers have discovered, initial-letter transposition is a much rarer error.) The day I meet him he has dark circles under his eyes and short bangs that look self-cut, and his skin looks as though it has struggled valiantly to draw whatever vitamin D it can from his cinema display. He's clearly swamped, but autocorrect is close enough to his heart that he is happy to take the time to talk about it.

  When Hachamovitch first joined Microsoft, he was given a job on the Word team. This was back in the early '90s. Word processing was at a crossroads, split into factions. On one side were the people who wanted adornments and frills‚Äîimproved desktop publishing, color separation, and the like. On the other side was the functionality gang, with whom Hachamovitch threw in his lot. This camp simply wanted to help people get out of their own way. As Hachamovitch saw it, the main thing that people do on a word processor is type‚Äîand typing, in his estimation, is a matter of ‚Äúa little bit of creativity and a whole lot of scutwork.‚Äù He could improve the typing experience by delivering us from scut. His aim was to make our typing sleek and invisible, smooth as speaking from a teleprompter.

 The notion of autocorrect was born when Hachamovitch began thinking about a functionality that already existed in Word. Thanks to Charles Simonyi, the longtime Microsoft executive widely recognized as the father of graphical word processing, Word had a ‚Äúglossary‚Äù that could be used as a sort of auto-expander. You could set up a string of words‚Äîlike *insert logo*‚Äîwhich, when typed and followed by a press of the F3 button, would get replaced by a JPEG of your company's logo. Hachamovitch realized that this glossary could be used far more aggressively to correct common mistakes. He drew up a little code that would allow you to press the left arrow and F3 at any time and immediately replace *teh* with *the*. His aha moment came when he realized that, because English words are space-delimited, the space bar itself could trigger the replacement, to make correction ‚Ä¶ automatic! Hachamovitch drew up a list of common errors, and over the next years he and his team went on to solve many of the thorniest. *Seperate* would automatically change to *separate*. Accidental cap locks would adjust immediately (making *dEAR grEG* into *Dear Greg*). One Microsoft manager dubbed them the Department of Stupid PC Tricks.

 MICROSOFT WORD COULDN'T VERY WELL GO AROUND RECOMMENDING THE CORRECT SPELLING OF *MOTHREFUKCER*.

 **It wasn't long** before the team realized that autocorrect could also be used toward less productive‚Äîbut more delightful‚Äîends. One day Hachamovitch went into his boss's machine and changed the autocorrect dictionary so that any time he typed *Dean* it was automatically changed to the name of his coworker Mike, and vice versa. (His boss kept both his computer and office locked after that.) Children were even quicker to grasp the comedic ramifications of the new tool. After Hachamovitch went to speak to his daughter's third-grade class, he got emails from parents that read along the lines of ‚ÄúThank you for coming to talk to my daughter's class, but whenever I try to type her name I find it automatically transforms itself into ‚ÄòThe pretty princess.‚Äô‚Äù

 Hachamovitch and his team couldn't get carried away with the pranks, though, because they were still hammering out the feature's basic functionality. The two-letter-caps substitution (*THis* to *This*) was scheduled to go live in Word 6, but it immediately posed the problem of how to handle exceptions (like *CDs*). What they needed, they realized‚Äînot just for this type of exception but for all of them‚Äîwas a master list, a kind of artisanal concordance. The task fell to Hachamovitch's intern, Christopher Thorpe, a 19-year-old on leave from Harvard. Thorpe wrote a script that compiled all the manual entries that Microsoft employees had made to their custom dictionaries‚Äîwords the built-in dictionary hadn't recognized but that were judged by users to be legitimate. Thorpe gave the list a quick edit and then gathered the remaining entries into a corpus. It began with such words as *abuzz* and *acidhead*. That prospectus became a database of the additional words that Word should find legit. In later Word releases, another list itemized changes that ought to be made to problematic homophone phrases. Word should always, for example, change *elude to* to *allude to*, and *could of been* to *could have been*.

 For our meeting, Hachamovitch dug up a stack of historical documents like that list, files that had languished for 20 years in office moves, making their way eventually to his basement. He clearly takes a marmish pride in the artifacts, patting a shrink-wrapped Word 95 box and turning it over to point out where it touted the great triumph of autocorrect. He flipped open a perfect-bound manuscript to a page he'd marked, with a table that showed when they added *judgement* as a correctible error. That one, he explained, was a very common misspelling, now eradicated like smallpox.

 On the subject of judgment, though, it became clear even in those early days that a sort of editorial consciousness was at work in Word's spell-check and autocorrect systems. *Judgement*, for example, isn't a misspelling‚Äîjust about every dictionary lists it as an acceptable alternative. But autocorrect tends to enforce primary spellings in all circumstances. On idiom, some of its calls seemed fairly clear-cut: *gorilla warfare* became *guerrilla warfare*, for example, even though a wildlife biologist might find that an inconvenient assumption. But some of the calls were quite tricky, and one of the trickiest involved the issue of obscenity. On one hand, Word didn't want to seem priggish; on the other, it couldn't very well go around recommending the correct spelling of *mothrefukcer*. Microsoft was sensitive to these issues. The solution lay in expanding one of spell-check's most special lists, bearing the understated title: ‚ÄúWords which should neither be flagged nor suggested.‚Äù

  I called up Thorpe, who now runs a Boston-based startup called Philo, to ask him how the idea for the list came about. An inspiration, as he recalls it, was a certain Microsoft user named Bill Vignola. One day Vignola sent Bill Gates an email. (Thorpe couldn't recall who Bill Vignola was or what he did.) Whenever Bill Vignola typed his own name in MS Word, the email to Gates explained, it was automatically changed to *Bill Vaginal*. Presumably Vignola caught this sometimes, but not always, and no doubt this serious man was sad to come across like a character in a Thomas Pynchon novel. His email made it down the chain of command to Thorpe. And Bill Vaginal wasn't the only complainant: As Thorpe recalls, Goldman Sachs was mad that Word was always turning it into *Goddamn Sachs*.

 Thorpe went through the dictionary and took out all the words marked as ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù Then he threw in a few anatomical terms for good measure. The resulting list ran to hundreds of entries:

 anally, asshole, battle-axe, battleaxe, bimbo, booger, boogers, butthead, Butthead ‚Ä¶

 With these sorts of master lists in place‚Äîthe corrections, the exceptions, and the to-be-primly-ignored‚Äîthe joists of autocorrect, then still a subdomain of spell-check, were in place for the early releases of Word. Microsoft's dominance at the time ensured that autocorrect became globally ubiquito",1548979384
"belgium","t5_2qhe6","&gt;It's not like companies are polluting for the fun of it, they're polluting to make a product.

And they should pay the price for cleaning up what they're polluting. The end. No price increases, no layoffs, support the country you're in or get out.

EDIT: Ask yourself: who is responsible for Belgium, the country?

It can't be nobody. That would mean there is lawlessness. That cannot be.

It's the government. The government, in case we've forgotten, is but a surrogate for the people. The people elect representatives to, well, represent them.

And there cannot be lawlessness. As such, if we can determine that a person or organization(or anything else, including the government itself) has damaged that which falls under the responsibility of the government of Belgium, it is the responsibility of the government of Belgium to stop them and punish them for it.

The idea that they'll just go pollute and abuse somewhere else and we should not want them to stop is weird. Complete lack of owning up to the consequences of one's actions.

All in the name of profit.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I find this Nerf highly concerning; both in timing and Targets.

First the timing: post Christmas and playoffs but ~1/1.5 months until the marketing starts for the first expansion of 2019. This timing indicates to me that that this is player churn/daily active users Nerf, rather then a balance Nerf. I think most players would agree that the current state of Hearthstone at a low point of ""fun"" relative to other metas, but were these staples oppressive? I would argue that the raise of Hunter was the natural outcome of the December Nerfs and Even/Odd Paladin is just continuously a statement on the 1 card = 1 mana = 1/1 minon value equation in a meta. 

When you tie in the Targets I think a picture comes together that this nerf doesn't have cohesive idea about what the meta is to be on the ""other side"" of it. Are we going back to a control meta? Why because the wolfs are one turn closer to Flamestrike? What about this is going impact the rock/paper/scissors of Giant turn 4? Rogue has less burst but will that change arrgo Rogue's general climbing power? 

Equality and Flame tongue are just silly IMO, Shaman hasn't had a tier 1 relevant class identity for the last year and removing a tool doesn't give it one. But what is the Equality Nerf doing? Still even, still requires a combo for full clear, does this de-power even pally? Does this stop OTK pally? ... Maybe

I have excepted that I'm not going to enjoy every meta in Hearthstone, and was generally on board with the year of the Raven being a reset year for the power level of the game; but I think that what we are seeing now is dangerous for the longer term structure (game meta) of hearthstone. Are Even/odd too powerful = yes; did hunter need to be taken out back = probable not. Is Even Lock going to be nerf when its 60% of the meta = Maybe?

.... And OTK decks are still cancer

It's because of his business that you're bearing the family's financial burden almost entirely on your own, the stress of which is starting to have a real impact on your mental health, as well as the health of your marriage. 

I think you have a right to know what the numbers and plans are, especially before they embark on another business venture, which will carry new risks with it. If they haven't addressed the issues with their current business that are keeping it from being profitable, what makes them think the next will succeed? I don't know what your current level of trust is, given that you mention him glossing over the facts and figures, but I'd ask for access to their books and sit down with an accountant to go through them. Successful business owners don't ""gloss over"" anything - to have control over your enterprise, you need to be ruthlessly honest with yourself about the health of your business and its shortcomings. 

Also, just because you were okay with this arrangement when you married him, doesn't mean you have to be happy about it forever. Circumstances and feelings change, and that's valid. It actually seems to me that you were mostly okay with your husband's business, and it was only once he started planning to start a second business that you began feeling this way.

The proper way to decarb weed is to bake it at ~220 degrees for at least a half hour uncovered.  

The way they did it sounds like they were just trying to skip the process of decarbing the weed seperately, but by covering it and cooking it for only 22 minutes, they definitely wasted a bunch of the THC.

What they ended up with, like I said, was neutered weed that pretty much just makes you wanna take a nap - it's tantamount to taking a mild sedative.  It's not that she 'doesn't do' edibles, it's that they don't know how to make them properly.  ",1548979385

Ranked Choice is where you rank your choices from most desirable to least.

The first round votes are cast - in the above example four for Chinese, three for Pizza, two for Mexican - and if there is no clear winner - i.e. more than 50% of the vote - then the least popular candidate is removed (in some examples), and the people's next choice is counted.

There is a large travel time in SE that does seem to rankle people - without changing that at all you might appease these people by giving them more options to travel automatically between areas in their ships as a passenger and more automation to go along with that for mining and transporting materials. So much of what happens in the game is human piloted ships when I think a lot of people might be interested in making something that goes out and does something by itself. Like establishing a mine and then something to take those materials back to your base. The emergent gameplay in shooting down mining drones, raiding supply chains, et cetera might be really interesting and provide for resources where people feel like it's worth their time to pvp for an area without risking everything because they're able to use automation to make several bases and several ships and then risk and lose them in areas. The gameplay loop right now encourages singular bases and ships because the human piloting them and using them are so valuable and it's not like there's an advantage to multiple bases or anything besides one huge conveyer linked refinery and one huge ship to dump ore into. There's no reason to have multiple ships for different ore types or to build a small refinery so you can transport the ore to where you're building.

Trying to think along those lines would help solve the kind of ""sandbox but now what?"" issue as well as probably reduce demand for a high speed limit.",1548979387

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt;The graph [comparing poverty in 1820 to today] casts this as a decline in poverty, but in reality what was going on was a process of dispossession that bulldozed people into the capitalist labour system, during the enclosure movements in Europe and the colonisation of the global south.

&gt;Prior to colonisation, most people lived in subsistence economies where they enjoyed access to abundant commons ‚Äì land, water, forests, livestock and robust systems of sharing and reciprocity. They had little if any money, but then they didn‚Äôt need it in order to live well... 

The author is on the verge of toting the 1820s as a time of freedom, prosperity and plenty. You don't need much sense to realize this is patently ridiculous. The wealthiest person in the 1820s didn't have access to healthcare, sanitation, electricity, fucking germ theory, etc. In contrast, the average homeless person in the developed world still has access to most of these things along with education and so on, even with a bank balance of $0. Everyone is immensely more wealthy today than they were 200 years ago.

The author is right in saying that comparing modern data to 1820s data isn't ideal, but mainly because it's impossible to measure just how much wealthier every single person is in a material sense since that time. If anything the figures are vastly understated, and it's primarily driven by advances in science and technology.

3. Point #1 again, please find it.

4. We would've had a better chance seeing ALL our money back if they didn't fk up their reputation for this long. If they would've done it a month ago, the court could've helped them get back on track earlier and support the withdrawals with the trading fees. The goal of a CCAA is to keep the business operating so they can prevent bankruptcy by MAKING MONEY which Quadrigacx has made impossible. Which bring me to #5

5. They will give whatever is left of the money to the creditors (us). I doubt 26m is enough but we might see 50% of our money. Prepare to wait at least 3-4 months before you see your some of your money if they don't troll you any longer.

  **Invoke the word** *autocorrect* and most people will think immediately of its hiccups‚Äîthe sort of hysterical, impossible errors one finds collected on sites like Damn You Autocorrect. But despite the inadvertent hilarity, the real marvel of our mobile text-correction systems is how astoundingly good they are. It's not too much of an exaggeration to call autocorrect the overlooked underwriter of our era of mobile prolixity. Without it, we wouldn't be able to compose windy love letters from stadium bleachers, write novels on subway commutes, or dash off breakup texts while in line at the post office. Without it, we probably couldn't even have phones that look anything like the ingots we tickle‚Äîthe whole notion of touchscreen typing, where our podgy physical fingers are expected to land with precision on tiny virtual keys, is viable only when we have some serious software to tidy up after us. Because we know autocorrect is there as brace and cushion, we're free to write with increased abandon, at times and in places where writing would otherwise be impossible. Thanks to autocorrect, the gap between whim and word is narrower than it's ever been, and our world is awash in easily rendered thought.

 As someone who typed the entire first draft of his book on a phone, I want to shake the hand of the person responsible for this heedlessness, to meet the man who taught machines to draw sense from our maniacal tapping. I find him in a drably pastel conference room at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Dean Hachamovitch‚Äîinventor on the patent for autocorrect and the closest thing it has to an individual creator‚Äîreaches across the table to introduce himself.

 ‚ÄúDean,‚Äù I say.

 ‚ÄúGabriel,‚Äù he says.

 ‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù He frowns. Then he smiles and adds: ‚ÄúAutocorrect.‚Äù Apparently his brain, long trained for efficiency, replaces implausible terms with likelier alternatives.

 Hachamovitch, now a vice president at Microsoft and head of data science for the entire corporation, is a likable and modest man. He freely concedes that he types *teh* as much as anyone. (Almost certainly he does not often type *hte*. As researchers have discovered, initial-letter transposition is a much rarer error.) The day I meet him he has dark circles under his eyes and short bangs that look self-cut, and his skin looks as though it has struggled valiantly to draw whatever vitamin D it can from his cinema display. He's clearly swamped, but autocorrect is close enough to his heart that he is happy to take the time to talk about it.

  When Hachamovitch first joined Microsoft, he was given a job on the Word team. This was back in the early '90s. Word processing was at a crossroads, split into factions. On one side were the people who wanted adornments and frills‚Äîimproved desktop publishing, color separation, and the like. On the other side was the functionality gang, with whom Hachamovitch threw in his lot. This camp simply wanted to help people get out of their own way. As Hachamovitch saw it, the main thing that people do on a word processor is type‚Äîand typing, in his estimation, is a matter of ‚Äúa little bit of creativity and a whole lot of scutwork.‚Äù He could improve the typing experience by delivering us from scut. His aim was to make our typing sleek and invisible, smooth as speaking from a teleprompter.

 The notion of autocorrect was born when Hachamovitch began thinking about a functionality that already existed in Word. Thanks to Charles Simonyi, the longtime Microsoft executive widely recognized as the father of graphical word processing, Word had a ‚Äúglossary‚Äù that could be used as a sort of auto-expander. You could set up a string of words‚Äîlike *insert logo*‚Äîwhich, when typed and followed by a press of the F3 button, would get replaced by a JPEG of your company's logo. Hachamovitch realized that this glossary could be used far more aggressively to correct common mistakes. He drew up a little code that would allow you to press the left arrow and F3 at any time and immediately replace *teh* with *the*. His aha moment came when he realized that, because English words are space-delimited, the space bar itself could trigger the replacement, to make correction ‚Ä¶ automatic! Hachamovitch drew up a list of common errors, and over the next years he and his team went on to solve many of the thorniest. *Seperate* would automatically change to *separate*. Accidental cap locks would adjust immediately (making *dEAR grEG* into *Dear Greg*). One Microsoft manager dubbed them the Department of Stupid PC Tricks.

 MICROSOFT WORD COULDN'T VERY WELL GO AROUND RECOMMENDING THE CORRECT SPELLING OF *MOTHREFUKCER*.

 **It wasn't long** before the team realized that autocorrect could also be used toward less productive‚Äîbut more delightful‚Äîends. One day Hachamovitch went into his boss's machine and changed the autocorrect dictionary so that any time he typed *Dean* it was automatically changed to the name of his coworker Mike, and vice versa. (His boss kept both his computer and office locked after that.) Children were even quicker to grasp the comedic ramifications of the new tool. After Hachamovitch went to speak to his daughter's third-grade class, he got emails from parents that read along the lines of ‚ÄúThank you for coming to talk to my daughter's class, but whenever I try to type her name I find it automatically transforms itself into ‚ÄòThe pretty princess.‚Äô‚Äù

 Hachamovitch and his team couldn't get carried away with the pranks, though, because they were still hammering out the feature's basic functionality. The two-letter-caps substitution (*THis* to *This*) was scheduled to go live in Word 6, but it immediately posed the problem of how to handle exceptions (like *CDs*). What they needed, they realized‚Äînot just for this type of exception but for all of them‚Äîwas a master list, a kind of artisanal concordance. The task fell to Hachamovitch's intern, Christopher Thorpe, a 19-year-old on leave from Harvard. Thorpe wrote a script that compiled all the manual entries that Microsoft employees had made to their custom dictionaries‚Äîwords the built-in dictionary hadn't recognized but that were judged by users to be legitimate. Thorpe gave the list a quick edit and then gathered the remaining entries into a corpus. It began with such words as *abuzz* and *acidhead*. That prospectus became a database of the additional words that Word should find legit. In later Word releases, another list itemized changes that ought to be made to problematic homophone phrases. Word should always, for example, change *elude to* to *allude to*, and *could of been* to *could have been*.

 For our meeting, Hachamovitch dug up a stack of historical documents like that list, files that had languished for 20 years in office moves, making their way eventually to his basement. He clearly takes a marmish pride in the artifacts, patting a shrink-wrapped Word 95 box and turning it over to point out where it touted the great triumph of autocorrect. He flipped open a perfect-bound manuscript to a page he'd marked, with a table that showed when they added *judgement* as a correctible error. That one, he explained, was a very common misspelling, now eradicated like smallpox.

 On the subject of judgment, though, it became clear even in those early days that a sort of editorial consciousness was at work in Word's spell-check and autocorrect systems. *Judgement*, for example, isn't a misspelling‚Äîjust about every dictionary lists it as an acceptable alternative. But autocorrect tends to enforce primary spellings in all circumstances. On idiom, some of its calls seemed fairly clear-cut: *gorilla warfare* became *guerrilla warfare*, for example, even though a wildlife biologist might find that an inconvenient assumption. But some of the calls were quite tricky, and one of the trickiest involved the issue of obscenity. On one hand, Word didn't want to seem priggish; on the other, it couldn't very well go around recommending the correct spelling of *mothrefukcer*. Microsoft was sensitive to these issues. The solution lay in expanding one of spell-check's most special lists, bearing the understated title: ‚ÄúWords which should neither be flagged nor suggested.‚Äù

  I called up Thorpe, who now runs a Boston-based startup called Philo, to ask him how the idea for the list came about. An inspiration, as he recalls it, was a certain Microsoft user named Bill Vignola. One day Vignola sent Bill Gates an email. (Thorpe couldn't recall who Bill Vignola was or what he did.) Whenever Bill Vignola typed his own name in MS Word, the email to Gates explained, it was automatically changed to *Bill Vaginal*. Presumably Vignola caught this sometimes, but not always, and no doubt this serious man was sad to come across like a character in a Thomas Pynchon novel. His email made it down the chain of command to Thorpe. And Bill Vaginal wasn't the only complainant: As Thorpe recalls, Goldman Sachs was mad that Word was always turning it into *Goddamn Sachs*.

 Thorpe went through the dictionary and took out all the words marked as ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù Then he threw in a few anatomical terms for good measure. The resulting list ran to hundreds of entries:

 anally, asshole, battle-axe, battleaxe, bimbo, booger, boogers, butthead, Butthead ‚Ä¶

 With these sorts of master lists in place‚Äîthe corrections, the exceptions, and the to-be-primly-ignored‚Äîthe joists of autocorrect, then still a subdomain of spell-check, were in place for the early releases of Word. Microsoft's dominance at the time ensured that autocorrect became globally ubiquito",1548979391

Ecgbehrt did briefly establish West Saxon control over Mercia in 830, and minted a celebratory coinage in London, but this was tenuous and short-lived, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Wiglaf of Mercia regained his crown the following year, and Mercian control of London was swiftly reestablished. Nonetheless, this did tip the balance of power in England towards Wessex, and allow Ecgbehrt to briefly claim *Bretwalda* status.

While *Bretwalda* could.be losely interpreted to mean ""King of all England"", it appears to have been a largely symbolic title given to a powerful king who could secure the nominal submission of other kingdoms, and not a genuine sign of unification. To ascribe 'First King of England' status to Ecgberht based on his *Bretwalda*ness would be to overlook other previous *Bretwaldas* such as √Üthelberht of Kent or R√¶dwald of East Anglia. It's Ecgberht's grandson, Alfred the Great, who can somewhat claim being the first King of the English, although it largely fell to his children Edward and √Üthelfl√¶d to actually establish much of that kingship, and it's Edward's son √Üthelstan who is crowned the first King of England.",1548979392

This is seen in games like this: a game is just a simulation, where everything happens in certain interval, like 30 times per second. If you jump in game, your next position is calculated and then after 1/30 seconds it is calculated again. This makes it seem that you are jumping smoothly, but you are actually just seeing a very fast slide show.

Consider you shoot a bullet in game. Game calculates next position for a single bullet really really fast. Rest of the time it just waits until remaining of the 1/30th of a seconds has passed and then it moves the bullet again. Now, lets spawn 1000 units which shoot continuously. There are now so many bullets that the game cannot move them all in 1/30th of a second anymore. The game starts to lag. 

Another way to say it, you are telling computer what to do and how often, not how fast or how much power to use. That looks like smooth animation, like a game, until you try to do too many things. In crysis, the world was so complex and detailed, that updating everyhthing and drawing everything to screen was just too much.",1548979392

Companies like Google and Microsoft...are never desperate.  Here is a quick list off the top of my head that arfe differentiators I look at when I'm reviewing the final candidates, and keep in mind the final candidates all have the best grades, from the best schools with the best extracurricular experience, etc.:

1) Can I trust this person to perform in front of my customers and my senior management

2) Will the person make my job easier or harder.  Will the candidate help me to reach my goals, and the goals of my department and company.  By the time you interview with me, you should know what these are already, and have a statement how you can help me reach these goals (you figure this out when you interview with my team members before you meet with me).

3) Will they be an active life learner?  If you're not learning, adapting, evolving all throughout your career...you will not excel over your peers, and I as a manager will not want to invest in you.

4) Are you someone that I or members of my team will want to spend long hours teaming with week after week, year after year.  Are you likeable?  I'm not going to voluntarily add an ass to the team no matter how talented you are.   Whether in person or virtually...your peers rely on you for their success, and their well-being as a teammate.  When everyone is stressed and challenged..are you going to make this worse, or are you going to contribute to making it better. 

5) How fast before the candidate is Fire and Forget?   Don't take this to mean you will be ignored, but do you have the talent and potential that I could send you to Tokyo on your own to work with a customer, and make me feel confident you've got it all handled end to end.  Or even better, how fast before you professionally develop to lead your own teams.  No you may not have this experience when you graduate, but know that those of us interviewing you are assessing your potential to be this some day...soon.   It's our butts on the line when we hire you, so know that we are pretty damn good at making those assessments of you in a matter of minutes.  In my case, you will spend hours interviewing before you get to interview with me.  The interview with me will probably be the shortest, 30-60 minutes at most.  In cases where I know you've been interviewing all day before meeting me, I will assess your energy level, how will quickly have you learned during those interviews to be able to intelligently ask me questions, but those who stand out, are the ones who already have proposed solutions or ideas when they meet me.  

Lastly, if you are a recent college grad....be humble.  Confidence is good, but to think you are the shit because of where you went to school, and what percentile you graduated in is not going to make yourself endearing to anyone.  

My nephew just got hired at Accenture.  He was top grade this, top school that...I told him imagine the hiring manager is down to his last 5 candidates.   And all 5 candidates are clones of yourself.   Why do I hire you over your clone?  Figure that out...and when you do get to be a finalist...you'll have a great chance of winning the final hire.

Her weakness is that she is very fragile if you try and spam her NP, which you need to do to actually make use of her. She can support most attackers that like stars and NP but she needs another support to keep her HP topped up or she isn't sustainable. The best choices by far are Merlin and Tamamo, as they can both provide her with healing through their NPs and they both also give team-wide NP with their NPs so she can NP more to charge their NP which allows her to NP more and charge their NPs which... you get the picture. Essentially she gives you the skeleton of a double-Merlin or double-Tamamo NP chain. However, she doesn't give anything outside of that while also being significantly squishier since her demerit will absorb most of the healing. The team will be significantly worse than any mix of Waver, Tamamo, and/or Merlin, but considering how strong all three of them are that doesn't make her useless. That said, she offers almost nothing in short fights and there are other units that will work better in many longer fights so she isn't really high tier in my book.",1548979396

1) there are pro-rights pro-gun liberals.

They have worse economic segregation and gentrify in their cities. The Democrats forgot about class and race intersections a *looooong* time ago. 


The ACA protected the rich by shifting the burden of health care onto lower middle class men. Most plans are still unusable and Bloomberg's healthcare stocks have never been happier. Universal Healthcare isn't trying poorly and patting yourself on the back that millions of people now have a plan they can't afford to use. It's having the balls to put forward a plan the Republicans will shrill about being fema camps. 

Guns is the Democrat's climate science denial. It's the emotionally charged excuse to get voters ignoring a massive failure to act. It let's them support stop and frisk, police interventionism, and vague expansions of criminality. It let's them ignore that black men are the victims of America's gun problem and push laws searching people's social media accounts for wrong think.

##General rules for this raffle:

* **1.** Please comment to request slot(s). Only TOP COMMENTS count. No replies to comments or automod. OP will reply to your comment to confirm your slot(s) and send you a PM with PayPal information. 

* **2.** Do not under any circumstances edit or delete your spot request. If you made an error in the amount of spots you'd like, make a new top level comment.

* **3.** All payments must be made as PayPal Family &amp; Friends. **DO NOT WRITE ANYTHING IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF YOUR PAYMENT**. 

* **4.** Please pay within the timeframe established by OP. If you anticipate you will not be able to pay for your slot(s) in that timeframe, please make arrangements to have someone cover your payment.

* **5.** ***The only accepted payment method is PayPal Friends &amp; Family.  DO NOT SEND YOUR PAYMENT AS AN eCHECK OR GOODS &amp; SERVICES!*** *Do not write anything in the payment notes section.* ***Report to mods anyone that refuses to pay via paypal friends &amp; family***

* **6.** After you have paid, please PM OP with the **NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS** associated with your PayPal. Do not publicly post your name or email address. Failure to do this will be considered non-payment.

You‚Äôre going down the route of ‚Äúremove Chrom and you can have the same story as long as you drastically change it‚Äù which can be said about any main character. 

In what way does Chrom not drive the plot? Robin sits around obeying Chrom whole
He goes from one journey to the next. 

Yes Chrom has one moment of weakness at the end, and Robin a moment of individual thought, but that‚Äôs one moment in an entire story that Robin gets to make because he‚Äôs a mage (and can strike Grima from further away than Chrom could) mixed of course with their mutual respect. 

You take Chrom our and there is no plot to awakening. It has to be a completely different story. 

And the same is true for Robin because he‚Äôs incredibly important to the story. You‚Äôd have to do major rewrites and chrom‚Äôs stort could not be the same. 

That doesn‚Äôt make robin the main character, it makes him an important figure in chrom‚Äôs life which again, you are the only person not understanding that both can be important. 

But when it comes to the main character it boils down to writing. 

Issues are given in a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how it affects chrom‚Äù way. Not robin. 

Plot points are introduced as strife for Chrom. Yes *even robin being a vessel* is introduced in a way that we see how it tests chrom‚Äôs ideals, not robin‚Äôs. 

Robin‚Äôs choice at the end is in a way that tests Chrom. Robin knows what he wants (so would Chrom, but moment of weakness because he has given so much to prove that he can make it out of this *with* robin) 

You remove Chrom you remove the...entire story. 

Robin, Ylisse, Emmeryn, Lucina, The Awakening, the Fire Emblem all has to go. There‚Äôs no story. 

You could even view robin as a major plot point more than a character 
And Chrom as the main character driving the plot. ",1548979402

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","Wow. Our stories are so incredibly similar. 
I am 24 now, also struggled with Bipolar 2 all my life. I picked up chronic PTSD and anxiety along the way, and got diagnosed with ADD as well.
I also did a medical withdrawal from my university for last semester, but it took a while of me isolating and not going to class and putting off assignments for the first time to this degree.
I understand now that I got derailed and most of my friends graduated and moved-a love interest got hospitalized along with my best friend, who I haven‚Äôt seen since September and miss more than I can say
I‚Äôve relied on friends for support all my life bc my family was always in turmoil. They see my true self that I want to show to the world.
I‚Äôve been on meds and in therapy, IOP and over the Xmas break I was in residential for 3 weeks to work on more trauma from the summer.
I‚Äôve had a history of abusive relationships and missing school. Tried to kill myself at 18, lots of circumstances led to the attempt but they didn‚Äôt figure out I was having a manic reaction to the SSRI I was just put on and was hospitalized. I ODed on benzos and my dad cracked my moms ribs for it. I choked my dad out, ran into the woods and slit my wrists. I was too fucked up to do it right so I failed
But now. After I took that huge leap to go into residential I got a different sense of things. I want to make something of myself and not just wallow my life away. I‚Äôve always had good grades but I lost my drive when my friends left. I made a resume for the first time and I‚Äôm going to apply for jobs and lab positions.
Despite relapsing into bad habits bc of a girl hurting me in the 2 weeks I‚Äôve been out of residential I‚Äôm recovering a bit and in a mixed state-going to class. Wish you well, we‚Äôll both kill it this semester!",1548979403

Checking: Usually with a big bank. I know a lot of people here always say to use Credit unions, but they‚Äôve never been really convenient to me. Big banks have more locations, and more features usually depending on what CU you‚Äôre comparing them too. I‚Äôd use this account as my everyday purchase type of things. I‚Äôd also get direct deposit into this account, then move it into my other accounts as I see fit.

Savings #1: This account would be with a big bank as well, preferably with the same as your checking. I only keep a few thousand here usually, and mostly use it as another place to just have cash that I can get to pretty fast if I need to make a big purchase or something. 

Savings #2: Yes I have 2 savings accounts lol. This one though would be a ‚Äúhigh yield‚Äù savings account where I‚Äôd gain a pretty good amount of interest, and also would have the majority of my money here as well. This account can be with a credit union if you‚Äôd like, but I currently have it with American Express. Anything that isn‚Äôt in my checking or other savings, would be here. I use this account for long term savings and rarely ever take money out, but always put money in. 

As far as how much money you should save vs spend, there is many variables. Find out your income, budget, and how much you feel comfortable spending. ",1548979404

Younger girls are higher SMV than older girls and are generally more prone to shit-testing, although that by no means means that older women aren't liable to engage in it to an extreme degree as well. So it isn't a matter of older girls being more receptive so much as it is a matter of men being responsive to the shit tests. But yeah shit-tests are womens' tool for finding alphas, and alphas don't commit; eventually a woman wants to hop off the cock carousel and settle down, and she (consciously or not) realizes that incessant shit-testing is not the best strategy to find the kind of guy who would be willing to do that (beta-bucks)",1548979405

My biggest issue was that most if not ALL of the Disney worlds were just their exact movies, scene by scene, with Sora either just not there or 0 interaction. The worst of these being POTC and Frozen. I see a lot of people trying to defend this saying it has always been this way when it clearly was not. 

Frozen has a friggin musical scene ripped straight from the movie, and that has never been a thing before. You talk to Elsa like what, once? A sentence at best? Every world has followed it movie a little maybe but largely had a story unique to the worlds of KH. Me and my boyfriend both have played every KH game to date and the remakes, and when he picked up the control her literally put it down an hour in with how bored he got from the just slog of cutscenes. I beat the game in a 24 hour sitting and I went ""That's it?"". A lot of people say they are the game length as its predecessor, if that is the case then why did KH2 feel like you did so much more? The game is visually stunning sure, but I will take a less pretty game with far more content over pretty and shiny(Looking at you The Order) any day of the week. No KH original worlds is unacceptable, We have had mainstays of the series GONE from the game. There are literal holes in this game, which don't even get me started on the story.

The game constantly just destroy it's own lore and rules to bring everybody back. Not only was I bored out of my mind from watching the 6-7th Disney movie by the time I was done, but the actual thing we were looking forward to the most, The big clash of light and dark felt so fucking rushed.  We didn't get explore the game's final world at all, and the final boss was the hugest disappointment. These are just a small list of things that let me down. I didn't buy this game expecting it to be as good as KH2(on release) and I don't care about Final Mix either, KH2 by itself was still and amazing game that caught the awe of many, lest you remember we didn't get Final Mix here in the states for years. So it was the original game that people loved, and Final Mix made it even better. KH3 just feel like a shill for disney. All i wanted to was some answers or hell, even proper closure, and I didn't even get that.",1548979406

Background: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years now, and lately things have been a little tense between us. We‚Äôve had fights and he‚Äôs asked for space multiple times(which I always try to give when he needs it) Last night after a rough fight (over text bc we‚Äôre both in school rn) I asked for space This was the convo: Boyfriend: I think I‚Äôm done trying 
Me: Done trying what? 
Boyfriend: Everything 
Me: Why? 
Boyfriend: just kind of done with everything if this is how it‚Äôs going to be all the time. 
Me: and how is that exactly? Boyfriend: who knows? Goodnight Me: ...you know five minutes no response 
Me: Hope you get some sleep, I‚Äôll be here. Probably crying, but I‚Äôll be here. 
Boyfriend: Get over it 
Me: üòÇYou‚Äôre unbelievable sometimes 
Boyfriend:Yup 
Me: truly unfckingbelievable sometimes... I hope you have a good rest of your night now. Boyfriend: I won‚Äôt. And I won‚Äôt be having a good week, or good month or year or life. But hey, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. 
Me: Well that‚Äôs your choice. I need some time and space to think, don‚Äôt expect much conversation from me after tonight. If there‚Äôs anything you want to say or get off your chest I suggest that you do it now. If not, again that‚Äôs your choice. 
Boyfriend: honestly, I couldn‚Äôt give you much more space at this point. If you need more we are done. 
Me: I love you, I care about you‚Ä¶ right now I‚Äôm hurt‚Ä¶ Not just from this, not just from you But from a lot. I know that I get clingy but when you asked for space I try my best to give it to you. I‚Äôm asking for you to do the same for me and give me space and time to think and heal. I‚Äôll always love you I just need a few days to recollect. 
Boyfriend:no Decide now I‚Äôm always hurt 
Me: wdym decide now? 
Boyfriend: i‚Äôm literally in a constant state of pain and no one gives a fck. Are you staying or going? 
Me: I care, I give a fck 
Boyfriend: you don‚Äôt though that‚Äôs the thing. You‚Äôre insensitive with everything I fcking feel.
 Me: I‚Äôm staying... i‚Äôm not leaving you, but like I said I need a little space. I‚Äôm staying and I do care. I‚Äôm not a good girlfriend or good in general but I care about you... more than anything. Can I ask why this is such a big problem? I‚Äôm really not trying to hurt you I just need some space to cool off. 
Boyfriend:you‚Äôre not getting any space. 
Me: and why‚Äôs that? 
Boyfriend: unless you think we should be done. Then you can have all the space you want alone. 
Me: I don‚Äôt want us to be done... Boyfriend: You sure? 
Me: yes I‚Äôm sure I want to be with you 
Boyfriend: Act like it.

Breakdown: Am I the asshole for asking for space in our relationship after a very nasty fight?
 P.s. sorry if I messed this up or if it‚Äôs too long.

Another easy clue is that you seem to think taxing 70% on income ABOVE 10 million will take 70% of what you earn, which mathematically could never be true no matter how much you made, it's literally impossible.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","You‚Äôre right that there are bubbles of fictitious capital however you fail to understand why those bubbles exist in the first place. In a free market, banks interest rates are decided by how much people are saving. The more people save and put money into a bank the lower interest rates will get and more loans will be given out to riskier enterprises because the banks have larger reserves. The opposite happens when savings gets low, interest rates rise and only low Risk people get loans. This equilibrium is destroyed when the federal reserve artificially lowers rates to stimulate fake economic growth because the feds low interest rates do not reflect the actual savings in the economy. As a result, tons of high risk loans are given out leading to misallocations and over speculation and when interest rates are hiked to reflect true savings in the market all these misallocations are liquidated resulting in the housing crashes. These bubbles keep on getting bigger and bigger as the fed keeps trying to keep our fake economy going. 

I am aware that toilet paper currency always loses its value all the way to hyperinflation and worthlessness. It is theft because it is a tax on savings. It is very hard to save money with inflation and cheap money because my savings loses buying power while a select few gain more buying power from the fed reserve. I did not consent to them devaluing my currency just like I never consented to my income being taxed. Just because a majority decided they want certain services does not mean they have a right to threaten me with force if I don‚Äôt want to give up my rightful property. If you have to force other people to pay for a good or service for you, do you really value and need that service? And unless you think Ponzi schemes work well, debt is a very big problem. You have to crazy to think people won‚Äôt want their money back. When people lose faith in the dollar all this debt is going to come crashing down on us. Capitalism is the solution to the problem.

It began on Friday, 2 April 1982, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands (and, the following day, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982, returning the islands to British control.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes good question 
As I said before, whenever the Israelites in antiquity offered a sacrifice, it couldn‚Äôt  just be any old animal. It had to be spotless. That was the only way it could be an acceptable sacrifice. And once again even after they made the sacrifice,  if they happened to sin again (which they will)  they would have to find another spotless animal over and over. 

This foreshadows Christ dying for our sins. No one is perfect , humans are sinners therefore another human being that is also imperfect  can‚Äôt die for all of our sins. That wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. 

The only way that we could have an eternal, never ending  sacrifice for our inevitable and endless sinful ways would be God himself dying for our sins in a fleshly form.  Christ was perfect and spotless, but only because he was God. 

God, incarnating  himself was literally the  only option for human salvation.
 During this time, because our depravity and endless willful sinning we would naturally deserve to die, Because sin simply resulted in death based on the old covenant. But God loved us so much that he didn‚Äôt want to just kill us all off , he  had to make away for us to be saved. 

The old covenant was NOT working. The Israelites in antiquity were supposed to be following the old covenant but would sin time and time again. It actually got to a point where they would purposely sin knowing that they could just sacrifice an animal right after. The old covenant showed that instead of focusing on the inward man and your spirit people would just focus on physical deeds just to look is though they were obeying God, but their hearts were really far from him. 

So to resolve the fact that Israel broke the old covenant along with the animal sacrifice that was required for sins, We then have the induction of the new covenant as well as the fact that Christ died for our sins (eternal sacrifice) ",1548979421

PS4 probably gets the least use, as it's just for exclusives, but it's still great.

I don't get any big AAA third party games like Doom on switch because of the resolution and performance issues, but any indies or bigger games that run fine like Okami I get on switch. 

Everything else I get on my Xbox. Of the 3 its most likely to have backwards compatibility with next gen, so having all my multiplats there makes sense. Plus it runs them best.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Yeah, just saying this attitude would have you believe that even pre-nerf, Telesto was trash because Luna beat it or traded or with it.

I don't see why ""recoil"" in general is a hot button issue. Specifically on TLW I can understand because it is *jarring* and takes a lot of skill to compensate for.

But...since when does console recoil have to be like PC recoil? They're two entirely different platforms. I think it's weird that PC guns often feel same-y and it eliminates the chase.

Like, when I watch Datto, his Go Figure is more accurate than my Blast Furnace. So why even grind for Blast Furnace then? But on console, Blast Furnace is significantly more accurate; guns have different recoil patterns can create a diverse loot pool and incentivize 'the chase' for good ones.

But on PC recoil is almost a non-issue so I don't even know why one would care which barrel option their Bygones has, or anything like that. Not to mention perks like Zen Moment and Firmly Planted probably do diddly shit on PC, which just makes worthwhile rolls even rarer.

PC has little recoil because it has no aim assist, console has recoil because we have a lot of aim assist and without recoil it would simply be too easy. (But you need aim assist because with 0 aim assist, even with 0 recoil it would be far too cumbersome to aim.)

Destiny was always praised for its gunplay, even when it was ONLY on console, so I don't know why suddenly the buttery-smooth gunplay isn't good enough on console anymore.

I think recoil in general is fine, and makes guns feel different, and can allow event guns to be better than guns that just drop anywhere in the world. Saying the recoil on TLW specifically is too high I can understand, but I don't think the release of TLW should spark some conversation to make the console experience like the PC experience when it comes to recoil.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","You don't really need to seek out a lot of recipes that are specificaly without onions as long as there are other strong flavors that form the basis of the recipe.  If you're looking for a replacement for onion rings, yes, you're going to have to do something pretty different (maybe deep fried zucchini fries).  But if you're looking to replace onion in a tomato sauce, the tomato flavor is going to be the dominant one, and omitting it won't be so noticeable, and there will be plenty of other flavors to give different variety (garlic, rosemary, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc).  So maybe a first tip is just look for recipes that focus on other vegetables or flavors.  

You can find some recipes indirectly by looking up recipes for low [FODMAPS](https://alittlebityummy.com/how-to-replace-onion-on-the-low-fodmap-diet/) diets because one of the things it excludes is onions (although they exclude many other things).  In Indian cooking, you can also look up Jain or ""satvik"" recipes, which should exclude the use of onions.

It feels goddamn good, and it feels more ""close"" than a condom.

What we *need* to focus on is male birth control like Vasalgel/RISUG. Safe, harmless methods of allowing men to temp sterilize themselves so they can make less risky choices about sex with other people.

Female birth control has serious side effects and not everyone can take it. Vasalgel, for instance, has no side effects, is totally safe, and is also far more reliable without needing a reapplication for about 10 years.

The debate between the rights of women and the rights of an unborn child (or whatever the fuck you want to call it) is a misnomer because men are carrying the sperm, the active ingredient. It's like taking medicine so you can eat raw chicken and not get salmonella instead of just cooking it first.

"RocketLeague","t5_30cz1","Well if you really wanna have it nearly the whole clip could have been better.

First you challenge the ball good but kinda jump over it and you also don't seem to dodge into the ball which would have made this 50-50 way better.

After the akward jump you try to get to the big boost pad (probably the right decision), but totally mess up and miss the pad with a bad dodge.

Now you get bumped around from the enemy guy and also don't hold drift to get back into the play faster.

Then you kinda flip into the wall which makes you even slower and then jump into the big boost pad like a headless chicken.

After the ball gets cleared I think you should actually chase after it, but you obviously mess up the challenge and kinda go over the ball, but that wasn't that bad.

From that position you obviously score a nice goal, which also tells me you should be good enough at aerialing and air rolls already and should instead work on positioning, rotating and also very important your ground mechanics, because in this short clip alone you messed up 3 times and could have been much faster if you maneuvered your car on the ground more efficiently.",1548979426

And what I‚Äôm saying is only having two primary weapons being competitive is a bad solution for balance. It‚Äôs not okay at the highest level on PC to have just two weapon options, and I don‚Äôt want that for console either, although I do agree bloom should be negated.

And again, how oppressive it is on PC is mainly at a high level (which I still don‚Äôt think is good) and not at all levels because there are a significant number of very low skill players who cannot effectively use it. On console, with more stability and less bloom, even the lowest level players would be able to effectively spam it.

40 AA compared to other weapons may not be crazy, but compared to normal shooters the bullet magnetism is absurdly high on all guns, and TLW is no exception.

The majority of players hitting .8 seconds means no weapon outside of Luna/NF can compete. There are no other competitive weapons that can hit that ttk even with all crits, which is insane. 

I think it‚Äôs not super healthy for PC to only have two weapons viable at the highest level, but thankfully most low skill players on Pc can‚Äôt use it effectively so it won‚Äôt permeate all skill levels like it would on console.

Seriously, removing stability will make it easy to use for even bad players on console, and that‚Äôs my issue. Even with the better stability most bad players on PC can‚Äôt use it effectively. ",1548979429

Let's start with a very basic chart.

What do you think of this:
https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/images/pubs-images/51846-coverlarge-figure.png

Specifically, note the trend from 1995 to 2013. Does that trend seem sustainable to you? Let's start there.

You said:

&gt;As a result, I assumed we were talking about the far future.

That's quite the assumption, based on that chart, no?

Let's dig into the report where that chart comes from (again...the CBO...a NON PARTISAN source of statistics on these kinds of things):

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51846

&gt;* The wealth of families at the 90th percentile of the distribution was 54 percent greater than the wealth at the 90th percentile in 1989, after adjusting for changes in prices.
* The wealth of those at the median was 4 percent greater than the wealth of their counterparts in 1989.
* The wealth of families at the 25th percentile was 6 percent less than that of their counterparts in 1989.



&gt;**The distribution of wealth among the nation‚Äôs families was more unequal in 2013 than it had been in 1989. For instance, the difference in wealth held by families at the 90th percentile and the wealth of those in the middle widened from $532,000 to $861,000 over the period (in 2013 dollars). The share of wealth held by families in the top 10 percent of the wealth distribution increased from 67 percent to 76 percent, whereas the share of wealth held by families in the bottom half of the distribution declined from 3 percent to 1 percent.**

Your entire ""argument"" is using current statistics while I'm simply trying to point out to you the **TREND** and what is happening unless we change something.",1548979429

Let me ask the question simply: Do you recognize that there‚Äôs a distinct difference between YouTube deleting content (and taking ad revenue) that legitimately violates the DMCA because the legal copyright holder has complained, and YouTube deleting content (and taking ad revenue) that doesn‚Äôt violate the DMCA because someone OTHER than the legal copyright holder (which may in fact be the same person who posted the content) has complained?",1548979429

He can patch up his Str problems by grinding Strike in 2-P, which is an inexpensive investment - only Marcia gets notable exp there. Seriously, S-strike Nealuchi compares pretty close with Ulki, who is not too shabby. He's the best laguz in 2-2 aside from vision problems, he's pretty strong in 2-E if you don't Haar-skip it (you probably are). He can make himself useful in Part 4 doing some chores, though his combat is pretty lousy unless you can get him to SS strike by the end of 2-E, which I think is something only I have bothered with in the whole world. 

Leanne - A rank. She's a heron, but her availability is poor and her song is awkward to use. IMO the worst of the three, but they're mutually exclusive so who even cares.

‚Ä¶Very well.

Rogue is a bit unique in that it has a very high skill ceiling (probably the highest of any melee), but it's also easy enough to get right that you don't have to be amazing to get decent ratings.

WW just has a lot going on, lots of keybinds for individual skills and a bunch of heals and buffs for your team. Lots of things to remember, and also the whole combo hit system feels a bit wonky until you get the hang of it.

Keep in mind, I'm not a WW player. I have an alt, so I'm just commenting based on what little I know about them. A real WW player can probably give you better advice, I just thought I'd point out that they are typically considered one of the more complex melee classes to play.",1548979430

"churning","t5_2vrf0","&gt;recent DPs of it working on the CSR? If your first flight is delayed 2 hours, but you miss your connecting flight and have to stay overnight, will Chase reimburse you for that?

Yes, FT has many DPs of claims being honored for CSR. FNBO Amex specifically calls out covering missed connections.

&gt; If I'm remembering correctly, Citi didn't actually update their terms and conditions for this use case; they just changed how they interpreted the T&amp;Cs.

You recall incorrectly - as of Jun 2018 they specifically call out missed connections

WHAT‚ÄôS NOT COVERED
Coverage does not apply under the following conditions:
The Covered Traveler(s) accepted an offer or coupon in exchange
for not boarding an overbooked flight.
The Covered Traveler(s) is delayed due to a missed connection of
their Common Carrier, **but the delay that caused the missed
connection does not meet the required time period of 6 hours**.
The Covered Traveler(s) is delayed due to being involved in or
under suspicion of any criminal act, illegal activities or disruptive/
abusive behavior.

&gt;The CSR also only covers spouses/domestic partners and dependent children under 22. So a fiance/gf/friend won't be covered either. 

You are right, but I was only pointing out that citi used to cover traveling companions but now they dont. 

It used to be (hands down) the best travel protection - I even wrote a post about it a couple of years ago! But I stand by what I said in my original comment - the benefit is now mediocre at best. It used to be the only card I book flights with (paid and award) but not anymore. ",1548979433

I agree with you that EPIC knows their engine inside and out. They create amazing games that are technological marvels and not only look great, but I know first hand that the people who work there on those systems are incredibly talented.

I'm talking about their decision making skills on how to support the game. How they choose to create and host events &amp; tournaments, the decisions they make when balancing the game (just because they balance frequently doesnt mean it's good), they frequently ask their community and influencers for feedback, then not only choose to ignore it, but they choose to ignore the feedback that's given on how to improve the decisions they're trying to make that their communities disagree with in the first place. (i.e. EPIC: so what do you think.  Community:we think you should do x, E: we aren't going to do x, we're going to do y what do you think.

* [https://www.asus.com/es/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-Strix-XG258Q/](https://www.asus.com/es/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-Strix-XG258Q/) \- The asus one, good, but I think it was a TN panel (anyway I heard that it was quite good anyway). A bit expensive, but good aesthetic if you like gaming style + it has 240hz instead of 144hz.  You also have the Zowie XL2540 as a cheaper and discrete version (but with really good reviews)
* [https://zowie.benq.com/en/product/monitor/xl/xl2430.html](https://zowie.benq.com/en/product/monitor/xl/xl2430.html)  TN panel, but cheaper, more discrete aesthetic and I have seen good reviews about it
* [https://zowie.benq.com/en/product/monitor/xl/xl2411p.html](https://zowie.benq.com/en/product/monitor/xl/xl2411p.html) same as above, it has a nice rating and it is cheap.
* [https://eu.aoc.com/es/gaming/products/c24g1](https://eu.aoc.com/es/gaming/products/c24g1) I couldn't find a good review about it, but looks fine, it has a VA panel and it is quite cheap.

That are some of the ones I could find for those prices, there are also some 27 inch versions, but remember the pixel reescaling. If you don't mind about it, go ahead if you want.

* For Ultrawide I have my eyes put on this one:  **LG 29UM69G-B** , since it is cheap and it seems to be quite good, with a nice ips panel (with some light bleeding, but that is a usual ips problem) but it has 75 hz. There is also a 34 inch version for around 350 (same problem as 27 inch fhd)
* **lg 34uc79g-b**. Same, but being a curved 34 inch version (same problem as 27 inch fhd) with 144 hz, but more expensive, around your max budget. 

And as 1440p:

* **MSI MPG27C:** I have seen some reviews and seems to be a nice monitor, but as any 1440 144hz, it is around 500.
* **AOC AG322QC4** and   **AG322QCX**. These are curved and 32"", which is actually huge, but they are nice monitors with a nice aesthetic, being the AG322QC4 (based on the reviews) the best of those 2. They are around 500 but I think that the  AG322QCX is a bit cheaper since it is an older model.  Both VA panels with 144hz.

Remember that for 1440p you will need to update your gpu card before or at the same time, or else it will be useless for gaming in a 1440p monitor.

These are all the monitors I could fine by now. I am also interested in some of them, since I was planning to buy one alongside an rtx 2060. I hope it helps a bit, anyway, I encourage you to research a bit by yourself. ""If you want something done right, do it by yourself"" Since it is your money and your taste, you are the one choosing, but for 300-500 you should be able to get a very nice TN  panel or a good VA panel. The problem of IPS panels is that they are so slow that gaming ones are really expensive, added to the fact that a lot of them include G-Sync, which makes them even more expensive.

I always find it curious that people assume the only good lists are the ones that place top 3 or so in the biggest tournaments. 

Metas matter and the vast majority of players that come here are not playing in or at that kind of level. Basically, there's lists out there that will work just fine where reaching two stacks is possible based on that player's meta. Make sense? 

Let's go further just in case. Right now the top tier meta consists of a lot of anti-tank stuff because of knights. This of course may change with the recent CA and the GSC release coming out. 

So, a list that has a lot of anti-tank would make sense, if you were playing at that level and against those kinds of opponents. The average player will likely not always be in that kind of situation and therefore their meta matters to their list building. Make sense? 

Assuming that a competitive list only fits within the realm of what you see online and in major tournaments is folly. 

&gt; To make it easier to hit with other units?

No. How this unit works within the rest of the codex is what I am talking about. You're looking through a keyhole and you've spotted something on the other side that looks appealing to you but you have no idea how the thing you are looking at fits within the room itself. 

So it's premature to suggest that it's amazing, at least within the context of the codex that ***isn't even out yet***. This of course is normal human behavior.

"monsterhunterrage","t5_3a2f0","That's very much an understandable point.

I guess for Tremors, it pretty much that the monster tries to actively tremor you rather than hit you. Uragaan's Chinslam and Deviljho's Stomp speak for that. I think they wanted to establish a certain balance, take damage or deal with downtime if you can't dodge it properly. With high damage monsters, you most likely are going to heal anyway if you get hit, which also causes downtime and is often a lot worse then getting tremored, because you already took damage and have to retreat..

Windpressure is a bit different. Fuck Kusha's Windpressure because you need to kill it firs to negate it, because if you don't, you have a ""great"" time melee'ing it.

Luna's windpressure is due to her way of spreading fire. It's kinda a necessary evil because otherwise it wouldn't make sense how she can spread her flames without it affecting you, because in case you didn't notice, the firespreadying only does damage from the blue flames she puts on the ground or when she breathes the fire for this attack onto one of the blue flames. The attack itself is meant to keep you in place for not dodging properly and take damage from the blue flames.

Similar things go for the Lunanove, but getting hit by Windpressure there basically garantuees a hit. At least you can stay down to avoid further damage here.",1548979437

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Tell a story that everyone lives to hate but is already sick of hearing:

A documentary on how an over privileged kid from Queens took an economics degree from a private school and a successful localized family business and parlayed it into a real estate empire.

Drone on endlessly about how he continued to dig his fingers into the pockets of Americans by contributing to the inflation of the real estate bubble. Highlight the cunning required to restructure debt through barely legal tactics by bankrupting multiple companies while maintaining personal wealth.

Throw in some gratuitous sex by reinforcing the fact that money can indeed buy happiness in the form of a former  Czechoslovakian model.

Delve into light-hearted comedy with the realization that one can still end up as a television personality known to most every American household even if you are bereft of anything resembling a personality or good looks.

Start building some drama by watching as this real estate mogul gains favor among the rich and powerful through strategically placed hotels throughout the world and their lavish accomodations. Fast forwarding through years of business deals and interactions with the world's richest as well as the most influential ones.

Build towards a climax not by following this individuals gradual tour of civil duty to the people but by watching a guns blazing, toupee flailing, lets-make-this-country-great-again-even-though-in-reality-it-was-cutthroat-self-serving-people-like-me-who-have-continually-lobbied-for-changes-that-made-it-less-great-in-the-first-place campaign rigamarole that will go down in history as one of funniest things the rest of the world ever watched America do to itself.

After stealing the countries top position by focusing all his energy into making the other ""real"" politicians look as bad as humanly possible by flaunting their indiscretions, regardless of whether they were right or wrong and the fact that they didn't actually have any real negative repurcussions, to a captivated public audience eager to make America great again we can finally start the final act.

We'll watch whimsically as he sends a steady stream of his well-known cohorts to do things that no individual with a strong moral compass and a 6th grade education would believe they were qualified to do. One after another they will do things to erode the values, beliefs, and benefits of every facet of government office by defiantly doing whatever they please regardless of public sentiment. Some will actually be punished for their individual failures to subvert the post to which they were appointed but the media will have no time to portray this to the public who unwittingly helped set it in motion because the next lunatic will already be lined up for the job and everyone's heads will be spinning while trying to follow the shell game.

Finally reaching a climax we'll see an event that tops even Roosevelt's threat to make some show of force by sailing his Navy around the world until they ran out of supplies unless the government funded his grandstanding completely and made sure they had the ability to make the entire trip. This man who got to where he was by worrying about his wallet and nobody elses will now shut down specific parts of the government for a record amount of time, indefinitely if need be, to force funding of a wall. Not a cool wall to protect a nation from invading mongal raiding parties but a medium sized wall to keep out a menace nontheless. This menace of people looking for a great country but not following proper procedures. A menace that is really only a menace because years of political ineptitude and agenda misdirection has built a flawed system which allows them to thrive in a country that isn't their own.

Quickly we pull away from the madness to wonder... If he doesn't get his wall will the menace still find a great country to mooch off of when they cross it's borders or will the ramifications of the standoff ripple on for years only to be viewed by the public as the fault of whomsoever happens to be in charge when the problem is finally known to all?

Fade to Black with the unanswered question if whether or not impeaching this imbecile and ejecting his cronies can really fix the problem. Is it the fault of those like him who have come before and will certainly continue to come after to reap the benefits of being in power or is it the fault of the system for allowing him to play his dastardly game just because nothing says he cant?

Yes... write your own ending.

2.44% a year? You‚Äôre getting fucked you can follow the indexes and make more.

Also can you help me with the estate tax where you believe only 2000 people are effected? According to that link, there are over 1m households with over 10m? You seem to know your stuff thanks. 

Also, the dems are attempting to expand it. 

The bill would raise $2.2 trillion by applying the tax to the riches of ""the top 0.02 percent of Americans,"" according to Sanders' office. It would apply to the estates of those who inherit more than $3.5 million, compared to the $11 million threshold that exists now.

So the number of effected Americans would be

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","&gt; Like what you said, since it was fine before, 

I mean, it got nerfed because it was too strong at max level (according to RumHam despite win rates and popularity not backing up that assertion, but even if I didn't get to play with it I can see that... which is why I was levelling it)

&gt; and it got buffed as well,

Only for tournament standard players.  The players who levelled freeze for ladder got a nerf.

&gt; it definitely needs a nerf

Yeah just fuck my investment, two rounds of nerfs for Ladder Freeze despite it being underrepresented by usage rate and win rate.

&gt; It resurfaced and people started crying out for a rework

I can't say I saw any of this crying out, seemed fairly random as it wasn't like freeze decks were dominating top of ladder (like I don't know if I saw any in the top 50 last time I checked pre-nerf)

&gt; it‚Äôs never been balanced on either spectrum. Weak or Strong.

Might be the only thing you've written so far that I've agreed with, but considering how I've adapted to choosing my cards based on how Supercell says they evaluate balance decisions (usage rate and win rate), it's rather frustrating to choose to level a card because Supercell's public decision making process says it won't be nerfed (because it had reasonable usage/win rates) and then for it to get double nerfed while other actual meta-dominating cards get ignored... is pretty annoying.",1548979441

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Not a dumb question at all! Elimination diets are common if baby is having tummy troubles as the first thought is that it's due to an intolerance or allergy. Dairy and soy are the most common triggers, and sensitivities they can generally grow out off. Their digestive systems are just so immature that they can be super sensitive.

So for me, I cut out dairy a couple weeks ago (my son is 5 weeks) to see if the lack of dairy (lactose) will help him. I had a very dairy heavy diet, just some of my favorite foods haha. Within another week we should know if it'll help him as it'll definitely be out of my system by then and thus not transferring to him. Soy tends to take an additional week or so.

A lot of women cut both at once if they believe it's a true milk protein allergy, as generally that will go hand in hand with a soy allergy. I was not advised that would be the case as my son isnt having bloody or mucus stools. He is/was having issues with a lot of gas that seems super painful to him and trou le pooping though. Which is why his pediatrician and the lactation consultant both suggested the dairy free trial (as there is not downside to him, just me missing cheese and milk!).

"u_Kaufkins","t5_saspd","Before coming into class, I do not feel like I had a large grasp on what folklore was or even had a hard-set idea as to what it is. In general, I felt like folklore had to do with trends and that it was typically associated with the ‚Äúold‚Äù, ‚Äúancient‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomary‚Äù, or ‚Äútraditional‚Äù. My opinion has definitely broadened and changed now. However, I did not have a preconceived notion on who these ‚Äúfolk‚Äù were. I was quite surprised reading that many people associate the folk with the ‚Äúlower class‚Äù or even ‚Äúnon-literate‚Äù. I believe that all ‚Äúfolk‚Äù or individuals have some sort of ‚Äúfolklore‚Äù that is tied to them. Even those who are ‚Äúelite‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh class‚Äù have traditions or ways of living. The readings and videos clarified my ideas of folklore and the folk if not challenged it. The readings went through a lot of examples of folklore that I did not previously think about. Folklore seems to be in almost about everything and between everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found the essay by Alan Dundes ‚ÄúFolklore as a Mirror of Culture‚Äù to be very interesting. This was all about how we can evaluate different aspects of folklore especially in children‚Äôs folklore to see things that reflect upon the culture. This does not surprise me but really puts a deep reason and meaning for studying folklore. Also, the video put this in to perspective as well. Folklore can help us understand ourselves, each other, and our culture better. One question I do have is how much do we as ‚Äúfolk‚Äù influence our own ‚Äúfolklore‚Äù and how much can or has it effected our folklore groups? Can one person influence an entire group by sharing new traditions/folklore? ",1548979443

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","Let's say I have a fairly high limit on my auto insurance policy for injury or property damage. $300,000 maybe. There are certainly auto accidents which exceed that limit. Maybe I caused a bus full of people to crash, or a car carrier loaded with luxury cars. What happens next after my policy is maxed out? They sue me for all my assets until I'm bankrupt. 

Let's say I have a major illness or injury and maxes out my health insurance. What happens next? They leave me to die. 

There are too many medical cases now where the cost is just prohibitive to private insurance. That doesn't mean there's no place for private insurance to supplement M4A. But I don't see any cases where it can replace it, without having many situations where people are left holding the bag. And when that happens, either the government is going to end up paying for it anyways, or the person is going to suffer and/or die. 

I understand that this is a complicated problem, and we've spent decades digging ourselves into this hole. But for that very reason we shouldn't be looking at half measures that just mean we have to revisit the problem again and again. ",1548979443

When people say 'racism' the listener automatically thinks white on &lt;enter ethnicity&gt; and racism against whites doesn't even exist in their mind. The term 'reverse racism' forces the listener to think outside that box. It's the same with sexism where the generally accepted opinion is that men are sexist and women are victims and never the reverse. The term 'reverse sexism' forces the listener to consider that which is not generally accepted. 

On the other hand, it's important to just say 'sexism' so that people eventually learn that it can happen to men and that women can be perpetrators as well. ",1548979443

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Read your loan contract **very carefully** to discover your options on early payment of the principal. Installment loans and revolving-credit loans are not the same.

In most installment (car) loans, the entire amount of the interest is added to the loan when the loan is granted. This is the reason you see people buy a car worth $15,000 but have a loan of much more than $15,000. In many installment loans, paying early does not reduce the principal, it merely defers payments.

So if you pay double your normal payment this month, the lender will say that you don‚Äôt have to pay next month‚Äôs payment ‚Äî you already paid it. If you continue to pay extra, you will shorten the amount of time you‚Äôre paying but you won‚Äôt reduce the cost of the loan (the interest).

This practice is normally different for mortgages, by the way, even though they are a form of installment loan. In most cases, you *can* make extra payments on principal.

Credit cards, and other revolving-credit loans, work differently. If you pay more on the principal, you end up paying less finance charge because your payment is calculated on the remaining balance. You still must make a payment the following month.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Finnegan's Wake. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Irish pub traditions most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Mr. Porter's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Giambattista Vico literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Finnegan's Wake truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mr. Porter's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Giambattista Vico's Italian epic Scienza nuova. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as James Joyce's genius unfolds itself on their book pages. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a James Joyce tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Can you choose not to have children? Because I could use your help in convincing others that it is foolish to choose to have a child when you can barely afford to support yourself. Another commenter gave the example of a guy making $20K with a family to support. You should tell them that this example should just choose to make $102 million.

Again, this is all fantasy talk. Yes, I wish everyone in the world made great decisions. Yes I wish there were no bad parents. Yes I wish that all children brought into the world had the basic necessities to to live. But that's not going to get us anywhere. We can work to cut down on those things (I agree) but there will always be those kids we need to take care of. Also, not everyone everyone $20k with a family is a fuck up. Circumstance out of your control from time to time can do a number on you.  

&gt;I would still be paying more than someone earning by paying the same rate. That is the power of math.

Here's the thing, I'm not rich but make a decent joint income $160k+ range and have no kids. The taxes I pay seem fair enough, and I'm able to live a completely comfortable lifestyle. And that's even with the $1.3k student loans I pay monthly. I know that even if I triple my income I'm still really only going to be increasing my taxes by like less than &lt;8% which doesn't seem to be a big problem (if I'm already comfortable, and I triple that, well I'm going to be super comfortable). So I don't worry much about taxes. 

So all in all where I'm getting at with this rant is for people who are making $10 million annually, and have to worry about their additional $10 million being taxed at 70%, I really don't have any room in my mind to care. I really don't care. Call me selfish, inconsistent, but to be perfectly honest I don't care. I'm just being honest and straightforward with you. 

So for me it's hard to continue this debate - so to speak - because at the end of it I can't fathom (in my world) why I should spend any time worrying about this. If they pass it - great - there's now more money for infrastructure, etc. If they don't - great - whatever. 

Not trying to come off as rude, just laying out my thoughts in a very candid way.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I wouldn't say it's a necessity, per se. Few, if any, other card games have a universal set of cards that are always standard. That's unheard of. A solution to keep both camps happy, in my opinion, would be to rotate standard and classic card sets to a more wild-like format. I think restricting gameplay to basically two game modes (one rotating excluding solo adventures) is the killer. Players who can't afford the newest cards need a mode. But that mode should not also be the same mode as the conventional standard. I think diversifying number of game modes would help, something along the lines of a more advanced filter system, creating an ability to filter out certain blocks and agree to only search for players who want to use the same blocks of cards would help.",1548979446

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","You made that distinction between hetero and homosexual relationship, no one else did in the chain above. I have no dog in this myself as I don't care too much about the romance sub-plots but what I see a lot is the people who are for Bumblebee have made it so much about it being a homosexual relationship. I'm all for homosexual or bi representation in media but not every detraction has to be a implied homophobia. What makes you think that the comment about the relationship being more natural has anything to do with it being heterosexual? 

I don't think it's about either one of them even being better than the other as a relationship. The way I understand it is they were rather heavy handed with the cues for Sun and Blake and a lot more subtle about Yang and Blake until volume 6. So of course it makes sense for Eclipse to feel more like the natural and expected ship. Doesn't mean it's a bad thing it didn't end up that way though, subverting expectation makes certain things interesting too.

Pretty popular but there's a similar sort of thing that happens in Legend of Korra. Korra initially has a first interest that's fairly in your face then later a more subtle romance. The key difference is there's a lot more time devoted to it as a whole and the first romance is actually explored and concluded.  ",1548979446

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","My first thought is that without all the dual lands, I'd suggest going either just Orzhov or Dimir.  The challenge with 3-color is to reliably hit your required land/colors so that you can cast things like a turn 2 Thought Eraser or a turn 4 Contempt. Hitting removal when you need it is often critical to winning control games.

Dawn + Fountain is a favorite combo of mine. Though if you want to run that combo, I also suggest 4x each. This way you have a greater chance of a turn 1 fountain and a turn 2 dawn. This can really help generate card draw against control decks, or incidental life gain/chump blocks against aggro.

[[ Cry of the Carnarium ]] is a better version of Golden Demise. I also generally only run 1-of since its utility is a bit limited.

I like [[ Absorb ]] better than Sabotage for incidental life gain against aggro decks.

[[ Search for Azcanta ]] is imho a must-have for Esper because of the targeted card draw it provides.

[[ Precognitive Perception ]] I prefer over Chemister's. As a mid-game refuel, it's been clutch for me in many instances coupled with the triple scry.

Seraph of the Scales and Ethereal Absolution seem out of place. Seraph dies to a lot of removal and doesn't really punch for a lot of damage. Chromium is often the single flier of choice for an Esper deck. Ethereal absolution can combo nicely with dawn, but that's where I'd run multiple dawns but only a single absolution. Otherwise it's an expensive card that may have little to no value against control decks.

I'd probably only run at most two Eldest Reborns. Mortify is worth having four-of.

This is the current Esper control deck I'm running. It might give you some ideas: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1624217

The irony is delicious.

&gt;Provocations aren't provocations so long as they're coming from ""Your team"". When an assault/murder occurs, like the republican baseball team attack or the Dallas police attack, and it's undeniably politically motivated by the left, you're forced to play mental gymnastics to deny association. 

Actually this kind of bad behavior is [immediately condemned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/30/pelosi-condemns-violent-actions-of-antifa-protesters/?utm_term=.184bfe10f340) by the left. We don't deny it, we address it. This includes sexual crimes. Remember Al Franken and Anthony Weiner? What are they doing now?

You can scream ""bOtH sIdEs"" all you want, but it's pretty clear Democrats TRY to take the high road.

And do you REAAAAAAAAAALLY want to use the ""mental gymnastics"" line, when Trump has an active conspiracy theory group dedicated to picking apart his dumb ass lines and spinning to actually mean something ""deep"" or impressive?

I have no problem with conservatives, half my fam and a few of my friends have different ideas on things. But for the most part, they all know Trump is a moron, and the folks who voted for him regret it. He's making everyone on the right look like shit. 

And yeah, some clowns on the left are going to start calling everybody Nazi's or whatever. I don't condone it, but I get why they say it, in a very simplistic mindset. I also understand you guys being cheesed about it. That fucking sucks.

"OurPresident","t5_3hhj5","There has long been dissent on the left. This is nothing new. It's just that the left has finally said ""fuck it. Fuck the corporatists"" - which is something that the Democratic Party was not ready to deal with. They could deal with losing a big percentage of the working class as long as they could get to 50%+1 on the back of social issues. Now that it's apparent that the proles are pissed off, there's been a rush to the left. 

The problem is that the party has lost much of it's credibility over the last 20 years or so. B. Clinton was an obvious corporatist who signed into law legislation that consolidated media into the hands of a few corporations, threw billions at telecommunications companies on the promise of cheap internet which never came, and sold  us all out to Wall Street. Monica Lewinsky wasn't the only person to suck a dick in the White House. Bill was hard on that banker cock for the entirety of his presidency. 

Next up was Barack Obama, who promised to gut the surveillance state (he expanded it and hammered whistle blowers), get us out of the ME wars we were already involved in (expanded bombing), reign in health care costs (mission accomplished for some - absolute ass fucking for others), Hope &amp; Change (and refused to prosecute Wall Street bankers for their actions leading up to the banking crisis of 2008). He did some good. He kept us out of a depression. He passed Dodd-Frank....and that was about it. 

Then they gave us Hillary - another corporatist. 

Why should working class voters vote for Democrats? Voting for Democrats doesn't do the working class any good. Voting for Republicans doesn't do the working class any good. Basically, if you're working class you are little more than a wealth generation unit for your betters (in the eyes of both parties). 

However, the loss of 2016 forced the Democratic party to at least try to regain the voters they lost. Better than what they have done since 1992. ""What are you going to do? Vote for him?""",1548979450

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","I have a solution to the private prison problem that I mentioned earlier. Real talk, this shit would work. 

New prison system based on GOOD economics

* Public option - prisoners get to attend a government-run prison
* Private option - prisoners can choose to attend a private prison of their choice
* The government gives yearly payments to the private prison that are some x% less than they would have spent on the prisoner
* Prisoners cannot be rejected from the public option

We have guaranteed minimum standards through the public option. Additionally, if the private prisons get too good, the voucher amounts can just be lowered in the following year. Also, if the private prisons are too bad, the prisoner can just opt to be transferred to a public prison. Information asymmetries when  picking the prisons can be dealt with through Yelp; prisoners will probably upload reviews of their prison like they [already do](https://www.correctionsone.com/arrests-and-sentencing/articles/470910187-Top-10-funniest-prison-and-jail-reviews-on-Yelp/), so information asymmetries won't be any higher than restaurants or hotels. Additionally, having multiple private prisoners competing for labor will help reduce the monopsony power and thus raise wages.

My first high cbd strain I've ever smoked, 19% cbd. It smelled very fresh like outdoor bud with a nice citrus/earthy sweetness. Smoked a little over a gram and it was so smooth even when taking huge bong hits. The taste is sweet/earthy with a hint of citrus and I didn't feel high or buzzed in the slightest but rather an uplifting,clear headed, relaxed sensation. No foggyness or burnout afterwards. Also has a decent amount of trichomes within the buds.

Thats not 7th street its 7th avenue.   

You cant make a left turn onto 7th avenue.  

You can only make a left turn into Van Buren or a Right turn onto 7th avenue.  

I dont drive down Grand so i dont know how backed up it gets.  Because that is a large intersection i can only assume that the lights will take longer to cycle. That problably means it will still bottleneck because the distance where it splits from 1 to 3 lanes doesnt stretch very long looks like its only about 300 feet. At most it can accomodate about 20 cars before it backs up again onto one lane.  

Either that or people want to get on the furthest most left lane because they need to make an immediate left after entering into van buren, cant really blame them for that.  ",1548979453

* Second even if the top bracket is lower in the rest of the countries the taxes on all their income before that 10 milllionth dollar would be higher. In fact the article about Scandinavian countries is all about how flat the taxes are. So no it doesn't make sense for a someone to move a 20 million dollar income when the taxes when all money earned between 600000 and million would be taxed at 50% rather than 37%

you're also missing the importance of wealth distribution. With incomes less skewed more of the national income makes its way to the average earner thus increasing the effective tax rate most people would pay relative to what they'd pay in the US.

Fiona cycling through fuck buddy after fuck buddy, somehow buying a building even though they were supposed to be poor as dirt. 

Ian cycling through obnoxious boyfriend after obnoxious boyfriend and then that gay jesus shit, or acting like he didn't give a shit about Mickey. At least they ended it well enough with Mickey and him technically getting a happy ending, and he isn't going away for 10 years. 

If the two worst storylines that they have no idea what to do with or how to write are gone, even if the actors were good, then maybe it might improve? Especially with less plotlines to focus on, since I think we can all agree that the show started it's decline when they weren't focusing on a group plotline but rather individual plots for all of them since they'd separated and moved out of the Gallagher house for a while. Now they're all back in that house so the plots can potentially start including them all as a family again. 

Probably not though. This is Showtime we're talking about.

The actual number is probably in the range of 500,000 or more. Also the 30k number includes suicides. I don‚Äôt believe suicide is a gun issue but many do so I included it. The number without suicides is 15,180 people accidentally shot per year. So the actual numbers are more like 500k to 15k.

"Headsets","t5_2whr0","I got my  philips l2bo today. Using it with a vmoda boompro mic. Had it on last few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I picked it.

I used a Razer Kraken headset for the last year. That was decent. Sound was good enough to not think I was missing anything. Mic was clear enough. The headset is *really* tough. The earcups are a solid plastic, but they swivel a little in an aluminum ring that extends up to the headband. the headband is a nicely padded metal band, and the chunky end of it that the earcups slide into is also metal. I used it for work, and then for play - so daily use probably surpassed sleeping. The control box started giving trouble - I mean using it on conference calls daily for a year wears things down. I'll say this about it - I have big ears and a big head. That headset is so freaking comfortable - I'd have a 6 hour call with people that do nothing but raise stress levels, and then relax watching something else still wearing them.

So I had a couple criteria for headphones. I wanted something that sounded good (noticeably better at least), and was comfortable. I wanted it to be as sturdy as my Kraken or more so, with a replaceable cable. Less plastic, more metal. In the end it was choosing between Master and Dynamic MH40 and the Philips L2BO. The Philips has better feedback on comfort with a big head, and there's more reviews on quality, and enough to confirm it's almost all metal.

So far enjoying the last few hours. Here's a few reviews that swayed me: [https://soundreview.org/audio/headphones/philips-l2bo-fidelio-headphones-review/](https://soundreview.org/audio/headphones/philips-l2bo-fidelio-headphones-review/)

"JonBenetRamsey","t5_2s3pg","There were zero doors unlocked. There were zero windows open that someone could fit through. John Ramsey told three different police officers on the 26th that he personally checked all windows and doors and that they were secure. He told his friend, John Fernie, that he had checked all doors and windows that morning. Patsy Ramsey told LHP at JBR funeral, that all the doors and windows were secured and locked. She asked Patsy was she sure the south patio door was locked and she said she was sure. These are facts of the case. Only later, did John change his story in his interviews. When the Ramseys took out an ad about notches of wood that were made on the south patio door, Barbara Fernie called them out and said that Patsy had already told her that those marks were made previous to the murder.

JOHN RAMSEY: Yeah. And when I went down and looked around the house that morning, and I think I‚Äôd 
made a statement or at least I read, I know I said this, that all the doors were locked and I had checked, I believe, every door on the first floor. And they were, appeared to be locked.

STEVE THOMAS: So the morning of the 26th do you recall checking all the doors, and they were locked?

JOHN RAMSEY: I believed I checked all the first-floor doors, yeah. I did go out once. I went out to the door 
that leads into the garage to see if it was locked because there‚Äôs a bunch of boxes piled in front of it and you couldn‚Äôt get to it from the inside of the garage. So I did in fact go out of the house once, which would have been for, you know, half a minute.

Second, if someone was a republican, they support republican beliefs, but don‚Äôt support their ‚Äúpro life‚Äù belief, does that mean they can‚Äôt be a republican? No. There is more to religion than priests raping and molesting children. If you can‚Äôt see that then you must be the one turning a blind eye.  Also how am I turning a blind eye? I‚Äôve told you my take on it, if it was legal I would probably kill them myself. I‚Äôve got 0 sympathy for child sex offenders but like I said, there‚Äôs more to religion than that. And in terms of where god was when the children were being molested, (this is going to be in the eyes of a religious person, so feel free to skip over and continue to flame me) God sees all. He sees good, he sees bad. Those priests, who expect a free ticket to heaven, will most likely go to hell for their actions. But god cannot step in every single time someone is in pain, even if they may be religious. He died for our sins once, and he is leaving us (for the most part) to live our life with minimal help, until we reach the afterlife. 

Look. I get where you‚Äôre coming from, I really do. But I‚Äôve said it twice and I‚Äôll Say it again, in my own life, I‚Äôve had prayers answered. More than once.

Instead, I‚Äôll address the points that are worth addressing. 

Can I quit a job that requires me to wear a uniform? Of course. To not quit that job is consenting to wear the uniform. Don‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt have a choice in the matter. 

You say ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just get to do whatever you want and damn everyone else. That‚Äôs not how society works‚Äù. Of course that‚Äôs how society works! You get to do whatever you want, as long as you do not hurt those around you. And you know what? Society is MUCH better because of it.

Is it selfish? If it is, I do not care. There is no compelling reason that says that I should put your well-being before mine. That‚Äôs not to say that I want to hurt you. But, I don‚Äôt owe you anything either (other than a commitment to let you live your life). 

I would argue that the very best version of humanity is a collection of individuals trying to take care of themselves first while not intentionally harming those around them. 

And to address the point about ‚Äúnot hurting those around you‚Äù as it pertains to vaccines. To not inject oneself with vaccines is not the same as ‚Äúmurdering‚Äù somebody. It is also not the same as going out of your way to harm another person, like shooting them or stealing from them. That argument is beyond ridiculous.

NATURE is the wrong-doer here... not people.  The world has always had diseases. If you can protect yourself from them, great... more power to you. But, nobody has a right to be protected against nature. And as such, you cannot hold others responsible for not protecting you from it. ",1548979464

Also added a new ALG lightning bow trigger to get rid of the old mushy one. Wood isn‚Äôt too beat up and I like the faded appearance in some spots. 

It took a fair bit of modification to get it to fit. Everything was too large so had to sand for a few hours to fit all the pieces. Sling point on the stock is so rusted I couldn‚Äôt get it off but it is sturdy so it is staying. Really like the new vintage look of the wood more than the stock WASR blonde

The core concept came from starting a campaign with two brand new players, who are super nerdy and very good actors but a liiiiittle bit shy. I wanted them to feel safe and encouraged roleplaying however they wanted, and wanted to set the tone to roleplay however, play a very traditional fantasy RPG character or go silly. The character is, therefore, on the surface a very stereotypical badass rogue character. Ex-military, wears a duster, cool fantasy name (Bannicallon Deake), doesn't talk much, drinks and smokes too much, private eye. RPing him is stereotypical Tough Guy Loner. The twist is those false identities, particularly Jarvis Tuntwhistle, who tend to be over-the-top ridiculous (ideally funny). Jarvis basically acts like somebody turned one of the Queen's pet Corgis into a germaphobic control freak, and then gave that person a very minor position of bureaucratic power. Clearly Deake has some secret theatrical ambitions he's channeling into his work.

Two more bits of mechanical cheese:

Suggestion is great out of combat, but with Magical Ambush it might be even better *in* combat. Under the right circumstances and in the right hands, it's considerably better than a save-or-die. Tell the pirate First Mate that the Captain is holding out on fair shares of the loot, he would make a better Captain anyway and it's time for him to take his rightful place as Captain, and we'll fight with him along with any of the crew that joins him. He gets *one* Saving Throw, and he makes it with Disadvantage, and then he's yours for 8 hours (or until you or your party damage him), no saving throws every turn or anything. Turns out, tons of BBEGs treat their minions poorly enough that there's often a reasonable way to ask them to switch sides. It's basically Dominate Person, but with 480 times longer duration. And for a 2nd level spell instead of a 5th level spell. With one single save, instead of a save every time they take damage. That they have disadvantage on, instead of advantage.

There are various ways your DM can shut this down, so you might want to ask in advance how your DM rules ""reasonable"" as well as confirm that Suggestion can be cast from hidden in order to proc Magical Ambush, but it is *very fun* when it works. Hell, I've allowed players to use Suggestion in combat by suggesting ""hey so if you fight us we're going to kill you. So. . .  fuck off or join up."" I was about to nope it, but the player made the *completely reasonable* argument that they're the player characters and my dude was just an NPC, so chances are the worst he was gonna do was use up party resources on the way to the *real* BBEG, his boss, so by far his best chance at survival was joining the party to help kill his boss, after which he could live happily ever after. Totally meta, but points for creativity.

&amp;#x200B;

You also might want to consider making Haste one of your non-Illusion non-Enchantment spells, cuz it's *real good* on a Rogue. Even better if somebody else in your party who's less likely to lose Concentration casts it on you. You use the extra action that Haste gives you to make an attack and proc Sneak Attack, then you use your regular action to Ready an Action, under the conditions basically amounting to ""as soon as it isn't my turn anymore, I make a weapon attack against a creature."" It doesn't combo with Booming Blade, but getting Sneak Attack twice in a round (it can be used once *per turn*) moooore than makes up for it.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","The local Porsche dealership I visited is actually really cool about it. I'm an average-looking and fairly young-looking Asian guy in his early 20's. Definitely don't give off the vibe of being wealthy.

But the few times I've visited to see their showrooms, I was always treated extremely nicely. One of my visits, I pulled up in my 86 and the salesperson that greeted me said something like ""Hey, that's a boxer right? Fits right in!"". Said he liked what I've done to my car, and he guessed that I was a Cayman fan (he was right). Told him I'd love to check out the GTSes that they had there, let me sit in them and everything. Even asked me if I wanted to take one of their used '13 or '14ish Caymans around the block.

But while I was shopping for my 86, I was briefly considering the WRX/BRZ, and the two Subaru dealers I visited treated me like I wasn't worth their time at all. First one, I drove a 2011 Civic Si at the time which I told them I intended to trade in. They had me wait for 30+ minutes to get their four-squares worksheet guy to lowball me, and after I gave them the margins I wanted (which I later got at a Toyota dealership the same day), the guy actually laughed and said ""nah, we're not getting anywhere close"". Second Subaru dealership salesperson immediately opened with ""You here alone? You look young, bud"" with this patronizing grin on his face. Immediately left. I have found a better Subaru dealership nearby though that I take my 86 to for parts since they have FA20 parts more readily available.

So all-in-all, it's really a dealership-by-dealership basis rather than by the brand. I'd say go and check them out, you'll at least be able to look at the cars there, if not sit in them. Not a bad way to spend some free time.",1548979466

It's been less than a decade and you're saying people don't remember? This comment thread is proof people remember. OP isn't just talking about the gay person coming out as gay in a straight relationship. OP this talking about everyone else attached to that facade who is hurting as well. Nothing wrong or to do about being gay and open with yourself. The struggles of the past aren't what OP is talking about at all. It's the struggles of the present they're talking about and how shitty of a thing to do to someone when they built their life around you only to be abandoned. That abandonment feeling that gay people had from their loved ones when they were struggling? It was just passed to their ex partner and OP is saying it isn't right. Not that the struggles are forgotten, just that it's equally shitty to build a life on a lie only to pull the tablecloth from underneath it and hurt others. 

That's not to say the gay person in the relationship should suffer and be miserable just for ""normality"" sake. Communication and being open is better, and is better for the gay person in the relationship feel at least they can talk about it. Do you, be happy, be free, but also handle your responsibility as a partner in a relationship that you started. Owning that responsibility is bigger than being straight or gay, happy or depressed, etc etc. 

My view my be a little askew, I'm bi and haven't had it affect any of my relationships in that way, and I can imagine coming out as bi vs coming out as gay is 100% different. I just don't think anyone has forgotten what you're saying, and now that it isn't like that anymore their are these kinds of conversations opening up all over.

Unions will seek what is called a Collective Bargaining Agreement, where all of the employee benefits, salaries, hours of work, disciplinary measures (etc) are negotiated by the union as a collective on behalf of all of its members.

Workers benefit because if a single worker is asking for benefits, the company can just fire that person. But they can't fire their entire staff at once. The union can also go on strike as a means of forcing the company to agree to things.

Companies don't want workers to unionize because it's easier for the company to deal with employees one-on-one than to have to deal with a unionized workforce.",1548979469

/u/shanata asked what percent of known abusers were themselves abused in childhood; you reported that 12% of abuse victims go on to later become abusers, but that does not indicate what percentage of abusers were themselves abused.

It could be that 12% of abused children go on to become 100% of the population of abusers (though that's extremely unlikely). 

If we have a population of, say, a million, and 10 percent of that population is abused, we have 100,000 people who were abused. 12,000 of those people are likely to abuse others later in life. 

If the total population of known abusers numbers 12,000, then you could reason that 100% of abusers were abused as children, even if only 12% of the people who get abused later become abusers.

If the total population of abusers is 24,000, then about half of all abusers were abused as children, and the other half were not. 

Unfortunately, I think actually verifying any numbers like these is unlikely to be feasible; most of this information would need to be self-reported, and an abuser is likely to claim to have been the victim of abuse themselves if it will yield lesser punishments. 

In addition, there will be many cases where abuse may have occurred and it was never revealed because it wasn't considered relevant to the case. ",1548979471
"Harmontown","t5_2vo38","Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure where he has actually lied about this either. The fact that commenters are so comfortable throwing out these accusations without any further information when prompted is concerning. If Peterson engaged in the same type of rhetoric I‚Äôm sure countless people would jump on him instantly.

But I‚Äôd also say it‚Äôs gender identity is not an apt comparison to religion as, like you mention, it involves the use of pronouns in daily speech. Someone could easily misgender someone as opposed to not refer to them by their religion. It‚Äôs not a societal expectation that we refer to each other as Christians or Atheists but it is with he and she. I‚Äôd also agree with Peterson that referring to someone‚Äôs pronoun isn‚Äôt a sign of respect insofar as it‚Äôs functional for the ability to converse.

Like you, Peterson has also stated he doesn‚Äôt speak for others, only himself. 

On a side note and seeing Peterson brought up in this sub: I consider myself left of centre and have found difficulty speaking with a lot of my leftist friends about Peterson. I think the real issue is a protectiveness around the disenfranchised that kicks in when someone takes a position that seems to oppose [insert group labelled oppressed‚Äôs] protection. It seems more left leaning people are more empathetic, but this can lead to mishearing and unfortunately (consciously or not) misrepresenting someone‚Äôs views who they see as the enemy in an impulse to protect.

I think it‚Äôs also that a lot of, especially younger, leftists have planted their flag in their own political opinions during and after their college education, at a time where the conservative positions were pretty bigoted and buffoonish. But from what I see, this has largely led to people not understanding any value whatsoever in conservatism. Peterson has a lot of valuable insight into both liberalism and conservatism, for anyone truly willing to listen. 

I just think the whole thing is sad and hope we‚Äôll eventually see that we could all learn a thing or two.",1548979471

You go through the game, choosing to align with the sides of Law, Chaos, or neutral through your actions.  At the end of each route, you usually learn that gods were pulling the strings of all sides the entire time, and you kill one of them.  Law routes often end with you killing lilith, lucifer, or another demon that is trying to upset the status quo and take power away from the gods.  Chaos routes usually end with you ascending through the levels of heaven, killing Archangels and sometimes YHVH to set humanity free from their tyrannical rule.  And neutral routes (often seen as the ‚Äútrue‚Äù endings) reveal an even greater power as the true antagonist.  But you almost always get to kill gods.  ",1548979472

I don't know why redditors hate everyone so much. I don't expect billionaires to dump all their money on a specific cause, but they've influenced and saved more people than I ever could in several lifetimes, at least give them that credit.

I don't understand hating someone for their worth, that doesn't resonate with me. 

Furthermore, it is an issue of logistics. Throwing money at Africa for example would do nothing as it wouldn't get distributed properly, and would be retained by warlords. With these freezing temperatures, there's hardly any possibility that people can currently travel, let alone allow for a full logistical effort to set up a type of event to save people.

"TheMindIlluminated","t5_3f6ws","Well, now we're getting into more and more idiosyncratic territory... I don't mind, I'm just prefacing this with the warning that it might end up being unrelatable.

I love games in many forms. For difficult tasks, my mental process seems to go the way of gamification.

When you play a game at the highest level you possibly can, there's an amazing sort of simplification that happens. You get ""in the zone"", as they call it. You have a clearly defined goal, and even though it might give rise to all sorts of priorities or potential courses of action, it all flows through this well understood and difficult to execute ""plan"" that is your current best. Just the best you can do.

In the ""game"" of working out, I know each rep can be done well or it can be done badly. Same thing for each set. So that narrows it down. If I ever think I've done a perfect set, it's pretty much guaranteed I can attribute that to a failure of attention.

Your strategy, which is to say ""your best"", has to account for failure and allow for improvements of itself.

I'm not great at meditation, at least not yet, but it seems to train a skill that all games have in common, it's extraordinary. So you're right that meditating more would probably help. Body awareness, if nothing else, is clearly key to physical exercise.

How I deal with difficult tasks is I think of them as games and deploy my best strategy. I often set timers to just concentrate on something for a set period. This keeps me from getting carried away and forgetting what time it is because I was fixing a chair or something, but it also lets me put most other stuff aside so I can really focus on the task at hand. I've also set timers when I sit down to play a videogame, and I've found that to me, that *can* make it way more enjoyable.",1548979475

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","So, this is a serious flaw with the personhood argument. Babies are ""unconscious"" up until usually 5 months after birth although some as early as 2. You're not a person until then according to the argument. That means there's an equivalency in killing the baby in the womb and killing the baby in the crib up to a point. Obviously we all innately know it is wrong to kill a baby. All of our biology has been pointed to the very act of keeping those babies alive. But the personhood argument requires these actions to be equivalent if you're being consistent. In order to avoid this, you have to stick an arbitrary time limit at the end which is in and of itself a concession that the personhood argument is not correct. Either it is or it isn't. If it's correct, you don't need the arbitrary time limit (1st trimester, 2nd trimester, birth). It's a nuanced, but fatally flawed position. It's certainly better than ""it's not human"" or ""it's not alive"" or ""natural rights don't exist"".

Many times people arbitrarily choose the development of the nervous system or the brain as their arbitrary line, but the presence of a brain or spinal cord don't make you a person. The only thing they make you capable of is experiencing sensation. If the ability to experience sensation is what makes you a person then it wouldn't be unethical to void people from the world as if they never existed and we pretty much universally agree that would be as bad if not worse than killing.",1548979476

"soylent","t5_2wmas","Before I answer your questions, I am going to leave you a couple of links to previous posts I've made here regarding my blood tests after a year 100% Soylent:  


1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/826tah/soylent\_only\_blood\_test\_results\_1\_year\_later/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/826tah/soylent_only_blood_test_results_1_year_later/)
2. [https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/82pakg/blood\_test\_results\_updated\_lipid\_panel\_test/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/82pakg/blood_test_results_updated_lipid_panel_test/)

**How long have you been going 100%?**: I started in March 2017, so as soon as March hits this year it'll be two (2) years.  


**Do you remember your first Soylent? And did you immediately realize you wanted to go 100%? What was you reaction when you first heard of Soylent?**: I certainly do remember. It was a bottle of Soylent 2.0 (there were no flavors back then). No, I did not intended on going 100% at first. I heard of Soylent for the first time during an episode of ""Teens React"". They gave a brief background of the product and from then on I made my own research and decided to go for it.  


**Why do you do it? Money, convenience, nutrition?**: I think it is a bit of all three aspects, although I would say it is mostly for the nutrition and the convenience. I am a horrible cook. I tried my best to eat healthy before, but I could never really stick to a plan. It was frustrating trying to figure out nutrition and it was even more frustrating trying to put a meal together. I am a long distance runner, so eating is a big part of my routine, but long distance running takes a huge amount of time and dedication, so trying to figure out nutrition was difficult to do.  


**Favorite flavor? Least favorite? Any flavor ideas you think would be good?:** Drink Original is my absolute favorite flavor (or lack thereof), followed closely by Soylent Nectar (*RIP*). My least favorite is Cafe Mocha and Cafe Vanilla but that's just because I cannot do caffeine at all. I think a mango or hazelnut flavor would be awesome.  


**Do you remember your last meal before going 100%? What was it?**: I think it is worth mentioning that going 100% for me does not mean not having a cheat meal once in a while. I am down to a cheat meal once every two weeks, but I have been consistent with having at least one cheat meal a week. I guess if you want to be literal, I am 98.9% Soylent.  


**Are there any foods you miss? Or do you genuinely feel as though you've made the best choice for you?**: Like I said on my previous response, I do have cheat meal once in a while, this allows me to curve any ""real food"" cravings I may get throughout a week. I feel I've made the best choice for me going 100%. Like I mentioned previously, I am a long distance runner and my running has dramatically improved with Soylent. Also, and I am not claiming this to be true, I have not been sick, not once, ever since I started a 100% Soylent diet. Again, I am not contributing Soylent to that, but it may be worth looking into it.  


**How long do you intend to do this?**: This has become a life choice for me. I don't think I'll ever stop, unless all complete foods disappear.  


**Do you feel healthier? Have you lost or gained weight?**: Yes, I feel healthier. Not only physically but also mentally. I was a 185-pound running man who could not improve his times. I never had run a half-marathon and could barely finish a 10 miler without complete exhaustion. Now, after close two two years, I am in the best shape of my life at 150 pounds, running sub 19-minute 5K's, sub 41-minute 10K's and have completed countless half-marathons and clock just over 40 miles a week of running, including 18+ long runs on weekend days.",1548979477

"scientology","t5_2qh3a","These are all good points. I think maybe we should make a ""soft"" rule. Not one we enforce and not one we put on the sidebar under ""rules"", but just a reminder to people to consider whether using a full name is necessary. If someone feels it is necessary to use a full name because that person is a known entity within the Scientology world or something like that (even if they aren't ""publicly known"" like a celebrity) then I don't necessarily think we should remove that or otherwise moderate it.

I think you make a good point that for someone's name to stand out they are most likely on a service completion list or are otherwise SOMEHOW identifiable as a Scientologist. And adding their name to our sub isn't likely to make them any more likely to be found by a potential employer or something like that.

I still think there is a certain degree of right to privacy, but I think I can agree that using a full name is not the same as denying someone the right to privacy. For example I used to be on a facebook group of a few hundred people with my full (first middle last) name from all over the world. Googling my username you can find out who I am, but googling my actual name won't link you back to me at all. So ironically I am MORE identifiable by someone posting a story about me and calling me Echo1883 than I am if they posted my full name :P

Anyway. I like the idea of just doing a friendly reminder to consider whether posting a full name is important. I don't think its really worth making a stink over or adding a hard and fast rule. As long as the post/comment is in line with reddit's official anti-doxxing policy then that's good enough to protect people's right to privacy without needing to get paranoid about using names.",1548979478

All the various mutual funds and investment funds submit numbers to the exchanges saying they want to sell or buy X amount of shares in CompanyY at the close of the day,  People investing in the funds decided to buy or sell the funds that day and they need to balance that out.  These amounts are multiple $billions of dollars, so the exchanges take all the buy sell orders and match them up, stock by stock so the market doesn't get distorted and makes the trades at the end of the day.  Since the volumes are so huge for this, it is a good process.  But there is always a mismatch and the mismatch has to be sold or bought in the market before close or right after close.  It turns out to be a very small number compared to the overall buy sell orders (which is kind of not really the expectation I guess) but it usually produces a huge candle or two between 3:50 pm and 3:59 pm.",1548979479

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","It's like you were saying ""I don't want to be murdered, hence I'll keep a band on my eyes and rely on sheer gut to distinguish friends from foes"". It makes no sense to address your concern with such a strategy at all. What I mean for ""nobody is entitled to safety"" means that you effectively can't control how others react; same way I've observed first hand cases of domestic abuse in my own family, they often relied in a false belief the world couldn't present them horrible, unfair situations just because they're human and there are laws. Crime still happens and that won't change on its own because you think that'd be fair, and when shit comes to happen, there won't be any magic wands or white knights who'll protect you. Would you rather live paranoid and miserable, holding up to your delusional expectations or be willing to let your butthurt go to break the cycle and contribute your part? It's not even like you're being forced to acknowledge psychopathic men are the main at fault, the point here is that doesn't release you from helping to change things from your actions.

That's what I actually said from the beginning - if you want psychopaths to control themselves, you need to foster a culture of personal responsibility (that if you believe that's possible, of course, there's also the belief that people are beyond fix). Acting the way you do naturalizes and fosters the opposite effect - not only you simply assume broken males can't fix themselves, but you generalize to everyone and on top of that, you expect the problem to solve on its own. You might as well sit your whole life expecting the world to change, but you know that's not realistic at all, you're just letting your own fear and weakness give you excuse not to move a finger but take the easiest attitude from your comfort zone. You're expecting of others what you aren't willing to do with your own hands, like human rights aren't something that we must keep each of us in order not to return back to incivility.

In some way I pity your weakness to help yourself become part of a solution, beyond just expecting the world magically becoming fair and friendly, even when it doesn't take a colossal effort, but that's your call. I'm just giving you my two cents in case you want to move on from self pity and inconsistent, irrational practices that help little to change a shit world because you're too afraid or you think it's unfair a poor little woman has also to get down from pampered victim's heaven.",1548979481

"Kingdom","t5_2sl0d","**TL;DR at bottom.**

I'm a bit divided on this. While I think Ri Boku is a well written character, his position in the overall story is very poorly written.

Let's start with his introductory battle with Ou Ki. His victory over Ou Ki is ultimately brought about by several things. **The first** is having a pawn that is almost a guaranteed General killer: Hou Ken. This is something to take note of, because every time Ri Boku faces off against a Great General that could conceivably defeat him, Ri Boku pulls out the Hou Ken card. No great strategies, just a convenient ""I win, you lose"" pawn. To go back to what caused him to win against Ou Ki: **The second thing** is that he somehow could plan the entire battle of Bayou weeks or months in advance, and that it unfolded exactly as he predicted (which is ridiculous). This is also something of a recurring theme, with Ri Boku fielding outlandish or exceedingly convoluted strategies or tactics against people he never faced before that nevertheless unfold exactly as he intended (like when he tells Ba Nan Ji to target the weak links in A Kou's defensive formation, which in turn were borrowed from Ou Sen). **The third** is that he caught Ou Ki off-guard with something Ou Ki had no way of knowing about: the speed of Zhao's northern horses. This doesn't really demonstrate that Ri Boku has greater strategic prowess than Ou Ki, rather it's more like Ri Boku caught a lucky break due to events out of his control (admittedly he capitalized on it, which is a point in his favor).

So to double back to that second thing for a bit: part of why that bothers me so much is that aside from giving Ri Boku an entirely implausible degree of foresight, it also greatly diminished Chousou, a character that I felt excellently displayed a strategist's might. Why did all of Chousou's successes have to have come from Ri Boku? It changed Chousou from a great strategist that put up a good fight against the living legend Ou Ki, to a stooge that was just following some other guy's script. And come on, how could Ri Boku have predicted that things would unfold exactly the way they did weeks or months in advance? As we can see with the current Zhao invasion arc, once things progress to a certain point even Qin's premier strategist Shou Hei Kun acknowledges that plans fall apart quickly and flexibility is key. I can sort of understand Ri Boku planning the opening move of Bayou leaving the baiting to Chousou, **but he planned the entire battle the way it actually unfolded**.

His victory over the Xiongnu is another thing I'm dissatisfied about because we never actually see the Xiongnu in action. All we see is Yo Tan Wa going all ""Ooh Sei be carefull, ooh the Xiongnu are scary, ooh, and this new guy who defeated them is even scarier, ooh!"". Without actually seeing them in action I'm disiclined to view them as being of the same caliber as the western mountain tribes. Show, don't tell.

Then there's Geki Shin. With the way Geki Shin was introduced I actually felt that Geki Shin deserved the title Great General of the Heavens. And if Ri Boku could defeat him, then wouldn't that be a really cool battle to see? But just when Geki Shin saw through Ri Bo Ku's plan and a close encounter seemed imminent, Ri Boku had Hou Ken conveniently waiting in the wing. So it's not like Ri Boku won through some grand strategy, just his Hou Ken pawn again. This one was doubly painful because I was really into Geki Shin. To see this character have such a disappointing ending was a real downer, especially as it was just to raise Ri Boku's star ever higher.

But wait, there's more! When we get to the coalition arc we first have Ri Boku face off against Duke Hyou (with an admittedly awesome whirlpool strategy), only for Ri Boku to bring out Hou Ken *yet again* to take care of Duke Hyou. After that we get Sai, where he (rightfully) fails to take the western mounrain tribes into account. The thing is, he has this inner monologue where he concludes that there's no way he could have predicted this. In and of itself that would've been fine, but when taking the larger in-story Ri Boku circlejerk into account it felt like it was included just to absolve Ri Boku of all blame for his defeat.

Then there's the Retsubi thing. Ri Boku just happened to have it constructed in such a way that it is difficult to hold against invaders. Ri Boku's brilliant accomplishments just keep piling up without holding any real meaning. Couldn't there have been some other good reason why they couldn't hold Retsubi? At the very least it could have been the idea of some other Zhao General or strategist. But no, Ri Boku, Ri Boku, Ri Boku.

Here's another example of the current Zhao invasion arc: where the Qin have everything going for them when preparing for war (a capable and determined King, many great strategists and Generals), Ri Boku on the other hand has to defend against the Qin onslaught with one hand tied behind his back by the Zhao King Tou Jou refusing to mobalize Kantan's 100.000 elite soldiers. Because obviously it wouldn't do to actually make it a close battle without giving Ri Boku an unfair handicap; we might start to think the Qin are a match for him when given equal resources (any mention of these 100.000 could simply have been omitted in the first place, rather than specifically mention them only to hold them back).

Yet another example is the battle of hand-me-down-strategies between A Kou and Ba Nan Ji: both have received instruction for advanced formations from their Lord, but *obviously* Ri Boku's strategy is the better one. It's like no-one in Zhao can do anything without Ri Boku holding their hands. Why couldn't Gyou'un have been the one to figure it out? Being an instinctual type general he would have been ideal for it. But no, it had to come straight from Ri Boku who is one battlefield away and can perfectly see through Ou Sen's formation despite never having faced him before.

Another thing to keep in mind is that we do regularly see Generals and Commanders pull off great strategies and tactics: Ou Ki (Bayou), Ren Pa, Rin Ko, Ou Sen and Kan Ki (Sanyou), Ou Hon (Choyou), etc. The things is that we see all these great battles unfolding before our eyes and are then *told* that they all pale in comparison to the mighty Ri Boku.

**TL;DR: *While I really do think that Ri Boku is a wel written character*, the way he is written in the story is not and I can't enjoy him with how his victories never feel earned (Xiongnu, Geki Shin, Duke Hyou), his losses are treated as not his fault (Sai, Tou Jou), his unnatural foresight that allows all sorts of outlandish strategies to be pulled off perfectly (Bayou &amp; Chousou, Retsubi, Ba Nan Ji vs A Kou) and how Hara has all other characters jerk him off by treating him as the best General alive.**",1548979482
"anime","t5_2qh22","Interesting episode!  I think the main question at this point is WHY the King and Princess are plotting against him?  I thought the girl did it for money at first, but now that we know she's a princess and the money was essentially the King's money there'd be no point.  I find it hard to believe they are screwing with him for fun, mostly because it'd be a boring plot point.  

I'm leaning towards two scenarios at this point.  Either the royalty is evil and they know the shield hero holds the key to victory, or maybe they have to draw out the shield hero's evil thoughts to make him more powerful in order to defeat the waves.  I wonder.",1548979482

And the basic idea is that you have a holding variable and do like. 

First student compare to second student.

If it returns 1 first student is greater if its 0 they're equal and if its negative then first student is less than second student.

The holding variable takes the value of whatever you're moving so if we're sorting from large to small and we're comparing 3 to 4 the holding variable takes the value of 4, and then is compared to the next number. If I'm explaining that right.

Let‚Äôs take Asatruism. While there is no universal way to pray to the Gods, the Evangelical Asatru Temple of Imperatesta, the largest central body of Asatru leadership, advocates the following:

‚ÄúPrayer is communication and connection with the divine. Prayer is not an action, it is a way of living. To best honor and give thanks to the Gods, a man must lead a virtuous and fruitful life. That is, he must be of a solid and reliable, yet cool and flexible nature, have a sense of self, have a conscience, be resilient, be honest, and be kind. The Gods do not ask us for our subservience, just as we do not beg on our knees for forgiveness.

Get off your moral high horse.  If you aren't dropping what you are doing to look for the missing kid you don't know the meaning is either.

  **Invoke the word** *autocorrect* and most people will think immediately of its hiccups‚Äîthe sort of hysterical, impossible errors one finds collected on sites like Damn You Autocorrect. But despite the inadvertent hilarity, the real marvel of our mobile text-correction systems is how astoundingly good they are. It's not too much of an exaggeration to call autocorrect the overlooked underwriter of our era of mobile prolixity. Without it, we wouldn't be able to compose windy love letters from stadium bleachers, write novels on subway commutes, or dash off breakup texts while in line at the post office. Without it, we probably couldn't even have phones that look anything like the ingots we tickle‚Äîthe whole notion of touchscreen typing, where our podgy physical fingers are expected to land with precision on tiny virtual keys, is viable only when we have some serious software to tidy up after us. Because we know autocorrect is there as brace and cushion, we're free to write with increased abandon, at times and in places where writing would otherwise be impossible. Thanks to autocorrect, the gap between whim and word is narrower than it's ever been, and our world is awash in easily rendered thought.

 As someone who typed the entire first draft of his book on a phone, I want to shake the hand of the person responsible for this heedlessness, to meet the man who taught machines to draw sense from our maniacal tapping. I find him in a drably pastel conference room at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Dean Hachamovitch‚Äîinventor on the patent for autocorrect and the closest thing it has to an individual creator‚Äîreaches across the table to introduce himself.

 ‚ÄúDean,‚Äù I say.

 ‚ÄúGabriel,‚Äù he says.

 ‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù He frowns. Then he smiles and adds: ‚ÄúAutocorrect.‚Äù Apparently his brain, long trained for efficiency, replaces implausible terms with likelier alternatives.

 Hachamovitch, now a vice president at Microsoft and head of data science for the entire corporation, is a likable and modest man. He freely concedes that he types *teh* as much as anyone. (Almost certainly he does not often type *hte*. As researchers have discovered, initial-letter transposition is a much rarer error.) The day I meet him he has dark circles under his eyes and short bangs that look self-cut, and his skin looks as though it has struggled valiantly to draw whatever vitamin D it can from his cinema display. He's clearly swamped, but autocorrect is close enough to his heart that he is happy to take the time to talk about it.

  When Hachamovitch first joined Microsoft, he was given a job on the Word team. This was back in the early '90s. Word processing was at a crossroads, split into factions. On one side were the people who wanted adornments and frills‚Äîimproved desktop publishing, color separation, and the like. On the other side was the functionality gang, with whom Hachamovitch threw in his lot. This camp simply wanted to help people get out of their own way. As Hachamovitch saw it, the main thing that people do on a word processor is type‚Äîand typing, in his estimation, is a matter of ‚Äúa little bit of creativity and a whole lot of scutwork.‚Äù He could improve the typing experience by delivering us from scut. His aim was to make our typing sleek and invisible, smooth as speaking from a teleprompter.

 The notion of autocorrect was born when Hachamovitch began thinking about a functionality that already existed in Word. Thanks to Charles Simonyi, the longtime Microsoft executive widely recognized as the father of graphical word processing, Word had a ‚Äúglossary‚Äù that could be used as a sort of auto-expander. You could set up a string of words‚Äîlike *insert logo*‚Äîwhich, when typed and followed by a press of the F3 button, would get replaced by a JPEG of your company's logo. Hachamovitch realized that this glossary could be used far more aggressively to correct common mistakes. He drew up a little code that would allow you to press the left arrow and F3 at any time and immediately replace *teh* with *the*. His aha moment came when he realized that, because English words are space-delimited, the space bar itself could trigger the replacement, to make correction ‚Ä¶ automatic! Hachamovitch drew up a list of common errors, and over the next years he and his team went on to solve many of the thorniest. *Seperate* would automatically change to *separate*. Accidental cap locks would adjust immediately (making *dEAR grEG* into *Dear Greg*). One Microsoft manager dubbed them the Department of Stupid PC Tricks.

 MICROSOFT WORD COULDN'T VERY WELL GO AROUND RECOMMENDING THE CORRECT SPELLING OF *MOTHREFUKCER*.

 **It wasn't long** before the team realized that autocorrect could also be used toward less productive‚Äîbut more delightful‚Äîends. One day Hachamovitch went into his boss's machine and changed the autocorrect dictionary so that any time he typed *Dean* it was automatically changed to the name of his coworker Mike, and vice versa. (His boss kept both his computer and office locked after that.) Children were even quicker to grasp the comedic ramifications of the new tool. After Hachamovitch went to speak to his daughter's third-grade class, he got emails from parents that read along the lines of ‚ÄúThank you for coming to talk to my daughter's class, but whenever I try to type her name I find it automatically transforms itself into ‚ÄòThe pretty princess.‚Äô‚Äù

 Hachamovitch and his team couldn't get carried away with the pranks, though, because they were still hammering out the feature's basic functionality. The two-letter-caps substitution (*THis* to *This*) was scheduled to go live in Word 6, but it immediately posed the problem of how to handle exceptions (like *CDs*). What they needed, they realized‚Äînot just for this type of exception but for all of them‚Äîwas a master list, a kind of artisanal concordance. The task fell to Hachamovitch's intern, Christopher Thorpe, a 19-year-old on leave from Harvard. Thorpe wrote a script that compiled all the manual entries that Microsoft employees had made to their custom dictionaries‚Äîwords the built-in dictionary hadn't recognized but that were judged by users to be legitimate. Thorpe gave the list a quick edit and then gathered the remaining entries into a corpus. It began with such words as *abuzz* and *acidhead*. That prospectus became a database of the additional words that Word should find legit. In later Word releases, another list itemized changes that ought to be made to problematic homophone phrases. Word should always, for example, change *elude to* to *allude to*, and *could of been* to *could have been*.

 For our meeting, Hachamovitch dug up a stack of historical documents like that list, files that had languished for 20 years in office moves, making their way eventually to his basement. He clearly takes a marmish pride in the artifacts, patting a shrink-wrapped Word 95 box and turning it over to point out where it touted the great triumph of autocorrect. He flipped open a perfect-bound manuscript to a page he'd marked, with a table that showed when they added *judgement* as a correctible error. That one, he explained, was a very common misspelling, now eradicated like smallpox.

 On the subject of judgment, though, it became clear even in those early days that a sort of editorial consciousness was at work in Word's spell-check and autocorrect systems. *Judgement*, for example, isn't a misspelling‚Äîjust about every dictionary lists it as an acceptable alternative. But autocorrect tends to enforce primary spellings in all circumstances. On idiom, some of its calls seemed fairly clear-cut: *gorilla warfare* became *guerrilla warfare*, for example, even though a wildlife biologist might find that an inconvenient assumption. But some of the calls were quite tricky, and one of the trickiest involved the issue of obscenity. On one hand, Word didn't want to seem priggish; on the other, it couldn't very well go around recommending the correct spelling of *mothrefukcer*. Microsoft was sensitive to these issues. The solution lay in expanding one of spell-check's most special lists, bearing the understated title: ‚ÄúWords which should neither be flagged nor suggested.‚Äù

  I called up Thorpe, who now runs a Boston-based startup called Philo, to ask him how the idea for the list came about. An inspiration, as he recalls it, was a certain Microsoft user named Bill Vignola. One day Vignola sent Bill Gates an email. (Thorpe couldn't recall who Bill Vignola was or what he did.) Whenever Bill Vignola typed his own name in MS Word, the email to Gates explained, it was automatically changed to *Bill Vaginal*. Presumably Vignola caught this sometimes, but not always, and no doubt this serious man was sad to come across like a character in a Thomas Pynchon novel. His email made it down the chain of command to Thorpe. And Bill Vaginal wasn't the only complainant: As Thorpe recalls, Goldman Sachs was mad that Word was always turning it into *Goddamn Sachs*.

 Thorpe went through the dictionary and took out all the words marked as ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù Then he threw in a few anatomical terms for good measure. The resulting list ran to hundreds of entries:

 anally, asshole, battle-axe, battleaxe, bimbo, booger, boogers, butthead, Butthead ‚Ä¶

 With these sorts of master lists in place‚Äîthe corrections, the exceptions, and the to-be-primly-ignored‚Äîthe joists of autocorrect, then still a subdomain of spell-check, were in place for the early releases of Word. Microsoft's dominance at the time ensured that autocorrect became globally ubiquito",1548979494

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","This is what people mean when they say ""all cops are bastards, aka ACAB"" - there's no such thing as a ""good cop"" because the good people are forced out by the corrupt mob mentality or leave voluntarily.

Look at any YouTube video of a police beating. More often than not, when one cop beats the shit out of someone, the other cops present either join the beating or stand there and take no action...instead of being a GOOD COP and stopping the officer who is beating a suspect.

Here's just one example: https://youtu.be/YVZXCH6Vdnw

There's THREE cops that went along with the beating and false arrest, but only ONE cop got charged. Why were the two accomplices not charged???? If two friends help me rob a bank, don't they get charged for their role???

Felony murder says I can be convicted of murder for lending you a car that you use to drive to a house, where you kill someone while robbing it, *even if I had no knowledge of your plans to rob the house or the actual killing (because it was a spur-of-the-moment choice) and even if I was not present when the killing occurred occurred.*

So why can't cops get charged as accomplices when they stand around and watch as a fellow officer brutalizes someone and/or don't IMMEDIATELY report it????

&gt; The state jails and labels minors as sex offenders consensual acts between minors, even if both parties agree there was no coercion.

This is an issue that can be fixed in a socialist society, without removing the entire concept and legality of age of consent. Obviously that situation is ridiculous, but if you can't see the consequences if what you're suggesting, I don't know what else to say.

&gt; You do realize that the state ENABLES rich people to be pedophiles right? In a system like we have now, where the state determines who is and isn't a sex offender, the ruling class is ALWAYS going to get away with pedophilia. The current situation is NOT protecting children from abuse, and we should absolutely be critical of it.

Obviously. It's also obvious the solution is not saying laws shouldn't be a thing in a socialist society, ignoring the type of society, how the laws are enforced, and the context of the law.

I'm not going to debate further on this. I'd also like to say this is still disingenuous, as I'm reading comments you made on SLS that very much sound like pedophile apologia. ",1548979495

There is not one category over here, there are two quite clearly distinct ones. Psychopaths (or category A if you like) can become Sociopaths (category B) but not the other way around. The Neurotypical's moral compass is static, with minor changes informed by logic, however always grounded on a fundamental core. The Psychopath's moral compass can vary in its entirety, outside of their conscious control. A Sociopath is the author of their own moral compass through conscious choice. Another way of coining these three types would be as Non-manipulators, compulsive manipulators, and utilitarian manipulators. The reason why this is so significant is it draws a line between the Psychopaths - the scary unpredictable loose cannons that have come to be feared as what is clearly a ""mental health issue"" due to volatility, and the Sociopaths - who are essentially just unshackled Neurotypicals with fewer pro-social biases.

A majority of stories don't need to spend 15-20 minutes (or longer) on exposition about what the characters are about to experience. I've read tons of scripts that spend so much time on exposition, which delays the plot development and often distracts from the story you're trying to tell. It's okay to keep the exposition simple, straight forward and to the point.

A perfect example of exposition being short and sweet is this scene from IT FOLLOWS: https://youtu.be/l4yfomJ73vw

The rules of the story are presented in a little over a minute, immidately followed by (no pun intended) the first big scare for the lead protagonist. Get the exposition out of the way quickly, then let the rest of the story unfold by being shown to the viewer rather than explained.

That's a friendship unbalance, that forces you to keep going her direction. You need to lean back and see if she comes your direction as well. There's a very good article about that, I'm going to see if I can find it. The author outlines how many people are always going outward towards others and how if we lean back and wait, the ones that really count come towards us. I've tried that with many people and it does work. It has two outcomes, however. You end up losing a lot of people who don't come your direction, but those who do are the cherished friends. The other ones? They don't value you as much as you value them. What do they bring to the table? Do they nurture you, build you up, support you? Are they warm, inviting, helpful? Or is that always you and not them?

Take inventory and see what you come up with on these people. I think a lot of people don't examine these things and drift through life just going with whatever tide they are in. They end up sad and dejected because they aren't controlling their lives, their lives are controlling them. And the people they are drifting with aren't necessarily concerned about them, they are just drifting in the same tide. You might as well be two corks, floating along, bumping into each other. That's not a friendship. Swim to shore. Stand on the ground. Look out there and see what the truth is.

If you both find out what‚Äôs hitting her ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù (not feeling safe, poor self image, feeling lost, etc) and work on that the sex will improve. 


Evolutionary phycology isn‚Äôt real science, and is just theoretical bs that sounds good. The truth is women and our sexuality have been treated for to long like men sexuality lite.

That age group that‚Äôs ‚Äúalready older than 18‚Äù is an entire generation younger than those of us who‚Äôve played fallout since it was called wasteland. 

Gen X only had a sliver of it become real, technical hard-core gamers. In many ways we were more technical teenagers than today‚Äôs teenagers because it took more tech skills, grit and work just to get the technology to cooperate and the darn games to run. Many of us even used that as a springboard into marketable IT skills and IT careers. 

And those of us that did played specific things that evolved into what you know today. 

If you look at these evolved things, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find us all clustered together in large numbers (Our familiarity with a much less polished world, and comfort with somewhat buggy software is also why Bethesda can sell a buggy title by the millions and get awards showered on their heads despite never fixing its bugs, whereas Battlefield or CoD could never pull that off). 

You wont find us in general gaming statistics. We‚Äôre just an aberration there. But you‚Äôll find we‚Äôre a very significant part of the audience of the Fallout franchise. 

So I didn‚Äôt mean younger *than you*. I meant younger than the fallout franchise‚Äôs crowd that‚Äôs accrued over the ages. It has **lots** of older people. The fallout sandwich (everything you love about America on top, everything you hate about it down below, you, a big gun and no law or morality restrictions in the middle) has sunk its emotional teeth into many, many people over the eons. 

Often (but not always) there‚Äôs a cost-driven glass wall between younger and older, because younger people (my kids for example) have more access to $200 appliances and less access to $1000+ PC game rigs. And they gravitate to where the rest of their friends are, which is.. the $200 appliances. Older people have better access to disposable income, and the % they make up of the PC crowd is higher. 

People not looking at the bigger picture and basing their impressions on who they meet in-game might often conclude that everyone on PS4 (or worse, ‚Äúin the game‚Äù) is young because they‚Äôre on PS4, and people on PC might conclude the opposite. Reality is somewhere in between.",1548979505

"indianews","t5_2qi1m","&gt;In 2014, she published The Doctor and the Saint as an introductory text to The Annihilation of Caste, a 1936 speech written by BR Ambedkar, a towering intellectual born into a Dalit family. Ambedkar was prevented from delivering it by Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal, the reformist, upper- caste organisation that had invited him to speak.

&gt;Several Dalit scholars and activists objected. They accused Roy of speaking over Ambedkar, in what was essentially a standalone essay that barely referenced the original text, corrupting his ideas in the process. 

&gt;Created by Dalit activists Kuffir Nalgundwar, Anoop Kumar and Anu Ramdas, the website contains arguments that suggest that the obvious intention of Roy‚Äôs introduction was to criticise Mahatma Gandhi, which she could have done without smuggling it inside Ambedkar‚Äôs seminal text. ([source](https://mg.co.za/article/2018-08-24-00-arundhati-roy-brilliant-troubledand-troubling))

....

Don't get me wrong, she is *good* at what she does and she knows how to speak to a westernized audience. 

&gt;Whenever she giggled girlishly, the literary salon of Johannesburg buzzed with exclamations about how cute she was, and when she made weighty proclamations on caste or class, there was enthused applause.

She is a darling of the western left and that is not going to change. She worked hard to get that reputation, I will give her that. 

&gt;The JRB: Thank you for your time. First, a quick question about lunch yesterday, which was India‚Äôs Independence Day.

&gt;Arundhati Roy: Yes. Some Indians‚Äô independence day.

&gt;The JRB: Yes, the national day. I wondered about why you chose to eat at a Johannesburg steakhouse on that day.

&gt;Arundhati Roy: Well, I didn‚Äôt choose to eat at a steakhouse, but it made me quite happy to be there. Because it‚Äôs a complete myth that Indians don‚Äôt eat beef. It‚Äôs just certain very upper-caste Indians who don‚Äôt eat beef and are trying to inflict this diet on everybody else. I mean, the state I come from, Kerala, everyone eats beef.

&gt;She herself declared that she was against India‚Äôs policies towards nuclear weapons, industrialization and economic growth (which she describes as ‚Äúencrypted with genocidal potential‚Äù in Listening to Grasshoppers: Field Notes on Democracy).

&gt;This is exactly what the Americans and foreign funded NGOs wanted. She wanted all developmental activities to be stopped in India and was dead against Industrialization concept which would create millions of job opportunities.

&gt;She started literally opposing every developmental projects in India calling it imperialist and against poor. She opposed the Indian Nuclear program and nuclear weapons development and claimed it to be used against the tribals of Mizoram and Nagaland. Her fake propaganda was highlighted by the western agency and opposed the government‚Äôs testing of nuclear weapons in Pokhran, Rajasthan during Vajpayees‚Äô government.

They collected the guests' money at a central register, and there was a tip jar at the register. The owners told me they pool all that money together and throw a big party for all the employees a couple of times a year. Any money left on the tables as a tip by guests was supposed to be brought up front and put in the jar by whomever cleaned the table. A dishwasher told me he'd worked for them for 14 years and there had not once been a party.

They were free to lie to the server because it was fine with them that none of us lasted long. (It was a small place, one or two servers at a time.) They would hire someone, feed them this line about the tip jar, withhold ""taxes"" from their paycheck but not submit any governmental paperwork or actually pay those taxes into social security, and just wait until they got fed up and quit and then just replace them. If the employee bothered to come back for their last paycheck, there were suddenly a whole lot of reasons why it wasn't available or there were deductions. (Most didn't return for it anyway.) The owners would get hundreds of hours work out of each person in exchange for less than $1000, and bank the tips they had earned. (Yes, they're out of business now.)",1548979506

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I'll lead stating that I agree that a state tax is a kind of income. That makes intuitive sense. However, because the unpaid labor of the clerk is the income of the capitalist and the clerk's income is the wage necessary to maintain the collective body of workers available (i.e. its ""Industrial Army of Labour"") at a level of labor power capable of unbounded accumulation of capital by the investment of the surplus value of the wage-slave's labor converted to profits for the capitalist into more capital, rinse and repeat- since that, it would seem that, in the example of the clerk and the consumer, the exchange from party A to party B is an act that initiates the process which I described in the first paragraph of this reply. As such, it sounds to me like, for such a process there will be many associated ""incomes."" There are also locks on the doors of those businesses and special armed bodies of men that we call cops who protect the revenue on its way from the register to being converted into capital, and a large bureaucracy consisting of three branches of government from the federal down to the local level all facilitating a form of rule that they hope can protect the interests of private property (particularly for capitalists) to try to minimize the cost of those cops (another income) by minimizing their confrontation with its citizens. In other words intimidation is costly but sometimes necessary so smart bureaucrats and capitalists avoid it when they can. In that entire process, it's apparent that the state and the class that it represents (i.e. capitalists), form a kind of parasite to society that must be extricated for our emancipation. For that reason ultimately an estate tax is not enough. Full expropriation is necessary imo.",1548979512

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb"," Ever since I first got to hold Arthur I hoped that my gift would be passed on to him. Every day I would be looking out for something out of the ordinary; something as simple as a light flickering or a board squeaking randomly near him would suffice for me too be able to tell if Arthur contained any power. But no, nothing, Arthur was the most normal, human, boring child I had ever seen.

Julie does not know about my life before I met her, you would think I would tell her, but back then I was not really the most liked person on the planet so it was best to keep my mouth shut about it,settle down, and lose my influence on the world.

Throughout Arthur's life I have always had some glimmer of hope that he was hiding his powers from us, that's what I did with my parents so why wouldn't he?

I was pretty sure that Arthur contained no powers as I was just a nosy enough parent to keep enough of an eye on him that there was no way he could be hiding any peculiarities from me.

Until today, when I casually walked in to his room with a surprise gift for his 15th birthday and I saw, very plainly, his desk floating a few feet off of the floor. My jaw dropped, how long has he been hiding his abilities? Mine started appearing when I was six years old and I it made odd things happen in my parents house all the time; is it possible he has been able to control his powers this well since he was a child?

After what felt like an hour staring at the hovering desk Arthur noticed my at the door and dropped the desk immediately with a small yelp. I looked over to him and saw a look on his face like a teenager that was just caught smoking weed. As he stands up about to explain I throw my arms around him.

""Finally!"", I cry out in glee.

Arthur gets a little less tense and looks up at me, his eyes wide with shock and anticipation for what I am going to say next.

I stand there for a moment and realize that I never actually made a plan for what I was going to say to him when he showed signs of my gift.

""Come on champ, lets go for a drive."" I try to say in a calming fatherly way.

We get in my car and I start the car with a wave of my hand, making sure Arthur sees this, and begin to drive. Arthur does not say anything for the whole drive, he does not seem stressed at all. I pull over the car at the abandoned oil refinery.

""I don't know how long you have been hiding your abilities but I am so happy I found out before you did anything stupid...hopefully"" I chuckle. Arthur looks at me and lets out a small smile.

I get out of the car and walk up to a fence with a large ""Do Not Enter"" sign on it, Arthur following me closely.

I look over to him and say, ""Everything I have told you about my life is a lie, and I'm very sorry""

I reach my hand out toward the fence, I watch it melt in to a pile of molten metal at my feet. ""Man it really has been a long time"" I say as I stretch my arm. I can see Arthur out of the corner of my staring at the now empty space that the fence was standing.

I step over the red hot puddle and begin walking toward the refinery.

""Comic books really get it all wrong"" I begin, ""People do not get super powers because they fell in to a vat of chemicals or get bitten by a radioactive spider. Each hero getting their own unique ability that helps them fight bad guys"" I say with a slight distasteful tone.

""That is not how it works in the real world"" I say as we approach the main building of the refinery.

""I have only met three other people like us, but in the real world supers don't have a single ability that they can master, we have every ability you can think of, if you put your mind too it you can achieve it"".

I raise my hand ceremoniously while staring at the large complex in front of us. I snap my fingers and the building explodes in to a million pieces, the debris would have certainly killed us if I had not put up a barrier around us beforehand.

I look down at Arthur who fell over in shock of the explosion, he looks up at me with wonder and a little fear in his eyes.

He opens his mouth and asks, ""Why did you never tell me that I was special?""

""The truth is I didn't know. Our kind are so rare I did not know if my gift would pass on to you.""

""Why do you not use your powers anymore?""

I sighed, ""I almost destroyed the world because of my power.""

""When I was about twenty five I decided that with my abilities that I thought no one else possessed, I would be able to rule the world and possibly make it a better place. My efforts were stopped immediately at the first city I was going to show my power too by people like us. My display began with me levitating and throwing some garbage and cars around so I could get the media to show up and I could voice my message. As I started however I was immediately thrown in to the sky by a chunk of road that was under me. I stopped a thousand feet in the air and saw three other people flying at me. It turns out that these other superhuman beings had never met but all decided to try and stop me from doing what they considered ""evil"". I refused to let them stop me on my quest.""

""Our battle went on for days, leveling the entire city in the process, killing thousands of people indirectly with our immense strength. The problem with fighting someone godlike power while having the same level of abilities is that 3 on 1 only becomes slightly more too manage in the long run. In the end it came down to me having a little more imagination on how to defeat one another to end the conflict.""

""If you killed your only competition why did you not continue to dominate the rest of the world?"" Arthur asked, I was a bit put off by this question since his tone inflected that I was wrong to not continue on my quest.

""After looking at the damage I had done and the casualties that I had caused I realized that there are probably a lot more supers that will contest me in my conquest and I did not want to destroy half of the world and then try to rule it.""

""I see no reason why not to destroy half of the world"" Arthur said with a straight tone.

I could not believe what I was hearing, my own son would be willing to kill billions of people for his own personal gain? That can't be right, I raised him better than that. My parents hardly raised me at all at least I had an excuse that I had never learned good Morales.

""Son, since we have been given this powerful gift from the universe, we cannot use it to make others suffer"" I placed my hand on Arthur's shoulder with caution.

""How do you know there are others?"" Arthur asked.

""I don't, those three people came randomly from the street. It would make sense that there could be more around the world.""

""I wonder I could beat them"" Arthur said with an air of confidence that got sent chills down my back.

Arthur pushed my hand off of his shoulder, turns and starts walking away.

""I have known about my powers for a long time Dad, I have taken down three supers already and with extremely few casualties. Not all at the same time unlike you."" He remarks as he flips to face me.

""I guess great minds think alike Dad, if you want to help me on my journey I would love to have you but if you are going to try and stop me we will regrettably have to fight"" he says as he brings his hands up, ready to activate his powers.

The ground cracks around him as he activates his gift.

""Son, when I beat your ass we are going straight home and you are so grounded."" ",1548979513

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","To be honest any ship can basically be an explorer ship, but there are definitely some that are specialised for it in terms of price and available slots for outfitting and some nice range. Cargo is just another slot option but not necessary, you can stow a different module in the slot to make it a different purpose ship.

Personally I think the best ships right now are the Asp Explorer, Diamondback Explorer and Krait Phantom. If you have less of a budget a Cobra MK3 is a good all-rounder and capable of exploring just fine. If you like to show up in something big and more expensive an Anaconda can stow a lot of modules and still have spare room.

In terms of getting there, I'd recommend moving out of the Sidewinder as fast as possible and get something to do some void opal mining for example. Could use a Cobra for that, and later refit the ship for exploration.",1548979514

Eh, it's not really presented as good or bad in the sense of the author moralising about it.  I mean, certainly those doing it are not presented terribly positively (though doing coke is far from the worst thing about them), but then that's true of almost everyone in the book.  Not sure what you mean by Aslan expy though - I don't recall anything resembling that (though certainly the main character being selfish is not uncommon).

The author is not wrong that its a bleakly nihilistic story, but he misses the point in assuming that the only purpose of such writing is merely to ""shock, outrage, offend, and dishearten"".  It's a beautifully dark and twisted book, and one of my favourites, with fascinating characters (who are admittedly awful people) and great writing.

‚ÄúSometimes, children are the last thing travelers want to see (or hear) on vacation‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Jennifer W. Miner


In my research for kid free hotels I came across many offers for hotels where Kids Stay Free! I immediately navigated away from the family friendly chains and discovered that there are several couples only accommodations and gay-friendly sites for me and my one-and-only. Some looked fancy and some required rubber sheets and participation in the daily wet T-shirt contests, but most childfree places catered to a more curious traveler. Swingers we are not!

It is no coincidence that my favorite hotel in the world is adults-only. It is peaceful and rejuvenating and expensive. But what price would you pay for the true luxury of lounging poolside without the words ‚ÄúMARCO‚Äù and ‚ÄúPOLO‚Äù ringing in your ears?

At this magical hotel, let‚Äôs just call it Heaven-on-Earth, the pool is quiet and there are no flying Frisbees or nap time tantrums. Sometimes there are  boobies but not the breastfeeding kind. Once in a panic a few guests entered the pool area in horror when they spotted several young teenagers. The management was swiftly notified, and the guests miraculously disappeared. (Even some loud adult guests were asked not to return.) Many of the guests of the hotel had children and spoke openly and guilt free about loving their childfree vacations. I met some pregnant guests who mourned the fact that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to return for some while. Everyone agreed that the childfree policy made the hotel a perfect repeat destination. The hotel is consistently booked far in advance even with its crazy rates.

So why don‚Äôt more hotels offer adult only options? The huge baby boomer market is made up of empty nesters, and the childfree by choice market is growing, and many gay couples have Double Incomes and No Kids. Several Four Seasons Hotels offer adult only pools and a few hotels in Cyprus are childfree for the summer season. Unfortunately, search for upscale adult only hotels came up pretty short, but it is my mission as a ‚ÄòWhy No Kids?‚Äô founder to take one for the childfree community and search out and find these oases of serenity and share them with our readers. (Who says childfree couples are selfish?)

As DINKs we need to tell hotel chains that we want adult only options with pools and even sections of the hotels or kid-free-zones. If we vote with our wallets just maybe the proprietors (aka huge corporations) will listen. Unfortunately, it seems like the opposite is happening. Today, hotels primarily cater to families with children with their cartoons character tie-ins, day-care activities and adventure areas that are reserved for kids only. Even the cruise ship market is capturing the kid‚Äôs vote. What happened to the idea that a vacation is a place of respite, relaxation, and calm; free from the noise and commotion of everyday life including screaming, splashing kids and crying babes? And what happens when you and your partner slip from the little ones for some much needed peace and alone time, and arrive at your destination to find that it‚Äôs not an escape at all? Can an argument be made that parents, not non-breeders can derive the greatest benefit from a few days of childfree lodging?",1548979516

"ShittyLifeProTips","t5_2tgym","You know, you don't have to be a vegan in order to eat responsibly. I dare say I do more for the vegan cause than vegans do. I say this because. 

 - I raise my own chicken and pigs so that me and my family realize the impact we have on these animals and it helps us reduce our meat intake. 
 - Raising your own animals ensures free range organic, grass fed, happy animals (and no partaking in cruel raised). 
 - I teach how to humanely slaughter chickens so that others can do the same &amp; I give info on who to see for the pigs and how to find grass fed, happy cows (I go in on one with 2 other families). 
 - I substitute meals with veggie &amp; fruit shakes &amp; juices &amp; teach the benefit of this to others. 
 - Supporting cruelty free meats will drive out big factory cruel farming same as organic veggies are doing now. Even non labeled organic options are making strides to make them more natural. 
 - I've tried having a rational discussion with vegans at both /r/debateavegan and /r/vegan but there's just no talking to them. to them it's all or nothing. Even my wife's mostly vegan diet with occasional egg or dairy ""causes cancer"" lol. They will lie through their teeth just to try to get another person to commit 100% to their cause and they will make zero effort to spread the word of cruelty free meats to their friends/family that tell them over and over they will never stop eating meat. They can't respect other peoples opinions enough and that is what disgusts me the most about vegans.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Finnegan's Wake. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Irish pub traditions most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Mr. Porter's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Giambattista Vico literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Finnegan's Wake truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mr. Porter's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Giambattista Vico's Italian epic Scienza nuova. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as James Joyce's genius unfolds itself on their book pages. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a James Joyce tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

"PS4Dreams","t5_38pk8","So what is this game about? It takes place in modern time, about a 20 year old boy who back in highschool lost his big sister in a car ""accident"" which led him to drop from school some time later and become a shut-in, he slowly starts getting depressed and becomes overweight until he decides he had enough and tries to commit suicide, but he doesn't because he's too scared. So why did this effect him so much? Ever since he was born and his twin brother ""died"" after birth, he felt weak and he grew up always quiet and weak and had to rely on his sister for almost anything, she was everything to him, she was like a best friend but after she left he had to fend for himself.

So after he couldn't end it, he came back home and decided to look for his sister's belongings to have something to remember her by, and he finds a lot of the same thing: pictures and albums of a group of 13 girls who turned to be singers his sister was into, and so from that day he started listening to their music and started to like them a lot but the girls aren't really what they seem to be, but they're not the only thing that wasn't normal, he too isn't normal and everything that happened to him isn't normal. Everything is written, someone is controlling all these events like a play.

I don't deal well with people who want me to indulge them and tell them lies to make them feel better. I've also once had to walk out of a shop because I felt my rage at a shopkeeper rise to unmanageable levels due to a combination of their rudeness, incompetence then defensive behaviour when I tried to offer polite feedback. It's something about me that I have to keep in check because it can and will dramatically destruct relationships if I don't see the red mist rising. On the other hand, I don't really regret any of these events, because I think I was right both times. I just could have handled it better. I think in terms of your situation, it's best for both parties to take some time out to cool down. This is the only thing that works for me when I am feeling like this.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","&gt; The initiative calls for [...] certain transportation fees or tolls be approved by both state and county voters unless the projects represent ‚Äúnet new capacity‚Äù on the freeway

Net toll revenue should be used for ""carrots"" that are alternatives to driving that go along with the ""stick"" of tolls.  However, the proposal and existing law would probably exclude increased transit service, closer-in housing and other things that get cars off the road and free up capacity (creating ""net new"" capacity for others).

Overall, freeways should have been tolled to begin with, since they 1) aren't part of the basic road system that driveways connect to 2)  are extra high-quality facilities that only exist in some corridors 3) are destructive to build and being paid for by outside revenue has encouraged local politicians to push for them to be built where it may not have been wise to do so.

&gt; Special interest groups see tolls, and they see dollar signs for all other manner of projects they want to fund or was to supplant toll revenues to pay for things like PERS

The Ottomans really wanted to be seen as the inheritors of Rome's legacy (as basically every Empire in the Europe wanted to), so they kept the original name, *Konstantiniyye*. Which is literally Konstantinopoli in Turkish.

The city was only officially renamed Istanbul after Atat√ºrk won the Turkish independence war and established the secular RoT. 

But the city has been referred to as Istanbul/Istanpoli since before the Roman Empire split in two by the common folk of the place, because it used to be the literal greatest city in the Western World for more than a thousand years (and arguably still is one of the culturally richest cities on earth)

Flats do sound totally different from round wounds and if your expecting to get round wound tones out of them you won't be happy with them. If your trying to recreate the tone of legends like Jimi Hendrix, Clapton, SRV thna you won't be happy with flats.

Because Disgaea 5 Complete is $29.99 currently, and Disgaea 1 Complete is $10 more, I‚Äôd go with the former. My issue with Disgaea 1 Complete is that it was grindy. There was also many QoL improvements that aren‚Äôt present. It was weird that NIS didn‚Äôt try to implement those into the ‚Äúremake‚Äù of the first game, but they aren‚Äôt there. Both games are great in their own right. For player friendly and QoL improvements, the fifth one is best. 

Don‚Äôt know much about Longest unfortunately. I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about it. 

YS 8, for the price, is an absolute. I haven‚Äôt played it personally. While I received a code, I passed it on to a colleague. They reported that it was fun. The story is subjective naturally, but I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things. In fact, I‚Äôve heard some say it was just as good as XB2. 

For the price, I can recommend God Wars. It‚Äôs full of customization, which helps with the battles. I found them bland, but since I had a task, it was easier to stomach. I did enjoy it, and for whatever reason, the battle theme was stuck in my head. It was strange. Wouldn‚Äôt strike you as catchy but for whatever reason, it fucking was lol

I can also absolutely recommend Labyrinth of Refrain. It‚Äôs such a whimsical and quirky game. I enjoyed the music, the story, and I found the voice acting to be rather well done, but that‚Äôs subjective. It‚Äôs also done by the creators of Disgaea. Yes, I completely can say that it‚Äôs worth the price right now. 

Yomawari collection was hard for me. I just, with so many games out, it was hard to give it a recommend. If you read my review, it does get it. However, I add in the caveat that it‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre a fan of horror walking sims. For me, it was a game that came out at a thought time, when the eshop and Switch itself is flooding in titles. I might even only go for it when it‚Äôs retailing for $19.99. Hurts to say as I love NIS but I promised myself I would be truthful. So, yeah, that‚Äôs the truth.

I agree that you should stick with an older cat unless you have the ability to be home often for a kitten‚Äôs needs. 
Adults are more independent and require a bit less play/attention. They also have more established personalities, so you can kinda know what you‚Äôre getting. 
A senior cat could also be a great option if you‚Äôre financially stable enough to afford potential extra medical bills. 
I recommend you just go to a shelter as planned and see if any magic happens.  If you don‚Äôt meet a kitty that you feel a connection with, or really want to take home, then wait a few days and go back. Repeat if needed.

Income and profit fluctuates from year to year due to shifting overhead costs, government subsidies and public policies regulating the beef industry. __Overall farm profit margins vary from 24 to 33 percent per head of cattle__, as calculated by Utah State University extension services in 2015.

I googled ‚ÄúBuy a Beef Farm‚Äù and this was from the first article. https://work.chron.com/average-income-cattle-rancher-16400.html

"EpicSeven","t5_nrn6j","&gt; You get it once every dozen or more runs and it only refunds half of the AP you spent. So if you spent 20 AP and regain 10, you are still behind than if you had just played a World or 9-4 maze and got 20-30k from chests + catalysts/fodder/fodder XP.

So you would rather... get a **t4 or t5 stuff that you wouldn't fucking use** than an partial stamina refund to retry the run again because you still get t6 mats. 

But if you are fucking looking for gold like what you just said, why are you fucking not grinding a world map instead.

I think you got it fucking wrong, you are doing wyvern for the t6 materials, not for gold. Gold is just a bonus at this point. 

&gt;Which is why you do hunts to get gear. Getting bookmarks instead of gear beats the purpose of doing hunts. Also, fodder/catalysts &gt; crafting materials.

Ahaha. Good fucking joke. Wyvern drops only 1 t6 claw, the majority of your material drop is from wave 1. The chances of you getting a good epic t6 is like 0.01% or some shit.

Worst so far was pirates for me. After final boss battle I swear I was staring at the screen for 30+ minutes before I could interact again. The only reason I didn‚Äôt skip was in case I would miss pertinent story for KH.

I've done what I can to help research this but I'm not as involved in all the new hardware and such as much as I used to be.

RAM I'm sure I can figure out but I'm not sure what MoBos and CPUs would fit for what I'm looking for at this time.

-Mr X can hear your gunshots wherever he is. If you fire a gun, he'll be at you in a few seconds. He can hear you sprint if you're in the same area as well. Pull him away, then run a few rooms away and don't fire any shots or sprint. He'll stay off you unless he patrols into that room (he's set to patrol through certain areas).

-Kill the library zombies your first time through there so you don't have to deal with them when X is on you.

-Lickers are blind. As long as you don't bump into them and they haven't already sensed you, you're able to slowly walk around them with no issues.

-Don't shoot zombies to kill. Shoot to bypass. Fire a shot or two into the head until it staggers, then run by them. Or lure to an open area and go around them.

And I'm also in agreement with your analogy. While I wouldn't go so far as to label the behaviour as malicious, I would concur that it is petty and supercilious.

However, the reverse must also be considered. A person that plays basketball as a hobby and furthermore does not take the time and effort to polish their abilities will get laughed off if they attempt to bring their game to professional basketball players. And that same person shouldn't then claim: ""they're just snobs without any real skill."" I see this as much as I see the point emphasized by your analogy. ",1548979537

Chaos is, by definition, *corruptive*. They didnt start with the ""flaying people alive"" thing, aside from the Night Lords - but it's important to note that no one really cared if they *did* do that, either - but they instead slid into those habits because Chaos sorcery *requires* it. It's a pretty small step to go from ""genocidal rampage"" to ""genocidal rampage plus carving on hearts.""

You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports

As a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. 

You will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.

I'd also accept crypto payments, since they operate in a similar way to a wire regarding no take backs (note, there are some rare instances in which a wire reversal can be done) and has lower fees.

Also, with crypto, anyone around the world can pay in their local currency and there are no conversion fees outside of the crypto trading fees and potential transfer fees.

I have Binance and Coinbase accounts. Anything I receive in Binance (alt coins) is sold for LiteCoin (cheapest transfer out rate) and transferred to Coinbase, and then I use Coinbase Pro to trade for free to USD, and withdraw to my bank account for free.

Anything I receive to my Coinbase account has no fees to withdraw, and the ACH transfer takes hours to a day.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Yep, I don't know...as said, I have no idea about middle management but I would be surprised if there wasn't a problem lower down given problems higher up. Talk to people who have money at risk on c-level execs, UK management does not have a strong reputation.

My experience is analysing companies, I have probably looked at every company listed in the UK above ¬£50m, I have met management at most of these, and the ones that I haven't I have talked to people who have. And I used to work US companies before that. The difference is light and day. It varies by industry: pharma has no real difference, retail appears to be populated exclusively by cowboys...but I don't really think this is controversial. I studied economic history too, and the deficiency of British managers is a feature of most accounts of Britain's recent economic history. I do agree with one thing though: most British managers believe they are well above average.

I think we can quibble over personal impressions but there is quite a bit of research on this, the government has even put their oar in (as unwelcome as that is) - https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/32327/12-923-leadership-management-key-to-sustainable-growth-evidence.pdf

"anime","t5_2qh22","The explanation for why Kirito and Asuna were able to move, if putting all of the novels into consideration is simple,

&amp;#x200B;

It's Cardinal ! It's the most advanced AI that Kayaba ever created, even more advanced than Yui. and there is only 1 copy of it and it's in SAO. and then later in ALO  coz it was a direct copy of SAO.

but this Cardinal is not in ""The Seed"" package, so it's not the same Cardinal that is in GGO or other games,

Cardinal was basically a very Super AI capable of maintaining Aincrad for over 2 years w'o a single staff.

It was the actual god of the system, creating quests and changing them as it see ""fit"" all by itself.

It can search the internet for lore and legends and create story and quest chain and everything.

Monitoring and scanning every player's mind and emotion to understand to apply the ""harassment"" code correctly.

meaning if a male player mistakenly touch a female player's breast, he will not be ""shoot backward"" but if someone was intentionally doing it, he will be punished.

Cardinal could also detect lies and trust of players.

&amp;#x200B;

these are all mentioned in the novels at many different point in the story. some in aincrad and some in progressive and some in ALO like that Tonkii story which was completely cut from anime.

&amp;#x200B;

I said all these to get to this point...

Cardinal was trying to make this as real as possible like real life.  this is probably ( not confirmed ) the reason why it prevented Yui from being an Emotional support program and just jump around and help people,

Cardinal's source of info on the real world is the internet and the many story and movie and everything in it.

so it believe that when the players ""really try to do something with all their might"" they sometimes can change the outcome. just like how in real life, a severely damaged person or animal can ""struggle a bit"" before he die.

The Cardinal will make some change to that player's status and let him to it in game as well.

it's is always monitoring the people's emotions and mind and can decide to do something it believe to be correct.

&amp;#x200B;

this is farther proved in the novel at different events in the story, for example there is a NPC that was suppose to die in Beta, it was an always fail scenario in a quest. but because Asuna refuse to accept what everyone thought, ""take it easy and let the quest scene finish and the npc die to proceed to next part""

and because she fight very seriously completely trying to use all her strength and save that NPC. Cardinal changed the quest on the go and that NPC was saved.  this happen in floor 3. not even too far in the aincrad.   


  
I believe Cardinal's behavior and ""development"" was even out of Kayaba's imagination, as the unexpected huge ""growth"" of an AI is a part of SAO Story as a whole. later mentioned about Yui and partially about fluctlights as well.

"weedstocks","t5_2zfqj","Guys I need some real advice because I just found out I need to close my account permanently and I am kind of pissed about it. 

My wife works for Morgan Stanley. She disclosed to her manager today that I have been actively trading, and have been successful using my etrade account that I have had longer than we have even been married. Prior to this, they did not know that I participated in the market. She ended up getting called into the compliance office, and now im basically fucked sideways because her firm does not allow spouses to hold investment accounts outside of the firm. 

The firm is stupid expensive as they don't really condone active trading. Commisions are 1% of trades (buy and sell), and options are comparatively expensive. Hell even Dollar Cost Averaging is going to be expensive. 

To make matters worse they really don't have an interactive investment hub, so basically everything that I have learned that has made me a better trader is either being taken away from me, or getting economically unsustainable. 

This is really the type of firm that would prefer I pay an annual fee to some guy for him to tell me which mutual funds to buy based on whoever is the firms best sponsor is at the time.  

This is the worst possible timing for me as most of the sector is really overbought, and I made some mistakes on Cron Puts this week that I am not going to have much time to make up for it. 

As of today my only position is 6,010 shares of Aphria . Last week I had 8,000 shares and would also like to put myself in a situation to make up the $13,000 I have missed.

What should I do? What would you do?

1. Should I just let my current Aphria position ride
2. Should I Diversify within the sector, what would I even buy today that would be a good long? VFF, CGC?
3. Should I Diversify outside the sector, whats even worth buying outside of weestocks? AMD? Snap?
4. Should I sell my position and spend the whole bag on 2020 Aphria calls for maximum gain potential? 
5. Divorce my wife (Not really an option, but fuck do i do?)

A few tips:

* I've DM'd you a link to submit your round with the correct title.
* Make sure your round can't be solved using Reverse-Image-Search (RIS):
    * Google isn't the only RIS engine! Try using a browser extension like Reveye ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reveye-ris/)) to check multiple engines at once.
    * If you need to, you can apply a mask to your image to trick RIS. Try our online masking tool [here](https://imagemasker.github.io).
* Once you've got the next round up, let us know how you solved this one!
* Feel free to join us in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D2t9fN2) to discuss your round and future rounds.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","&gt; That assumes that Tywin knew Ned would be the one sitting on the Iron Throne, passing the judgment - which assumes he knew that Robert would be off hunting. And since Robert going off on a hunt was a complete coincidence, there is no way Tywin could've predicted that.

I actually think it's a pretty good bet that Ned would be taking petitioners instead of Robert regardless of whether Robert is hunting. Robert is very much an absentee king.

That's an interesting plan, but there's two problems with it:

1) There's no way the conflict would have reached the point of Edmure Tully personally engaging without word reaching King's Landing, as we see - the word comes back to the capital after Clegane raids one village. If what you say is true the scene where Ned sits the Iron Throne would have him receiving news of Edmure's capture, not of one village being raided.

2) What happens when news reaches KL of Tyrion's capture and Ned immediately says Catelyn did it on his orders, as he did? it's hard to claim that he is defending himself against Tully aggression when the Starks are taking credit for the Tully's ""offenses"".",1548979543

"onguardforthee","t5_3icow","Well, Ontario, looks like we're partying like its 1999.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time municipal integration and downloading by the Harris government was complete, it was clear that little would be gained for the effort. Nobody had asked for it- it wasn't part of Harris's campaign. Promised savings never materialized; sure, it got a lot of expenses off the Province's books, but that didn't mean they disappeared. A lot of goodwill was burned up, and many communities lost truly local representation of their interests altogether. 

&amp;#x200B;

So too it will be with replacing the LHINs with a ""super agency"". Nobody is asking for this, and Ford didn't campaign on it- although his campaign was so vague and mealy-mouthed that he barely campaigned on any issue. It won't actually save any money: [LHINs represent a miniscule $90 million of the $30 billion they administer.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lhin-ontario-doug-ford-local-health-integration-networks-1.4980509) Optimistically, let's say we save $25 million- that's a savings of 0.83% of the overall healthcare budget. And it comes at the expense of eliminating local representation of healthcare interests.

&amp;#x200B;

Doug Ford knows it would be suicide to actually cut the healthcare budget, but he has to find savings somehow because increasing taxes is out of the question. The LHINs are an easy target: the public doesn't really know what they do, they can easily be characterized as ""administrative"" dead weight, and Doug just has a hate-boner for bureaucracy in general. But I believe he is also doing this to obtain tighter control over how health care funds are spent. Whether that means privatization or not I don't know, but it does mean health funding decisions driven by politicians, who are ignorant (in some cases, proudly so) of the needs of our system.",1548979544

Sony could have a similar influence next gen. The appeal of BC is for everyone, ESPECIALLY people who didn't buy into your market before.

It's true that Porzingis is coming off a major injury and it's possible that his health is fucked up beyond belief, but the Suns should take chances on guys like him.

I truly believe his talent is worth the risk. Losing the cap flexibility would hurt, but it's not like the Suns have any guarantees that anyone is going to sign with a franchise that could finish with the worst record in the league 2 years in a row.

I understand the case for steering clear of Porzingis, but given how talent-starved the Suns are, he's a guy worth gambling on",1548979547

"PhysicsStudents","t5_2wo7k","**IF** your gen phys class is NOT calculus based then really the beat thing you can do is 

1) Understand the physics concepts and try to convince yourself they are true. You need a small foundation before you can go to higher level phys 

2) Familiarize yourself with any equations given. At this stage, and I know it‚Äôs sucks and may be hard, but at this stage you really won‚Äôt be given derivations of formulas. You have to just accept and use them. From my past experience these gen phys clases are more to show you the branches of physics and to make you practice your problem solving skills. Essentially, you‚Äôll be given a problem, need to figure out which equation or concept to use. It‚Äôs grunt work but we all start somewhere 

3) As anyone will say, practice makes perfect. 

4) [ Optional ] I tend to lean more toward the math side of physics and like to generalize problems using simple algebra. Perhaps making up problems or extending problems by generalizing them may help. For example, perhaps a problem about projectile motion asks you find the range or where it will fall given some initial velocity at some angle. But maybe let the velocity and angle be variables and see where it takes you. You‚Äôll see kinda how things unfold 


However if your gen phys class does depend on calculus. The above apply but you should also really understand the idea of a derivative and why it‚Äôs defined that way. I hope I helped, I‚Äôm not the beat with advice ",1548979547

"canada","t5_2qh68","3 things,

1. I did mention NDP is more left than Liberal already.

2. Communism like many leftist ideals, doesn‚Äôt work out the way it‚Äôs planned on paper ‚Äî who in the right mind would give up all their power to just let society govern itself? There are many more issues to communism that fundamentally makes it a futile method of political governance, many of which fall short not realizing the selfish nature of human beings; it turns out seizing the means of production only ceased the means of production, and thus People‚Äôs Republic of China is becoming more capitalistic than ever in its recent years of economical boom (may I remind you that Jack Ma is in the top 10 richest business men globally, in a ‚ÄúCOMMUNIST‚Äù country). 

Unless you are going with the ‚Äúreal communism hasn‚Äôt been tried‚Äù simplistic special snowflake mentality, then there‚Äôs no way for this matter to be resolved except for death, lots of bloodshed and deaths, before people would learn their lessons yet again.

3. The taxes we pay in Canada is within top 10 highest per capita globally as a function of and from low to lower upper classes. 

People in Canada who are dissatisfied with the socialized healthcare system is in the majority (who would‚Äôve thought most Canadians didn‚Äôt live in major cities collectively /s). In fact, the socialized healthcare system is so bad that decent doctors (namely specialists) tend to migrate to the US (again, who would‚Äôve thought that limiting the income of skill workers to not let their income reflect their individual ability to perform specialized tasks would drive them away? /s)
To combat this phenomenon, med schools in Canada have many ways to coerce graduating medical professionals to stay in Canada to practice medicine such as crippling amounts of national loan to money gouging tuition and enrolment fees, and some sort of waiver (I forgot the name my med school friends told me) that new med students need to sign indicating they must practise in Canada for x years after graduation, etc.  As a result (at least partially), we have an endless supply of family doctors (lazy bum money grabbers that can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do anything serious and just refer anything mildly serious to specialists), and super scarce amount of specialists (average wait time is up to years for non-emergency but easily life impairing and/or chronic illnesses) ‚Äî sounds similar to ceasing the means of production above, doesn‚Äôt it? Well, this is no coincidence.

On a separate, more social issue, you might‚Äôve heard of bill C-16 that passed and is a troublesome one especially in Ontario because of the radically left leaning ontario human rights organization, where the devils in the details of bill C 16 give jurisdiction power to regional pubic sectors such as this one to regulate speech deemed convictive arbitrarily by the law enforcement and ‚Äúvictim‚Äù resulting in legal charges up to incarceration. If this doesn‚Äôt sound like the beginning of governmental power abuse to you, then I don‚Äôt know what your definition of freedom might be. Before some of you might start, I am a visible minority myself; I just happen to think from a logical perspective on these things, I know people who commit hate crimes exist, but I know a LOT of people who utilizes abusive legal forces also exist. Take a look at Wilfred Laurier University Lindsay Shepherd controversy or perhaps any other controversies happening at any uni/college campuses; shit like this happens in broad day light, evil fears no exposure when the system is corrupt. 

I‚Äôm a normal citizen just like you too, I‚Äôd urge you think who‚Äôs side you‚Äôd want to be on carefully. 

I‚Äôm not conservative neither, if this helps you rethink what/whom you identify as ‚Äúcentric‚Äù.",1548979548

"EternalCardGame","t5_3byur","&gt; Empower Aggro, in this regard, is no different. If the enemy plays Hailstorm, you lose. So you stop playing it, they stop playing Hailstorm, you start playing it again, repeat ad nauseam. Its a bad deck that wins by relying on the enemy not teching any cards against it. Which they probably wont at first because its bad.

Part of the reason I have been running Shadow is to either use [[Shakedown]] to strip cards like [[Hailstorm]] from a hand, or to use [[Haunting Scream]] to kill out of nowhere. In aggro/combo decks, Shakedown is very strong because you want to remove their cheap removal spells, and expect to get more use out of the Nightfall trigger than your opponent.

In particular though, many of the combo-like finishes involve doubling damage - meaning that exactly 25 is difficult to do, but 24 is a common number (6 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 24).

Aggro/Combo has (largely) replaced aggro, but you do still see plenty of Rajani Aggro on ladder, and lately I've seen plenty of Primal/Fire (Skycrag? I forget the name) aggro featuring plenty of Aegis.

Aegis has been showing its strength vs. decks that like to rely on Hailstorm to clear the board.",1548979548

For example the unsolvability of the halting problem - another famous diagonalization argument - is often presented by assuming you have a solution and making a sort of liars paradox by diagonalizing. But you don‚Äôt need the assumption you have a solution. Just imagine you have an arbitrary program that isn‚Äôt necessarily trying to solve the halting problem (or at least it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be succeeding) and then you can write a program that is a counterexample to that particular program predicting whether it halts, in fact you can write a program that takes an arbitrary program as input and outputs a ‚Äúcounterexample‚Äù program to it correctly predicting whether all programs halt. The proof is exactly the same you just don‚Äôt bother to make the assumption that you have a solution because you don‚Äôt need that assumption, and what the proof is actually doing is much clearer and less likely to lead to confusion.",1548979549

Bought the lanyard and wear it everyday for school, definitely a good buy. The clip on the back of the lanyard is one that is easy to pull apart and put back together; if you need to readjust you'll be done in a few seconds.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt;  is because of the hyper-rich refusing to pay people a living wage

How do you think the real world works? Businesses just voluntarily pay high costs for goods or labor? Do you pay extra for the things you buy? Does that make you a bad person?

Every business that's ever existed has tried to maximize their revenue while minimizing their costs. Even then, something like 90% fail. Running a successful business is very difficult. You can't just pay everybody $30/hour.

Besides, nobody owes you anything. The idea that people should voluntarily pay above market wages when they don't expect it to be worth the cost is laughable. It will never happen.

The real reason wages have stagnated is that there is far more labor competing for a similar number of jobs. Women work now, nearly doubling the labor force. We've had tens of million of immigrants. And over 2 billion more workers are in the global economy, with India, China, and other 3rd world countries being the biggest labor source for multinational corporations. Oh, and private unions in the US are nearly dead.

If you want higher wages you have to either increase productivity or reduce the supply of labor.",1548979554

And to 19 different organizations? Just wondering...how much of that is going towards administration and such? If so, how much of that is an unnecessary duplication? Just recently, there were three organizations involved in veterans food bank initiatives and the talk was how that was making a mess of what the overall goal was. Why not consolidate some of it, some of the organizations? I‚Äôm not pigeonholing them all saying they all deliver the EXACT same service, but consolidation often leads to savings in terms of administration expenditures and such....money that can then be focused front line.

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in that as well, radiant garden would REALLY benefit from an open world expansion. I hope we get the following in a DLC package:

* full radiant garden access including sephiroth battle and some final fantasy characters

* full twilight town access including new struggle, revisiting seifer‚Äôs gang

* full land of departure postgame access? I have a couple of ideas about this one. As it is now, land of departure is only the hall for one fight and one moment in game, but it would be cool to see the rest of the land, maybe not as sora, but as aqua/terra/ven. And hopefully maybe even a revisiting of the mirage arena with online access! Total pipe dream though.

* being able to freely explore scala ad caelum without the xehanort fight, cus holy shit is it beautiful

* returning to destiny islands, maybe even going to the main island this time! It really sucks that we couldn‚Äôt get to actually play destiny islands, only got cutscenes.

* some realm of darkness visitation and exploration with mobility thats better than anything from 0.2, although probably not ever gonna happen because we already got 0.2

It seems like all these worlds have already been built, or at least the necessary parts for the cutscenes have been built. It‚Äôd be weird for the dev team to not do anything with them after working so hard on expansive maps.

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","Silverstream and Gallus actually have a lot of potential for matchup between them. Not only do they work well together when they've paired off in the show, but their individual differences flow well as well, such as Gallus always smiling even as he rolls his eyes when Silverstream geeks out over something new and ordinary. He seems to find it a bit endearing, while Silverstream is always one of the first to pull him out of his cynicism. Basically, they play off one another well, which is a good starting point.

They're also both relentlessly optimistic in the face of their hardships, while having different enough ones that they can help the other overcome it. It was brought up in a pony discussion the other day that if not for Gallus' backstory, Silverstream would have the most difficult one: She's literally a child of war and exile.

But both of them charge past that with their own strengths, which means they compliment one another's weaknesses when their own strength isn't enough. The other's is something their own can overcome (at least, in Gallus' case as we saw in the ""test"" episode).

I don't know about Sandbar/Occellus, though I can see it now that you point it out, but Gallus and Silverstream is definitely a viable long-term friendship with openings for more.

Huh, come to think of it, it'd be poetic as well. If they hooked up, Gallus would fall into the hippogryph noble class ... which means he'd probably be more loaded than any other griffon, while being one of the few that it would no longer matter to.",1548979561

Hong Kong (CNN)Since the beginning of January, the Chinese military has revealed a dizzying array of sophisticated and powerful new weaponry.

The testing of some of these devices has been accompanied by great fanfare. But just how plausible is the new technology in a battlefield situation?

With Tuesday's report from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that China ""leads the world"" in some weapons systems, a closer look at Beijing's latest claims is in order.

The mother of all bombs

State-run Global Times reported in early January that China had tested its version of the ""mother of all bombs,"" a named adopted from the US Air Force's Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, or MOAB, which it dropped on an Afghan cave complex in 2017.
China's version of the weapon is second only in power to a nuclear bomb, according to the Global Times report. Pictures accompanying the story showed the weapon falling from the bomb bay of what was said to be an H-6K jet bomber and then a huge, fiery blast on the ground.
""The massive blast can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defense shelters,"" Global Times quoted military analyst Wei Dongxu as saying.
The report says the Chinese MOAB is smaller and lighter than its American counterpart, which enabled it to be dropped from the bomber much like a conventional weapon, unlike the US version which is essentially shoved out the back of a C-130 cargo plane. As a result, China claims its version of a massive, non-nuclear explosive will be more accurate than its US counterpart.
Verdict: Plausible. China has been trying to copy military technology from others and refine it to its needs. But even with what it says is its superior delivery method, the bomb's deployment in battle would likely require full air superiority.
The 'Underground Steel Great Wall'

A story posted on the PLA's English-language website on January 13 proclaims the Underground Steel Great Wall (USGW) to be a set of defensive installations set deep under mountainous terrain at an undisclosed location somewhere in China.
The wall is intended to protect secure military bases from enemy attack. According to the report, the rock of the mountains would withstand much of a potential blast. The ""steel"" part of the wall, meanwhile, is a reference to the work of Qian Qihu, a scientist who is said to have figured out how to provide extra blast protection to vulnerable exits and entrances.
Qian says his work will provide protection from future hypersonic weapons, missiles that can fly five to 10 times the speed of sound, and can change direction in flight to avoid missile defenses while delivering nuclear warheads.
""Qian's work guaranteed the safety of the country's strategic weapons, launch and storage facilities as well as commanders' safety during extreme times,"" military expert Song Zhongping says in the story.
Verdict: Skeptical. Though Russia claims to have a hypersonic missile ready for deployment, one has never been used in combat so developing ""steel"" that can withstand such a weapon would seem theoretical at best.
Ship-killer ballistic missiles

After the US Navy sent a guided-missile destroyer near Chinese-claimed islands in the South China Sea on January 10, Chinese state media said the People's Liberation Army had deployed DF-26 ballistic missiles ""capable of targeting medium and large ships"" at sea.
A Global Times report said the deployment of the missiles with a range of 3,400 miles (5,471 kilometers) ""is a good reminder that China is capable of safeguarding its territory.""
The DF-26, unveiled during a military parade in 2015 in Beijing, was originally seen as an intermediate range ballistic missile for use against land targets. Analysts dubbed it the ""Guam killer"" owing to the fact it brought the US Pacific island and its important military bases within China's missile reach.
But China has never offered proof that it has tested the DF-26 in the anti-ship configuration, able to target warships on the move.
Verdict: Skeptical. Military analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, says no military has ever successfully developed an anti-ship ballistic missile. And actually using one in combat would require multiple practice launches to refine tactics and procedures, something that China has shown no evidence of having done.
Two-seat stealth fighter-bomber

A new version of the J-20 stealth fighter, introduced into the PLA Air Force fleet in February 2018, could be configured into fighter-bombers as well as electronic warfare and aircraft carrier-based versions, according to a report on the PLA's English-language website.
Those versions of the twin-engine jet might also include a seat for a second pilot, said the report, picked up from Global Times.
""All current stealth fighter jets feature single-seat, so the potential J-20 variant might become the first two-seat stealth fighter jet in the world,"" the report said, citing China Central Television.
The report said a second crew would be needed to handle the flood of information coming into the J-20's digital battlefield systems.
Verdict: Likely. The US DIA's China report said ""the PLAAF is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets. Stealth technology continues to play a key role in the development of these new bombers."" These new bombers could be operational within six years, the DIA said.
Super soldiers with futuristic weapons

Hand-held knives that fire bullets, pistols that shoot around corners and assault rifles that launch grenades. Those are just some of the things China wants to equip its special forces with to create ""super soldiers,"" according to a story on the PLA website.
The bullet knives could be used when enemies are close, and the corner pistols would allow soldiers to hide behind walls while engaging foes coming at them from a right angle, according to the report.
The rifle-grenade launcher combo provides ""the strongest individual firepower in the world,"" and connects the battlefield using digital sensors, a positioning system and data sharing, the report says.
Military analyst Wei Dongxu calls the new arms ""sci-fi"" weapons that will make one Chinese soldier the equal of 10 adversaries.
Verdict: Plausible. While the weapons may sound a bit like something Q developed for James Bond, China isn't the first country to work on these kinds of things. In 2015, the US Defense Advanced Research Products Agency said it was developing .50-caliber bullets with optical sensors that could change direction in mid-air.

"Sino","t5_38jyn","A New Year's Eve report in the South China Morning Post said China has completed a massive Wireless Electromagnetic Method (WEM) radio antenna.
The WEM consists of high-voltage wires strung form steel towers arranged in a cross pattern 60 kilometers wide and 80 to 100 kilometers long, according to the SCMP report. As a rectangle on the map, that would cover and area of 3,700 square kilometers, just shy of the area of Shanghai, though China has not given the exact location of the antenna for security reasons.
Connected to power stations underground, the setup can send out extremely low frequency (ELF) radio signals that can travel through the Earth's crust for 3,500 kilometers, the report said.
Why would this be needed? It's how you get orders to submarines without them having to surface. And as analyst Joseph Trevithick writes on The War Zone blog, China has the world's largest submarine fleet.
Trevithick says ELF communication would allow China's nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines to stay deeper in the ocean than other methods do. That would make them harder to detect and enhance their standing as a nuclear second-strike deterrent. The problem with the system is that it allows only one-way text communication, from base to sub.
Verdict: Likely. The technology is far from new so it's more of an infrastructure investment than any scientific breakthrough. The US Navy once based such systems in Michigan and Wisconsin, but shut them down early this century when better technologies were developed.
Naval rail gun

Reports in state-run media from early January said China would 'soon' be able to deploy electromagnetic railguns on its warships.
In theory, railguns will fire metal shells using an electrical rather than an explosive charge -- a potentially revolutionary development in weapons technology that would render gunpowder obsolete. With a range over 100 miles, the projectile would travel at up to nine times the speed of sound (6,850 mph). It would also use kinetic rather than explosive energy to destroy its target.
With no explosive residue, the electromagnetic railgun is expected to be more accurate and easier to maintain than conventional artillery.
Photos of what was said to be a railgun mounted on a PLA Navy landing ship circulated around the internet early this month.
A Global Times story quoted a Chinese naval expert, Li Jie, as saying the photos mean China's railgun may be in the final stages of testing. The weapon could be destined for use on China's brand-new Type 55 destroyers, among the most sophisticated on the planet, when operational, the report said.
Verdict: Plausible. The US Navy, too, has been working to perfect a railgun, and had the jump on China in development, said Schuster, the military analyst at Hawaii Pacific University. But China is catching up fast, he says, and may beat the US to actual deployment. Both could have working railguns at sea in less than a decade, he says.
'Flying saucer-like' stealth drone

Chinese television showed Beijing's new stealth Sky Hawk drone in flight for the first time in early January, boasting of the aircraft's ability to fly ""faster, farther and avoid detection.""
A report from state-sponsored Global Times called the drone ""flying saucer-like."" The aircraft, however, is in fact closer in appearance to the US Air Force's B-2 stealth bomber, albeit in miniature.
The Sky Hawk was on static display at Airshow China in Zhuhai in November, at which time the state-run Xinhua news service interviewed the aircraft's chief designer, Ma Hongzhong, who touted its features.
""It could very well be hidden from view, and it could have stronger capabilities of attack, defense and survival when it is used in combat,"" Ma said in a video interview.
He also said the craft represented an advance in aerodynamics that offer greater endurance, plus a larger interior that gives it the ability to carry more fuel and weapons.
Verdict: Plausible. The Sky Hawk is one of a series of drones in an expanding Chinese program for the unmanned aerial vehicles, with Chinese military use and export sales both being targeted. Despite the ballyhooing over the Sky Hawk flight, Song told Global Times that China still lags behind the US in stealth drone development. In 2013, the US Navy successfully launched and recovered a similar looking drone, the X-47B on an aircraft carrier. That aircraft in 2015 also successfully conducted an in-flight refueling.
Homegrown aircraft carrier

News reports say the PLA Navy's first homegrown aircraft carrier has completed its fourth round of sea trials and returned to the port where it was built, the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (DSIC) shipyard in Dalian.
Before the carrier left for those trials, Global Times said the fourth round of tests was expected to focus on the ship's air wing, with tests being run on radar, air traffic control and launch and landing equipment on the 50,000-ton ship.
Wang Yunfei, a naval expert and retired PLA Navy officer, told Global Times it was possible J-15 fighter jets would try a takeoff-and-landing exercise during the fourth sea trial. Photos of the ship on its return to Dailan after 13 days at sea showed a J-15 and a helicopter on its deck, according to the South China Morning Post.

The latter report quoted military expert Li Jie as saying the carrier could be officially delivered to the PLA Navy by April 23, when it could participate in a large fleet review off Shandong province for Chinese Navy Day.
Verdict: Likely. With rumors in state-sponsored media that the new carrier will be in the Navy Day fleet review, it would be embarrassing to the PLA Navy if it didn't make it. Plus, China's first carrier, the Liaoning, and the new Type 55 destroyer, one of the largest and most sophisticated warships in Asia, are expected to be in the naval parade, according to Global Times. An image of all three sailing together would be a great, patriotic sight for domestic consumption.

Tell her, either though a mail, email, or your Mom that you do not wish to have contact, but it's not her fault, and you wish her all the best. Tell her you will answer ONE email, she can ask whatever she wants to know, and you will answer with whatever information you are willing to give and/or have.

I am 47 years old, and was adopted at birth in a closed adoption. My birth mother would have thought there was no way I could ever possibly find out who she is. DNA testing wasn't even a distant thought in the 70's, let alone computers and their capacity. I can't speak for all adoptees. And I don't have any desire to connect with my bio Mom. (though I am very, very thankful that she chose to give birth to me vs aborting me). But I think perhaps that is a fair solution to all involved.

As far as the circumstances of her conception? If she doesn't ask, don't tell her. If she does ask, answer her truthfully, but you can be as brief as you like. (ie ""your conception was a traumatic event. I did not know the man that fathered you"") would be enough to give her a picture without spelling it out. Mostly likely your Mom may have hinted at it or told her outright already anyhow. At any rate, those are my thoughts. Best wishes in whatever you decide.",1548979569

i was not giving a  deep analysis of Keynesian theory here 



the drug economy is different. there is no substitute for someone's drug of choice. this is no competition.
the nature of the beast makes price fixing obligatory. there is a long retail chain with the per unit cost being increased at each step. 

cocaine for example 

a ton of leaf to start with costs only about $400 or $500/ton which is  ~$4/kilo

Farmers who process that coca leaf into a base paste and then sell that to traffickers can get about $900 a kilo . 

when that paste is turned into coke and s shipped up north, it goes for $10G-$20G 

by the time it makes it to the retailer, it's worth like $70G- $80G

by the time the street level dealer divide it into grams cut it with baking soda etc., a pure kilo is worth equivalent of about $150G

if i could make a pen for $4 and sell it to you for $150G, you could not stop me from making pens 

make it legal so it can be subjected to normal market forces and all that money goes away

but that will never happen

&gt; The Alan Parsons Project was a British rock group active from 1975 until 1990, founded by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson both from London, England. The group is based on a number of regular group members such as Stuart Elliot and Ian Bairnson, complemented with varying lead vocals such as Colin Blunstone (the Zombies), Chris Rainbow and Gary Brooker (Procol Harum).  The group is well known for its concept albums, which cover themes such as Edgar Allan Poe, Gaudi, and Freud. 

&gt; Eric Woolfson wrote most of the music and lyrics while Alan Parsons overviewed the production process. Prior to starting his Project, Parsons worked as an engineer with names such as the Beatles(Abbey Road, the Get Back roofttop concert) and Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother).

&gt; Since the 1990s Alan Parsons has been performing live shows, touring all over the world, but without Eric Woolfson. Read more on Last.fm.

It would be way easier for them to be viewed as mature for taking care of their kid (if abortion were illegal) rather than questioned for keeping a baby they weren't ready to have.

There are plenty of people on this sub who've been bingoed with some form of ""kids will just happen to you"" like you have no say in the matter.

They are all trying to convince you to live your life the way they think you should. But the truth is that only YOU know what is best for you. You knew that you didn't want to get pregnant, and your sister shamed you for wanting to prevent pregnancy, your so-called ""friends"" shamed you for wanting to prevent pregnancy. They are gaslighting you by telling you that no, they know better than you what you want out of your life, and are ignoring and dismissing your clearly stated wishes. And they all ACTIVELY SABOTAGED your efforts to not get pregnant.

And your husband -- he does not get to have sex with you whenever and however he pleases just because you are married. Consent is always required, each time, for every act. You told him you didn't want to get pregnant, and he ignored you and came inside of you anyway, when he did not have your consent to do so. He raped you. And now he is gaslighting you by telling you that of course you want a baby, even though you kept telling him that you wanted to put off getting pregnant.

You can love someone, and hate their actions. You can love someone, and not like them very much.

To answer your question, how to deal with becoming a mom before you are ready, and how to stop resenting your husband -- that is above Reddit's paygrade. 

I would honestly recommend you talk to a counselor. NOT one affiliated with your church, or your religion. You need to talk to someone who is unbiased, who will lay out your options, and who will not judge you for the options you consider and the choice you ultimately make, and someone who is bound by confidentiality. 

You are not wrong to resent your husband. You are not wrong to not want to be pregnant right now. You are not wrong for wanting to control your own life and your own body. And anyone who tries to tell you that you are wrong for feeling those things and wanting those things -- *they* are wrong. They don't get to control how you feel or what you want out of life.

For example give all injectors a 30 day cool down period.  If you try to use the same injector with the 30 days the skill points you get are a fractional equivalent of the amount of time left on the timer.

So say you use a 50k skill injector on January 1st, if you try to use another 50k injector on January 4th , only one tenth of the time has passed so you get 10% of the skill points 5k.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;The greatest trick literally ever played was rich white men (democrats) flipping their stance on race and convincing poor black people to vote for them rather than the other rich white men (republicans).

This is my entire argument...... and it's correct. Democrats literally flipped their stance on blacks and proceeded to use that against them to continue to do nothing for blacks since ""the party flip"". Saying that the War on Drugs was an attack on only blacks is incredibly irreponsible of you. During the 1960's when the war on drugs started were coming from central and south america at the same time that communist countries were popping up left and right and Reagan didn't want illegal, recreationally used habits to singlehandedly fund the communist nations he was fighting to keep away. Again, saying that the war on drugs was racist is incredibly irresponsible of you.

I don't understand why I'm still even debating with you. The fact is that democrats flipped their stance on race. That's a fact. If your opinion is that Democrats are succeeding at addressing the problems facing black americans, then you're more than entitled to your own opinion. But it's a fact that democrats flipped, it's a fact that Trump has done more for blacks in his first two years in office than Obama did in his first two years in office, and apparently you either fail to grasp those concepts or you're so blinded by your obvious hate for the orange man in the oval office that you so desperately want him to be racist, that you refuse to see reason.

"Jazz","t5_2qmm6","Your premise is flawed.   
    
People don‚Äôt have to be motivated to seek it out.  If you read some of the threads here on r/jazz, you‚Äôll find many situations where jazz found the person instead.  They heard a song on the radio or a tv commercial that made them want to check it out.  Or they were in a restaurant or bar or coffee shop or some public place where it was playing and that made them want to hear more.  Or a free concert in the park.  Or any number of ways that music reaches us.  We get introduced to creative stuff all the time.  And for those who sought it out‚Ä¶ exploring music tastes is nothing remotely close to a privilege, especially with how many avenues are out there to reach any kind of music, and they‚Äôre the same as those that got you to find ‚Äúthe music you already like.‚Äù          
    
And please stop with the whole ‚Äúears versus no ears thing.‚Äù  The idea that you have to have an advanced or educated ear to enjoy jazz is a bunch of nonsense.  ANYBODY can get into jazz.  You don‚Äôt have to have a trained ear or anything.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if a person can‚Äôt tell the difference between a saxophone and a piano‚Ä¶ none of that matters for enjoying a form of music or not.  There‚Äôs nothing complicated about listening to jazz and listening to it is the same as listening to any other music.   

And f you have ‚Äúmore things to worry about than exploring [your] music tastes,‚Äù then good for you.  That‚Äôs got nothing to do with anybody else‚Äôs motivations for listening to music.  You seem to be conflating your own opinion as some sort of grand pronouncement on the state of things.  It‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs just you.    
    
As far as musicians learning to play music, yes, that‚Äôs different than being a music fan, which I stated in my original post.  Some things require more effort in life than other things.  It‚Äôs na√Øve to think otherwise.  If a musician wants to play jazz, they‚Äôll have to, like, study stuff.    
    
And take some responsibility for your original post.  Perhaps if people aren‚Äôt getting your point, consider that it might be because you didn‚Äôt explain it well to begin with.

I'm mostly worried that giving them each 2 magic items wouldn't be enough to stop it from being a one sided fight. 

I've already got a plan to streamline the bandit turn so it's not me rolling 20 times against them, and I kinda want this to be uncontested for them, just based on what i know about the players and how the mood will likely be at the end of the night. Just a fun chance for them to feel cool.

Longer time controls are not easy, and those 90+30 are hard, specially in the end. You don¬¥t get extratime and probably you will have an endgame with less than 10 minutes on the clock, so basically you¬¥ll have to play with the extratime a large amount of moves. This is very stressful for the mind and your calculation skills suffer. I think it¬¥s normal. 

Just take it easy, and go to the next game with clean head. Everything is learning process. 

I would remove from your mental ecuation the *had a won position* way of thinking. You are much better, better, whatever, but the game is not over until it¬¥s over. And this way of thinking just indirectly relax your attention and you are more willing to make mistakes. I often say when you are ahead of material is when you more focus have to remain.

Still firsts are firsts so that's not bad, and they do get cap space which is good but given their situation who even wants to go there? If KP didn't even want to stay I doubt anyone will want to go there. Mavs now have like no first round picks ever again but two of the best young players in the league so whatever.

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","Large+ Greatswords and Ballista's don't actually exist as player facing weapons, so its up to DMs how they interact with abilities, and what their properties really are. 

I mean, technically, even if you want to dig into what the DMG says, it says:

&gt; A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to use at all.

Animate Weapon is still an attack roll, so even if you rule that it works with a Large Weapon and give them a Large Weapon, you'd still have disadvantage, which is the same penalty anyone else has. It doesn't say anything about holding the weapon in your hands like some sort of Fighter.

Ultimately I don't think this one is a problem. A Ballista is usually treated as a creature stat block or a specific plot item (I don't actually know if there's an official one, but it might be in the DMG somewhere), and large weapon rules seem in the DMG - which is the DM's turf anyway - seems to cover with an adequate solution the issue.

I do appreciate the people pointing out stuff like this that they find though, and if its something that comes up a lot I may adjust wording, just to me it looks like it's already covered for the most part in this instance.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I'll never buy anything from Epic again, including on their store, but for a different reason.

Back before Fortnite was a PvP game, it was an early access PvE co-op shooter. I guess it still is, but nobody cares. Anyway, back then I spent a couple hundred bucks buying in to the early access for me and some friends so we could play it. Figured it'd be Gears of War horde-mode plus some base building, and I was willing to buy in.

Several things went terribly wrong with this:

The loot progression in the pay-to-play mode was still almost 100% lootbox based. This would have been okay, as the early access pack gave you ""X free lootboxes"".

After downloading, you learn that you can only open one of those included lootboxes a day. Fine, but if you didn't play a day, you lost the lootbox. So of the couple hundred we were collectively entitled to and paid for, we redeemed maybe thirty.

This was doubly stupid because it was an early access game, with not a ton of content, and so waiting a week or two between patches made total sense. Also, we were all employed with our own families, so playing a base-building game every night wasn't exactly practical.

Even with the lootbox rip-off/scam, we'd have kept doing this for a while... except they pivoted to this not-what-we-paid-for PvP battle royale game and pretty much stopped development on the PvE mode.

I once bought 4 Xbox 360s so we could play Gears of War horde mode each on our own TVs in one room LAN-party style. Some of the best game nights I've ever had. Sad to see where they are now.",1548979583

An ad from McDonald's Taiwan that sparked a row about whether it showed support for the country's independence from China has been withdrawn.

The commercial, broadcast on YouTube, showed a student's exam admission ticket stating her nationality as Taiwanese. She drops the ticket on the street and it's run over by a truck, before being washed clean by a water sprayer. The ad then rewinds and the student is shown eating an Egg McMuffin, known as a Man Fu Bao ‚Äî which reportedly has a similar pronunciation in Mandarin to ""full of good luck.""

People in China protested against the ad online, accusing the company of supporting an independent Taiwan, according to a report on the Focus Taiwan website on Saturday.

McDonald's Taiwan said the ad promoted its Egg McMuffin and aimed to boost students' morale, while McDonald's China said it supported the ""One China"" principle. ""We regret about the ad which had stirred up such an unnecessary misunderstanding,"" McDonald's in China said on its Weibo page, according to Focus Taiwan. ""We always hold a solid 'One China' stance and we are determined to continue to support China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

The ad was posted on YouTube on December 6 and withdrawn on December 18 after the online backlash, but McDonald's Taiwan did not say whether it removed the ad because of the protests.

Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged against ""foreign interference"" in China's relationship with Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as a province that has no right to international recognition as a separate political entity and has increased pressure on multinational companies to refer to Taiwan as part of China.

""Deviating from the 'One China' principle will make the situation of cross (strait) relations tense and chaotic. That's harming the interests of our Taiwan compatriots,"" Xi said, according to an official English-language translation of a speech broadcast on state media on January 1.

Last week, Alex Huang, the spokesperson for Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, said it would not bow to pressure from China.

McDonald's China and McDonald's Taiwan had not responded to CNBC's requests for comment at the time of publication.

Now, it's not like we had the money to pay for these tax cuts, they both increased the Federal Deficit dramatically, so in other words, these terrible policies have BORROWED money on our Public Accounts, in order to shift large portions of the proceeds to the already wealthy.  

I'm a middle class person, and I pay taxes.  My 22 year old son is working hard and paying taxes.  We are asked, ""by what right do we have to expect the rich to pay more?""

Don't wait.  Do it now.

Even if that means heading to lowsec in a Corvette (free rookie ship), and dying almost instantly after locking-target on someone [Actually, I find I last a lot longer than I expect, when I use a Corvette.]

Get used to dying.  Especially now when you are in cheap ships.

[My favorite ship was my own design:  a smart-bomb and energy draining nosferatu Condor (T1 Caldari frigate), with a shield booster.  Very strange, and unconventional.  I found that I could almost run the shield booster continuously if I kept my capacitor low enough.  I never killed anything aside from NPC and drones, but had tons of fun experimenting with what worked for me.]

Get used to congratulating the victor, even if they smack-talk you.  Note that it is really hard for someone to hurl insults at you, when you are already hurling bigger insults at yourself ... and laughing them all off.  Never loose your temper.  Always laugh it off.  It is just a game after all.

Get used to asking people for advice, especially people that destroy your ships;  ask them what you should have done differently, or if you did anything good at all.  Nobody knows everything in Eve (10yrs here, and I don't claim to know it all), so don't be afraid to ask!

Make friends.  That's where the true power in Eve is.

If the scaling down is removed, you could scale the raid up without the need for an alt that had at least ~95 combat to average out at 115. What this would mean is that while it may seem like a good idea to let people scale the raid as hard as they want, it would make things very hectic by effectively increasing the average points per 'meta' raid and drive down the price of uniques as a result. Being limited to requiring a half decent account to scale the raids up has essentially added a requirement to scaling raids up for more points. While it might seem like this hurts the little guy (and it does), the negative there pales in comparison to the negatives of removing the limit.

Also, 115 combat is really not too hard to get. You're likely not really ready for endgame content if you don't have the ability to achieve that req. You'll spend far more time learning to raid efficiently than you would getting the combat reqs from nightmare zone.",1548979589

&gt; they should be taxed on it at the same rate YOU are taxed

That already happens today.

You dont pay the same amount of taxes as someone making 100k or 200k. Do you understand our current tax system? 

People pay taxes based on their income as they meet different thresholds. So if you make $65,000, the money you earn after $38,701 is taxed at 22%. Everything below 38,700 is taxed at a different rate.

The only difference between now and what Osceola Crouton proposed is a few more tiers of rates.

So the guy making 1 million, 10 million and 100 million a year are all paying the same 37%. The proposed changes make it so the highest earners pay at a different bracket for the money that pases that threshold.

&gt; What happens if those people fuck off with their money overseas?

Historically that doesnt happen at the rate you believe it will happpen. If it was the case mass multi billionaires would be leaving Europe and moving to tax haven countries. Even with the U.S, mega rich people prefer location over cost.

So no, this has been proven wrong in the past within the U.S

"JonBenetRamsey","t5_2s3pg","I don't think either of them have commented on it. But I am not sure. 

&gt;Perhaps I am very naive, but the idea of a nine year old not only knowing what a garrotte was but also how to to craft and use one really seems far-fetched to me.

It was not a professional garrote. It was a rather unusual device similar to a boy scout's toggle-rope used in hiking. Burke was in the Scouts, so we know that physically he could have tied those knots. 

As for knowing what a garrote was, there is a passage in Kolar's book: 

&gt;[Susan] Stine had over overheard the boys [Burke and Doug Stine] discussing whether or not manual strangulation had been involved in JonBen√©t‚Äôs death. Stine described the conversation as being ""very impersonal"".

This indicates to me that Burke (and/or his friend Doug) knew about the distinction between strangling someone by hand and using a rope. Perhaps we ought to find a nine year old boy and ask him what he knows about strangulation. I think kids pick up a lot from the violence in TV/movies. 

But again, I'm not sure that the BDI explanation is the best or the simplest one. 

&gt; if you are interested then I‚Äôd be happy to share with you my theory of what happened that night

Yes please share, though if you are going to the trouble, you ought to make a new post in the sub so that more people can see/comment on it.

&gt;would JBR, at the age of six, really need her brother to feed her pre cut pineapple

No, but he could have made it and she simply ate some of it. Or Patsy could have made it for both of them. It is also possible that Jonbenet could have made it herself. People don't always leave fingerprints on everything they touch. 

It's possible that it's not pineapple, but quite a coincidence that the autopsy specifically mentioned pineapple, and that a bowl of pineapple was found on the table.

  I know your girlfriend said she's not into humiliation at all, but she might be into it a little and into you a lot, so she's just enjoying your relationship being her best ever and cautiously taking baby steps to be sure not to jeopardize it in any way.  
  
  She might be into the humiliation factor a little and might really enjoy seeing you in a babyish looking diaper. There are some just babyish, and others overbearingly made to look like little boy or girl diapers.  You should try and get a sample pack with babyish diapers that has a girly one in it. That way you'll know if she really get to see if you can make her even happier than you already are.  
  
  **YouAreMakingHerSoHappy** you can't even know. She might be afraid to ask for more because, don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  
  
  So try getting some babyish ones, some girly ones and some plain ones telling her you just want to find the ones that work best and you don't care about the looks of them because only you and her will see them. Then after you put them on tell her you do feel a little embarrassed or aware of how babyish in the baby looking ones are on you. Or how surprisingly girly the girly ones are and how humiliated you'd be if someone saw them peak out from your pants in public, but you enjoy how excited she gets so much you're not want to take that risk.

Then you download your results from Ancestry and upload them, for free, to Gedmatch.com, FamilyTreeDNA.com (FTDNA), MyHeritage.com, and LivingDNA.

"zedmains","t5_34mx4","I‚Äôm looking at the graphs on leagueofgraphs now and they are all so different to zed‚Äôs.

They support my hypothesis that zed drops off hard at 35 minutes. Jax seems to drop off at 45 minutes, which is so small a number of games that it‚Äôs less relevant, and azir (garbage and less applicable due to terrible balance) and kassadin spike at 45 mins. But, notably, kassadins win% is 55% for a whopping ten minutes of game time from 30-40, which means he is strong already and only gets stronger.

The change in gradient is what is indicative of a champion‚Äôs strength at a given point, not their total win%. This is totally supported by Lee sin and katarina (spiking and dropping at 15 minutes, implying a drop off) and the late champs (spiking at 35). Zed gets a little weaker than he was before at 15 (but still stronger than other champs), then gets stronger at 25, before dropping off at 35.

If the gradient is steady, the champion is neither getting weaker or stronger. They are simply gaining or losing the chance to win because of their current strength being acted out in the game. This can lead to increasing or decreasing win% depending on whether it is positive or negative.  You can think of the gradient as a unit like ‚Äòwins/minute‚Äô. If a champion stays at 2 wins/ minute, it‚Äôs win% increases. Jumping from 2 to 3 wins/min is a powerspike, and the reverse is a drop off.

This means that maintaining a high win% or increasing win% over time is the sign of strength, not the actual peak itself.",1548979596

I also believe we need to get a couple of DE. Brandon Graham, Trey Flowers, Shaquil Barrett. Hopefully none of them will break the bank for us but I really feel like this move will free us to take BPA at #4 in the Draft.

A starting RT should also be one of our priorities.

I'm conflicted about taking a LB here, I feel like we could address this issue in the draft with someone like Mack Wilson so I wouldn't say this is a priority. But I wouldn't be mad if we were to sign someone like Mosley or Barr.

Le'Veon Bell is an interesting subject, I feel like he would fit our offense incredibly well, but at the same time I wouldn't want to invest too much on a RB.

Ronald Darby will probably be the best CB available, but I'd prefer to draft someone like Baker of Murphy. Also, if Verrett is there for a cheap one year prove it deal, take him.

Go days with one or both almost constantly, or can have episodes almost daily. The important part is recognising them. Mania can be anything from compulsive shopping, ADHD style behaviour, or even high/strange sexual impulses. Depressive episodes can be anything from general depression to anger or anxiety, or any combination. It can be hard to spot compared to other illnesses (such as depression or ADHD) because of how similar symptoms are. The thing to watch for is if it happens in episodes, or if it is constant. If they have times where they don't feel it, and can recognise they were acting differently, it's more likely to be something bipolar. If they are always like it to an extent, it's more likely to be something else. Even trained doctors can struggle to tell the difference without careful study and observations. ",1548979597

This is the thing for me. I'm not sure how you can be a fan of something that, for the most part, is nothing more than an idea. As a product, it doesn't really exist yet.

I also think there's a lot of projection about what AEW will be. We know some tidbits from what Cody and The Bucks have said, but that's it.

And above all, we don't even know how successful they will be.

So all the people cheerleading seems premature and a bit obnoxious -- probably because it seems more driven by anti-WWE sentiment than anything.

That game goes either way, my dude.

Also, I don't think ""stories"" are an imperial unit, exactly. Like it's just literally saying how many floors there are in a house, but that's not actually a measure of it's height. Like a doll house could be 5 stories, but it's obviously gonna be smaller than an actual 2 story house.

13 miles vs 20 minutes isn't even about imperial or metric. That's just about what matters more. What matters is how long you're going to take, not the exact distance you'll be driving. And why exactly is a ""better division system"" useful anyway?

Fahrenheit was designed around a water and brine mixture, so your argument can be equally used for imperial. And in fact it's weirder, because it's not just ""water"" it's some solution of water and another thing.

Metric clocks and calendars don't work because we don't get to decide the time in seconds of a day, or the lengths of the seasons in days. But every other measurement doesn't have to be based around Earth's relationship to the sun, hence we can decide whatever works.

I'm sure you're right that metric isn't perfect, very little in this world is, but these arguments for it's problems are pretty terrible.",1548979598

"AppalachianTrail","t5_2stbz","I've posted this before, my advice to the SOs at home...

* If you don't already have one, get a copy of the AWOL guide (or whatever guide they're using) and follow along. When they tell you about places or terrain, you'll have a better idea of what they're talking about. You can also use it to help with maildrops or resupply points. My husband would often call or text and ask me to send him something at the next logical location and just let him know where to pick it up. It kept him from going crazy with logistics, and let me feel more involved in his hike. You're their trail boss - that's a big deal and can be lots of fun!

* I printed out a giant map of the AT and hung one at home and one in my office. Whenever I'd hear from my husband, I'd move his floating head up the trail. It was something to do every day and was fun to talk about with friends/family/co-workers.

* I asked friends and family to send care packages at certain points and made sure my husband knew to check for them. (Give them a specific idea of what to send, sometimes they'd send heavy stuff or things that aren't practical and he'd have to leave it behind or figure out how to mail it back home. Ask your partner what they need if in doubt.) Friends and family felt involved and it gave him a boost to get a surprise delivery of Aunt Molly's homemade cookies. Or a note from an old co-worker with $20 thrown in for a meal in town on them.

* I kept a daily journal while he was away. I'd write down things that happened at home that I'd ordinarily tell him about, whether silly or not. And I'd write down things that he told me had happened to him on the trail. He was really appreciative of it because he didn't write down a whole lot. His memory would be blurry because dates cease to exist on the trail and he can remember the where but not the when. Write down the silly details that they're apt to forget, including trail names of people they've met, even if just for a day. My husband still reads that journal and thanks me for keeping it.

* Don't bog down your SO with day-to-day issues. So the toilet stopped up, or your car broke down and you're not sure how you're going to get it fixed and get to work this week, or you're sick of having to mow the lawn every damn week...don't make them feel guilty for being out there. My husband was out there to enjoy the trail and not have to deal with the everyday problems. He worked hard to be able to do that. I didn't want to make him feel like his ""being on vacation"" was a hardship on me. There will be times where they feel bad for being out there and leaving you to deal with the stupid crap. Don't make them feel bad, support them - it sounds like you're doing a great job of this already. Have someone else you can talk to about the annoying things, don't turn precious phone calls with your SO into complaining about the ants in the kitchen.

* Here's something I wish I had started doing sooner in my husband's hike...I took my favorite action figure (Thor!) and made a mini-comic of the adventures we were having while my husband was away. I put on my own superhero costume and took selfies and made up weird stories with Thor helping around the house or getting into trouble in the washing machine...dumb stuff like that. He looked forward to those in his mail drops and he still has them all. If it's in your personality, maybe you can have an adventure with a pet or some item in your house that would give them something to look forward to and make them laugh.

I ended up having a lot of fun as trail boss. Let me know if you have any other questions.",1548979599

People playing on stronger PCs can uncap their framerate to better use their GPUs, so frames in the hundreds is normal (i get about 150 uncapped)

Oh, how very democratic

&gt;Why? I think applying more weights to those that run faster in a race would make those already ahead not ever be caught by those behind. At least it would make it harder. So without everyone starting at the same level, the same point, or as you say a reset button, progressive taxes only limits wealth mobility. Income is to Wealth as speed is to position.

Life isn't a race. You really gotta work on this metaphor. WTF do you think would happen if you just set everyone's tax to 20% right now? Income inequality is so absurd the ultra-rich will just continue to hoard wealth and perform as capitalist overlords over everyone else, making all decisions that have real effects on everyone else's lives.

Yes.

Your memes trigger your mom, not me. We both know it's idiotic.

Employees under capitalism are treated only as an expense. Employees should have majority ownership of the companies they work for, giving them majority voting power over the major decisions of the company as the board of directors does in a corporation. This model is more equitable and fair and creates a stable company that is focused on the long term instead of short term monetary profits which only benefits those who can juice more profits out of every corner they can, including you and I.

WW2. The continent was split between the countries under the control of the US and the USSR, with the USSR being an enemy. Was WW2 not a victory? For non-american examples, basically every war in Europe for most of history. You go to war, you win, you get what you want, and most of the time, the other country is still in control of most if not all of their territory, and they still don't like you.

My definition of victory only seems different because you're definition is wrong. In WW2 our goal was to stop germany and japan, we did it, so we won. In korea our goal was to keep the south free of communism, we did it, so we won. We went into vietnam with the goal of stopping communism, and while we did lose at the time, nowadays they have a 95% positive view of capitalism. We went into the middle east with the goal of endless war, and we've done it! That's a victory. You may not like the outcome or purpose, but it's still a victory.

&gt;please do so voluntarily. I don't need to pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the above, you haven't had sex for 12 years.

&amp;#x200B;

So you probably have some anxiety related disorder / other hang-ups about sex - or you are waiting for your princess charming or something like that?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean you like sex, you can have sex, but you don't have it. Doesn't add up.",1548979600

You might think, Hey look! A place where women aren't all sucking tranny peen! Weird! But then you find out that they are scared of tranny peen, and believe that in a couple years, women who don't assimilate and get a peen themselves will be locked up in suspended cages, let down from their gibbets only to be repeatedly viciously raped and denied STEM jobs.

That place is like /r/drama if everyone here felt scared for their lives, and could only find possibly recourse in demanding mayocide and bussy. Swap our memes for 'white-female ethnosexstate now' and 'kill all men before they kill all women' and you have a pretty fair idea of their topics.

And that's where it gets interesting: they're unironically probussycide, unironically antifemayocide. Truly, /r/drama has its antithesis.

And believe me: it is dangerous.

You might be arguing over topic A and end up wrong, and then in a discussion of unrelated topic B, people will point out how you were wrong about topic A and therefore must be wrong about topic B.

That is so true.  People talk about ""an apology not costing you anything,"" but it actually can cost you chunks being torn out of your reputation a piece at a time, if you're not careful.  I do tend to over-apologize in many facets of my life, but I've tried to curtail it, because I know I risk people invalidating me or thinking less of me if I'm constantly accepting fault/blame that I don't deserve, or simply building a negative narrative about me.  Like, if someone tells me I was ""being illogical and dramatic"" and I offer uncritical apologies for it enough times when I didn't even agree with that framing, eventually they'll find it easy to write off any undesirable opinion of mine as ""illogical and dramatic.""

In the same way, it can feel noble to accept responsibility for a SNAFU rather than rightfully blame someone else (aka ""throw them under the bus""), but too many instances of that, and you'll be the one who's known as the fuckup.",1548979605

I get that you feel sensitive about your lip, I don't know if it's a scar or you were born with it, but either way, you're Spiderman and you got it defending the fuck out of New York. I don't care what anybody says.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: because other people are sharing their lip scar stories, I have one too.  When I was nine I was pissed off at having to push my little sister on a swing  (""You're six years old, you should be able to do it yourself!"") and pushed *really hard* to 'teach her a lesson'. Instant karma when it hit me in the face and I needed three stitches in my bottom lip. 

I was really sensitive about it in my teens, but you know, the doctor did a great job of fixing it. I don't even think about it now, it's just my face.

I think they would hide Jamshid being a Nahid to protect him from the ifrits, since they were killing all of them. 

Didn‚Äôt the book mention something about it being taboo for Nahids to be in romantic relationships? Something about It compromising the Nahids purity or something. That might be enough motive to hide it from Ghassan. I imagine having a baby out of wedlock with a daeva (Kevah) might not go over too hot. ",1548979607

"Sino","t5_38jyn","Why China Is the Brave New World of Editing Human #DNA

The headline-making births last November of the world‚Äôs first gene-edited babies (twin girls) was unsurprising in one way: The scientist involved was from China. As part of its effort to dominate scientific spheres including biotechnology, China has taken the lead in testing uses of Crispr, a tool newly available to researchers enabling them to alter DNA codes simply and inexpensively. Chinese scientists were the first to test Crispr in monkey embryos, in non-viable human embryos, in adult humans, and now in creating designer babies. Now China is confronting accusations that its regulatory system is overlooking the ethical considerations and medical risks.
1 Did China approve genetic altering of the babies?

The scientist who altered the genes of the twin girls as embryos, He Jiankui, says he had approval from the medical ethics committee at Harmonicare Women and Children‚Äôs Hospital in Shenzhen. An investigation by the Chinese government found that He deliberately evaded government regulations and forged ethical review documents, the Xinhua government news agency reported on Jan. 21. The result of that investigation prompted He‚Äôs employer, Southern University of Science and Technology, to fire him.


2 What explains the uproar over this case?

Altering the genes of an embryo changes DNA in every cell, including the eggs or sperm, of the resulting person, alterations that will be passed on to progeny. The technique works by making cuts in DNA, some of which may be unintended and bring unknown effects. Normally, participants in clinical research must give their informed consent, something embryos obviously cannot do. The scientist, He, says his goal was to produce babies immune to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, by altering a gene in the embryos that makes a protein called the CCR5 receptor, which HIV uses to enter cells. To some researchers, that‚Äôs insufficient grounds to justify such high risks, since HIV infection is relatively uncommon in China, there are other ways to prevent it and it‚Äôs treatable. Even if the gene-editing worked, the twins won‚Äôt be invulnerable to HIV, which can also invade cells via a receptor called CXCR4. What‚Äôs more, studies suggest that CCR5 deficiencies increase vulnerability to West Nile virus and influenza.
3 What rules does China have in place?

Under guidelines issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission in 2003, gene editing of embryos isn‚Äôt banned, but the use of genetically modified eggs, sperm or embryos for reproduction is prohibited. These guidelines are not laws, and they are enforced through the commission‚Äôs ability to withdraw the licenses of fertility clinics.
4 What are the rules elsewhere?

Twenty-nine of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe human-rights organization, including France, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain, have ratified the 1997 Oveido Convention, which prohibits genetic modification of reproductive ""germline"" cells. The U.S. Congress has banned the Food and Drug Administration from considering germline-editing trials. A 2002 Australian law calls for imprisonment for 15 years for anyone who purposely makes heritable alterations in a human cell. Reports by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in 2017 and the U.K.‚Äôs Nuffield Council on Bioethics in 2018 concluded that human trials of editing germline cells should be used only to fill unmet medical needs and benefit those whose genes are altered.
5 What explains China‚Äôs approach?

China wants to be a leader in the defining technologies of the 21st century and has poured billions into funding research. As a participant chosen for its prestigious Thousand Talents scheme -- a plan to lure back talented Chinese from overseas -- He would have received at least a starting bonus of about $143,000 for his research, with the possibility of additional research grants of roughly $700,000. He also founded a startup called Direct Genomics that makes DNA-sequencing equipment, which also received government funding, according to its website. According to the database clinicaltrials.gov, China has 12 human trials involving the Crispr method. One of these is active, with eight in the recruiting stage. In the U.S., there are eight Crispr-related trials, six of which are recruiting and none of which are active.
6 How is China responding?

The country‚Äôs biotech companies and universities have worked hard to counter suspicions that their endeavors are rife with fraud and minimally supervised experimentation. The Genetics Society of China, the Chinese Society for Cell Biology and other groups were quick to condemn He‚Äôs gene-editing work, calling it a serious ethical violation. A Chinese branch of the World Health Organization pulled an application to register the gene-editing project in a clinical database.

We have known for hundreds and hundreds of years that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and just like other greenhouse gasses it prevents the suns heat from escaping. We only have to look to Venus to see what happens when too much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere.

"espresso","t5_2rqoi","The particulars:
Roast date: early Jan

Breville SGP settings:
Size 15
2 shots
17 seconds

Granting: uneven tamp because I used a 54 mm tamper on the 58 mm portafilter. 

18 g in, 36 out. Pulled for 32 seconds (from button press to button press; not sure what the actual pull time is supposed to.be measured as)

Tastes much better than my Mr Coffee Cafe Barista - that wasn't even an espresso. This is an actual espresso. It tastes above Starbucks and bad coffee shops, but it's not near my favorite coffee shops yet, and that's okay. 

When I checked the puck afterwards, I could see the indentations of the shower head. So I know I have to either fill less or tamp more. Will try grinding for 16 seconds/17 g and get a right sized tamper. 

What do you think of the speed of the pull? I got the 1:2, but it also seemed to flow too freely, but it was also a long pull? Not sure how to square that circle. Advice appreciated on what to adjust to dial in my next shot.",1548979611

Often, it feels like our brain uses short cuts. We love our family because it is evolutionarily useful to do so; but when we feel that love, we don't always feel the reasoning; I know I don't. I adore boyfriend in a way that feels pure and irrational, even though I am (vaguely) aware of the reasons I feel that love. There is a layer of subconscious abstraction.

I'm confused by your thought here;

&gt;We're not tricked into emotion, we feel it. Our thoughts and feelings exist in the same place, emotions aren't overlaid over rationality.

This seems at odds with irrational things like fear of clowns and such. I get irrationally upset when I hear people yelling; I'm aware that I have a context with being yelled at a lot that makes yelling an especially sore topic for me, but that knowledge isn't required to feel the jolt of anxiety even raised voices on the street can bring. My brain has associated yelling directly with the negative response, no conscious thought required.

I think this is the subconscious layer that doesn't exist in lizardfolk. Lizardfolk might still have fears from negative experiences, but they don't need a direct or subconscious alarm. It is all there, in their minds; I remember my experience with this! It is damaging! I should away!

Their love isn't felt in a warm or sappy way, it's just the direct and conscious appraisal of signifiers of fertility and the advantages that an individual can bring to your life.

We had a lizardfolk palidan who wasn't emotionally invested in justice, but had very strong feelings on how the world should be ordered. It was a purely philosophical position.

I just reread the piece in Volo's guide, and I also don't understand where this

&gt;they're described as feeling and responding to, but completely uninfluenced by their emotions

comes from. It seems clear to me that they DON'T experience emotions in those ways. They are never angry, the way that others are, but they can appear aggressive to enemies or prey. That seems pretty clear-cut to me.

"PUBATTLEGROUNDS","t5_3fmbm","The real thing that inland circles does is pace the game out better. I for one got SUPER tired of seeing 75% of the lobby die by the end of the first closure, because far-off circles tend to herd everyone together and force a lot of early game fights. This, in turn, led to the most boring and stale mid-game meta that PUBG has ever seen. Sanhok being released with its more frequent but slower circles felt like a breath of fresh air to a lot of players because you could drop anywhere and be confident that you'd make it to the circle while still taking fights throughout. You actually got to *play* the whole time; Erangel's pacing was fucked by comparison before they changed the circle generation algorithm.

The new circle placement certainly benefits players who plan their movements poorly, but I still argue that any benefit to shit players is outweighed by the larger benefit to smart players who want to take fights as they move in. I'm rarely faced with a ""fight or run tot he circle"" decision anymore, and that feels way better than always being afraid of having to balance combat with travelling several km. It just feels like the action is spread throughout the whole game moreso than the initial scramble followed by 15 minutes of loot simulator, and then a really cool circle on a beach or some shit.",1548979612

But...   
  
  
As much as we have a culture addicted to outrage, this time (I'll admit a bias) I think people have a point.   
Best example is my own, after the patch last week I've been seeing 9+ CTD's an hour, I'd call that an issue worth getting frustrated and outraged over, the majority of the games content I've not been able to interact with, because I've not been able to finish any quest that lasts more than 10'ish minutes.  
  
  
I also think there is justification regarding the ""balance"" anger, what was done to ""fix"" the TSE issue was short sighted and has created far more problems than it solved. Maybe that sounds arrogant, but I've summarized some of the points others made that would have been considerably better in another post on this thread.  
  
  
As to it being a crisis.. Allot of that really depends on numbers Bethesda isn't going to show us. Some of the data people have lined indicates a massive drop in players since launch, and based on the general feedback the last few weeks I'd have to believe they've had another major group of players leave the ""world"".

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","The first thought that comes to me is that I actually think 35 is a good ""last age"" to have kids, both for men and for women. The reason of that is because by the time your kid is in the early 20's, you'd all be already close to your 60's, and I think that's too much. I remember I had a school classmate that was born when his father was at the age of 52. By the time my classmate was 18, his father was already an old man that couldn't really do anything. That's pretty bad.

My point is, do think about this. I don't plan on ever having kids, but if I did, I wouldn't want them to have an old image of a parent while they're still young. My parents had me at the ~35 age mark, and I'm currently on my mid 20's. Unfortunately, none of them works out or do any kind of exercise, so they're just slowly becoming old vulnerable people. Sometimes I wished my parents were younger. That's just my opinion.",1548979615
"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","My pleasure:) I agree and I think that if we (the readers) stop complaining for a second about the things that we feel the D's didn't deliver on, and actually give them some credit for knowing a bit about what they are doing, then there's way more to be gained from the dialog and the images than what can gleaned from a cursory look.

One of my favorite scenes from the show is the scene with Brienne and Jaime in the tent outside of Riverrun. Brienne the oh so blue in that very very red tent. And Jaime's off-hand remark, *""it's a conundrum.""*

I don't see anyway that that isn't intentional when you consider how GRRM uses gems in the books. Rubies are red and sapphires are blue, and they are often considered to be different, but they are actually very much the same as they are both *corundums.*

My mayhaps a bit far/further fetched idea about Gilly's remark (I have been shamed a few times for saying this:)) is that it is a reference to Jon's Valyrian descent. 

If you try googling images of Jon Snow's blood, after the stab stab, and instead of looking at the black out-line of his blood, look in the middle. Then there is this white reverse s-shape which, to me at least, looks like a seahorse... but people tend to go all Westworld on me when I say this, so could be there's nothing there. No one sees the seahorse:)

Additional tinfoil: The japanese word for seahorse supposedly means *""dragon's bastard child.""*    ",1548979615

"Jazz","t5_2qmm6","&gt; dae everything is subjective and artistic merit can't be quantified by any metrics?

Did I ever claim this, or would you rather debate that strawman?  

&gt; Of course it's my interpretation. Just like it would be my interpretation that if someone were to paint their own stars onto The Starry Night, it would detract from the beauty that was already there, and it would be arrogant of that person to assume that their artistic ""contribution"" comes anywhere close to the creativity and genius of Van Gogh.  

Except you're acting like someone is literally painting over the original starry night (like, that woman who decided to 'fix' the jesus painting a few years back). This isn't that case. The original ""It's a wonderful world"" will always be, by far, the most popular and authoritative version while KG's boring-ass version is already fading into obscurity. It strikes me as more lame than arrogant.  

&gt; Sampling is creatively turning a part of a song into something else. This lacks any semblance of creativity  

It doesn't, though. It has *some* semblance of creativity. Just very little of it.  

&gt; and is clearly just a way for KG to try to profit off of black american art.  

oh gimme a fuckin' break. This song is written by two white guys. And it's a chart-topping pop song that happens to be sung by a Jazz icon. You'd think we were talking about Coltrane's Alabama from your comment here.",1548979616

Ah √® il sito di Bassi. Tecnicamente niente da dire, ma come persona non mi √® mai piaciuta. Era il classico che in mailing list cercava di rispondere in maniera sgarbata o di fare lo spiritoso imitando Linus Torvalds, ma senza averne l'intelligenza e il senso dell'umorismo. Mi ricorda un po' quei giocatori di tennis italiani che spaccano le racchette per imitare John McEnroe, per√≤ poi escono al primo turno dopo aver insultato arbitro, raccattapalle e spettatori.

Ok ho fatto il mio rant misto a rosicata. Grande Bassi per il codice che hai scritto te ne sar√≤ sempre grato, per√≤ quando parli di altre cose ti metterei le mani in faccia. Domani mi leggo la storia di Gnome e ascolter√≤ i podcast. Grazie per il link, sono un utilizzatore di lungo corso e un tempo avevo anche studiato le GTK+. Ti voglio bene.

Browsing Iron Heart - which is already up there when it comes to pricing - I'm conditioned far enough to think the jeans are an acceptable price, but to pay as much or *more* for a shirt snaps me straight back to how everybody else feels about cheap jeans. I've never paid more than about ¬£40 for a shirt and I've got several dating back to the 90s still in wearable condition (if a slightly tighter fit now). ¬£300 for a shirt blows my mind even though I can make all the same arguments about materials, construction, fit, weight etc. in support of jeans.

No judgement, and those shirts look great, but money is a thing. I just hope everybody owns a house already, because my mortgage is long done and I still can't justify buying one, never mind a wardrobe of them. I kinda fear for just how normalised it has become to spend a grand on an outfit consisting of sneakers, jeans and a shirt, while so many young people think they can never afford a home or to have a family.

""I arst you civil enough, didn't I?"" said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. ""You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer?""

""And what in hell's name is a pint?"" said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.

""'Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon. 'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.""

""Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half litres - that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front of you.""

""I likes a pint,"" persisted the old man. ""You could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.""

""When you were a young man we were all living in the tree-tops,"" said the barman, with a glance at the other customers.

There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbed face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him gently by the arm.

""May I offer you a drink?"" he said.

""You're a gent,"" said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. ""Pint!"" he added aggressively to the barman. ""Pint of wallop.'""

Then you get 2 SQ from weekly Master Missions (like daily quests, but for the week), and another 3 from login rewards each week IIRC.

Basically not a whole lot, especially given the super shitty rates.

The main mitigating factor is that virtually every unit is viable. Even friend point units can be top tier like Hans or Leonidas. There are also items you periodically get that do things like break the unit level cap or forcibly increase the unit's stats past their limit. Like say, a 3*  will never have _quite_ as many stats as a 5* but you can get pretty close.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","&gt; I don't need a deep personal understanding of chicken farming to adequately criticize it.

You should at least be on nodding terms with chicken farming practices and chicken behaviour though if you want your criticism to be at all credible, and it really seems like you are not by any stretch of the imagination. If I had to guess I would say it is likely you have never kept chickens or worked with chickens in any capacity. Since you have not even offered any common knowledge or anecdotal evidence to support the claims you make it seems very likely that these are regurgitated talking points, or simply conjecture.

&gt; Asserting that animals who do not communicate to you that they are suffering are not suffering is extremely dubious.

With knowledge of how chickens behave when they are happy and how they behave when they are stressed I think it is reasonable to make deductions about their state of mind, especially when those behaviours are so easily identifiable and so disparate in their manifestations. Chickens are not complicated animals, they have very clearly defined behaviours that reflect their moods, as anyone who has any experience with chickens will be able to tell you. They are overtly communicative and demonstrative animals.

You are clutching at straws at this point. Your human/chicken analogy has failed. Chicken breeding is not rape, it is regular chicken-on-chicken mating. Removing an egg from a nest box is neither distressing for a chicken not in brood nor is it meaningfully comparable to theft of a child. There are plenty of cases to be made for the immorality of industrial chicken farming but the cases you are making here are weak and tenuous at best.

Take for instance my example above regarding the ""National Guard"". Now that is a direct translation, precisely what he said. But if you are an American, or just read a lot of American news, you would assume that they are establishing an official militia in each province. In actuality it is merely a paramilitary organization dedicated to fighting combatants within the country. More akin to GIGN or DSU than the American version.

As far as context I missed, well there is a whole lot. Just a small example is that Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term in office, because of Porfirio D√≠az who gained the presidency and then fixed elections to stay in power for over thirty years. He was the establishment that the Mexican Revolution sought to overthrow.

Another small example is that AMLO established his political party, MORENA, in 2012. This party now controls the executive and legislative branches fully, giving AMLO the ability to push policies relatively quickly. 

There are so many tiny contextual things I haven't mentioned, and I honestly probably don't even realize it with half of them. If you have any specific questions, I might be able to field those a little easier.",1548979623

"IDontWorkHereLady","t5_341k1","What is cool about it for me, is that my dad was the cool dad when I was growing up, and always had great audio equipment and a lot of great music too.

My dad was in radio locally in the 60s to early 70s, in the 'heyday' of AM radio. So, a lot of top 40 and popular music. But after he left the radio station, he worked for a recording studio and ended up being involved in several gold and platinum albums, and enjoyed the harder rock that he recorded over the 'classic' rock he played in the radio.

In a sense, my dad was a metal head before being a metal head was a thing.

I played some Primus for my dad once, and he actually liked it. Mostly because they were real musicians  real instruments, rather than so much electronic music of the 80s and the contrived, sampled and produced music from later. He actually recognized their song ""On The Coattails of a Dead Man"" as being about Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.

So, he was the cool dad as u was growing up, and then I get to be the cool dad for my son. Sort of passing of the torch, in a sense. ",1548979627

For all the idiots who DON'T (or *didn't*) believe this is possible.

Because, when it comes to this ""domestic violence against women"" bullshit, **the cops AND courts do not ""verify"" *ANYTHING* the woman says...** they won't necessarily even bother to *check* whether she has ANY documentation (driver license or other\*) that validates her claim to being a ""resident"" of a particular home.  The courts simply act on it -- they issue ""orders"" and the police follow them.

-
THIS is why it **isn't** merely a matter of NOT ""marrying"" them, or NOT ""cohabiting""... if some ""crazed-psycho-bitch"" wants to ""get you"" (for revenge, or any reason or indeed NO 'rational' reason whatsoever) then all she has to do is find out your address, and LIE to the police.

-
And as far as ""access"" to your house... well once you've been taken into custody (locked up for the night, possibly longer), your home is then EMPTY.  She doesn't even *need* a key, as most homes are relatively trivial to break into... and once inside she can gain control of any/all of your shit, do whatever the fuck she wants to with it (steal it &amp; sell it, destroy it or just fuck it up; even move some of HER shit in to back up her claim that she has a RIGHT to live there {and thus keep you away even longer, get your arse locked up yet again if you try to re-enter YOUR home}... oh, and good luck trying to get any ""justice"" around that; you'll be lucky if you can even fight off the false accusation and keep your arse free).

-
**WILL any of that happen to you?** *Probably* not... **But it COULD...**
- 
It's really just a matter of chance; hookup with the ""wrong"" woman (some crazed one, and remember these days there's a shitload of them on various ""psych"" meds -- maybe the med helps her NOT be a crazed-psycho-bitch... or than again maybe it MAKES her even crazier {either way she can &amp; will use it as an ""excuse""}).

-
You can't guarantee that this won't happen to you... but you CAN dramatically reduce the probability of it happening... **by being an *actual* MGTOW** (and not just *pretending* to be one on the internets, while still being a pussy-chasing blue-pilled idiot in real life).

---
\* EDIT: And keep in mind it's actually also *trivial* for her to change her driver's license to your address -- most governments now allow that to be done via an *online* form, she fills it in, pays a trivial fee -- heck in some jurisdictions she can even stop by the DMV to get a physical ""new/replacement license"" (or alternately SENT to her in the mail... even an alternate address of her choice, under the rationale that she ""hasn't YET moved"" -- she simply needs to do it a week or so in advance, and BAM as far as the courts will be concerned, she now ""officially"" lives at your house, even if she's never set foot on the property).",1548979628

"dragonballfighterz","t5_3ltwg","When it comes to defense you kinda just have to learn it by trial and error. If you see the opponent‚Äôs feet leave the ground it‚Äôs probably and overhead. Anything else you probably should be crouch blocking. 

If you‚Äôre just starting off I would probably spend some time in Story mode to see what the game can teach you and then start labbing out characters and teams that you like in practice mode. Later on if you‚Äôre having trouble blocking a particular blockstring you can set the dummy in training mode to preform the blockstring so you can practice that way.

On a side note, since you‚Äôre starting out now it‚Äôs both a good and a bad time. The reason for this is the recent patch which has changed a ton, so much so that the current meta is kind of up in the air right now and everyone is kinda trying to relearn the game. Offensive strategies that worked before aren‚Äôt as effective with this patch. it‚Äôs better to start now and learn rather than learn and re-adapt.
